TI Effect of environment on the interferometry of clocks
SO QUANTUM
AB Quantum interference of "clocks", namely of particles with time-evolving internal degrees of freedom (DOF), is a promising avenue to test genuine general relativistic effects in quantum systems. The clock acquires which path information while experiencing different proper times on traversing the arms of the interferometer, leading to a drop in its path visibility. We consider scenarios where the clock is subject to environmental noise as it transits through the interferometer. In particular, we develop a generalized formulation of interferometric visibility affected by noise on the clock. We find that, for small noise and small proper time difference between the arms, the noise further reduces the visibility, while in more general situations it can either increase or reduce the visibility. As an example, we investigate the effect of a thermal environment constituted by a single field mode and show that the visibility drops further as the temperature is increased. Additionally, by considering noise models based on standard quantum channels, we show that interferometric visibility can increase or decrease depending on the type of noise and also the time scale and transition probabilities. The quantification of the effect of noise on the visibility - particularly in the case of a thermal environment paves the way for a better estimate on the expected outcome in an actual experiment.

TI Interpolating Between Rényi Entanglement Entropies for Arbitrary
   Bipartitions via Operator Geometric Means
SO ANNALES HENRI POINCARE
AB The asymptotic restriction problem for tensors can be reduced to finding all parameters that are normalized, monotone under restrictions, additive under direct sums and multiplicative under tensor products, the simplest of which are the flattening ranks. Over the complex numbers, a refinement of this problem, originating in the theory of quantum entanglement, is to find the optimal rate of entanglement transformations as a function of the error exponent. This trade-off can also be characterized in terms of the set of normalized, additive, multiplicative functionals that are monotone in a suitable sense, which includes the restriction-monotones as well. For example, the flattening ranks generalize to the (exponentiated) R & eacute;nyi entanglement entropies of order alpha is an element of[0,1]\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$\alpha \in [0,1]$$\end{document}. More complicated parameters of this type are known, which interpolate between the flattening ranks or R & eacute;nyi entropies for special bipartitions, with one of the parts being a single tensor factor. We introduce a new construction of subadditive and submultiplicative monotones in terms of a regularized R & eacute;nyi divergence between many copies of the pure state represented by the tensor and a suitable sequence of positive operators. We give explicit families of operators that correspond to the flattening-based functionals, and show that they can be combined in a nontrivial way using weighted operator geometric means. This leads to a new characterization of the previously known additive and multiplicative monotones, and gives new submultiplicative and subadditive monotones that interpolate between the R & eacute;nyi entropies for all bipartitions. We show that for each such monotone there exist pointwise smaller multiplicative and additive ones as well. In addition, we find lower bounds on the new functionals that are superadditive and supermultiplicative.

TI Mixing Time of Open Quantum Systems via Hypocoercivity
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Understanding the mixing of open quantum systems is a fundamental problem in physics and quantum information science. Existing approaches for estimating the mixing time often rely on the spectral gap estimation of the Lindbladian generator, which can be challenging to obtain in practice. We propose a novel theoretical framework to estimate the mixing time of open quantum systems that treats the Hamiltonian and dissipative part separately, thus circumventing the need for a priori estimation of the spectral gap of the full Lindbladian generator. This framework yields mixing time estimates for a class of quantum systems that are otherwise hard to analyze, even though it does not apply to arbitrary Lindbladians. The technique is based on the construction of an energy functional inspired by the hypocoercivity of (classical) kinetic theory.

TI Classification of Z=2Z-quadratic unitary fusion categories
SO QUANTUM TOPOLOGY
AB A unitary fusion category is called Z/2Z-quadratic if it has a Z/2Z group of invertible objects and one other orbit of simple objects under the action of this group. We give a complete classification of Z/2Z-quadratic unitary fusion categories. The main tools for this classification are skein theory, a generalisation of Ostrik's results on formal codegrees to analyse the induction of the group elements to the centre, and a computation similar to Larson's rank-finiteness bound for Z/3Z-near group pseudounitary fusion categories. This last computation is contained in an appendix coauthored with attendees from the 2014 AMS MRC on Mathematics of Quantum Phases of Matter and Quantum Information.

TI Construction of Optimal Orthogonal Partition
SO STAT
AB Orthogonal partitions play a crucial role in orthogonal array theory, design of experiments and quantum information theory. The optimisation of orthogonal partitions can improve the saturation percentages of orthogonal arrays (OAs) obtained by the orthogonal partition method. In particular, optimal orthogonal partitions of strength 1 are of great practical utility. However, there is still a scarcity of results about orthogonal partitions, especially optimal ones. In this paper, the definition of an optimal orthogonal partition is proposed, and we construct optimal orthogonal partitions of OAs by several construction methods, such as orthogonal partition method, difference scheme construction, generalised product construction and (u,u+v)$$ \left(u,u+v\right) $$ construction. As an application, we obtain various optimal orthogonal partitions and OAs with higher saturation percentages.

TI All-thermal reversal of heat currents using qutrits
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Few-level systems coupled to thermal baths provide useful models for quantum thermodynamics and to understand the role of heat currents in quantum information settings. Useful operations such as cooling or thermal masers have been proposed in autonomous three-level systems. In this work, we propose the coherent coupling of two qutrits as a simultaneous refrigerator and heat pump of two reservoirs forming a system. This occurs thanks to the coupling to two other reservoirs which are out of equilibrium but do not inject heat in the system. We explore the thermodynamic performance of such operation and discuss whether it can be distinguished from the action of a Maxwell demon via measurements of current fluctuations limited to the working substance.

TI CrSBr: An Air-Stable, Two-Dimensional Magnetic Semiconductor
SO NANO LETTERS
AB The discovery of magnetic order at the 2D limit has sparked new exploration of van der Waals magnets for potential use in spintronics, magnonics, and quantum information applications. However, many of these materials feature low magnetic ordering temperatures and poor air stability, limiting their fabrication into practical devices. In this Mini-Review, we present a promising material for fundamental studies and functional use: CrSBr, an air-stable, two-dimensional magnetic semiconductor. Our discussion highlights experimental research on bulk CrSBr, including quasi-1D semiconducting properties, A-type antiferromagnetic order (T-N = 132 K), and strong coupling between its electronic and magnetic properties. We then discuss the behavior of monolayer and few-layer flakes and present a perspective on promising avenues for further studies on CrSBr.

TI Characterizing the uncertainty relation via a class of measurements
SO PHYSICA SCRIPTA
AB The connection between uncertainty and entanglement is a prevalent topic in quantum information processing. Based on a broad class of informationally complete symmetric measurements, which can be viewed as a common generalization of symmetric, informationally complete positive operator-valued measures and mutually unbiased bases, a conical 2-design is calculated. This design plays a crucial role in quantum measurement theory. Subsequently, the relation between the uncertainty and the entanglement for a set of measurements is portrayed using conditional collision entropy. Furthermore, a tighter lower bound of the uncertainty relation is discussed according to the characterization of the entropic bound. Finally, the relation is applied to entanglement witnesses. It is demonstrated that the present results are unified and comprehensive.

TI Evaluation of Hamiltonians from Complex Symplectic Matrices
SO SYMMETRY-BASEL
AB Gaussian unitaries play a fundamental role in the field of continuous variables. In the general n mode, they may formulated by a second-order polynomial in the bosonic operators. Another important role related to Gaussian unitaries is played by the symplectic transformations in the phase space. The paper investigates the links between the two representations: the link from Hamiltonian to symplectic, governed by an exponential, and the link from symplectic to Hamiltonian, governed by a logarithm. Thus, an answer is given to the non-trivial question: which Hamiltonian produces a given symplectic representation? The complex instead of the traditional real symplectic representation is considered, with the advantage of getting compact and elegant relations. The application to the single, two, and three modes illustrates the theory.

TI Thermodynamic approach to quantum cooling limit of continuous Gaussian
   feedback
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Feedback cooling plays a critical role in stabilizing quantum systems and achieving low temperatures, where a key question is to determine the fundamental thermodynamic limits on cooling performance. We establish a fundamental bound on quantum feedback cooling in Gaussian systems, by deriving a generalized second law of thermodynamics involving the kinetic temperatures of the system and a measure of quantum information flow obtained by continuous measurement. In contrast to previously known bounds, the obtained bound can be saturated by experimentally feasible situations using the quantum Kalman filter with a large feedback gain, where the cooling efficiency approaches its maximum. Our theoretical result is numerically demonstrated using parameters from an experiment of levitated nanoparticles. Our theory provides a general framework for understanding the thermodynamic constraints on quantum feedback cooling.

TI Singularity transformation through single-pass phase modulation of light
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB The emergence of optical vortex phenomena has generated significant interest in optical technologies. By manipulating light parameters such as amplitude, phase, and polarization, new advances have been made in structured light techniques, which enable the creation of phase and polarization singularity. The present work demonstrates a novel and robust technique for converting phase singularity into polarization singularity through single-pass phase modulation of the input beam. The proposed approach simplifies the experimental setup and enables flexibility in the generation of different forms of polarization singularity, including topological conversion from C-point to V-point polarization singularity or otherwise. The method can be useful for diverse applications of singular beams, such as for classical and quantum information processing, and communications.

TI Projected Least-Squares Quantum Process Tomogra-phy
SO QUANTUM
AB We propose and investigate a new method of quantum process tomography (QPT) which we call projected least squares (PLS). In short, PLS consists of first computing the least-squares estimator of the Choi matrix of an unknown channel, and subsequently projecting it onto the convex set of Choi matrices. We consider four experimental setups including direct QPT with Pauli eigenvectors as input and Pauli measurements, and ancilla-assisted QPT with mutually unbiased bases (MUB) measurements. In each case, we provide a closed form solution for the least-squares estimator of the Choi matrix. We propose a novel, two-step method for projecting these estimators onto the set of matrices representing physical quantum channels, and a fast numerical implementation in the form of the hyperplane intersection projection algorithm. We provide rigorous, non-asymptotic concentration bounds, sampling complexities and confidence regions for the Frobenius and trace-norm error of the estimators. For the Frobenius error, the bounds are linear in the rank of the Choi matrix, and for low ranks, they improve the error rates of the least squares estimator by a factor d2, where d is the system dimension. We illustrate the method with numerical experiments involving channels on systems with up to 7 qubits, and find that PLS has highly competitive accuracy and computational tractability.

TI Transient subdiffusion via disordered quantum walks
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Transport phenomena play a crucial role in modern physics and applied sciences. Examples include the dissipation of energy across a large system, the distribution of quantum information in optical networks, and the timely modeling of spreading diseases. In this work we experimentally prove the feasibility of disordered quantum walks to realize a quantum simulator that is able to model general transient subdiffusive phenomena, exhibiting a sublinear spreading in space over time. Our experiment simulates such phenomena by means of a finely controlled insertion of various levels of disorder during the evolution of the walker, enabled by the unique flexibility of our setup. This allows us to explore the full range of subdiffusive behaviors, ranging from anomalous Anderson-like localization to normal diffusion for all experimentally accessible step numbers.

AB An equiangular tight frame (ETF) yields a type of optimal packing of lines in a Euclidean space. ETFs seem to be rare, and all known infinite families of them arise from some type of combinatorial design. In this paper, we introduce a new method for constructing ETFs. We begin by showing that it is sometimes possible to construct multiple ETFs for the same space that are "mutually unbiased" in a way that is analogous to the quantum-information-theoretic concept of mutually unbiased bases. We then show that taking certain tensor products of these mutually unbiased ETFs with other ETFs sometimes yields infinite families of new complex ETFs.

TI The Computational Advantage of MIP* Vanishes in the Presence of Noise
SO JOURNAL OF THE ACM
AB The class MIP & lowast; of quantum multiprover interactive proof systems with entanglement is much more powerful than its classical counterpart MIP [8, 31, 32]: while MIP = NEXP, the quantum class MIP & lowast; is equal to RE, a class including the halting problem. This is because the provers in MIP & lowast; can share unbounded quantum entanglement. However, recent works [53, 54] have shown that this advantage is significantly reduced if the provers' shared state contains noise. This article attempts to exactly characterize the effect of noise on the computational power of quantum multiprover interactive proof systems. We investigate the quantum two-prover one-round interactive system MIP & lowast; [poly, O(1)], where the verifier sends polynomially many bits to the provers and the provers send back constantly many bits. We show that noise completely destroys the computational advantage given by shared entanglement in this model. Specifically, we show that if the provers are allowed to share arbitrarily many EPR states, where each EPR state is affected by an arbitrarily small constant amount of noise, the resulting complexity class is equivalent to NEXP = MIP. This improves significantly on the previous best-known bound of NEEEXP (nondeterministic triply exponential time) [53]. We also show that this collapse in power is due to noise, rather than the O(1) answer size, by showing that allowing for noiseless EPR states gives the class the full power of RE = MIP & lowast; [poly, poly]. Along the way, we develop two technical tools of independent interest. First, we give a new, deterministic tester for the positivity of an exponentially large matrix, provided that it has a low-degree Fourier decomposition in terms of Pauli matrices. Secondly, we develop a new invariance principle for smooth matrix functions having bounded third-order Fr & eacute;chet derivatives or which are Lipschitz continuous.

TI Krylov complexity and gluon cascades in the high energy limit
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
AB We point out an interesting connection between the mathematical framework of the Krylov basis, which is used to quantify quantum complexity, and the entanglement entropy in high energy QCD. In particular, we observe that the cascade equation of the dipole model is equivalent to the SL ( 2, R ) Schr & ouml;dinger equation in the Krylov basis. Consequently, the Krylov complexity corresponds to the average distribution of partons and the Krylov entropy is the counterpart of the entanglement entropy computations of [D. E. Kharzeev and E. M. Levin, Phys. Rev. D 95, 114008 (2017).]. Our work not only brings new tools for exploring quantum information and complexity in QCD, but also gives hope for experimental tests of some of the recent, physical probes of quantum complexity.

TI Quantum speed limit for complex dynamics
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Quantum speed limit focuses on the minimum time scale for a fixed mission and hence is important in quantum information where fast dynamics is usually beneficial. Most existing tools for the depiction of quantum speed limit are the lower-bound-type tools, which are in fact difficult to reveal the true minimum time, especially for many-body systems or complex dynamics. Therefore, the evaluation of this true minimum time in these scenarios is still an unsolved problem. Hereby we provide the operational definition of quantum speed limit for a general target and propose a three-step (classification-regression-calibration) methodology based on machine learning to evaluate the true minimum time in complex dynamics. Moreover, the analytical expression of the true minimum time is also provided for the time-dependent Hamiltonians with time-independent eigenstates.

TI Enhancing spin-photon coupling with a micromagnet
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Hybrid quantum systems involving solid-state spins and superconducting microwave cavities play a crucial role in quantum science and technology, but improving the spin-photon coupling at the single quantum level remains challenging in such systems. Here, we propose a simple technique to strongly couple a single solid-state spin to the microwave photons in a superconducting coplanar waveguide cavity via a magnetic microsphere. We show that strong coupling at the single spin level can be realized by virtual magnonic excitations of a nearby micromagnet. The spin-photon coupling strength can be enhanced up to typically 4 orders of magnitude larger than that without the use of the micromagnet. This work can find applications in quantum information processing with strongly coupled solid-state spin-photonic systems.

TI Building and aligning a 10-plane light converter
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS-PHOTONICS
AB The ability to manipulate the spatial structure of light is fundamental for a range of applications, from classical communication to quantum information processing. Multi-plane light conversion (MPLC) addresses the limitations of single-plane modulation by enabling full control over multiple spatial modes of light through a series of phase masks separated by free-space propagation. In this tutorial, we present a step-by-step guide for building and aligning a 10-plane programmable light converter using a single spatial light modulator and standard optical components. Our method allows precise alignment, achieving single-pixel accuracy with a relatively simple setup. We hope that this guide will help other researchers to quickly adopt and adapt MPLC technology for their own experiments.

TI Mode-selective single-photon addition to a multimode quantum field
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB Spectro-temporal modes of light can be exploited for the generation of high-dimensional Gaussian quantum states. Such states are at the basis of continuous variable quantum information protocols where they have to support mode-selective non-Gaussian operations. We develop a general framework for single-photon addition on multimode states of light via parametric down conversion (PDC) processes. We identify the analytical conditions for single-mode and mode-selective photon addition. We show that spectral mode selectivity can be achieved in the type-II collinear down conversion, while single-mode condition are retrieved for noncollinear type-I and type-II processes. Numerical results are shown for photon addition in PDC process at near-infrared and telecommunications wavelengths.

TI Integrated Circular Polarization Detectors Based on Asymmetric Materials

SO SYMMETRY-BASEL
AB Circular polarization detection plays a significant role in various fields, such as optical communication, quantum information processing, biomedical detection, polarization imaging, and sensing. Traditionally, similar to linear polarization detection, circular polarization detection is realized by systems composed of discrete optical components, which tend to be bulky and complex. With the advancement of technology, there is a growing demand for efficient and compact integrated circular polarization detectors. In this review, we focus on two advanced research areas concerning integrated circular polarization detectors: those based on asymmetric materials or structures. We explore recent advances and future prospects and challenges for the development of integrated circular polarization detectors.

TI Generalization of group-theoretic coherent states for variational
   calculations
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB We introduce families of pure quantum states that are constructed on top of the well-known Gilmore-Perelomov group-theoretic coherent states. We do this by constructing unitaries as the exponential of operators quadratic in Cartan subalgebra elements and by applying these unitaries to regular group-theoretic coherent states. This enables us to generate entanglement not found in the coherent states themselves, while retaining many of their desirable properties. Most importantly, we explain how the expectation values of physical observables can be evaluated efficiently. Examples include generalized spin-coherent states and generalized Gaussian states, but our construction can be applied to any Lie group represented on the Hilbert space of a quantum system. We comment on their applicability as variational families in condensed matter physics and quantum information.

TI Boosting photon-number-resolved detection rates of transition-edge
   sensors by machine learning
SO OPTICA QUANTUM
AB Transition-edge sensors (TESs) are very effective photon-number-resolving (PNR) detectors that have enabled many photonic quantum technologies. However, their relatively slow thermal recovery time severely limits their operation rate in experimental scenarios compared with leading non-PNR detectors. In this work, we develop an algorithmic approach that enables TESs to detect and accurately classify photon pulses without waiting for a full recovery time between detection events. We propose two machine-learning-based signal processing methods: one supervised learning method and one unsupervised clustering method. By benchmarking against data obtained using coherent states and squeezed states, we show that the methods extend the TES operation rate to 800 kHz, achieving at least a four-fold improvement, whilst maintaining accurate photon-number assignment up to at least five photons. Our algorithms will find utility in applications where high rates of PNR detection are required and in technologies that demand fast active feed-forward of PNR detection outcomes.

Classical results on R & eacute;nyi and Kullback-Leibler divergences are applied to obtain new results and new proofs for some known results about Petz-R & eacute;nyi and Umegaki relative entropy. Most important among these, is a necessary and sufficient condition for the finiteness of the Petz-R & eacute;nyi alpha-relative entropy. All of the results presented here are valid in both finite and infinite dimensions. In particular, these results are valid for states in Fock spaces and thus are applicable to continuous variable quantum information theory.

TI A resource theory of quantum measurements

AB Resource theories are broad frameworks that capture how useful objects are in performing specific tasks. In this paper we devise a formal resource theory quantum measurements, focusing on the ability of a measurement to acquire information. The objects of the theory are equivalence classes of positive operator-valued measures, and the free transformations are changes to a measurement device that can only deteriorate its ability to report information about a physical system. We show that catalysis and purification, protocols that are possible in other resource theories, are impossible in our resource theory for quantum measurements. Standard measures of information gain are shown to be resource monotones, and the resource theory is applied to the task of quantum state discrimination.

AB Atomically precise nanoclusters play an important role in nanoscale catalysis, photonics, and quantum information science. Their nanochemical properties arise from their unique superatomic electronic structures. As the flagship of atomically precise nanochemistry, the Au-25(SR)(18) nanocluster exhibits tunable spectroscopic signatures that are sensitive to the oxidation state. This work aims to unravel the physical underpinnings of the spectral progression of Au-25(SR)(18) nanocluster using variational relativistic time-dependent density functional theory. The investigation will focus on the effects of superatomic spin-orbit coupling, its interplay with Jahn-Teller distortion, and their manifestations in the absorption spectra of Au-25(SR)(18) nanoclusters of different oxidation states.

TI Talbot self-imaging and two-photon interference in ring-core fibers
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Wave propagation on the surface of cylinders exhibits interferometric self-imaging, much like the Talbot effect in the near-field diffraction at periodic gratings. We report the experimental observation of the cylindrical Talbot carpet in weakly guiding ring-core fibers for classical light fields. We further show that the ring-core fiber acts as a higher-order optical beamsplitter for single photons, whose output can be controlled by the relative phase between the input light fields. By also demonstrating high-quality two-photon interference between indistinguishable photons sent into the ring-core fiber, our findings open the door to applications in optical telecommunications as a compact beam multiplexer as well as in quantum information processing tasks as a scalable realization of a linear optical network.

TI Towards On-Demand Heralded Single-Photon Sources via Photon Blockade
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB Spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) in a laser pumped optical nonlinear medium can produce heralded single photons with a high purity but a very low yield. Improving the yield by increasing the pump power in SPDC inevitably reduces the purity due to excitation of multiphoton events. We propose a scheme to overcome this purity-yield trade-off by suppressing multiphoton events in a cavity-enhanced SPDC via the photon-blockade effect. By introducing a strong photon-photon interaction into the intracavity medium and increasing the pump power, we can improve the available single-photon yield to larger than 90%, while keeping the purity high, towards on-demand generation of single photons through the SPDC process. Our quasi-on-demand SPDC sources may boost single-photon-based quantum-information technology.

   nor any dimensional restriction
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Characterization of quantum devices received from unknown providers is a significant primary task for any quantum information processing protocol. Self-testing protocols are designed for this purpose of certifying quantum components from the observed statistics under a set of minimal assumptions. Here we propose a self-testing protocol for certifying binary Pauli measurements employing the violation of a Leggett-Garg inequality. The scenario based on temporal correlations does not require entanglement, a costly and fragile resource. Moreover, unlike previously proposed self-testing protocols in the prepare and measure scenario, our approach requires neither dimensional restrictions, nor other stringent assumptions on the type of measurements. We further analyze the robustness of this hitherto unexplored domain of self-testing of measurements.

We proceed by first studying the relation between faster-than-light signaling and the causal factorization of the dynamics formultiple detector-field interactions. We show in what way spatially extended nonrelativistic detector models predict superluminal propagation of the field's initial conditions. We draw parallels between this characteristic of detector models, stemming from their nonrelativistic dynamics, and Sorkin's "impossible measurements on quantum fields" [R. D. Sorkin, in Directions in General Relativity: Proceedings of the 1993 International Symposium, Maryland (Cambridge University Press, 1993), Vol. 2, pp. 293-305.]. Based on these features, we discuss the validity of measurements in quantum field theory when performed with nonrelativistic particle detectors.

AB Quantum conference is a process of securely exchanging messages between three or more parties, using quantum resources. A Measurement Device Independent Quantum Dialogue (MDI-QD) protocol, which is secure against information leakage, has been proposed (Quantum Information Processing 16.12 (2017): 305) in 2017, is proven to be insecure against intercept-and-resend attack strategy. We first modify this protocol and generalize this MDI-QD to a three-party quantum conference and then to a multi-party quantum conference. We also propose a protocol for quantum multi-party XOR computation. None of these three protocols proposed here use entanglement as a resource and we prove the correctness and security of our proposed protocols.

TI Nonvolatile cryogenic phase-slip memory with single-shot readout
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB The demand for cryogenic memory components is driven by the need for ultrafast, low-power, and highly reliable computing systems. Phase-slip-based devices promise to fulfill all these requirements, with potential applications in both classical and quantum information processing. However, previous implementations have faced challenges due to inefficient writing and readout schemes. In this work, we address these limitations with a simple device design and measurement techniques inspired by circuit quantum electrodynamics. We present a memory element that stores information in the winding of a high-kinetic inductance superconducting loop, inductively coupled to a coplanar waveguide resonator. Using 2-mu s single-shot measurements, we bring the resonator to the steady state and achieve a readout fidelity of 99.698% with an active measurement time of just 25 ns.

TI Dual-frequency modulation in microwave-optical double resonance for
   manipulation of atomic populations
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB This study presents a dual-frequency modulation scheme in which both optical and microwave fields are simultaneously modulated in a microwave-optical double resonance system within a hot rubidium vapor cell. The combined modulation produces harmonic spectral features at the sum and difference of the individual modulation frequencies, indicating nonlinear coupling between the fields. Experimental results reveal that this approach enables modulation of atomic population dynamics and facilitates efficient population transfer between hyperfine levels. The observed frequency mixing highlights the system's sensitivity to dual modulation and suggests its potential for enhancing the spectral control of atomic transitions. These findings may support future developments in atomic clocks, high-precision magnetometers, and quantum information processing systems.

This is because, on the one hand, reconstructions can help us to better understand quantum mechanics, and, on the other hand, reconstructions are themselves in need of interpretation. My overall objective, thus, is to motivate the reconstruction program and to show why philosophers should care. My specific aims are threefold. (i) Clarify the relationship between reconstructing and interpreting quantum mechanics, (ii) show how the informational reconstruction of quantum theory puts pressure on standard realist interpretations, (iii) defend the quantum reconstruction program against possible objections.

TI Quantum detection of new physics in top-quark pair production at the LHC

TI Information scrambling dynamics in a fully controllable quantum
   simulator
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Quantum information scrambling has received tremendous attention owing to its key concept in the fields of quantum chaos and quantum gravity. Here, with exploiting a fully controllable superconducting quantum processor, we study the verified scrambling in a 1D spin chain by an analog superconducting quantum simulator with the signs and values of individual driving and coupling terms fully controllable. By engineering opposite Hamiltonians on two subsystems, we measure the temporal and spatial patterns of out-of-time ordered correlators (OTOC), with the Hamiltonian mismatch and the decoherence extracted quantitatively from the scrambling dynamics, providing a benchmarking tool for probing not only the spatial but the temporal patterns of scrambling dynamics in many-body systems. Our work demonstrates the superconducting system with strong controllability as a powerful quantum simulator.

TI Complexities of information sources
SO JOURNAL OF APPLIED STATISTICS
AB Calculating the entropy for complex systems is a significant problem in science and engineering problems. However, this calculation is usually computationally expensive when the entropy is computed directly. This paper introduces three classes of information sources that for all members of each class, the entropy value is the same. These classes are characterized according to special dynamics created by three kinds of self-mappings on omega, and A, where omega is a probability space and A is a finite set. An approximation of rank variables of the product of information sources is made, and it is proved that the topological entropy of the product of two information sources is equal to the summation of their topological entropies.

TI The complexity of the vertex-minor problem
SO INFORMATION PROCESSING LETTERS
AB A graph H is a vertex-minor of a graph G if it can be reached from G by the successive application of local complementations and vertex deletions. Vertex-minors have been the subject of intense study in graph theory over the last decades and have found applications in other fields such as quantum information theory. Therefore it is natural to consider the computational complexity of deciding whether a given graph G has a vertex-minor isomorphic to another graph H. Here we prove that this decision problem is NP-complete, even when restricting Hand G to be circle graphs, a class of graphs that has a natural relation to vertex-minors. (C) 2021 The Author(s).

TI Kinetic inductance and jitter dependence of intrinsic photon-number
   resolution in superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Photon-number resolution (PNR) is crucial in quantum information technology. Time-resolved measurements applied to superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors (SNSPDs) have recently demonstrated intrinsic PNR capabilities, complementing their superior efficiency, speed, and timing precision. Using waveguide-integrated SNSPDs, we investigate the impact of nanowire kinetic inductance and system jitter on intrinsic PNR, identifying the trade-off between intrinsic PNR and detector speed. Increasing the kinetic inductance from 165 nH to 872 nH enhances the PNR quality by 12%, 31%, and 23% for the first three photon numbers but reduces the maximum count rate from 165 Mcps to 19 Mcps.

TI Transmitting squeezed states in a cascaded cavity-magnonic system
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB The squeezed state has wide applications in quantum information and metrology. This work demonstrates the long-distance transmission of a squeezed state, where we utilize a cavity-magnonic system composed of a cascaded cavity and a yttrium iron garnet sphere. The squeezed source, originating from a flux-driven Josephson parametric amplifier, is mediated through six cavity modes and ultimately transmitted to magnon mode. With appropriate detuning matching, state transmission can be blocked at any mode, and the difference in squeezing phase between adjacent modes is pi. Squeezed magnons exhibit high robustness against environmental temperature and magnetic damping. Our work provides prior guidance for multi-mode transmission of quantum states in continuous variable systems.<br /> (c) 2025 Optica Publishing Group under the terms of the Optica Open Access Publishing Agreement

TI Magnon-Skyrmion Hybrid Quantum Systems: Tailoring Interactions via
   Magnons
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Coherent and dissipative interactions between different quantum systems are essential for the construction of hybrid quantum systems and the investigation of novel quantum phenomena. Here, we propose and analyze a magnon-skyrmion hybrid quantum system, consisting of a micromagnet and nearby magnetic skyrmions. We predict a strong-coupling mechanism between the magnonic mode of the micromagnet and the quantized helicity degree of freedom of the skyrmion. We show that with this hybrid setup it is possible to induce magnon-mediated nonreciprocal interactions and responses between distant skyrmion qubits or between skyrmion qubits and other quantum systems like superconducting qubits. This work provides a quantum platform for the investigation of diverse quantum effects and quantum information processing with magnetic microstructures.

TI Knots and entanglement
SO SCIPOST PHYSICS
AB We extend the entanglement bootstrap program to (3+1)-dimensions. We study knotted excitations of (3+1)-dimensional liquid topological orders and exotic fusion processes of loops. As in previous work in (2+1)-dimensions [1, 2], we define a variety of super -selection sectors and fusion spaces from two axioms on the ground state entanglement entropy. In particular, we identify fusion spaces associated with knots. We generalize the information convex set to a new class of regions called immersed regions, promoting various theorems to this new context. Examples from solvable models are provided; for instance, a concrete calculation of knot multiplicity shows that the knot complement of a trefoil knot can store quantum information. We define spiral maps that allow us to understand consistency relations for torus knots as well as spiral fusions of fluxes.

TI Quantum Nonreciprocal Interactions via Dissipative Gauge Symmetry
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB One-way nonreciprocal interactions between two quantum systems are typically described by a cas-caded quantum master equation, and rely on an effective breaking of time-reversal symmetry (TRS) as well as the balancing of coherent and dissipative interactions. Here, we present a new approach for obtain-ing nonreciprocal quantum interactions that is completely distinct from cascaded quantum systems, and that does not in general require broken TRS. Our method relies on a local gauge symmetry present in any Markovian Lindblad master equation. This new kind of quantum nonreciprocity has many implica-tions, including a new mechanism for performing dissipative steady-state unitary gate operations on a target quantum system. We also introduce a new, extremely general quantum-information-based metric for quantifying quantum nonreciprocity.

TI Quantum coherence of an orbital angular momentum multiplexed
   continuous-variable entangled state
SO OPTICS CONTINUUM
AB Orbital angular momentum (OAM) multiplexed entangled state is an important quantum resource for high dimensional quantum information processing. In this paper, we experimentally quantify quantum coherence of OAM multiplexed continuous-variable (CV) entangled state and characterize its evolution in a noisy environment. We show that the quantum coherence of the OAM multiplexed CV entangled state carrying topological charges l = 1 and l = 2 are the same as that of the Gaussian mode with l = 0 in a noisy channel. Furthermore, we show that the quantum coherence of OAM multiplexed entangled state is robust to noise, even though the sudden death of entanglement is observed. Our results provide reference for applying quantum coherence of OAM multiplexed CV entangled state in a noisy environment.

TI Optimizing the quality factor of InP nanobeam cavities using atomic
   layer deposition
SO APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS
AB Photonic crystal nanobeam cavities are valued for their small mode volume, CMOS compatibility, and high coupling efficiency-crucial features for various low-power photonic applications and quantum information processing. However, despite their potential, nanobeam cavities often suffer from low quality factors due to fabrication imperfections that create surface states and optical absorption. In this work, we demonstrate InP nanobeam cavities with up to 140% higher quality factors by applying a coating of Al2O3 via atomic layer deposition to terminate dangling bonds and reduce surface absorption. Additionally, changing the deposition thickness allows precise tuning of the cavity mode wavelength without compromising the quality factor. This Al2O3 atomic layer deposition approach holds great promise for optimizing nanobeam cavities that are well-suited for integration with a wide range of photonic applications.

TI Quantum Adaptive Agents with Efficient Long-Term Memories
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW X
AB Central to the success of adaptive systems is their ability to interpret signals from their environment and respond accordingly-they act as agents interacting with their surroundings. Such agents typically perform better when able to execute increasingly complex strategies. This comes with a cost: the more information the agent must recall from its past experiences, the more memory it will need. Here we investigate the power of agents capable of quantum information processing. We uncover the most general form a quantum agent need adopt to maximize memory compression advantages and provide a systematic means of encoding their memory states. We show these encodings can exhibit extremely favorable scaling advantages relative to memoryminimal classical agents, particularly when information must be retained about events increasingly far into the past.

TI Entanglement scaling and criticality of infinite-size quantum many-body
   systems in continuous space addressed by a tensor network approach
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB Simulating strongly correlated quantum systems in continuous space belongs to the most challenging and long-concerned issues in quantum physics. This work investigates the quantum entanglement and criticality of the ground-state wave functions of infinitely many coupled quantum oscillators (iCQOs). The essential task involves solving a set of partial differential equations (Schr & ouml;dinger equations in the canonical quantization picture) with infinitely many variables, which currently lacks valid methods. By extending the imaginary-time evolution algorithm with translationally invariant functional tensor network, we simulate the ground state of iCQOs with the presence of two- and three-body couplings. We determine the range of coupling strengths where there exists a real ground-state energy (dubbed as physical region). With two-body couplings, we reveal the logarithmic scaling law of entanglement entropy (EE) and the polynomial scaling law of correlation length against the virtual bond dimension chi at the dividing point of physical and nonphysical regions. These two scaling behaviors are signatures of criticality, according to the previous results in quantum lattice models, but were not reported in continuous-space quantum systems. The scaling coefficients result in a central charge c = 1, indicating the presence of free boson conformal field theory (CFT). We further show that the presence of three-body couplings, for which there are no analytical or numerical results, breaks down the CFT description at the dividing point. Our work uncovers the scaling behaviors of EE in the continuous-space quantum many-body systems. These results provide solid numerical evidence supporting the high efficiency of TN in representing the continuous-space quantum many-body wave functions in the thermodynamic limit, and meanwhile suggest an efficient approach to study the entanglement properties and criticality in continuous space.

TI Entanglement negativity and replica symmetry breaking in general
   holographic states
SO JOURNAL OF HIGH ENERGY PHYSICS
AB The entanglement negativity is an element of(A:B) is a useful measure of quantum entanglement in bipartite mixed states. In random tensor networks (RTNs), which are related to fixed-area states, it was found in [arXiv:2101.11029] that the dominant saddles computing the even R & eacute;nyi negativity is an element of((2k)) generically break the Z(2k) replica symmetry. This calls into question previous calculations of holographic negativity using 2D CFT techniques that assumed Z(2k) replica symmetry and proposed that the negativity was related to the entanglement wedge cross section. In this paper, we resolve this issue by showing that in general holographic states, the saddles computing is an element of((2k)) indeed break the Z(2k) replica symmetry. Our argument involves an identity relating is an element of((2k)) to the k-th R & eacute;nyi entropy on subregion AB & lowast; in the doubled state |rho AB > AA & lowast;BB & lowast;, from which we see that the Z(2k)replica symmetry is broken down to Z(k). For k<1, which includes the case of is an element of(A:B) at k=1/2, we use a modified cosmic brane proposal to derive a new holographic prescription for is an element of((2k)) and show that it is given by a new saddle with multiple cosmic branes anchored to subregions A and B in the original state. Using our prescription, we reproduce known results for the PSSY model and show that our saddle dominates over previously proposed CFT calculations near k=1. Moreover, we argue that the Z(2k) symmetric configurations previously proposed are not gravitational saddles, unlike our proposal. Finally, we contrast holographic calculations with those arising from RTNs with non-maximally entangled links, demonstrating that the qualitative form of backreaction in such RTNs is different from that in gravity.

TI Connection between Memory Performance and Optical Absorption in Quantum
   Reservoir Computing
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Quantum reservoir computing (QRC) offers a promising paradigm for harnessing quantum systems for machine learning tasks, especially in the era of noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices. While information-theoretical benchmarks like short-term memory capacity (STMC) are widely used to evaluate QRC performance, they fail to provide insights into the physical mechanisms underlying these quantum neural networks. We establish a quantitative connection between the optical absorption spectrum of a quantum reservoir and its memory performance, revealing that optimal STMC aligns directly with maximal absorption, providing a physical explanation for the previously reported "sweet-spot" behavior in QRC performance as a function of dissipation. This connection bridges quantum information theory with experimentally accessible physical properties, opening pathways for targeted engineering of quantum reservoir computers with optimized performance for specific tasks.

TI Genuine tripartite entanglement of W state subject to Hawking effect of
   a Schwarzschild black hole
SO EPL
AB We study the genuine tripartite entanglement (GTE), one-tangle and two-tangle of W state of fermionic fields in the background of a Schwarzschild black hole. We find that, with the increase of the Hawking temperature, the GTE of W state first decreases and then tends to zero, while the GTE of GHZ state first decreases and then freezes. We also find that the Hawking effect can completely destroy the two-tangle of W state, while one-tangle first decreases and then the freezing phenomenon appears with the growth of the Hawking temperature. These results are helpful to guide us to select appropriate quantum states and quantum resources to deal with relativistic quantum information tasks. Copyright (c) 2023 EPLA

TI Dark state atoms trapping in a magic-wavelength optical lattice near the
   nanofiber surface
SO CHINESE OPTICS LETTERS
AB We report the experimental realization of dark state atoms trapping in a nanofiber optical lattice. By applying the magicwavelength trapping potentials of cesium atoms, the AC Stark shifts are strongly suppressed. The dark magneto-optical trap efficiently transfers the cold atoms from bright (6S1/2, F = 4) into dark state (6S1/2, F = 3) for hyperfine energy levels of cesium atoms. The observed transfer efficiency is as high as 98% via saturation measurement. The trapping lifetime of dark state atoms trapped by a nanofiber optical lattice is also investigated, which is the key element for realizing optical storage. This work contributes to the manipulation of atomic electric dipole spin waves and quantum information storage for fiber networks.

TI Beyond the standard quantum limit for parametric amplification of
   broadband signals
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB The low-noise amplification of weak microwave signals is crucial for countless protocols in quantum information processing. Quantum mechanics sets an ultimate lower limit of half a photon to the added input noise for phase-preserving amplification of narrowband signals, also known as the standard quantum limit (SQL). This limit, which is equivalent to a maximum quantum efficiency of 0.5, can be overcome by employing nondegenerate parametric amplification of broadband signals. We show that, in principle, a maximum quantum efficiency of unity can be reached. Experimentally, we find a quantum efficiency of 0.69 +/- 0.02, well beyond the SQL, by employing a flux-driven Josephson parametric amplifier and broadband thermal signals. We expect that our results allow for fundamental improvements in the detection of ultraweak microwave signals.

TI Franck-Condon Tuning of Optical Cycling Centers by Organic
   Functionalization
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Laser induced electronic excitations that spontaneously emit photons and decay directly to the initial ground state ("optical cycling transitions") are used in quantum information and precision measurement for state initialization and readout. To extend this primarily atomic technique to large, organic compounds, we theoretically investigate optical cycling of alkaline earth phenoxides and their functionalized derivatives. We find that optical cycle leakage due to wave function mismatch is low in these species, and can be further suppressed by using chemical substitution to boost the electron-withdrawing strength of the aromatic molecular ligand through resonance and induction effects. This provides a straightforward way to use chemical functional groups to construct optical cycling moieties for laser cooling, state preparation, and quantum measurement.

TI Complete discrimination of pure quantum states
SO AIP ADVANCES
AB This paper presents a complete discrimination strategy of pure quantum states, by which the accessible information about the input pure states can be obtained completely. The complete discrimination is showed by taking the example of discriminating symmetric pure states. The measurement operators of complete discrimination can be represented by the multi-order correct operators, and the m-order relative average correct probability in the figure of merit is introduced. Since the rank of an inconclusive operator is one and an inconclusive operator provides the minimum relative average correct probability, no more information about the input state can be extracted. Our strategy involves two standard discrimination strategies, namely minimum-error discrimination and unambiguous discrimination, while overcoming their deficiencies. It is promising for complete discrimination and may find important applications in quantum information science.

TI Chiral Virasoro algebra from a single wavefunction
SO ANNALS OF PHYSICS
AB Chiral edges of 2+1D systems can have very robust emergent conformal symmetry. When the edge is purely chiral, the Hilbert space of low-energy edge excitations can form a representation of a single Virasoro algebra. We propose a method to systematically extract the generators of the Virasoro algebra from a single ground state wavefunction, using entanglement bootstrap and an input from the edge conformal field theory. We corroborate our construction by numerically verifying the commutation relations of the generators. We also study the unitary flows generated by these operators, whose properties (such as energy and state overlap) are shown numerically to agree with our analytical predictions.

TI Efficient construction of matrix-product representations of many-body
   Gaussian states
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We present a procedure to construct tensor-network representations of many-body Gaussian states efficiently and with a controllable error. These states include the ground and thermal states of bosonic and fermionic quadratic Hamiltonians, which are essential in the study of quantum many-body systems. The procedure improves computational time requirements for constructing many-body Gaussian states by up to five orders of magnitude in the low and up to two orders of magnitude in the intermediate temperature regime, thus allowing simulations beyond the range of what was hitherto feasible. Our procedure combines ideas from the theory of Gaussian quantum information with tensor-network-based numerical methods, thereby opening the possibility of exploiting the rich toolkit of Gaussian methods in tensor-network simulations.

TI Complete complementarity relations in curved spacetimes
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We extend complete complementarity relations to curved spacetimes by considering a succession of infinitesimal local Lorentz transformations, which implies that complementarity remains valid as the quanton travels through its world line and the complementarity aspects in different points of spacetime are connected. This result allows the study of these different complementary aspects of a quantum system as it travels through spacetime. In particular, we investigate the behavior of these different complementary properties of massive spin-1/2 particles in the Schwarzschild spacetime. For geodetic circular orbits, we find that the spin state of one particle oscillates between a separable and an entangled state. For nongeodetic circular orbits, we notice that the frequency of these oscillations gets bigger as the orbit nears the Schwarzschild radius r(s).

TI Information flow in non-unitary quantum cellular automata
SO SCIPOST PHYSICS
AB The information flow in a quantum system is a fundamental feature of its dynamics. An important class of dynamics are quantum cellular automata (QCA), systems with discrete updates invariant in time and space, for which an index theory has been proposed for the quantification of the net flow of quantum information across a boundary. While the index is rigid in the sense of begin invariant under finite-depth local circuits, it is not defined when the system is coupled to an environment, i.e. for non-unitary time evolution of open quantum systems. We propose a new measure of information flow for non-unitary QCA denoted the information current which is not rigid, but can be computed locally based on the matrix-product operator representation of the map.

TI Holographic entanglement negativity for a single subsystem in conformal

SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS A-MATHEMATICAL AND THEORETICAL
AB We utilize a holographic construction to compute the entanglement negativity for bipartite mixed state configurations of a single subsystem in CFTds with a conserved charge dual to bulk AdS(d+ 1) geometries. In this context, we obtain the holographic entanglement negativity for single subsystems with long rectangular strip geometries in CFTds with a conserved charge dual to bulk non extremal and extremal Reissner-Nordstrom (RN)-AdS(d+ 1) black holes at the leading order in a perturbation theory. We demonstrate that the holographic entanglement negativity computed involves the elimination of thermal contributions at the leading order confirming earlier results in the literature. This also conforms to quantum information theory expectations and constitutes further consistency checks for the holographic construction.

SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB The subchannel discrimination task involves distinguishing between different branches of a quantum evolution. The guessing probability of this task can be enhanced using quantum resources such as entanglement and steerability. In this study, we explore how to optimize the task's guessing probability within the one-sided device-independent quantum information processing framework, which is naturally associated with steering, and restricted to one-way local operations and classical communication. From a theoretical standpoint, we demonstrate how to separately optimize local filters and measurements, and provide an optimality condition that directly links the enhancement of guessing probability to the maximum steerability achievable through local filters. We then experimentally demonstrate the enhancement of the discrimination task on a two-ququart photonic system by implementing the optimal local filters.

TI On-chip pulse shaping of entangled photons
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB The miniaturization of optical systems via integrated photonics is critical to the ultimate scalability and performance of photonic quantum processors, yet many longstanding optical signal processing capabilities- such as Fourier-transform pulse shaping-remain unrealized on chip. In this work, we demonstrate on-chip spectral shaping of entangled photons using a multichannel microring-resonator-based silicon photonic pulse shaper. Achieving line-by-line phase control on a 3 GHz grid for two frequency-bin-entangled qudits, the pulse shaper's fine spectral resolution enables control of nanosecond-scale temporal features, which are observed by direct coincidence detection of biphoton correlation functions that show excellent agreement with theory. This work marks a demonstration of biphoton pulse shaping using an integrated spectral shaper and holds significant promise for applications in photonic quantum information processing.

TI Finding pythons in unexpected places
SO CLASSICAL AND QUANTUM GRAVITY
AB We argue that novel (highly nonclassical) quantum extremal surfaces (QESs) play a crucial role in reconstructing the black hole interior even for isolated, single-sided, non-evaporating black holes (i.e. with no auxiliary reservoir). Specifically, any code subspace where interior outgoing modes can be excited will have a QES in its maximally mixed state. We argue that as a result, reconstruction of interior outgoing modes is always exponentially complex. Our construction provides evidence in favor of a strong python's lunch proposal: that nonminimal QESs are the exclusive source of exponential complexity in the holographic dictionary. We also comment on the relevance of these QESs to the geometrization of state dependence in the typicality arguments for firewalls.

SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Particle detector models such as the Unruh-deWitt detector are widely used in relativistic quantum information and field theory to probe the global features of spacetime and quantum fields. These detectors are typically modeled as coupling locally to the field along a classical worldline. In this paper, we utilize a recent framework that enables us to prepare the detector in a quantum-controlled superposition of trajectories and study its response to a massless scalar field in finite-temperature Minkowski spacetime and an expanding de Sitter universe. Unlike a detector on a classical path, which cannot distinguish these spacetimes, the superposed detector can do so by acquiring nonlocal information about the geometric and causal structure of its environment, demonstrating its capability as a probe of these global properties.

TI Antibunched photon-pair source based on photon blockade in a
   nondegenerate optical parametric oscillator
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Nonclassical light sources, such as correlated photon pairs, play an important role in quantum optics and quantum information processing systems. This study proposes a process to generate antibunched photon pairs in a nondegenerate optical parametric oscillator. It is found that when the parameters of the system satisfy certain conditions, the generated photons in subharmonic modes exhibit a strong antibunching behavior and are strongly correlated with one another. In particular, the average photon-pair number is resonantly enhanced. It is also observed that the conventional photon blockade contributes to this phenomenon. In addition, it is interesting to note that fundamental mode photons can blockade the subharmonic mode photons. We refer to this phenomenon as a heterogeneous photon blockade.

TI Phase-Adaptive Dynamical Decoupling Methods for Robust Spin-Spin
   Dynamics in Trapped Ions
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB Quantum platforms based on trapped ions are the main candidates to build a quantum hardware with computational capacities that largely surpass those of classical devices. Among the available control techniques in these setups, pulsed dynamical decoupling (pulsed DD) has been revealed as a useful method to process the information encoded in ion registers, whilst minimizing the environmental noise over them. In this work, we incorporate a pulsed DD technique that uses random pulse phases, or correlated pulse phases, to significantly enhance the robustness of entangling spin-spin dynamics in trapped ions. This procedure was originally conceived in the context of nuclear magnetic resonance for nuclear spin detection purposes, and here we demonstrate that the same principles apply for robust quantum-information processing in trapped-ion settings.

TI Probing the Coherence of Solid-State Qubits at Avoided Crossings
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Optically addressable paramagnetic defects in wide-band-gap semiconductors are promising platforms for quantum communications and sensing. The presence of avoided crossings between the electronic levels of these defects can substantially alter their quantum dynamics and be both detrimental and beneficial for quantum information applications. Here we present a joint theoretical and experimental study of the quantum dynamics of paramagnetic defects interacting with a nuclear spin bath at avoided crossings. We find that we can condition the clock transition of the divacancies in SiC on multiple adjacent nuclear spins states. We suppress the effects of fluctuating charge impurities and demonstrate an increased coherence time at clock transition, which is limited purely by magnetic noise. Our results pave the way to designing single defect quantum devices operating at avoided crossings.

TI k-Positivity and Schmidt number under orthogonal group symmetries
SO QUANTUM INFORMATION PROCESSING
AB In this paper, we present a new application of group theory to develop a systematical approach to efficiently compute the Schmidt numbers. The Schmidt number is a natural quantification of entanglement in quantum information theory, but computing its exact value is generally a challenging task even for very concrete examples. We exhibit a complete characterization of all orthogonally covariant k-positive maps. This result generalizes earlier results by Tomiyama (Linear Algebra Appl 69:169-177, 1985). Furthermore, we optimize duality relations between k-positivity and Schmidt numbers under group symmetries. This new approach enables us to transfer the results of k-positivity to the computation of the Schmidt numbers of all orthogonally invariant quantum states.

TI Cryogenic optical packaging using photonic wire bonds
SO APL PHOTONICS
AB The widespread adaptation of systems relying on optically controlled quantum information will require reliable and efficient multi-channel fiber-to-chip connections that function at cryogenic temperatures. Here we demonstrate low loss (2 dB per channel) connections between a single mode fiber array and tapered silicon waveguides down to 5 K using polymer based photonic wire bonds (PWBs). A method is described for assembling the silicon chip and fiber array such that the PWB connections are robust to temperature cycling and cryostat bakeout. The threshold power handling capability of the PWBs is greater than 4 dBm, sufficient to demonstrate optical bistability in silicon microring resonators coupled to the waveguides at 5 K.(c) 2023 Author(s).

SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB We present a method to identify distinct tunneling modes in a tunable superconducting tunnel junction composed of a superconducting tip and a sample in a scanning tunneling microscope. Combining the relative decay constant of tunneling current extracted from I-V-z spectroscopy with its statistical analysis over the atomic disorders in the sample surface, we identified the crossover of dominant tunneling modes between single charge tunneling, Andreev reflection (AR), and Josephson tunneling with respect to the bias voltage at a measurement temperature nearly half of the critical temperature. The method enables one to determine the specific tunneling regime independently of the spectral shapes and to reveal intrinsic modulation of AR and Josephson current by disorder that will be crucial for superconducting quantum information processing.

TI Perovskite polariton parametric oscillator
SO ADVANCED PHOTONICS
AB Optical parametric oscillators (OPOs) have been widely applied in spectroscopy, squeezed light, and correlated photons, as well as quantum information. Conventional OPOs usually suffer from a high power threshold limited by weak high-order nonlinearity in traditional pure photonic systems. Alternatively, polaritonic systems based on hybridized exciton-photon quasi-particles exhibit enhanced optical nonlinearity by dressing photons with excitons, ensuring highly nonlinear operations with low power consumption. We report an on-chip perovskite polariton parametric oscillator with a low threshold. Under the resonant excitation at a range of angles, the signal at the ground state is obtained, emerging from the polariton-polariton interactions at room temperature. Our results advocate a practical way toward integrated nonlinear polaritonic devices with low thresholds.

TI Thermal Fisher Information for a Rotating BTZ Black Hole
SO ENTROPY
AB Relativistic quantum metrology provides a framework within which we can quantify the quality of measurement and estimation procedures while accounting for both quantum and relativistic effects. The chief measure for describing such procedures is the Fisher information, which quantifies how sensitive a given estimation is to a variance in some underlying parameter. Recently, the Fisher information has been used to quantify the spacetime information accessible to two-level quantum particle detectors. We have previously shown that such a system is capable of discerning black hole mass for static black holes in 2 + 1 dimensions. Here, we extend these results to the astrophysically interesting case of rotating black holes and show that the Fisher information is also sensitive to the rotation of a black hole.

AB Quantum cooperativity is evident in light-matter platforms where quantum-emitter ensembles are interfaced with confined optical modes and are coupled via the ubiquitous electromagnetic quantum vacuum. Cooperative effects can find applications, among other areas, in topological quantum optics, in quantum metrology, or in quantum information. This tutorial provides a set of theoretical tools to tackle the behavior responsible for the onset of cooperativity by extending open quantum system dynamics methods, such as the master equation and quantum Langevin equations, to electron-photon interactions in strongly coupled and correlated quantum-emitter ensembles. The methods are illustrated on a wide range of current research topics such as the design of nanoscale coherent-light sources, highly reflective quantum metasurfaces, or low intracavity power superradiant lasers.

TI Evidence of photochromism in a hexagonal boron nitride single-photon
   emitter
SO OPTICA
AB Solid-state single-photon emitters (SPEs) such as the bright, stable, room-temperature defects within hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) are of increasing interest for quantum information science. To date, the atomic and electronic origins of SPEs within hBN have not been well understood, and no studies have reported photochromism or explored cross correlations between hBN SPEs. Here, we combine irradiation time-dependent microphotoluminescence spectroscopy with two-color Hanbury Brown-Twiss interferometry in an investigation of the electronic structure of hBN defects. We identify evidence of photochromism in an hBN SPE that exhibits single-photon cross correlations and correlated changes in the intensity of its two zero-phonon lines.

TI Kerr-Nonlinearity-Triggered Nonclassicality of Magnons in a
   Photon-Magnon Coupling System
SO PHOTONICS
AB Hybrid quantum systems have attracted much attention due to the fact that they combine the advantages of different physical subsystems. Cavity QED (cavity quantum electrodynamics) with magnons is a hybrid quantum systems that combines a YIG (Yttrium Iron Garnet) sphere and a 3D (three-dimensional) rectangular microwave cavity. Based on this hybrid photon-magnon system, we obtain an approximate analytic solution by the RWA (rotating wave approximation) with an ingenious transformation. After skillfully diagonalizing the Hamiltonian, we show that the Kerr-nonlinearity interactions could yield a negativity value of the Wigner function, periodic quadrature squeezing effects, antibunching property, and field nonclassicality in the magnon. Our work may stimulate the study of nonclassicality of photon-magnon coupling systems and its potential applications in quantum information processing.

TI Controlling quantum many-body dynamics in driven Rydberg atom arrays
SO SCIENCE
AB The control of nonequilibrium quantum dynamics in many-body systems is challenging because interactions typically lead to thermalization and a chaotic spreading throughout Hilbert space. We investigate nonequilibrium dynamics after rapid quenches in a many-body system composed of 3 to 200 strongly interacting qubits in one and two spatial dimensions. Using a programmable quantum simulator based on Rydberg atom arrays, we show that coherent revivals associated with so-called quantum many-body scars can be stabilized by periodic driving, which generates a robust subharmonic response akin to discrete timecrystalline order. We map Hilbert space dynamics, geometry dependence, phase diagrams, and system-size dependence of this emergent phenomenon, demonstrating new ways to steer complex dynamics in many-body systems and enabling potential applications in quantum information science.

TI Spectral properties of two superconducting artificial atoms coupled to a
   resonator in the ultrastrong coupling regime
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB We experimentally investigate a superconducting circuit composed of two flux qubits ultrastrongly coupled to a common LC resonator. Owing to the large anharmonicity of the flux qubits, the system can be described well by a generalized Dicke Hamiltonian containing spin-spin interaction terms. In the experimentally measured spectrum, we observed two key phenomena. First, an avoided level crossing provides evidence of the exotic interaction that allows the simultaneous excitation of two artificial atoms by absorbing one photon from the resonator. Second, we identified a pronounced spectral asymmetry that is a clear signature of light-matter decoupling. This multi-atom ultrastrongly coupled system opens the door to studying novel processes for quantum optics and quantum-information tasks on a chip.

Metasurfaces have the potential to greatly improve the performance of OPAs and extend their range of applications. Although metasurface OPAs have found applications mostly in conventional optics so far, they have also shown great promise for application in light emitting devices and quantum optics in recent years. This paper presents a review of the state of the art of metasurface OPAs for both conventional and emerging applications.

Our method integrates a quantum marginal imposition technique with convolutional denoising autoencoders. The loss function is carefully designed to enforce essential physical constraints, including Hermiticity, positivity, and normalization. Through extensive numerical simulations, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, achieving high success rates and accuracy. Furthermore, we show that, in many cases, our model offers a faster alternative to state-of-the-art semidefinite programming solvers without compromising solution quality. These results highlight the potential of ML techniques for solving complex problems in quantum mechanics.

We embed a twodimensional Al-InAs hybrid system in a resonant microwave circuit, probing the breakdown of superconductivity due to an applied magnetic field. We find a fingerprint from the two-component nature of the hybrid system, and quantitatively compare with a theory that includes the contribution of intraband p +/- ip pairing in the InAs, as well as the emergence of Bogoliubov-Fermi surfaces due to magnetic field. Separately resolving the Al and InAs contributions allows us to determine the carrier density and mobility in the InAs.

TI Bosonic indistinguishability-dependent contextuality
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Producing contextual correlations in sequences of measurements on single quantum systems faces two major problems. One is the experimental difficulty of performing sequences of ideal measurements on high-dimensional quantum systems, a problem that also affects other forms of quantum temporal correlations. The other is the simulability with classical light of existing contextuality experiments with photons. Here, we introduce a scheme that solves both problems. We show that, by encoding quantum information in n >= 2 indistinguishable bosons in m >= 2 modes, targeting observables exploiting the bunching-antibunching of bosons, and performing ideal measurements by dispersively coupling these systems with auxiliary qubits, it is possible to realize sequential quantum measurements on high-dimensional quantum systems and produce contextuality which cannot be simulated by classical light, as it relies on indistinguishability and higher-order interference.

TI Entangled states from simple quantum graphs
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS A-MATHEMATICAL AND THEORETICAL
AB Entanglement is a fundamental resource for many applications in quantum information processing. Here, we investigate how quantum transport in simple quantum graphs (QGs), modeled as controlled two-level quantum systems, can be utilized to generate entangled states through coherent control operations between two simple QGs. A controlled operation is defined such that the scattering behavior of one QG dynamically modifies the other. Our analysis reveals the precise conditions under which maximal entanglement or separability arises, including configurations that can be implemented via phase shifts in graph structures. Our findings demonstrate that the maximal entanglement in this system is closely related to recent results on randomized QGs. These results provide new pathways for engineering entanglement using simple QGs and suggest experimental feasibility using microwave networks.

TI Microresonator-enhanced quantum dot single-photon emission in
   GaAs-on-insulator platform
SO MATERIALS FOR QUANTUM TECHNOLOGY
AB Single-photon emitters play a crucial role in integrated photonic quantum systems across various material platforms. In this study, we present a cavity-enhanced quantum dot single-photon source in a high-index contrast material platform (GaAs-on-insulator). A quantum dot is embedded in a microring resonator with a quality factor of approximately 9000, where the cavity-induced light enhancement results in a spontaneous emission acceleration factor of around 2.6, and we achieve a g( (2) )(0) as low as 0.03 +/- 0.02 and post-selected two-photon interference visibility of 51.7% +/- 3.2% for the single-photon source. This demonstration shows the potential of the GaAs-on-Insulator platform for scalable on-chip quantum information processing.

TI Hints of entanglement suppression in hyperon-nucleon scattering
SO PHYSICS LETTERS B
AB Hyperon (Y Y = E, , A)-nucleon (N N = n, p ) interactions are crucial for understanding the existence of neutron stars heavier than two solar masses. Amid renewed experimental efforts, we study YN scatterings from the perspective of quantum information, focusing on whether spin entanglement is suppressed in the s-wave channel, which is observed in np scattering and leads to enhanced global symmetries. Using global fits of phase shifts from experimental data, we find hints of entanglement suppression among the eight flavor channels in the strangeness S = -1 sector, similar to the np case. One exception is the E+p + p channel, where conflicting global fits lead to inconclusive outcome. We then propose "quantum" observables in E+p + p scattering to help resolve the differing global fits.

TI Quantum receiver enhanced by adaptive learning
SO LIGHT-SCIENCE & APPLICATIONS
AB Quantum receivers aim to effectively navigate the vast quantum-state space to endow quantum information processing capabilities unmatched by classical receivers. To date, only a handful of quantum receivers have been constructed to tackle the problem of discriminating coherent states. Quantum receivers designed by analytical approaches, however, are incapable of effectively adapting to diverse environmental conditions, resulting in their quickly diminishing performance as the operational complexities increase. Here, we present a general architecture, dubbed the quantum receiver enhanced by adaptive learning, to adapt quantum receiver structures to diverse operational conditions. The adaptively learned quantum receiver is experimentally implemented in a hardware platform with record-high efficiency. Combining the architecture and the experimental advances, the error rate is reduced up to 40% over the standard quantum limit in two coherent-state encoding schemes.

TI Cooperation and dependencies in multipartite systems
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB We propose an information-theoretic quantifier for the advantage gained from cooperation that captures the degree of dependency between subsystems of a global system. The quantifier is distinct from measures of multipartite correlations despite sharing many properties with them. It is directly computable for classical as well as quantum systems and reduces to comparing the respective conditional mutual information between any two subsystems. Exemplarily we show the benefits of using the new quantifier for symmetric quantum secret sharing. We also prove an inequality characterizing the lack of monotonicity of conditional mutual information under local operations and provide intuitive understanding for it. This underlines the distinction between the multipartite dependence measure introduced here and multipartite correlations.

TI Testing quantum theory with thought experiments
SO CONTEMPORARY PHYSICS
AB Quantum mechanics is one of our most successful physical theories; its predictions agree with experimental observations to an extremely high accuracy. However, the bare formalism of quantum theory does not provide straightforward answers to seemingly simple questions: for example, how should one model systems that include agents who are themselves using quantum theory? These foundational questions may be investigated with a theorist's tool - the thought experiment. Its purpose is to turn debates about the interpretation of quantum theory into actual physics questions. In this article, we give a state-of-the-art overview on quantum thought experiments involving observers, from the basic Wigner's friend to the recent Frauchiger-Renner setup, clarifying their interpretational significance and responding to objections and criticism on the way.

TI Quantum Tomography: From Markovianity to Non-Markovianity
SO SYMMETRY-BASEL
AB The engineering of quantum computers requires the reliable characterization of qubits, quantum operations, and even the entire hardware. Quantum tomography is an indispensable framework in quantum characterization, verification, and validation (QCVV), which has been widely accepted by researchers. According to the tomographic target, quantum tomography can be categorized into quantum state tomography (QST), quantum process tomography (QPT), gate set tomography (GST), process tensor tomography (PTT), and instrument set tomography (IST). Standard quantum tomography toolkits generally consist of basic linear inverse methods and statistical maximum likelihood estimation (MLE)-based methods. Furthermore, the performance of standard methods, including effectiveness and efficiency, has been further developed by exploiting Bayesian estimation, neural networks, matrix completion techniques, etc. In this review, we introduce the fundamental quantum tomography techniques, including QST, QPT, GST, PTT, and IST. We first introduce the details of basic linear inverse methods. Then, the framework of MLE methods with constraints is summarized. Finally, we briefly introduce recent further research in developing the performance of tomography, utilizing some symmetry properties of the target. This review provides a primary getting-start in developing quantum tomography, which promotes quantum computer development.

TI Training quantum embedding kernels on near-term quantum computers
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Kernel methods are a cornerstone of classical machine learning. The idea of using quantum computers to compute kernels has recently attracted attention. Quantum embedding kernels (QEKs), constructed by embedding data into the Hilbert space of a quantum computer, are a particular quantum kernel technique that is particularly suitable for noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices. Unfortunately, kernel methods face three major problems: Constructing the kernel matrix has quadratic computational complexity in the number of training samples, choosing the right kernel function is nontrivial, and the effects of noise are unknown. In this work, we addressed the latter two. In particular, we introduced the notion of trainable QEKs, based on the idea of classical model optimization methods. To train the parameters of the QEK, we proposed the use of kernel-target alignment. We verified the feasibility of this method, and showed that for our experimental setup we could reduce the training error significantly. Furthermore, we investigated the effects of device and finite sampling noise, and we evaluated various mitigation techniques numerically on classical hardware. We took the best performing strategy and evaluated it on data from a real quantum processing unit. We found that using this mitigation strategy demonstrated an increased kernel matrix quality.

TI Method for constructing cost-effective networks by mimicking human
   walking track superposition
SO JOURNAL OF ASIAN ARCHITECTURE AND BUILDING ENGINEERING
AB Infrastructure networks play a key role in supporting modern city activities. Future technologies will require networks such as hydrogen fuel pipelines and quantum internet networks, which should be feasible and sustainable. This study proposes a method that connects given demand points by a cost-effective network, which has a low total length that enables a low construction cost and a low total detour rate that leads to high operational effectiveness. The proposed method configures the network from scratch by mimicking human walking track superposition on a green space. Walking tracks are expected to be cost-effective because of the self-organization of pedestrians walking on a short path and a path on which others have walked. The resulting networks are equivalent to or more cost-effective than proximity graphs considered cost-effective and have geometric features similar to and different from them. The method requires two dominant parameters: initial walking resistance and ground vegetation recovery speed. A large number of networks with varying parameters approximate Pareto solutions between cost and effectiveness. Increasing either parameter generates a network with a smaller total length and a larger total detour rate. This adjustability is convenient for decision-makers faced with constraints of the construction cost and operational effectiveness.

TI Ternary molecular switching in a single-crystal optical actuator with
   correlated crystal strain
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB A growing portfolio of single-crystal optical actuators is forging a new class of photonic materials that hold prospects for quantum technologies. Ruthenium-based complexes that exhibit this phenomenon via SO2-linkage photoisomerisation are of particular interest since they display multiple metastable states, once induced by green light; yet, complete photoconversion into each SO2-isomeric state is rarely achieved. We discover a new complex, trans-[Ru(SO2)(NH3)4(4-bromopyridine)]tosylate2, that produces 100% photoconverted eta 1-OSO isomeric crystal structures at 90 K, which fully transition into eta 2-(OS)O photoisomers upon warming to 100 K, while the dark-state eta 1-SO2 structure is wholly recovered by heating the crystal to room temperature. Crystal structures and optical-absorption profiles of each state are captured via in-situ light-induced single-crystal X-ray diffraction and optical-absorption spectroscopy. Results show that both photoisomeric species behave as optical switches, but with distinct optical properties. The photoisomerisation process causes thermally-reversible micro- and nanoscopic crystal strain, as characterised by optical microscopy and in-situ light-induced atomic-force microscopy.

TI Coexistence of linear and non-linear thermoelectricity in
   graphene-superconductor tunnel junctions
SO JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS
AB We theoretically analyze the electronic transport properties of a monolayer graphene/insulator/superconductor ( G I S) tunnel junction subject to a temperature gradient. For intrinsic graphene, the system shows always dissipative charge transport even in the presence of an electronic temperature difference between the two leads. Differently, the G I S produces a thermoelectric response when the graphene electrochemical potential is lifted to energies comparable to the zero-temperature gap of the superconductor, i.e., the system is particle-hole asymmetric. Indeed, the thermally biased G I S system is able to produce both a short-circuit Peltier current and an open-circuit Seebeck voltage. This thermoelectric effect is made of a linear conventional component, due to the intrinsic particle-hole asymmetry of the sy Insert/Remove Numbered Liststem, and a non-linear contribution, due to a further spontaneous particle-hole symmetry breaking. In most of the thermal and charge configurations of the G I S system, the linear component prevails. Concluding, the G I S system could be employed in the design of thermometers, electromagnetic radiation sensors, and heat engines with profound influence in superconducting quantum technologies.

TI Neural-shadow quantum state tomography
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Quantum state tomography (QST) is the art of reconstructing an unknown quantum state through measurements. It is a key primitive for developing quantum technologies. Neural network quantum state tomography (NNQST), which aims to reconstruct the quantum state via a neural network ansatz, is often implemented via a basis-dependent cross-entropy loss function. State-of-the-art implementations of NNQST are often restricted to characterizing a particular subclass of states, to avoid an exponential growth in the number of required measurement settings. To provide a more broadly applicable method for efficient state reconstruction, we present "neural-shadow quantum state tomography" (NSQST)-an alternative neural network-based QST protocol that uses infidelity as the loss function. The infidelity is estimated using the classical shadows of the target state. Infidelity is a natural choice for training loss, benefiting from the proven measurement sample efficiency of the classical shadow formalism. Furthermore, NSQST is robust against various types of noise without any error mitigation. We numerically demonstrate the advantage of NSQST over NNQST at learning the relative phases of three target quantum states of practical interest, as well as the advantage over direct shadow estimation. NSQST greatly extends the practical reach of NNQST and provides a novel route to effective quantum state tomography.

TI Simulation Software for Transition-Edge Sensor Performance Prediction
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON APPLIED SUPERCONDUCTIVITY
AB Transition-edge sensors (TES) are outstanding calorimeters based on the steep superconductive transition of a metallic film. Among other photon detectors, they are renowned for the fine energy resolution, the photon-number resolving (PNR) capability and an extremely low dark count rate. Due to the broad detection spectrum, from gamma-ray to visible and submillimetre wavelengths, TESs are highly sought-after in a great variety of fields, such as X-ray detection and quantum technologies. Each of these fields demands a step forward in TESs performance with regards to the recovery time and energy resolution. Here we present a program, primarily capable of predicting the performance of TESs. Using established theoretical and empirical methods we developed a software that allows the users to choose active area, thickness, and material composition of a TES and to calculate its performance. Furthermore, the software can simulate TES properties at different working points. The aim of the software is to minimize the production cost and speed up the overall process for the creation of new devices with improved performance.

TI Bilinear dynamic mode decomposition for quantum control
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB Data-driven methods for establishing quantum optimal control (QOC) using time-dependent control pulses tailored to specific quantum dynamical systems and desired control objectives are critical for many emerging quantum technologies. We develop a data-driven regression procedure, bilinear dynamic mode decomposition (biDMD), that leverages time-series measurements to establish quantum system identification for QOC. The biDMD optimization framework is a physics-informed regression that makes use of the known underlying Hamiltonian structure. Further, the biDMD can be modified to model both fast and slow sampling of control signals, the latter by way of stroboscopic sampling strategies. The biDMD method provides a flexible, interpretable, and adaptive regression framework for real-time, online implementation in quantum systems. Further, the method has strong theoretical connections to Koopman theory, which approximates nonlinear dynamics with linear operators. In comparison with many machine learning paradigms minimal data is needed to construct a biDMD model, and the model is easily updated as new data is collected. We demonstrate the efficacy and performance of the approach on a number of representative quantum systems, showing that it also matches experimental results.

TI Cross-platform comparison of arbitrary quantum processes
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB In this work, we present a protocol for comparing the performance of arbitrary quantum processes executed on spatially or temporally disparate quantum platforms using Local Operations and Classical Communication (LOCC). The protocol involves sampling local unitary operators, which are then communicated to each platform via classical communication to construct quantum state preparation and measurement circuits. Subsequently, the local unitary operators are implemented on each platform, resulting in the generation of probability distributions of measurement outcomes. The max process fidelity is estimated from the probability distributions, which ultimately quantifies the relative performance of the quantum processes. Furthermore, we demonstrate that this protocol can be adapted for quantum process tomography. We apply the protocol to compare the performance of five quantum devices from IBM and the "Qianshi" quantum computer from Baidu via the cloud. The experimental results unveil two notable aspects: Firstly, the protocol adeptly compares the performance of the quantum processes implemented on different quantum computers. Secondly, the protocol scales, although still exponentially, much more favorably with the number of qubits, when compared to the full quantum process tomography. We view our work as a catalyst for collaborative efforts in cross-platform comparison of quantum computers.

TI Quantum HF/DFT-embedding algorithms for electronic structure
   calculations: Scaling up to complex molecular systems
SO JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS
AB In the near future, material and drug design may be aided by quantum computer assisted simulations. These have the potential to target chemical systems intractable by the most powerful classical computers. However, the resources offered by contemporary quantum computers are still limited, restricting the simulations to very simple molecules. In order to rapidly scale up to more interesting molecular systems, we propose the embedding of the quantum electronic structure calculation into a classically computed environment obtained at the Hartree-Fock (HF) or density functional theory (DFT) level of theory. This result is achieved by constructing an effective Hamiltonian that incorporates a mean field potential describing the action of the inactive electrons on a selected Active Space (AS). The ground state of the AS Hamiltonian is then determined by means of the variational quantum eigensolver algorithm. We show that with the proposed HF and DFT embedding schemes, we can obtain significant energy corrections to the reference HF and DFT calculations for a number of simple molecules in their strongly correlated limit (the dissociation regime) as well as for systems of the size of the oxirane molecule.

AB Graphene is a quantum spin Hall insulator, with a nontrivial topological gap induced by the spin-orbit coupling. Such splitting is weak (similar to 45 mu eV) in the absence of external magnetic field. However, due to rather long spin-relaxation time, graphene is an attractive candidate for applications in quantum technologies. When it is encapsulated in hexagonal boron nitride, the coupling between graphene and the substrate compensates intrinsic spin-orbit coupling and decreases the nontrivial topological gap, which may lead to phase transition into a trivial band insulator state. In this work, we have measured experimentally the zero-field splittings in monolayer and bilayer graphene by the means of subterahertz photoconductivity-based electron spin resonance technique. The dependance in temperature of such splittings have been also studied in the 2-12K range. We observed a decrease of the spin splittings with increasing temperature. Such behavior might be understood from several physical mechanisms that could induce a temperature dependence of the spin-orbit coupling. These includes the difference in the expansion coefficients between the graphene and the boron nitride substrate or the metal contacts, the electron-phonon interactions, and the presence of a magnetic order at low temperature.

TI Stable Electrostatic Levitation using Conformal Metasurfaces with
   Negative Polarizability
SO SMALL STRUCTURES
AB A conceptual and exploratory theoretical study on the feasibility of electrostatic levitation using a finite, conformal metasurface with negative static polarizability () is presented. Previous work has shown that stable electrostatic levitation in 3D media with negative susceptibility is theoretically possible but appears practically unattainable due to extreme experimental constraints. As a viable alternative, here, a simplified 2D system composed of anisotropic, dipolarizable entities arranged over a doubly curved surface and polarized perpendicular to the local tangent plane is modeled, drawing inspiration from recent advances in active metamaterials and aiming to lay the foundation for future realizable devices demonstrating stable electrostatic levitation. Using a self-consistent dipole-dipole interaction framework and numerical simulations, the existence of equilibrium points satisfying both force cancellation and stability conditions is theoretically demonstrated. The results show that stable levitation of a test charge can be achieved at heights up to ten times the lattice spacing, with full 3D restoring forces enabled by double curvature. These findings suggest that finite 2D metasurfaces may offer a physically realizable route toward electrostatic levitation, potentially enabling novel charged-particle trapping schemes for future quantum technologies.

TI Optimal Cold Atom Thermometry Using Adaptive Bayesian Strategies
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Precise temperature measurements on systems of few ultracold atoms is of paramount importance in quantum technologies, but can be very resource intensive. Here, we put forward an adaptive Bayesian framework that substantially boosts the performance of cold atom temperature estimation. Specifically, we process data from real and simulated release-recapture thermometry experiments on few potassium atoms cooled down to the microkelvin range in an optical tweezer. From simulations, we demonstrate that adaptively choosing the release-recapture times to maximize information gain does substantially reduce the number of measurements needed for the estimate to converge to a final reading. Unlike conventional methods, our proposal systematically avoids capturing and processing uninformative data. We also find that a simpler nonadaptive method exploiting all the a priori information can yield competitive results, and we put it to the test on real experimental data. Furthermore, we are able to produce much more reliable estimates, especially when the measured data are scarce and noisy, and they converge faster to the real temperature in the asymptotic limit. Importantly, the underlying Bayesian framework is not platform specific and can be adapted to enhance precision in other setups, thus opening new avenues in quantum thermometry.

TI Quantum versus classical generative modelling in finance
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Finding a concrete use case for quantum computers in the near term is still an open question, with machine learning typically touted as one of the first fields which will be impacted by quantum technologies. In this work, we investigate and compare the capabilities of quantum versus classical models for the task of generative modelling in machine learning. We use a real world financial dataset consisting of correlated currency pairs and compare two models in their ability to learn the resulting distribution-a restricted Boltzmann machine, and a quantum circuit Born machine. We provide extensive numerical results indicating that the simulated Born machine always at least matches the performance of the Boltzmann machine in this task, and demonstrates superior performance as the model scales. We perform experiments on both simulated and physical quantum chips using the Rigetti QCS(TM) platform, and also are able to partially train the largest instance to date of a quantum circuit Born machine on quantum hardware. Finally, by studying the entanglement capacity of the training Born machines, we find that entanglement typically plays a role in the problem instances which demonstrate an advantage over the Boltzmann machine.

TI High-Q Cavity Coupled to a High Permittivity Dielectric Resonator for
   Sensing Applications
SO ANNALEN DER PHYSIK
AB The use of high-quality factor resonators is of undoubted interest for high-precision measurements and for applications in quantum technologies. Novel types of microwave sensors can be realized by coupling a first resonator acting as a stable frequency reference with a second resonator that is sensitive to a particular physical quantity. Here, a coupled cavity configuration is reported in which a high quality () factor elliptical TESLA-shaped superconducting cavity is coupled with a high permittivity () puck, whose resonant frequency varies as a function of temperature due to the temperature dependence of the permittivity that reaches values higher than 30 000 below 1 K. Extensive electromagnetic simulations are used to test different coupling configurations, showing great versatility in tuning the coupling in the weak or strong regime, depending on the puck's position within the cavity. Moreover, for the coupled system, they allow investigation of the dependence of the zero transmission frequency (notch frequency) on changes in permittivity , obtaining a maximum value of 2.8 MHz per unit change of , for . Finally, the use of the coupled system as a sensor that operates in different temperature ranges is discussed.

TI Enhanced Control of Single-Molecule Emission Frequency and Spectral
   Diffusion
SO ACS NANO
AB The Stark effect provides a powerful method to shift the spectra of molecules, atoms, and electronic transitions in general, becoming one of the simplest and most straightforward ways to tune the frequency of quantum emitters by means of a static electric field. At the same time, in order to reduce the emitter sensitivity to charge noise, inversion symmetric systems are typically designed, providing a stable emission frequency with a quadratic-only dependence on the applied field. However, such nonlinear behavior might be reflected in correlations between the tuning ability and unwanted spectral fluctuations. Here, we provide experimental evidence of this trend using molecular quantum emitters in the solid state cooled down to liquid helium temperatures. We finally combine the electric field generated by electrodes, which is parallel to the molecule's induced dipole, with optically excite long-lived charge states acting in the perpendicular direction. Based on the anisotropy of the molecule's polarizability, our two-dimensional control of the local electric field allows us not only to tune the emitter's frequency but also to sensibly suppress the spectral instabilities associated with field fluctuations.

TI Large scale purification in semiconductors using Rydberg excitons
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Improving the quantum coherence of solid-state systems is a decisive factor in realizing solid-state quantum technologies. The key to optimize quantum coherence lies in reducing the detrimental influence of noise sources such as spin noise and charge noise. Here we demonstrate that we can utilize highly-excited Rydberg excitons to neutralize charged impurities in the semiconductor Cuprous Oxide - an effect we call purification. Purification reduces detrimental electrical stray fields drastically. We observe that the absorption of the purified crystal increases by up to 25% and that the purification effect is long-lived and may persist for hundreds of microseconds or even longer. We investigate the interaction between Rydberg excitons and impurities and find that it is long-ranged and based on charge-induced dipole interactions. Using a time-resolved pump-probe technique, we can discriminate purification from Rydberg blockade, which has been a long-standing goal in excitonic Rydberg systems.
   Charged impurities are a major source of charge noise in semiconductors. Here, using pump-probe time-resolved relative transmission measurements on cuprous oxide, the authors demonstrate a strategy for mitigating charged impurities by injection and subsequent breakdown of Rydberg excitons.

TI Broadband and Tunable Light Harvesting in Nanorippled MoS2
   Ultrathin Films
SO ACS APPLIED MATERIALS & INTERFACES
AB Nanofabrication of flat optic silica gratings conformally layered with two-dimensional (2D) MoS2 is demonstrated over large area (cm(2)), achieving a strong amplification of the photon absorption in the active 2D layer. The anisotropic subwavelength silica gratings induce a highly ordered periodic modulation of the MoS2 layer, promoting the excitation of Guided Mode Anomalies (GMA) at the interfaces of the 2D layer. We show the capability to achieve a broadband tuning of these lattice modes from the visible (VIS) to the near-infrared (NIR) by simply tailoring the illumination conditions and/or the period of the lattice. Remarkably, we demonstrate the possibility to strongly confine resonant and nonresonant light into the 2D MoS2 layers via GMA excitation, leading to a strong absorption enhancement as high as 240% relative to a flat continuous MoS2 film. Due to their broadband and tunable photon harvesting capabilities, these large area 2D MoS2 metastructures represent an ideal scalable platform for new generation devices in nanophotonics, photo-detection and -conversion, and quantum technologies.

TI HUBO and QUBO models for prime factorization
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB The security of the RSA cryptosystem is based on the difficulty of factoring a large number N into prime numbers p and q satisfying N = p x q. This paper presents a prime factorization method using a D-Wave quantum computer that could threaten the RSA cryptosystem in the future. The starting point for this method is very simple, representing two prime numbers as qubits. Then, we set the difference between the product of the two prime numbers expressed in qubits and N as a cost function, and we find the solution when the cost function is minimized. D-Wave's quantum annealer can find the minimum value of any quadratic problem. However, the cost function must be a higher-order unconstrained optimization (HUBO) model because it contains second- or higher-order terms. We used a hybrid solver accessible via Leap, D-Wave's real-time quantum cloud service, and the dimod package provided by the D-Wave Ocean software development kit (SDK) to solve the HUBO problem. We also successfully factorized 102,454,763 with 26 logical qubits. In addition, we factorized 1,000,070,001,221 using the range-dependent Hamiltonian algorithm.

   Cavities with Embedded Quantum Dots
SO ACS PHOTONICS
AB On-chip microcavities with embedded quantum emitters provide an excellent platform for high-performance quantum technologies. A major difficulty for such devices is overcoming the detrimental effects of fluctuations in the device dimensions caused by the limitations of the fabrication processes. We present a system based on a 1D photonic-crystal cavity with an embedded quantum dot. A microelectromechanical cantilever is used to tune the cavity mode wavelength via index modulation and the quantum-confined Stark effect is used to tune the quantum dot emission energy, thus mitigating the effect of fabrication imperfections. To demonstrate the operation of the device, a maximum voltage-controllable cavity tuning range of Delta lambda = 1.8 nm is observed. This signal is measured at the end of a bus waveguide which side-couples to the cavity, enabling the coupling of multiple cavities to a common waveguide, a key requirement for scale-up in these systems. Additionally, a quantum dot is tuned into resonance with the cavity mode, exhibiting an enhanced emission rate with a detector-resolution limited Purcell factor of F P = 3.5.

TI A photonic crystal receiver for Rydberg atom-based sensing
SO COMMUNICATIONS ENGINEERING
AB Rydberg atom-based sensors use atoms dressed by lasers to detect and measure radio frequency electromagnetic fields. The absorptive properties of the atomic gas, configured as a Rydberg atom-based sensor, change in the presence of a radio frequency electromagnetic field. While these sensors are reasonably sensitive, the best conventional radio frequency sensors still outperform Rydberg atom-based sensors with respect to sensitivity. One approach to increase the sensitivity of Rydberg atom-based sensors is to engineer the vapor cell that contains the atomic gas. In this work, we introduce a passive, all-dielectric amplifier integrated into a Rydberg atom-based sensor vapor cell. The vapor cell is a combination of a slot waveguide and a photonic crystal. The structural features of the vapor cell yield a power amplification of similar to 24 dB. The radio frequency electromagnetic field is coupled adiabatically into the slot waveguide and slowed to increase the interaction between the radio frequency field and the atoms to effectively amplify the incoming signal, i.e., increase the Rabi frequency on the radio frequency transition. The work shows the utility of vapor cell engineering for atom-based quantum technologies and paves the way for other such devices.

TI Modulation of surface phonon polaritons in MoO3 via dynamic
   doping of SiC substrate
SO NANOPHOTONICS
AB Polar biaxial crystals with extreme anisotropy hold promise for the spatial control and the manipulation of polaritons, as they can undergo topological transitions. However, taking advantage of these unique properties for nanophotonic devices requires to find mechanisms to modulate dynamically the material response. Here, we present a study on the propagation of surface phonon polaritons (SPhPs) in a photonic architecture based on a thin layer of alpha-MoO3 deposited on a semiconducting 4H-SiC substrate, whose carrier density can be tuned through photoinduction. By employing this system, we establish a comprehensive polaritonic platform where the propagation of the hybridized SPhPs can be manipulated dynamically due to their coupling with the electron plasma. Specifically, we demonstrate that increasing the doping of the 4H-SiC substrate allows for modulating the on/off switch behavior of SPhP propagation or its controlled canalization. Furthermore, this modulation leads to a notable increase in the Purcell factor, primarily attributed to the doping-induced flat dispersion curve creating ultra-slow light. These findings have significant implications for the development of nanophotonic and quantum technologies, as they enable the utilization of polaritonic materials exclusively.

TI A Secure Quantum Protocol for Anonymous One-Vote Veto Voting
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Voting is one of the most prominent components of democracy. The one-vote veto, which requires the voting result to be only "yes'' or "no'', is a particularly noteworthy type of voting with widespread application. When obtaining a "no'' result, no useful information about the number of "no'' votes and who votes "no'' is disclosed. In this paper, we introduce a protocol for anonymous one-vote veto utilizing qubits and local Pauli operations Z and X, building simple processes for easy implementation under the current technology. For better elaboration, we give two examples: all voters cast "yes'' votes and only one voter casts a "no.'' Then, the corresponding experiment tests are conducted on the simulated IBM quantum computer to verify their feasibility. We also show that the proposed protocol has the desirable properties of privacy, fairness, verifiability and robustness. Furthermore, we analyze the proposed protocol's security against cheating from eavesdroppers, a semi-honest server and malicious voters. Thiswork is the first attempt to illustrate how qubits can be useful for building a secure anonym ous one-vote veto strategy.

TI A Verifiable Multi-Secret Sharing Scheme Based on Short Integer Solution
SO CHINESE JOURNAL OF ELECTRONICS
AB With the possible birth of the quantum computer, traditional secret sharing schemes have been unable to meet security requirements. We proposed a new verifiable multi-secret sharing scheme based on the short integer solution problem. By utilizing a symmetric binary polynomial, k secrets and secret shares can be generated, and then we convert the secret shares into binary string on Z(q), which can be identified by one-way anti-collision hash function on the lattice, so that multiple secrets can be reconstructed safely. The advantages mainly focus on verifiability without interaction in the distribution phase and less memory requirement. In a secret sharing scheme, verifiability prevents the dealer to share the wrong shares and forces the participants to submit their shares correctly. Meanwhile, the interaction can be reduced, which means the security is improved. In a multi-secret sharing scheme, releasing the public values is inevitable, this paper has less public values and less size of shares per secret size to reduce the pressure of memory consumption in the proper parameters. In the end, it can also effectively resist the quantum attack.

AB The modern security protocols in most of our systems rely primarily on three basic functions of asymmetric cryptography: public key encryption, digital signature, and key exchange. Today, we only do key exchange (TLS 1.3) with the ECDH protocol. The confidentiality is persistent because the session keys are discarded at the end and to certify this key exchange, we sign it with RSA or ECDSA. However, these cryptosystems are at least theoretically attackable in a quantum computer model. Thus the NIST PQC standardization process has given significant momentum to research on code-based public-key cryptosystems specifically. Their security is based on the hardness of the syndrome decoding problem. In this article, we first propose a new formalism of the matrix-vector product in based-code cryptography. Second, we present a chosen-ciphertext attack on the first step of Niederreiter decryption by solving the matrix-vector product problem with side-channel information. Finally, we put this result to recover secret information in code-based cryptosystems including some candidates for the extension of the NIST PQC normalization process.

TI Resonant Spin Amplification and Accumulation in MAPbI3 Single
   Crystals
SO ADVANCED SCIENCE
AB Quantum technologic and spintronic applications require reliable semiconducting materials that enable a significant, long-living spin polarization of electronic excitations and offer the ability to manipulate it optically in an external field. Due to the specifics of band structure and remarkable spin-dependent properties, the lead halide perovskite semiconductors are suitable candidates for that. Here, the carrier spin dynamics in a MAPbI3 (MA = methylammonium) perovskite single crystal with thickness of 20 mu m are studied by the time-resolved Kerr ellipticity technique at cryogenic temperatures. Long times of longitudinal electron spin relaxation T1 = 30 ns and transverse electron spin dephasing T2,e & lowast;=21$T_{2,e}<^>*=21$ ns are found. The spin dynamics lasting longer than the applied laser pulse repetition period give rise to spin accumulation effects. They are exploited through the resonant spin amplification, polarization recovery, and spin inertia techniques to study the electron and hole spin systems coupled with the nuclear spins. These results establish the lead halide perovskite semiconductors as suitable platform for quantum technologies relying on spin-dependent phenomena.

TI Numerical Simulations of Josephson Traveling Wave Parametric Amplifiers
   (JTWPAs): Comparative Study of Open-Source Tools
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON APPLIED SUPERCONDUCTIVITY
AB Josephson Traveling Wave Parametric Amplifiers (JTWPAs) are largely exploited in quantum technologies for their broadband and low noise performance in the microwave regime. When one or more microwave tones are applied at the input, such devices show a complex wave-mixing response due to their intrinsic nonlinear nature. Numerical simulations of the JTWPAs nonlinear behaviour provide useful insights not only for the design of such devices, but also for the interpretation and validation of the experimental results. Here we present and discuss a comparative analysis of different open-source tools which can be used for JTWPAs numerical simulations. We focus on two tools for transient simulations, WRSPICE and PSCAN2, and on one tool for direct simulation of the frequency domain behaviour, JosephsonCircuit.jl. We describe the working principle of these three tools and test them considering as a benchmark a JTWPA based on SNAILs (Superconducting Nonlinear Asymmetric Inductive eLement) with realistic experimental parameters. Our results can serve as a guide for numerical simulations of JTWPAs with open-source tools, highlighting advantages and disadvantages depending on the simulation tasks.

TI Theory of a frequency-dependent beam splitter in the form of coupled
   waveguides
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB It is known that the beam splitter in the form of coupled waveguides (BS) is one of the main devices used in quantum optics and quantum technologies. A BS has two independent parameters: one is the reflection coefficient R or the transmission coefficient T, where R+T=1; the second is the phase shift phi. In various applications of quantum optics, these coefficients are considered constant. This is due to the fact that the frequency dependence of these coefficients is usually not taken into account, or this dependence is such that it cannot affect the constancy of these coefficients. It is shown that the coefficients R, T and phase shift phi are generally values that depend on the frequencies of incoming photons, the interaction time of photons in the BS, and the type of BS. It is established that in general, R, T and phi cannot be considered constant coefficients, and the criteria for when they can be considered constant are defined. The results obtained must be taken into account when analyzing and planning experiments where the beam splitter is presented in the form of coupled waveguides.

TI Simulating the non-Hermitian dynamics of financial option pricing with
   quantum computers
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB The Schr & ouml;dinger equation describes how quantum states evolve according to the Hamiltonian of the system. For physical systems, we have it that the Hamiltonian must be a Hermitian operator to ensure unitary dynamics. For anti-Hermitian Hamiltonians, the Schr & ouml;dinger equation instead models the evolution of quantum states in imaginary time. This process of imaginary time evolution has been used successfully to calculate the ground state of a quantum system. Although imaginary time evolution is non-unitary, the normalised dynamics of this evolution can be simulated on a quantum computer using the quantum imaginary time evolution (QITE) algorithm. In this paper, we broaden the scope of QITE by removing its restriction to anti-Hermitian Hamiltonians, which allows us to solve any partial differential equation (PDE) that is equivalent to the Schr & ouml;dinger equation with an arbitrary, non-Hermitian Hamiltonian. An example of such a PDE is the famous Black-Scholes equation that models the price of financial derivatives. We will demonstrate how our generalised QITE methodology offers a feasible approach for real-world applications by using it to price various European option contracts modelled according to the Black-Scholes equation.

TI Copula-based risk aggregation with trapped ion quantum computers
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Copulas are mathematical tools for modeling joint probability distributions. In the past 60 years they have become an essential analysis tool on classical computers in various fields. The recent finding that copulas can be expressed as maximally entangled quantum states has revealed a promising approach to practical quantum advantages: performing tasks faster, requiring less memory, or, as we show, yielding better predictions. Studying the scalability of this quantum approach as both the precision and the number of modeled variables increase is crucial for its adoption in real-world applications. In this paper, we successfully apply a Quantum Circuit Born Machine (QCBM) based approach to modeling 3- and 4-variable copulas on trapped ion quantum computers. We study the training of QCBMs with different levels of precision and circuit design on a simulator and a state-of-the-art trapped ion quantum computer. We observe decreased training efficacy due to the increased complexity in parameter optimization as the models scale up. To address this challenge, we introduce an annealing-inspired strategy that dramatically improves the training results. In our end-to-end tests, various configurations of the quantum models make a comparable or better prediction in risk aggregation tasks than the standard classical models.

TI Simulation of Closed Timelike Curves in a Darwinian Approach to Quantum
   Mechanics
SO UNIVERSE
AB Closed timelike curves (CTCs) are non-intuitive theoretical solutions of general relativity field equations. The main paradox associated with the physical existence of CTCs, the so-called grandfather paradox, can be satisfactorily solved by a quantum model named Deutsch-CTC. An outstanding theoretical result that has been demonstrated in the Deutsch-CTC model is the computational equivalence of a classical and a quantum computer in the presence of a CTC. In this article, in order to explore the possible implications for the foundations of quantum mechanics of that equivalence, a fundamental particle is modelled as a classical-like system supplemented with an information space in which a randomizer and a classical Turing machine are stored. The particle could then generate quantum behavior in real time in case it was controlled by a classical algorithm coding the rules of quantum mechanics and, in addition, a logical circuit simulating a CTC was present on its information space. The conditions that, through the action of evolution under natural selection, might produce a population of such particles with both elements on their information spaces from initial sheer random behavior are analyzed.

TI Scalable Thermal Engineering via Femtosecond Laser-Direct-Written
   Phononic Nanostructures
SO ADVANCED FUNCTIONAL MATERIALS
AB Modern electronics demands innovative thermal management strategy beyond conventional approaches. Here, A transformative platform bridging laboratory-scale phononic nanostructures and industrial-scale thermal engineering is demonstrated via femtosecond laser-induced periodic surface structures (fs-LIPSS). Laser-direct-written phononic metamaterials is achieved with throughputs exceeding 10-(5) m2 s-1-three orders of magnitude faster than electron beam lithography-while maintaining nanoscale resolution. Applied to silicon membranes, the fs-LIPSS reduce thermal conductivity from 101 to 76 W m-1 K-1, surpassing thin-film limit predicted by Fuchs-Sondheimer model. Monte Carlo simulations corroborate these findings, showing that long mean free paths are limited by the fs-LIPSS, while ablation-induced roughness mediates isotropic modulation of thermal conductivity via enhanced diffuse scattering. Thus, this maskless and resist-free process enables the fabrication of phononic nanostructures that are CMOS-compatible and scalable to wafer-level dimensions. This work establishes the fs-LIPSS as a versatile approach that makes phonon engineering practical for real-world devices, unlocking applications in quantum technologies, on-chip energy conversion, and high-performance computing.

TI Steric Engineering of Exciton Fine Structure in 2D Perovskites
SO ADVANCED ENERGY MATERIALS
AB A comprehensive study of excitonic properties of 2D layered perovskites is provided, with an emphasis on understanding and controlling the exciton fine structure. First, an overview of the optical properties is presented, discussing the challenges in determining the bandgap and exciton binding energies. Through magneto-optical spectroscopic measurements (up to B = 140 T), scaling laws are established for exciton binding energy as a function of the band gap and the diamagnetic coefficient. Using an in-plane magnetic field, the exciton fine structure for various 2D perovskites is examined to measure the energy splitting between the excitonic levels. The exciton fine structure and exchange interaction are correlated with structural parameters, employing an effective mass model, to highlight the role of steric effect on the exchange interaction. These findings reveal that lattice distortions, introduced by organic spacers, significantly influence the exchange interaction, driving a tunable energy spacing between dark and bright excitons. This unique feature of 2D perovskites, not present in other semiconductors, offers a novel tuning mechanism for exciton control, making these materials highly promising for efficient light emitters and advanced quantum technologies.

TI Nonreciprocal conversion between radio-frequency and optical photons
   with an optoelectromechanical system
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Nonreciprocal systems breaking time-reversal symmetry are essential tools in modern quantum technologies enabling the suppression of unwanted reflected signals or extraneous noise entering through detection ports. Here we propose a scheme enabling nonreciprocal conversion between optical and radio-frequency (rf) photons using exclusively optomechanical and electromechanical interactions. The nonreciprocal transmission is obtained by interference of two dissipative pathways of transmission between the two electromagnetic modes established through two distinct intermediate mechanical modes. In our protocol, we apply a bichromatic drive to the cavity mode and a single-tone drive to the rf resonator, and use the relative phase between the drive tones to obtain nonreciprocity. We show that perfect nonreciprocal transduction can be obtained in the limit of large cooperativity in both directions, from optical to rf and vice versa. We also study the transducer noise and show that mechanical thermal noise is always reflected back onto the isolated port. In the limit of large cooperativity, the input noise is instead transmitted in an unaltered way in the allowed direction; in particular one has only vacuum noise in the output rf port in the case of optical-to-rf conversion.

TI Coherent Control of Perfect Optical Vortex Through Four-Wave Mixing in
   an Asymmetric Semiconductor Double Quantum Well
SO FRONTIERS IN PHYSICS
AB A scheme for the coherent control of perfect optical vortex (POV) in an asymmetric semiconductor double quantum well (SDQW) nanostructure is proposed by exploiting the tunneling-induced highly efficient four-wave mixing (FWM). The orbital angular momentum (OAM) is completely transferred from a unique POV mode to the generated FWM field. Using experimentally achievable parameters, we identify the conditions under which resonant tunneling allows us to improve the quality of the vortex FWM field and engineer helical phase wave front beyond what is achievable in the absence of resonant tunneling. Furthermore, we find that the intensity and phase patterns of the vortex FWM field are sensitive to the detuning of the probe field but rather robust against the detuning of the coupling field. Subsequently, we perform the coaxial interference between the vortex FWM field and a same-frequency POV beam and show interesting interference properties, which allow us to measure the topological charge of the output POV beam. Our result may find potential applications in quantum technologies based on POV in solids.

Emergent gauge symmetries are important in quantum many-body systems in quantum phases associated with long range entanglement and topological order, e.g. they arise in high temperature superconductors, with string-net condensation and in the A-phase of superfluid He-3. String-nets and superfluid He-3 exhibit emergent properties similar to the building blocks of particle physics. Emergent gauge symmetries also play an important role in simulations of quantum field theories. This article discusses recent thinking on possible emergent gauge symmetries in particle physics, commenting also on Higgs phenomena and the vacuum energy or cosmological constant puzzle in emergent gauge systems. This article is part of the theme issue 'Quantum technologies in particle physics'.

TI Ultra-coherent nanomechanical resonators based on inverse design
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Engineered micro- and nanomechanical resonators with ultra-low dissipation constitute a promising platform for various quantum technologies and foundational research. Traditionally, the improvement of the resonator's performance through nanomechanical structural engineering has been driven by human intuition and insight. Such an approach is inefficient and leaves aside a plethora of unexplored mechanical designs that potentially achieve better performance. Here, we use a computer-aided inverse design approach known as topology optimization to structurally design mechanical resonators with optimized performance of the fundamental mechanical mode. Using the outcomes of this approach, we fabricate and characterize ultra-coherent nanomechanical resonators with, to the best of our knowledge, record-high Q . f products for their fundamental mode (where Q is the quality factor and f is the frequency). The proposed approach - which can also be used to improve phononic crystals and coupled-mode resonators - opens up a new paradigm for designing ultra-coherent micro- and nanomechanical resonators, enabling e.g. novel experiments in fundamental physics and extreme sensing.
   Nanomechanical resonators can be improved through rational design. Using an inverse design approach the authors achieve ultra-coherent resonators and pave the way towards the engineering of high performance micro- and nanomechanical resonators.

TI Experimental Fock-state bunching capability of non-ideal single-photon
   states
SO OPTICA
AB Advanced quantum technologies, as well as fundamental tests of quantum physics, crucially require the interference of multiple single photons in linear-optics circuits. This interference can result in the bunching of photons into higher Fock states, leading to a complex bosonic behavior. These challenging tasks timely require to develop collective criteria to benchmark many independent initial resources. Here we determine whether n independent imperfect single photons can ultimately bunch into the Fock state vertical bar n >. We thereby introduce an experimental Fock-state bunching capability for single-photon sources, which uses phase-space interference for extreme bunching events as a quantifier. In contrast to autocorrelation functions, this operational approach takes into account not only residual multi-photon components but also a vacuum admixture and the dispersion of individual photon statistics. We apply this approach to high-purity single photons generated from an optical parametric oscillator and show that they can lead to a Fock-state capability of at least 14. Our work demonstrates a novel collective benchmark for single-photon sources and their use in subsequent stringent applications.

TI Optimizing the quantum interference between single photons and local
   oscillator with photon correlations
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB The quantum interference between a coherent state and a single photon is an important tool in continuous variable optical quantum technologies to characterize and engineer non-Gaussian quantum states. Semiconductor quantum dots (QDs), which have recently emerged as a key platform for efficient single-photon generation, could become interesting assets in this context. An essential parameter for interfering single photons and classical fields is the mean wavepacket overlap between both fields. Here, we report on two homodyne photon-correlation techniques enabling the precise measurement of the overlap between a single photon generated by a QD-cavity device and pulsed laser light. The different statistics of interfering fields lead to specific signatures of the quantum interference on the photon correlations at the output of the interfering beam splitter. We compare the behavior of maximized overlap, measuring either the Hong-Ou-Mandel visibility between both outputs or the photon bunching at a single output. Through careful tailoring of the laser light in various degrees of freedom, we achieve a record overlap of 76% with integrated solid-state sources, which evidences the very low level of noise in our integrated single-photon sources.

TI All-on-chip reconfigurable generation of scalar and vectorial orbital
   angular momentum beams
SO LIGHT-SCIENCE & APPLICATIONS
AB Structured light carrying angular momentum, such as spin angular momentum (SAM) and orbital angular momentum (OAM), has been at the core of new science and applications, driving the need for compact on-chip sources. While many static on-chip solutions have been demonstrated, as well as on-chip sources of free-space modes, no architecture that is fully reconfigurable in all angular momentum states and all on-chip has so far been possible. Here we report the first all-on-chip structured light generator for the creation of both scalar and vectorial angular momentum beams, facilitated through a silicon-on-insulator (SOI) chip with a silica mode multiplexer (silica chip). We selectively stimulate six linearly-polarized (LP) modes of the silica multimode bus waveguide, precisely controlling the modal powers and phases with the SOI chip. This allows us to tailor arbitrary superpositions of the mode set thus synthesizing common cylindrical vector vortex beams as well as OAM beams of controlled spin and topological charge. Our compact structured light generator exhibits high switching speed and operates across the telecom band, paving the way for applications such as optical communication and integrated quantum technologies.

TI Unveiling quantum steering by quantum-classical uncertainty
   complementarity
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB One of the remarkable aspects of quantum steering is its ability to violate local uncertainty complementarity relations. In this vein of study, various steering witnesses have been developed. Here, we introduce a novel complementarity relation between the system's quantum and classical uncertainties corresponding to the distillable coherence and the von Neumann entropy, respectively. We show that the proposed complementarity relation is tighter than the entropic uncertainty relation (EUR). Leveraging this result, we propose a steering witness that is more efficient than the EUR. From the operational perspective, the steering witness quantifies the amount of extra distillable coherence facilitated by quantum steerability. Notably, the proposed steering witness serves as a full entanglement measure for pure bipartite states-an ability that the EUR lacks. We also experimentally validate such a property through a photonic system. Furthermore, a deeper connection to the uncertainty principle is revealed by showcasing the steering-induced distillable coherence can quantify measurement incompatibility and quantum steerability under genuine incoherent operations. Our work establishes a clear quantitative and operational link between coherence and steering, which are vital resources of quantum technologies, and underscores our efforts in bridging the uncertainty principle with quantum coherence.

TI Analytical soliton solutions of the Kairat-II equation using the
   Kumar-Malik and extended hyperbolic function methods
SO AIMS MATHEMATICS
AB The study of optical solitons has advanced significantly due to their stability and diverse applications, particularly in high-speed telecommunications, optical signal processing, and quantum technologies. This paper focuses on the derivation of exact soliton solutions for the nonlinear KairatII (K-II) equation, which models second-order spatiotemporal and group velocity dispersion effects in nonlinear optical systems. By applying the Kumar-Malik method and the extended hyperbolic function method, a comprehensive set of soliton solutions are obtained, capturing the intricate propagation dynamics of solitons in nonlinear media. The Kumar-Malik method yields numerous soliton solutions such as Jacobi elliptic function solution with an elliptic modulus, the trigonometric function solution, the hyper-trigonometric solution, dark solitons, bright solitons, periodic, singular and rational function solutions, etc. The behavior, stability, and evolution of these solitons are further illustrated through twodimensional (2D), three-dimensional (3D), and contour plots, providing insights into their structural form are derived for the given equation, providing valuable insights into the theoretical framework of solitons in nonlinear optics and presenting potential advancements for soliton-based technologies.

TI Measurement and Simulation of Ultra-Low-Energy Ion-Solid Interaction
   Dynamics
SO MICROMACHINES
AB Ion implantation is a key capability for the semiconductor industry. As devices shrink, novel materials enter the manufacturing line, and quantum technologies transition to being more mainstream. Traditional implantation methods fall short in terms of energy, ion species, and positional precision. Here, we demonstrate 1 keV focused ion beam Au implantation into Si and validate the results via atom probe tomography. We show the Au implant depth at 1 keV is 0.8 nm and that identical results for low-energy ion implants can be achieved by either lowering the column voltage or decelerating ions using bias while maintaining a sub-micron beam focus. We compare our experimental results to static calculations using SRIM and dynamic calculations using binary collision approximation codes TRIDYN and IMSIL. A large discrepancy between the static and dynamic simulation is found, which is due to lattice enrichment with high-stopping-power Au and surface sputtering. Additionally, we demonstrate how model details are particularly important to the simulation of these low-energy heavy-ion implantations. Finally, we discuss how our results pave a way towards much lower implantation energies while maintaining high spatial resolution.

TI Resonant Two-Laser Spin-State Spectroscopy of a Negatively Charged
   Quantum-Dot-Microcavity System with a Cold Permanent Magnet
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB A high-efficiency spin-photon interface is an essential piece of quantum hardware necessary for various quantum technologies. Self-assembled (In,Ga)As quantum dots have excellent optical properties: if embedded in an optical microcavity, they can show near-deterministic spin-photon entanglement and spin readout. To address the individual spin states, an external magnetic field is required, and a superconducting magnet is usually used. Here we show a compact cryogenically compatible Sm-Co magnet design that delivers a 475-mT in-plane (Voigt-geometry) magnetic field at 5 K, which is suitable for lifting the energy degeneracy of the electron spin states and trion transitions of a single (In,Ga)As quantum dot. This quantum dot is embedded in a birefringent high-finesse optical microcavity that enables efficient collection of single photons emitted by the quantum dot. We demonstrate spin-state manipulation by addressing the trion transitions with a single laser field and two laser fields. The experimental data agree well with our model, which covers single- and two-laser cross-polarized resonance fluorescence, Purcell enhancement in a birefringent cavity, and variation of the laser powers.

TI Experimental tests of multiplicative Bell inequalities and the
   fundamental role of local correlations
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Bell inequalities are mathematical constructs that demarcate the boundary between quantum and classical physics. A new class of multiplicative Bell inequalities originating from a volume maximization game (based on products of correlators within bipartite systems) has been recently proposed. For these new Bell parameters, it is relatively easy to find the classical and quantum, i.e., Tsirelson, limits. Here, we experimentally test the Tsirelson bounds of these inequalities using polarization-entangled photons for a different number of measurements (n), each party can perform. For n = 2, 3, 4, we report the experimental violation of local hidden variable theories. In addition, we experimentally compare the results with the parameters obtained from a fully deterministic strategy, and observe the conjectured nature of the ratio. Finally, utilizing the principle of "relativistic independence" encapsulating the locality of uncertainty relations, we theoretically derive and experimentally test new and richer quantum bounds for both the multiplicative and the additive Bell parameters for n = 2. Our findings strengthen the deep correspondence between local and nonlocal correlations, and pave the way for both theoretical (e.g., better understanding of nonlocal correlations) and practical (e.g., Bell tests and quantum technologies with inefficient detectors) applications.

TI Extremely high extinction ratio electro-optic modulator via frequency
   upconversion to visible wavelengths
SO OPTICS LETTERS
AB Intensity modulators are fundamental components for integrated photonics. From near-infrared (NIR) to visible spectral ranges, they find applications in optical communication and quantum technologies. In particular, they are required for the control and manipulation of atomic systems such as atomic clocks and quantum computers. Typical integrated electro-optic modulators operating at these wavelengths show high bandwidth and low-voltage operation, but their extinction ratios are moderate. Here we present an integrated thin-film lithium niobate electro-optic (EO) modulator operating in the C-band, which uses a subsequent periodically poled waveguide to convert the modulated signal from 1536 to 768 nm using the second-harmonic (SH) generation. We demonstrate that the upconverted signal retains the characteristics of the modulated input signal, reaching a measured high bandwidth of 35 GHz. Due to the nature of the nonlinear process, it exhibits, with respect to the fundamental signal, a doubled extinction ratio of 46 dB, which is the highest, to the best of our knowledge, recorded for near-infrared light on this platform.

TI The Influence of Deposition Temperature and Material Stress on Low-Loss
   Silicon Nitride Films for Integrated Quantum Optics
SO IEEE PHOTONICS JOURNAL
AB We report on an optimization procedure for depositing low-loss silicon nitride films at temperatures of 760 degrees C and 820 degrees C using low-pressure chemical vapor deposition. They were characterized in terms of quality and compositional proximity to stoichiometric silicon nitride. Films deposited at 760 degrees C showed a higher stoichiometry, with a silicon-to-nitrogen ratio of 0.744, when compared to the 820 degrees C film, which had a ratio of 0.77. We found the film deposited at the lower temperature had a smoother surface and exhibited lower optical losses. We investigated the impact of film stress on the refractive index of the film and found that removing the backside nitride from the wafer after deposition has a major effect on refractive index values. When using these films for integrated nonlinear and quantum applications, such as frequency conversion or soliton generation, knowledge of how the index changes with wafer and fabrication processing is critical for predicting the correct geometries, and the concomitant group velocities, needed to realize such quantum technologies.

TI Levitation of superconducting microrings for quantum magnetomechanics
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB Levitation of superconductors is becoming an important building block in quantum technologies, particularly, in the rising field of magnetomechanics. In most of the theoretical proposals and experiments, solid geometries, such as spheres are considered for the levitator. Here we demonstrate that replacing them by superconducting rings brings two important advantages: First, the forces acting on the ring remain comparable to those expected for solid objects, whereas the mass of the superconductor is greatly reduced. In turn, this reduction increases the achievable trap frequency. Second, the flux trapped in the ring by in-field cooling yields an additional degree of control for the system. We construct a general theoretical framework with which we obtain analytical formulations for a superconducting ring levitating in an anti-Helmholtz quadrupole field and a dipole field for both zero-field and field cooling. The positions and the trapping frequencies of the levitated rings are analytically found as a function of the parameters of the system and the field applied during the cooling process. Unlike what is commonly observed in bulk superconductors, lateral and rotational stabilities are not granted for this idealized geometry. We, therefore, discuss the requirements for simple superconducting structures to achieve stability in all degrees of freedom.

TI Sample-efficient learning of interacting quantum systems
SO NATURE PHYSICS
AB Learning the Hamiltonian of a complex many-body system is hard, but now there is proof that it can be done in a way where the number of required measurements scales as a polynomial of the number of particles.
   Learning the Hamiltonian that describes interactions in a quantum system is an important task in both condensed-matter physics and the verification of quantum technologies. Its classical analogue arises as a central problem in machine learning known as learning Boltzmann machines. Previously, the best known methods for quantum Hamiltonian learning with provable performance guarantees required a number of measurements that scaled exponentially with the number of particles. Here we prove that only a polynomial number of local measurements on the thermal state of a quantum system are necessary and sufficient for accurately learning its Hamiltonian. We achieve this by establishing that the absolute value of the finite-temperature free energy of quantum many-body systems is strongly convex with respect to the interaction coefficients. The framework introduced in our work provides a theoretical foundation for applying machine learning techniques to quantum Hamiltonian learning, achieving a long-sought goal in quantum statistical learning.

TI Remote cooling of spin-ensembles through a spin-mechanical hybrid
   interface
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB We present a protocol for the ground-state cooling of a tripartite hybrid quantum system, in which a macroscopic oscillator acts as a mediator between a single-probe spin and a remote spin ensemble. In the presence of weak dispersive coupling between the spins and the oscillator, cooling of the oscillator and the ensemble spins can be achieved by exploiting the feedback from frequent measurements of the single-probe spin. We explore the parameter regimes necessary to cool the ensemble, the oscillator, or both to their thermal ground states. This novel cooling protocol shows that, even with only weak dispersive coupling, energy transfer-like effects can be obtained by simply manipulating the probe spin. These results not only contribute to the development of a practical solution for cooling/polarizing large spin ensembles but also provide a relatively simple means of tuning the dynamics of a hybrid system. The proposed protocol thus has broader implications for advancing various quantum technology applications, such as macroscopic quantum state generation and remote sensing.

TI Two-photon charging of a quantum battery with a Gaussian pulse envelope
SO PHYSICS LETTERS A
AB Quantum energy science is rapidly emerging as a domain interested in the generation, transfer and storage of energy at the quantum level. In particular, quantum batteries have the scope to exploit the wonders of quantum mechanics in order to boost their performance as compared to their electrochemical equivalents. Here we show how an exponential enhancement in stored energy can be achieved with a quantum battery thanks to a two-photon charging protocol. We consider theoretically a quantum battery modelled as a quantum harmonic oscillator, which when driven by a quadratic field (manifested by a Gaussian pulse envelope) gives rise to squeezing of the battery. This quantum squeezing ensures that the population of the battery is driven exponentially up its bosonic energy ladder. Our results demonstrate a plausible mechanism for quickly storing a vast amount of energy in a quantum object defined by continuous variables, which may be explored experimentally in a variety of quantum optical platforms.

TI Establishing an end-to-end workflow for SNSPD fabrication and
   characterization
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB The outstanding performance of superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors (SNSPDs) has expanded their application areas from quantum technologies to astronomy, space communication, imaging, and LiDAR. As a result, there has been a surge in demand for these devices, that commercial products cannot readily meet. Consequently, more research and development efforts are being directed towards establishing in-house SNSPD manufacturing, leveraging existing nano-fabrication capabilities that can be customized and fine-tuned for specific needs. We report on the implementation of an end-to-end workflow for SNSPD fabrication and characterization, from superconducting film growth to meander nanowire fabrication and their integration with electrical readout circuits and optical testbeds. An essential aspect of this research involved identifying the key parameters of our workflow and developing reliable procedures for their optimization. As an outcome, the ab initio development of SNSPD technology yielded devices with characteristics comparable to commercial devices at a wavelength of 1550 nm, making them well-suited for telecommunication and integrated quantum systems. This report aims to provide useful insights to those entering the field and accelerate the establishment of superconducting detector technology and its application across various domains.

TI Experimental certification of level dynamics in single-photon emitters
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Emitters of single photons are essential resources for emerging quantum technologies and developed within different platforms including nonlinear optics and atomic and solid-state systems. The energy-level structures of emission processes are critical for reaching and controlling high-quality sources. The most commonly applied test uses a Hanbury Brown and Twiss (HBT) setup to determine the emitter energy-level structure based on fitting temporal correlations of photon detection events. However, only partial information about the emission process is extracted from such detection, that might be followed by an inconclusive fitting of the data. This process predetermines our limited ability to quantify and understand the dynamics in the photon emission process that are of importance for the applications in communication, sensing, and computing. In this work, we present a complete analysis based on all normalized coincidences between detection and no-detection events recorded in the same HBT setup to certify expected properties of an emitted photonic state. As a proof of concept we apply our methodology to single nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond, in which case the certification conclusively rejects a model based on a two-level emitter that radiates a photonic state mixed with any classical noise background.

TI Spin-defect characteristics of single sulfur vacancies in monolayer
   MoS2
SO NPJ 2D MATERIALS AND APPLICATIONS
AB Single spin-defects in 2D transition-metal dichalcogenides are natural spin-photon interfaces for quantum applications. Here we report high-field magneto-photoluminescence spectroscopy from three emission lines (Q1, Q2, and Q*) of He-ion induced sulfur vacancies in monolayer MoS2. Analysis of the asymmetric PL lineshapes in combination with the diamagnetic shift of Q1 and Q2 yields a consistent picture of localized emitters with a wave function extent of similar to 3.5 nm. The distinct valley-Zeeman splitting in out-of-plane B-fields and the brightening of dark states through in-plane B-fields necessitates spin-valley selectivity of the defect states and lifted spin-degeneracy at zero field. Comparing our results to ab initio calculations identifies the nature of Q1 and Q2 and suggests that Q* is the emission from a chemically functionalized defect. Analysis of the optical degree of circular polarization reveals that the Fermi level is a parameter that enables the tunability of the emitter. These results show that defects in 2D semiconductors may be utilized for quantum technologies.

TI Micro-transfer printing of O-band InGaAs/InP photodiodes on a silicon
   nitride photonic platform
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Silicon nitride (SiN) photonic platforms offer outstanding optical properties, making them suitable for diverse applications in communications, sensing, and nonlinear/quantum technologies. However, the absence of native active components, such as photodiodes, significantly limits the functionality of these platforms. This work addresses this gap by integrating O-band InGaAs/InP photodiodes onto a low-pressure chemical vapor deposition (LPCVD) SiN photonic platform using micro-transfer printing (mu TP). The photodiodes exhibit a low dark current below 38 nA at-2 V bias voltage and a high responsivity of 1 A/W at 1310 nm, facilitated by an efficient waveguide coupling structure. Moreover, the adoption of a modified uni-traveling carrier (MUTC) design enhances the 3-dB bandwidth to 32 GHz, an improvement of 12 GHz compared to a reference PIN photodiode with the same absorber thickness. The photodiodes successfully demonstrated high-speed data reception of non-return-to-zero (NRZ) signals up to 40 Gbps with clear open eye diagrams. The mu TP technique holds significant promise for co-integrating photodiodes with other active components, paving the way for multifunctional SiN-based PICs for next-generation data communications, interconnects, and on-chip signal processing.

TI Quantized conductance in hybrid split-gate arrays of superconducting
   quantum point contacts with semiconducting two-dimensional electron
   systems
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB A quantum point contact (QPC)-a constriction in a semiconducting two-dimensional electron system with a quantized conductance-is a building block of novel spintronic and topological electronic circuits. QPCs can also be used as readout electronics, charge sensors, or switches in quantum nanocircuits. A short and impurity-free constriction with superconducting contacts is a Cooper-pair QPC analogue known as a superconducting quantum point contact (SQPC). The technological development of such quantum devices has been prolonged due to the challenges of maintaining their geometrical requirement and nearmaterial and device engineering techniques and report on an innovative realization of nanoscale hybrid SQPC arrays with split gate technology in semiconducting 2D electron systems. We exploit the special gate tunability of the quantum wells, and demonstrate the first experimental observation of conductance quantization in hybrid InGaAs-Nb SQPCs. We observe reproducible quantized conductance at zero magnetic fields in multiple quantum nanodevices fabricated in a single chip and systematically investigate the quantum transport of SQPCs at low and high magnetic fields for their potential applications in quantum metrology, for extremely accurate voltage standards, and fault-tolerant quantum technologies.

TI Numerical analysis of a high-efficiency dual-material waveguide-grating
   coupler system for ultraviolet photonics
SO OPTICS CONTINUUM
AB The unique capabilities of photonic integrated circuits (PICs) position them as a high-performance and scalable platform, enabling a broad spectrum of applications ranging from classical communication to pioneering quantum technologies. Despite the significant success of visible and near-infrared PICs, extending light integration into the ultraviolet-near ultraviolet (UV-NUV) wavelength range poses substantial challenges due to the technology's relatively immature development. In this study, we introduce a novel dual-material waveguide-grating coupler system that employs aluminum oxide (Al2O3) as the waveguide and aluminum nitride (AlN) as the grating coupler, leveraging their complementary optical properties. Given their large band gaps combined with a demonstrated low-loss propagation in Al2O3 at UV wavelengths and the high refractive index of AlN, we present a pathway for significant efficiency improvements and reduced device footprint through finite-difference time-domain simulations. Notably, the monolithic integration of these materials within CMOS-compatible processes presents a viable approach to harnessing the UV-NUV regime for on-chip light routing and input/output devices.

TI Ultralow-Vertical-Current Magnetization Switching Effect in an All Van
   Der Waals 2D Heterostructure
SO CHINESE PHYSICS LETTERS
AB The manipulation of magnetization and spin polarization using electrical currents represents a fundamental breakthrough in spintronics. It has formed the foundation for data storage and next-generation computing systems. Spin-transfer torque (STT) and spin-orbit torque (SOT) have emerged as prominent mechanisms in current-driven magnetization switching. However, these approaches typically require critical current densities in the range of 106 to 109 A & sdot;cm-2, resulting in significant heat generation during data writing processes. Herein, we report the discovery of an ultralow-vertical-current magnetization switching effect in a van der Waals ferromagnetic/ferroelectric heterostructure based on the modulation of the critical magnetic field (HC) using small vertical currents, with a critical current density as low as 1.81 A & sdot;cm-2 and an average effective field (Heff/JC) as high as 150.3 mT & sdot;A-1 & sdot;cm2. This unique magnetization switching effect with ultralow-critical-vertical-current densities typically six to nine orders of magnitude lower than those of the STT and SOT provides a new transformative and viable pathway for developing next-generation spintronic and quantum technologies.

TI Direct determination of high-order transverse ligand field parameters
   via μSQUID-EPR in a Et4N[160GdPc2] SMM
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB The development of quantum technologies requires a thorough understanding of systems possessing quantum effects that can ultimately be manipulated. In the field of molecular magnetism, one of the main challenges is to measure high-order ligand field parameters, which play an essential role in the relaxation properties of SMMs. The development of highly advanced theoretical calculations has allowed the ab-initio determination of such parameters; however, currently, there is a lack of quantitative assessment of how good the ab-initio parameters are. In our quest for technologies that can allow the extraction of such elusive parameters, we develop an experimental technique that combines the EPR spectroscopy and mu SQUID magnetometry. We demonstrate the power of the technique by performing EPR-mu SQUID measurement of a magnetically diluted single crystal of Et4N[GdPc2], by sweeping the magnetic field and applying a range of multifrequency microwave pulses. As a result, we were able to directly determine the high-order ligand field parameters of the system, enabling us to test theoretical predictions made by state-of-the-art ab-initio methods.

TI Certifying emergent genuine multipartite entanglement with a partially
   blind witness
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Genuine multipartite entanglement underlies correlation experiments corroborating quantum mechanics and it is an expedient empowering many quantum technologies. One of many counterintuitive facets of genuine multipartite entanglement is its ability to exhibit an emergent character. That is, one can infer its presence in some multipartite states merely from a set of its separable marginals. Here we show that the effect can also be found in the context of Gaussian states of bosonic systems. Specifically, we construct examples of multimode Gaussian states carrying genuine multipartite entanglement which can be verified solely from separable nearest -neighbor two-mode marginals. The key tool of our construction is an entanglement witness acting only on some two-mode reductions of the global covariance matrix, which we find by a numerical solution of a semidefinite program. We also propose an experimental scheme for preparation of the simplest three-mode state, which requires interference of three correlatively displaced squeezed beams on two beam splitters. Besides revealing the concept of emergent genuine multipartite entanglement in the Gaussian scenario and bringing it closer to experimentally testable form, our results pave the way to effective diagnostics methods of global properties of multipartite states without complete tomography.

TI Single-molecule scale magnetic resonance spectroscopy using quantum
   diamond sensors
SO REVIEWS OF MODERN PHYSICS
AB Single -molecule technology stands as a powerful tool, enabling the characterization of intricate structural and dynamic information that would otherwise remain concealed within the averaged behaviors of numerous molecules. This technology finds extensive application across diverse fields including physics, chemistry, biology, and medicine. Quantum sensing, particularly leveraging nitrogen -vacancy (NV) centers within diamond structures, presents a promising avenue for single -molecule magnetic resonance, offering prospects for sensing and imaging technology at the single -molecule level. Notably, while significant strides have been made in single -molecule scale magnetic resonance using NV centers over the past two decades, current approaches still exhibit limitations in magnetic sensitivity, spectral resolution, and spatial resolution. In particular, the full reconstruction of three-dimensional positions of nuclear spins within single molecules remains an unattained goal. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the current state of the art in single -molecule scale magnetic resonance encompassing an analysis of various relevant techniques involving NV centers. Additionally, it explores the optimization of technical parameters associated with these methods. This detailed analysis serves as a foundation for the development of new technologies and the exploration of potential applications.

TI Dynamic quantum-enhanced sensing without entanglement in central spin
   systems
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We propose a dynamic quantum sensing scheme by using a quantum many-spin system composed of a central spin interacting with many surrounding spins. Starting from a generalized Ising ring model, we investigate the error propagation formula of the central spin, and it indicates that Heisenberg scaling can be reached while the probe state only needs to be a product state. Particularly, we derive an analytical form of the dynamic quantum Fisher information in a limit case, which explicitly exhibits the Heisenberg scaling. By comparing with numerical results, we demonstrate that the general case can be well approximated by the analytical result when the coupling strength among the surrounding spins is much weaker than the coupling strength between the central and surrounding spins. This analytic result guides us to find the appropriate probe state and the proper measurement time to achieve the Heisenberg scaling in realistic situations. Furthermore, we investigate various effects which are important in practical quantum systems, including the central spin Zeeman term, the anisotropy of the hyperfine interaction and the inhomogeneity of the hyperfine coupling strength. Our result indicates that the dynamic quantum-enhanced sensing scheme seems feasible in realistic quantum central spin systems, like semiconductor quantum dots.

TI Critical quantum metrology with fully-connected models: from Heisenberg
   to Kibble-Zurek scaling
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Phase transitions represent a compelling tool for classical and quantum sensing applications. It has been demonstrated that quantum sensors can in principle saturate the Heisenberg scaling, the ultimate precision bound allowed by quantum mechanics, in the limit of large probe number and long measurement time. Due to the critical slowing down, the protocol duration time is of utmost relevance in critical quantum metrology. However, how the long-time limit is reached remains in general an open question. So far, only two dichotomic approaches have been considered, based on either static or dynamical properties of critical quantum systems. Here, we provide a comprehensive analysis of the scaling of the quantum Fisher information for different families of protocols that create a continuous connection between static and dynamical approaches. In particular, we consider fully-connected models, a broad class of quantum critical systems of high experimental relevance. Our analysis unveils the existence of universal precision-scaling regimes. These regimes remain valid even for finite-time protocols and finite-size systems. We also frame these results in a general theoretical perspective, by deriving a precision bound for arbitrary time-dependent quadratic Hamiltonians.

TI Photoactivation of Color Centers Induced by CW Laser Irradiation in
   Ion-Implanted Diamond
SO ACS PHOTONICS
AB Split-vacancy color centers in diamonds are promising solid-state platforms for the implementation of photonic quantum technologies. These luminescent defects are commonly fabricated upon low-energy ion implantation and subsequent thermal annealing. Their technological uptake will require the availability of reliable methods for the controlled, large-scale production of localized individual photon emitters. This task is partially achieved by controlled ion implantation to introduce selected impurities in the host material and requires the development of challenging beam focusing or collimation procedures coupled with single-ion detection techniques. We report on the protocol for the direct optical activation of split-vacancy color centers in diamond via localized processing with a continuous-wave laser at mW optical powers. We demonstrate the activation of photoluminescent Mg- and Sn-related centers at both the ensemble and single-photon emitter levels in ion-implanted, high-purity diamond crystals without further thermal processing. The proposed lithographic method enables the activation of individual color centers at specific positions of a large-area sample by means of a relatively inexpensive equipment offering real-time, in situ monitoring of the process.

TI [2+2] Cycloaddition Produces Divalent Organic Color-Centers with Reduced
   Heterogeneity in Single-Walled Carbon Nanotubes
SO JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY
AB Organic color centers (OCCs), generated by the covalent functionalization of single-walled carbon nanotubes, have been exploited for chemical sensing, bioimaging, and quantum technologies. However, monovalent OCCs can assume at least 6 different bonding configurations on the sp(2) carbon lattice of a chiral nanotube, resulting in heterogeneous OCC photoluminescence emissions. Herein, we show that a heat-activated [2 + 2] cycloaddition reaction enables the synthesis of divalent OCCs with a reduced number of atomic bonding configurations. The chemistry occurs by simply mixing enophile molecules (e.g., methylmaleimide, maleic anhydride, and 4-cyclopentene-1,3-dione) with an ethylene glycol suspension of SWCNTs at elevated temperature (70-140 degrees C). Unlike monovalent OCC chemistries, we observe just three OCC emission peaks that can be assigned to the three possible bonding configurations of the divalent OCCs based on density functional theory calculations. Notably, these OCC photoluminescence peaks can be controlled by temperature to decrease the emission heterogeneity even further. This divalent chemistry provides a scalable way to synthesize OCCs with tightly controlled emissions for emerging applications.

TI Overcoming the Rate-Directionality Trade-off: A Room-Temperature
   Ultrabright Quantum Light Source
SO ACS NANO
AB Deterministic GHz-rate single photon sources at room temperature would be essential components for various quantum applications. However, both the slow intrinsic decay rate and the omnidirectional emission of typical quantum emitters are two obstacles toward achieving such a goal which are hard to overcome simultaneously. Here, we solve this challenge by a hybrid approach using a complex monolithic photonic resonator constructed of a gold nanocone responsible for the rate enhancement, enclosed by a circular Bragg antenna for emission directionality. A repeatable process accurately binds quantum dots to the tip of the antenna-embedded nanocone. As a result, we achieve simultaneous 20-fold emission rate enhancement and record-high directionality leading to an increase in the observed brightness by a factor as large as 800 (130) into an NA = 0.22(0.5). We project that these miniaturized on-chip devices can reach photon rates approaching 1.4 x 10(8) photons/s and pure single photon rates of >10(7) photons/second after temporal purification processes, thus enabling ultrafast light-matter interfaces for quantum technologies at ambient conditions.

TI Long range and highly tunable interaction between local spins coupled to
   a superconducting condensate
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Interfacing magnetism with superconducting condensates is rapidly emerging as a viable route for the development of innovative quantum technologies. In this context, the development of rational design strategies to controllably tune the interaction between magnetic moments is crucial. Here we address this problem demonstrating the possibility of tuning the interaction between local spins coupled through a superconducting condensate with atomic scale precision. By using Cr atoms coupled to superconducting Nb, we use atomic manipulation techniques to precisely control the relative distance between local spins along distinct crystallographic directions while simultaneously sensing their coupling by scanning tunneling spectroscopy. Our results reveal the existence of highly anisotropic interactions, lasting up to very long distances, demonstrating the possibility of crossing a quantum phase transition by acting on the direction and interatomic distance between spins. The high tunability provides novel opportunities for the realization of topological superconductivity and the rational design of magneto-superconducting interfaces.
   The possibility of using superconductivity to control indirect interactions between magnetic moments remains largely unexplored. Here, the authors report tuning the interaction between local spins of Cr atoms coupled through a superconducting condensate in Nb.

TI Sub-millielectronvolt Line Widths in Polarized Low-Temperature
   Photoluminescence of 2D PbS Nanoplatelets
SO NANO LETTERS
AB Colloidal semiconductor nanocrystals are promising materials for classical and quantum light sources due to their efficient photoluminescence (PL) and versatile chemistry. While visible emitters are well-established, excellent (near-infrared) sources are still being pursued. We present the first comprehensive analysis of low-temperature PL from two-dimensional (2D) PbS nanoplatelets (NPLs). Ultrathin 2D PbS NPLs exhibit high crystallinity confirmed by scanning transmission electron microscopy, revealing Moire patterns in overlapping NPLs. At 4 K, unique PL features are observed in single PbS NPLs, including narrow zero-phonon lines with line widths down to 0.6 meV and a linear degree of polarization up to 90%. Time-resolved measurements identify trions as the dominant emission source with a 2.3 ns decay time. Sub-meV spectral diffusion and no inherent blinking over minutes are observed, as well as discrete spectral jumps without memory effects. These findings advance the understanding and underscore the potential of colloidal PbS NPLs for optical and quantum technologies.

TI Fractional Wannier Orbitals and Tight-Binding Gauge Fields in Kitaev
   Honeycomb Superlattices with Flat Majorana Bands
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW X
AB Fractional excitations hold immense promise for both fundamental physics and quantum technologies. However, constructing lattice models for their dynamics under gauge fields remains a formidable challenge due to inherent obstructions. Here, we introduce a novel and systematic framework for deriving low-energy lattice models of fractional orbitals coupled to tight-binding gauge fields. Departing from conventional geometric approaches, our method systematically eliminates the high-energy states via virtual hopping, thereby deriving the gauge potential and quantum metric through a superexchange mechanism. We demonstrate the framework by constructing Wannier orbitals for Majorana states and a tight-binding Z(2) gauge field across various flux-crystalline phases in the Kitaev spin model on a honeycomb lattice. Our study reveals a striking phase transition between two nontrivial topological phases characterized by gapless flat band with extensive degeneracy. Furthermore, we develop a gauge-invariant mean-field theory for interacting Majorana orbitals, leading to a fractional Chern state. Our work establishes a general framework for gauge-mediated tight-binding models and a gauge-invariant mean-field theory for interacting fractional orbitals that can be readily extended to U(1), SU(N) lattice gauge theories.

TI Every Quantum Helps: Operational Advantage of Quantum Resources beyond
   Convexity
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Identifying what quantum -mechanical properties are useful to untap a superior performance in quantum technologies is a pivotal question. Quantum resource theories provide a unified framework to analyze and understand such properties, as successfully demonstrated for entanglement and coherence. While these are examples of convex resources, for which quantum advantages can always be identified, many physical resources are described by a nonconvex set of free states and their interpretation has so far remained elusive. Here we address the fundamental question of the usefulness of quantum resources without convexity assumption, by providing two operational interpretations of the generalized robustness measure in general resource theories. First, we characterize the generalized robustness in terms of a nonlinear resource witness and reveal that any state is more advantageous than a free one in some multicopy channel discrimination task. Next, we consider a scenario where a theory is characterized by multiple constraints and show that the generalized robustness coincides with the worst -case advantage in a single -copy channel discrimination setting. Based on these characterizations, we conclude that every quantum resource state shows a qualitative and quantitative advantage in discrimination problems in a general resource theory even without any specification on the structure of the free states.

TI Direct Visualization and Effects of Atomic-Scale Defects on the
   Optoelectronic Properties of Hexagonal Boron Nitride
SO ADVANCED ELECTRONIC MATERIALS
AB Hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) has attracted a lot of attention in the past years, thanks to its many remarkable properties. These include the presence of single-photon emitters with superior optical properties, which make it an ideal candidate for a plethora of photonic technologies. However, despite the large number of experimental results and theoretical calculations, the structure of the defects responsible for the observed emission is still under debate. In this work, individual atomic-scale defects in hBN with atomic force microscopy under ambient conditions are visualized and multiple narrow emission lines from optically stable emitters are observed. This direct observation of the structure of the defects combined with density functional theory calculations of their band structures and electronic properties allows associating the existence of several single-photon transitions to the observed defects. The work sheds light on the origin of single-photon emission in hBN that is important for the understanding and tunability of high-quality emitters in optoelectronics and quantum technologies.

TI Observation of polaronic state assisted sub-bandgap saturable absorption
SO OPTO-ELECTRONIC ADVANCES
AB In soft-lattice lead-halide perovskites, the polaronic effects involving stabilization of localized charge character by structural deformations and polarizations have an important effect on the properties of functional materials such as the band gap, which has attracted considerable investigations. However, the concept of polaron assisted nonlinear photonics remains largely unexplored, which has a wide range of applications from optoelectronics to telecommunications and quantum technologies. Here, we report the first observation of the polaronic state assisted saturable absorption through subbandgap excitation with a redshift exceeding 60 meV. By combining photoluminescence, transient absorption measurements and density functional theory calculations, we explicate that the anomalous nonlinear saturable absorption under sub-bandgap excitation is caused by the transient picosecond timescale polaronic state formed by strong carrier/excitonphonon coupling effect. The bandgap fluctuation caused by polaron formation can be further tuned through excitonphonon coupling of perovskites with different Young's modulus. This suggests that we can design targeted soft lattice lead-halide perovskite with a specific structure to effectively manipulate exciton-phonon coupling and exciton-polaron formation. These findings profoundly expand our understanding of exciton-polaronic nonlinear optics physics and provide an ideal platform for developing actively tunable nonlinear photonics applications.

AB Controlling the site, size, and shape of group III-nitride quantum dots (QDs) is critical for the development of mass-producible single-photon sources for scalable quantum technologies operable at room temperature. Herein, a methodology is proposed for fabricating high-purity single QD emitters by controlling site-controlled GaN micro-pyramid structures with a high degree of uniformity and symmetry. To achieve a uniformly grown, hexagonally symmetric micro-pyramid array, the H-2/N-2 carrier gas ratio, growth temperature, and V/III ratio are controlled to attain self-limited growth regime and self-limited width at the GaN pyramid apex. A thin InGaN layer is consecutively grown on a pyramid array under the growth condition for enhancing the growth rate anisotropy to hinder the growth of InGaN quantum wells (QWs) at semi-polar facets. As a result, single-photon emission is observed from apex QD with suppressed background side QW emission while maintaining more than 90% high hexagonal QD symmetry over the large area of the wafer.

TI Curvature-enhanced localised emission from dark states in wrinkled
   monolayer WSe2 at room temperature
SO SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY OF ADVANCED MATERIALS
AB Localised emission from defect states in monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides is of great interest for optoelectronic and quantum device applications. Recent progress towards high temperature localised emission relies on the application of strain to induce highly confined excitonic states. Here we propose an alternative paradigm based on curvature, rather than in-plane stretching, achieved through free-standing wrinkles of monolayer tungsten diselenide (WSe2). We probe these nanostructures using tip-enhanced optical spectroscopy to reveal the spatial localisation of out-of-plane polarised emission from the WSe2 wrinkles. Based on the photoluminescence and Raman scattering signatures resolved with nanoscale spatial resolution, we propose the existence of a manifold of spin-forbidden excitonic states that are activated by the local curvature of the WSe2. We are able to access these dark states through the out-of-plane polarised surface plasmon polariton resulting in enhanced strongly localised emission at room temperature, which is of potential interest for quantum technologies and photonic devices.

TI Visible-Light Integrated PIN Avalanche Photodetectors With High
   Responsivity and Bandwidth
SO JOURNAL OF LIGHTWAVE TECHNOLOGY
AB Integrated photodetectors are key building blocks of scalable photonics platforms. Many recent improvements have been made for integrated avalanche photodetectors (APDs) operating at infrared telecommunications wavelengths, but their visible-spectrum counterparts remain relatively unexplored. Here, we demonstrate PIN-doped silicon APDs for visible light detection, monolithically integrated with a silicon nitride photonics circuit via end-fire coupling. An in-depth study of multiple PIN doping profiles reveals different optimal designs based on the desired operating regimes. At -49 dBm input power, they show 0.25 A/W (0.8 A/W) responsivity at reverse bias as low as 0.5 V (5.5 V), with corresponding dark current of <3 pA (50 pA). We also report fast RF response with an optimal 3 dB bandwidth of 11 GHz and gain-bandwidth product of 142 GHz, with all devices yielding open eye diagrams at 25 Gbps or above. Coupled with CMOS-compatible fabrication, our APDs will enable scalable photonics applications in sensing, communications, and quantum technologies at visible wavelengths.

TI Thermal-Noise Cancellation for Optomechanically Induced Nonreciprocity
   in a Whispering-Gallery-Mode Microresonator
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB Magnetic-free optomechanically induced nonreciprocity may stimulate a wide range of practical applications in quantum technologies. However, how to suppress the thermal-noise flow from the mechanical reservoir is still a difficulty encountered in achieving optomechanically nonreciprocal effects on a few- and even single-photon level. Here, we show how to realize thermal-noise cancellation by quantum interference for optomechanically induced nonreciprocity in a whispering-gallery-mode (WGM) microresonator. We find that both nonreciprocal transmission and amplification can be achieved in the WGM microresonator when coupled to two coupled mechanical resonators. More interestingly, the thermal noise can be suppressed when the two coupled mechanical resonators couple to a common thermal reservoir. The thermal-noise cancellation is induced by the destructive quantum interference between the two flow paths of the thermal noises from the common reservoir. The scheme of quantum-interference-induced thermalnoise cancellation can be applied in both sideband-resolved and unresolved regimes, even with strong backscattering taken into account. Our work provides an effective way to achieve nonreciprocal effects on a few- or single-photon level without precooling the mechanical mode to the ground state.

TI Extrinsic Localized Excitons in Patterned 2D Semiconductors
SO ADVANCED FUNCTIONAL MATERIALS
AB A new localized excitonic state is demonstrated in patterned monolayer 2D semiconductors. The signature of an exciton associated with that state is observed in the photoluminescence spectrum after electron beam exposure of several 2D semiconductors. The localized state, which is distinguished by non-linear power dependence, survives up to room temperature and is patternable down to 20 nm resolution. The response of the new exciton to the changes of electron beam energy, nanomechanical cleaning, and encapsulation via multiple microscopic, spectroscopic, and computational techniques is probed. All these approaches suggest that the state does not originate from irradiation-induced structural defects or spatially non-uniform strain, as commonly assumed. Instead, it is shown to be of extrinsic origin, likely a charge transfer exciton associated with the organic substance deposited onto the 2D semiconductor. By demonstrating that structural defects are not required for the formation of localized excitons, this work opens new possibilities for further understanding of localized excitons as well as their use in applications that are sensitive to the presence of defects, e.g. chemical sensing and quantum technologies.

TI Optimal probes for global quantum thermometry
SO COMMUNICATIONS PHYSICS
AB Quantum thermodynamics has emerged as a separate sub-discipline, revising the concepts and laws of thermodynamics, at the quantum scale. In particular, there has been a disruptive shift in the way thermometry, and thermometers are perceived and designed. Currently, we face two major challenges in quantum thermometry. First, all of the existing optimally precise temperature probes are local, meaning their operation is optimal only for a narrow range of temperatures. Second, aforesaid optimal local probes mandate complex energy spectrum with immense degeneracy, rendering them impractical. Here, we address these challenges by formalizing the notion of global thermometry leading to the development of optimal temperature sensors over a wide range of temperatures. We observe the emergence of different phases for such optimal probes as the temperature interval is increased. In addition, we show how the best approximation of optimal global probes can be realized in spin chains, implementable in ion traps and quantum dots. Existing low-temperature thermometers can only perform with high precision within a narrow range. Here, the authors provide a bound for global thermometry across a wide range, including the design of optimal thermometers with the state-of-the-art quantum technologies.

TI Spin-dependent localization of spin-orbit and Rabi-coupled Bose-Einstein
   condensates in a random potential
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB We investigate the effect of the spin-orbit (SO) and Rabi couplings on the localization of the spin-1/2 condensate trapped in a one-dimensional random potential. Our studies reveal that the spin-dependent couplings create distinct localization regimes, resulting in various relations between localization and spin-related properties. First, we examine the localization in the linear condensate and find that the SO coupling can lead to a transition of the localized state from the 'basin-like' to the 'void' region of the potential. For a weak random potential upon an increase in the SO coupling, we find a re-entrant transition from a broad to narrow localized state and back at a higher SO coupling. Further, we analyze the competing role of inter-species and intra-species interactions on the localization of the condensate. We find the appearance of spin-dependent localization as the interactions increase beyond threshold values for a sufficiently strong disorder. Our findings on controlling spin-dependent localization may be useful for future ultracold atomic experiments and corresponding spin-related quantum technologies.

TI Single-Element 2D Materials beyond Graphene: Methods of Epitaxial
   Synthesis
SO NANOMATERIALS
AB Today, two-dimensional materials are one of the key research topics for scientists around the world. Interest in 2D materials is not surprising because, thanks to their remarkable mechanical, thermal, electrical, magnetic, and optical properties, they promise to revolutionize electronics. The unique properties of graphene-like 2D materials give them the potential to create completely new types of devices for functional electronics, nanophotonics, and quantum technologies. This paper considers epitaxially grown two-dimensional allotropic modifications of single elements: graphene (C) and its analogs (transgraphenes) borophene (B), aluminene (Al), gallenene (Ga), indiene (In), thallene (Tl), silicene (Si), germanene (Ge), stanene (Sn), plumbene (Pb), phosphorene (P), arsenene (As), antimonene (Sb), bismuthene (Bi), selenene (Se), and tellurene (Te). The emphasis is put on their structural parameters and technological modes in the method of molecular beam epitaxy, which ensure the production of high-quality defect-free single-element two-dimensional structures of a large area for promising device applications.

TI Cooling of Optically Levitated Particles: Principles, Implementations,
   and Applications
SO PHOTONICS
AB Optically levitated particles in high vacuum offer an exceptionally isolated mechanical platform for photonic control. Effective cooling of their center-of-mass motion is essential not only for enabling ultrasensitive precision sensing but also for opening access to the quantum regime where macroscopic superposition and nonclassical states can be realized. In this review, we present a comprehensive overview of recent advances in active feedback cooling, based on real-time photonic modulation, and passive feedback cooling, driven by optomechanical interactions within optical resonators. We highlight key experimental milestones, including ground state cooling in one and two dimensions, and discuss the emerging applications of these systems in force sensing, inertial metrology, and macroscopic quantum state preparation. Particular attention is given to novel proposals for probing quantum gravity, detecting dark matter and dark energy candidates, and exploring high-frequency gravitational waves. These advancements establish levitated optomechanical systems as a powerful platform for both high-precision metrology and the investigation of fundamental quantum phenomena. Finally, we discuss the current challenges and future prospects in cooling multiple degrees of freedom, device integration, and scalability toward future quantum technologies.

TI Radical TADF: Quartet-Derived Luminescence with Dark TEMPO
SO ADVANCED MATERIALS
AB High-spin states in organic molecules offer promising tuneability for quantum technologies. Photogenerated quartet excitons are an extensively studied platform, but their applications are limited by the absence of optical read-out via luminescence. Here, a new class of synthetically accessible molecules with quartet-derived luminescence is demonstrated, formed by appending a non-luminescent TEMPO radical to thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) chromophores previously used in OLEDs. The low singlet-triplet energy gap of the chromophore opens a luminescence channel from radical-triplet coupled states. A set of design rules is established by tuning the energetics in a series of compounds based on a naphthalimide (NAI) core. Generation of quartet states is observed and the strength of radical-triplet exchange is measured. In DMAC-TEMPO, up to 72% of detected photons emerge after reverse intersystem crossing from the quartet state repopulates the state with singlet character. This design strategy does not rely on a luminescent radical to provide an emission pathway from the high-spin state. The large library of TADF chromophores promises a greater pallet of achievable emission colours.

TI Simulation of Solvatochromic Phenomena in Xanthione Using Explicit
   Solvent Methods
SO MOLECULES
AB Xanthione is a sulfated polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon which exhibits unique anti-Kasha properties and substantial sensitivity to its medium. Due to this sensitivity however, this makes xanthione-based systems very difficult to simulate. Further, xanthione's is understood to be come more photostable in the presence of a highly polar medium, however whether these photophysical properties could be taken advantage of for certain applications remains to be seen. In clarifying long-held beliefs of specific solvent effects, we apply a rigorous theoretical solvent analysis in both implicit and explicit solvent mediums to elucidate a more complete description of solvent polarity sensitivity in xanthione using both quantum chemical and molecular dynamics techniques. Not only was it found that explicit solvation methods are vital in an accurate description of the system, only a handful of explicit solvent molecules in the simulation are required to yield an appropriate electronic description. This short work is vital to devising future applications for xanthione-based and other quantum technologies, and is an important foundation stone on this journey.

TI Room temperature nonlocal detection of charge-spin interconversion in a
   topological insulator
SO NPJ 2D MATERIALS AND APPLICATIONS
AB Topological insulators (TIs) are emerging materials for next-generation low-power nanoelectronic and spintronic device applications. TIs possess non-trivial spin-momentum locking features in the topological surface states in addition to the spin-Hall effect (SHE), and Rashba states due to high spin-orbit coupling (SOC) properties. These phenomena are vital for observing the charge-spin conversion (CSC) processes for spin-based memory, logic and quantum technologies. Although CSC has been observed in TIs by potentiometric measurements, reliable nonlocal detection has so far been limited to cryogenic temperatures up to T = 15 K. Here, we report nonlocal detection of CSC and its inverse effect in the TI compound Bi1.5Sb0.5Te1.7Se1.3 at room temperature using a van der Waals heterostructure with a graphene spin-valve device. The lateral nonlocal device design with graphene allows observation of both spin-switch and Hanle spin precession signals for generation, injection and detection of spin currents by the TI. Detailed bias- and gate-dependent measurements in different geometries prove the robustness of the CSC effects in the TI. These findings demonstrate the possibility of using topological materials to make all-electrical room-temperature spintronic devices.

TI Coherent dynamics of strongly interacting electronic spin defects in
   hexagonal boron nitride
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Optically active spin defects in van der Waals materials are promising platforms for modern quantum technologies. Here we investigate the coherent dynamics of strongly interacting ensembles of negatively charged boronvacancy (V-B(-)) centers in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) with varying defect density. By employing advanced dynamical decoupling sequences to selectively isolate different dephasing sources, we observe more than 5-fold improvement in the measured coherence times across all hBN samples. Crucially, we identify that themany-body interactionwithin the V-B(-) ensemble plays a substantial role in the coherent dynamics, which is then used to directly estimate the concentration of V-B(-). We find that at high ion implantation dosage, only a small portion of the created boron vacancy defects are in the desired negatively charged state. Finally, we investigate the spin response of V-B(-) to the local charged defects induced electric field signals, and estimate its ground state transverse electric field susceptibility. Our results provide new insights on the spin and charge properties of V-B(-), which are important for future use of defects in hBN as quantum sensors and simulators.

TI Seeded spin-mixing interferometry with long-time evolution in
   microwave-dressed sodium spinor Bose-Einstein condensates
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS B-ATOMIC MOLECULAR AND OPTICAL PHYSICS
AB We experimentally demonstrate a new type of spin-mixing interferometry in sodium Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) based on seeded initial states. Seeding is useful because it speeds up the generation of entangled pairs, allowing many collisions to take place quickly, creating large populations in the arms of the interferometer. The entangled probe states of our interferometer are generated via spin-exchange collisions in F =1 spinor BECs, where pairs of atoms with the magnetic quantum number m(F) = 0 collide and change into pairs with m(F) = +/- 1. Our results show that our seeded spin-mixing interferometer beats the standard quantum limit (SQL) with a metrological gain of 3.69 dB with spin-mixing time t = 10 ms in the case of single-sided seeding, and 3.33 dB with spin-mixing time t = 8 ms in the case of double sided seeding. The mechanism for beating the SQL is two-mode spin squeezing generated via spin-exchange collisions. Our results on spin-mixing interferometry with seeded states are useful for future quantum technologies such as quantum-enhanced microwave sensors, and quantum parametric amplifiers based on spin-mixing.

TI Enhanced Nonlinear Optical Responses in MoS2 via Femtosecond
   Laser-Induced Defect-Engineering
SO ADVANCED FUNCTIONAL MATERIALS
AB 2D materials are a promising platform for applications in many fields as they possess a plethora of useful properties that can be further optimized by careful engineering, for example, by defect introduction. While reliable high-yield defect engineering methods are in demand, most current technologies are expensive, harsh, or non-deterministic. Optical modification methods offer a cost-effective and fast mechanism to engineer the properties of 2D materials at any step of the device fabrication process. In this paper, the nonlinear optical responses of mono-, bi-, and trilayer molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) flakes are enhanced by deterministic defect-engineering with a femtosecond laser. A 50-fold enhancement in the third harmonic generation (THG) and a 3.3-fold increase in the second harmonic generation (SHG) in the optically modified areas is observed. The enhancement is attributed to resonant SHG and THG processes arising from optically introduced mid-band gap defect states. These results demonstrate a highly controllable, sub-micrometer resolution tool for enhancing the nonlinear optical responses in 2D materials, paving the way for prospective future applications in optoelectronics, quantum technologies, and energy solutions.

TI Unraveling the Contributions to Spin-Lattice Relaxation in Kramers
   Single-Molecule Magnets
SO JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY
AB The study of how spin interacts with lattice vibrations and relaxes to equilibrium provides unique insights into its chemical environment and the relation between electronic structure and molecular composition. Despite its importance for several disciplines, ranging from magnetic resonance to quantum technologies, a convincing interpretation of spin dynamics in crystals of magnetic molecules is still lacking due to the challenging experimental determination of the correct spin relaxation mechanism. We apply ab initio spin dynamics to a series of 12 coordination complexes of Co2+ and Dy3+ ions selected among similar to 240 compounds that largely cover the literature on single-molecule magnets and well represent different regimes of spin relaxation. Simulations reveal that the Orbach spin relaxation rate of known compounds mostly depends on the ions' zero-field splitting and little on the details of molecular vibrations. Raman relaxation is instead found to be also significantly affected by the features of low-energy phonons. These results provide a complete understanding of the factors limiting spin lifetime in single-molecule magnets and revisit years of experimental investigations by making it possible to transparently distinguish Orbach and Raman relaxation mechanisms.

TI Thermal resistance in superconducting flip-chip assemblies
SO APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS
AB Cryogenic microsystems that utilize different 3D integration techniques are being actively developed, e.g., for the needs of quantum technologies. 3D integration can introduce opportunities and challenges to the thermal management of low temperature devices. In this work, we investigate sub-1 K inter-chip thermal resistance of a flip-chip bonded assembly, where two silicon chips are interconnected by compression bonding via indium bumps. The total thermal contact area between the chips is 0.306mm(2), and we find that the temperature dependence of the inter-chip thermal resistance follows the power law of alpha T-3, with alpha = 7.7-15.4K(4) mu m(2)/nW. The T-3 relation indicates phononic interfacial thermal resistance, which is supported by the vanishing contribution of the electrons to the thermal conduction, due to the superconducting interconnections. Such a thermal resistance value can introduce a thermalization bottleneck in particular at cryogenic temperatures. This can be detrimental for some applications, yet it can also be harnessed. We provide an example of both cases by estimating the parasitic overheating of a cryogenic flip-chip assembly operated under various heat loads as well as simulate the performance of solidstate junction microrefrigerators utilizing the observed thermal isolation.

TI Study on the Comprehensive Optimization of Quantum Radar Stealth Based
   on the Waverider Warhead
SO AEROSPACE
AB Quantum radar is a novel detection method that combines radar and quantum technologies. It exceeds the detection threshold and poses a threat to conventional stealth targets. This work aims to derive the expression of the quantum radar cross-section of a new complex target. The calculation formula of QRCS was derived after introducing the relative photon parameters and vector dot product. Subsequently, a comprehensive optimization model of quantum stealth and lift-drag ratio based on a genetic algorithm was proposed for the waverider warhead. During the optimization process, we proposed an optimization method with the objective function of the QRCS pioneering design value and achieved better outcomes than the optimization method using the average value in terms of QRCS performance and lift-drag ratio in the important azimuths of the waverider. By changing the design variables of the waverider warhead and using this new optimization method, the QRCS of the waverider in the forward and lateral angles were minimized, remarkably improving the aerodynamic performance of the waverider. Similarly, the optimization results show that the proposed design value optimization method is feasible.

TI Single-Ion Magnets with Giant Magnetic Anisotropy and Zero-Field
   Splitting
SO ACS OMEGA
AB The design of mononuclear molecular nanomagnets exhibiting a huge energy barrier to the reversal of magnetization have seen a surge of interest during the last few decades due to their potential technological applications. More specifically, single ion magnets are peculiarly attractive by virtue of their rich quantum behavior and distinct fine structure. These are viable candidates for implementation as single-molecule high-density information storage devices and other applications in future quantum technologies. The present review presents the comprehensive state of the art in the topic of single-ion magnets possessing an eminent magnetization-reversal barrier, very slow magnetic relaxation and high blocking temperature. We turn our attention to the achievements in the synthesis of 3d and 4f single-ion magnets during the last two decades and discuss the observed magnetostructural properties underlying the anisotropy behavior and the ensuing remanence. Furthermore, we highlight the fundamental theoretical aspects to shed light on the complex behavior of these nanosized magnetic entities. In particular, we focus on key notions, such as zero-field splitting, anisotropy energy and quantum tunneling of the magnetization and their interdependence.

TI Wavefront Shaping of Scattering Forces Enhances Optical Trapping of
   Levitated Nanoparticles
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Optically-levitated nanoparticles in vacuum offer a pristine platform for high-quality mechanical oscillators, enabling a wide range of precision measurements and quantum technologies. A key performance metric in such systems is the stiffness of the optical trap, which is typically enhanced by increasing laser power-at the cost of unwanted heating, reduced coherence, and enhanced quantum backaction. Here, we demonstrate an innovative route to increasing trap stiffness: wavefront shaping of the optical field. By tailoring the spatial phase profile of the trapping beam, we significantly boost the mechanical confinement of subwavelength particles without raising the optical intensity. Remarkably, this enhancement arises from a selective reduction of non-conservative optical forces, while preserving the conservative restoring forces that define trap stiffness. As a result, mechanical nonlinearities are also reduced, improving stability at low pressures. Our findings challenge the long-standing assumption that diffraction-limited focusing is optimal for dipolar Rayleigh particles, and establish wavefront shaping as a powerful, readily applicable tool to control optomechanical forces in levitation experiments. This opens avenues for minimizing backaction, reducing thermal decoherence, and expanding the range of materials that can be stably levitated.

TI Room-temperature high-purity single-photon emission from carbon-doped
   boron nitride thin films
SO SCIENCE ADVANCES
AB Hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) has emerged as a promising platform for generating room temperature single photons exhibiting high brightness and spin-photon entanglement. However, improving emitter purity, stability, and scalability remains a challenge for quantum technologies. Here, we demonstrate highly pure and stable single-photon emitters (SPEs) in h-BN by directly growing carbon-doped, centimeter-scale h-BN thin films using the pulsed laser deposition (PLD) method. These SPEs exhibit room temperature operation with polarized emission, achieving a g((2))(0) value of 0.015, which is among the lowest reported for room temperature SPEs and the lowest achieved for h-BN SPEs. It also exhibits high brightness (similar to 0.5 million counts per second), remarkable stability during continuous operation (>15 min), and a Debye-Waller factor of 45%. First-principles calculations reveal unique carbon defects responsible for these properties, enabled by PLD's low-temperature synthesis and in situ doping. Our results demonstrate an effective method for large-scale production of high-purity, stable SPEs in h-BN, enabling robust quantum optical sources for various quantum applications.

TI Collective radiative interactions in the discrete truncated Wigner
   approximation
SO SCIPOST PHYSICS
AB Interfaces of light and matter serve as a platform for exciting many-body physics and photonic quantum technologies. Due to the recent experimental realization of atomic arrays at sub-wavelength spacings, collective interaction effects such as superradiance have regained substantial interest. Their analytical and numerical treatment is however quite challenging. Here we develop a semiclassical approach to this problem that allows to describe the coherent and dissipative many-body dynamics of interacting spins while taking into account lowest-order quantum fluctuations. For this purpose we extend the discrete truncated Wigner approximation, originally developed for unitarily coupled spins, to include collective, dissipative spin processes by means of truncated correspondence rules. This maps the dynamics of the atomic ensemble onto a set of semiclassical, numerically inexpensive stochastic differential equations. We benchmark our method with exact results for the case of Dicke decay, which shows excellent agreement. For small arrays we compare to exact simulations, again showing good agreement at early times and at moderate to strong driving, and to a second order cumulant expansion. We conclude by studying the radiative properties of a spatially extended three-dimensional, coherently driven gas and compare the coherence of the emitted light to experimental results.

TI Perspective on 2D material polaritons and innovative fabrication
   techniques
SO APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS
AB In this Perspective, we present that polariton modes hosted in two-dimensional (2D) materials can be used to increase and control light-matter interactions at the nanoscale. We analyze the optical response of the most used 2D material nanostructures that support plasmon, exciton, and phonon polariton modes. Polariton characteristic lengths are used to assess the hybrid light-matter modes of different 2D material monolayers and nanoribbons. We present that the 2D material nanodisk can act like a cavity that supports localized polariton modes, which can be excited by a nearby placed quantum system to present ultra-fast and ultra-bright operation. The key to achieve high quality 2D polariton modes is to reduce material losses. Thus, state-of-the-art exfoliation, chemical vapor deposition, and transferring techniques of 2D materials are introduced to fabricate nanostructures that fulfill the stringent requirements of applications in photonics, optoelectronics, and quantum technologies.

TI Nanodomain poling unlocking backward nonlinear light generation in thin
   film lithium niobate
SO NANOPHOTONICS
AB Nonlinear frequency conversion offers powerful capabilities for applications in telecommunications, signal processing, and computing. Thin-film lithium niobate (TFLN) has emerged as a promising integrated photonics platform due to its strong electro-optic effect and second-order nonlinearity, which can be exploited through periodic poling. However, conventional poling techniques in x-cut TFLN are constrained to minimum period sizes on the order of microns, restricting access to highly phase-mismatched interactions such as counter- and backward-propagating frequency conversion. In this work, we demonstrate scalable periodic poling of x-cut TFLN with domains periods as short as 215 nm and realize devices that support both counter- and back-propagating phase matching. We estimate conversion efficiencies of 1,474 %/W/cm2 and 45 %/W/cm2 for the two interaction types, respectively. Sum frequency generation measurements confirm that the nonlinear generation takes place in the desired direction. Furthermore, we report spontaneous parametric down conversion for the counter-propagating configuration and, for the first time, for a backward propagating device. This breakthrough provides unprecedented control over engineering of ferroelectric domain geometries in TFLN, leading into the generation of photon pairs with precisely tailored spatial and spectral characteristics. Such capabilities hold strong potential for advancing quantum signal processing, scalable quantum computing architectures, and precision quantum metrology.

TI Photon routing in disordered chiral waveguide QED ladders: interplay
   between photonic localization and collective atomic effects
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB In recent years, photon routing has garnered considerable research activity due to its key applications in quantum networking and optical communications. This paper studies the single photon routing scheme in many-emitter disordered chiral waveguide quantum electrodynamics (wQED) ladders. The wQED ladder consists of two one-dimensional lossless waveguides simultaneously and chirally coupled with a chain of dipole-dipole interacting two-level quantum emitters (QEs). In particular, we analyze how a departure from the periodic placement of the QEs due to temperature-induced position disorder can impact the routing probability. This involves analyzing how the interplay between the collective atomic effects originating from the dipole-dipole interaction and disorder in the atomic location leading to single-photon localization can change the routing probabilities. As for some key results, we find that the routing probability exhibits a considerable improvement (more than 90% value) for periodic and disordered wQED ladders when considering lattices consisting of twenty QEs. This robustness of collective effects against spontaneous emission loss and weak disorders is further confirmed by examining the routing efficiency and localization length for up to twenty QE chains. These results may find applications in quantum networking and distributed quantum computing under the realistic conditions of imperfect emitter trappings.

TI Beyond the standard model of topological Josephson junctions: From
   crystalline anisotropy to finite-size and diode effects
SO APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS
AB A planar Josephson junction is a versatile platform to realize topological superconductivity over a large parameter space and host Majorana bound states. With a change in the Zeeman field, this system undergoes a transition from trivial to topological superconductivity accompanied by a jump in the superconducting phase difference between the two superconductors. A standard model of these Josephson junctions, which can be fabricated to have a nearly perfect interfacial transparency, predicts a simple universal behavior. In that model, at the same value of Zeeman field for the topological transition, there is a pi phase jump and a minimum in the critical superconducting current, while applying a controllable phase difference yields a diamond-shaped topological region as a function of that phase difference and a Zeeman field. In contrast, even for a perfect interfacial transparency, we find a much richer and nonuniversal behavior as the width of the superconductor is varied or the Dresselhaus spin-orbit coupling is considered. The Zeeman field for the phase jump, not necessarily pi, is different from the value for the minimum critical current, while there is a strong deviation from the diamond-like topological region. These Josephson junctions show a striking example of a nonreciprocal transport and superconducting diode effect, revealing the importance of our findings not only for topological superconductivity and fault-tolerant quantum computing but also for superconducting spintronics.

TI High-speed micro-ring modulator using ferroelectric PLZT for integrated
   photonics
SO APL PHOTONICS
AB The ever-increasing demand for high-speed transmission in fiber communications is driving a requirement for advanced modulators. Large bandwidths, low power consumption, compact footprints, and minimal signal losses are all essential to achieving high-performance modulation. Recently, the remarkable potential of electro-optic modulators has been demonstrated using perovskite ferroelectric crystals that exhibit a strong Pockels effect (meaning an electro-optic coefficient >200 pm/V), such as lanthanum-modified lead zirconate titanate (PLZT). These materials enable high-speed modulation when deposited on insulating substrates as thin films. The present work fabricated a micro-ring modulator (MRM) having a small footprint (160 mu m radius) based on a PLZT film on an insulator. This device demonstrated a low V L-pi  of 0.78 V cm and a wide bandwidth of 51 GHz. In addition, 80 Gbit/s on-off keying modulation and 128 Gbit/s four-level pulse amplitude modulation were achieved with a driving voltage of 300 mV(pp). The high-performance MRM produced in this study could have applications to scalable photonic integration and a wide range of conventional optoelectronic systems and emerging quantum technologies.

TI Asymmetric Biphoton Generation under Ground-State Decoherence and Phase
   Mismatch in a Cold Atomic Ensemble
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB An experimental investigation of how ground-state decoherence and phase mismatch influence biphoton generation in double-Lambda spontaneous four-wave mixing (SFWM) within a cold atomic ensemble is presented. The results reveal significant asymmetry in the Stokes and anti-Stokes photon generation rates, arising from the distinct effects of phase mismatch and ground-state decoherence. While phase mismatch primarily drives this asymmetry under minimal decoherence, larger decoherence further amplifies it, underscoring the complex interplay between these factors. Using the coincidence count rate representation, insights are provided into pairing ratios, demonstrating that the stimulated four-wave mixing process inherent in SFWM explains the observed phenomena. Interestingly, although ground-state decoherence reduces the generation of temporally correlated photons, it paradoxically enhances biphoton purity, as confirmed through conditional autocorrelation measurements. This counterintuitive phenomenon is reported here for the first time. Furthermore, unconditional autocorrelation measurements show that the generated photons follow a thermal-state distribution, consistent with theoretical predictions. This study advances the understanding of biphoton generation dynamics and temporal photon correlations in SFWM, offering valuable insights for optimizing SFWM-based biphoton sources and their applications in quantum technologies.

TI Optical tuning of the diamond Fermi level measured by correlated
   scanning probe microscopy and quantum defect spectroscopy
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW MATERIALS
AB Quantum technologies based on quantum point defects in crystals require control over the defect charge state. Here we tune the charge state of shallow nitrogen-vacancy and silicon-vacancy centers by locally oxidizing a hydrogenated surface with moderate optical excitation and simultaneous spectral monitoring. The loss of conductivity and change in work function due to oxidation are measured in atmosphere using conductive atomic force microscopy and Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM). We correlate these scanning probe measurements with optical spectroscopy of the nitrogen-vacancy and silicon-vacancy centers created via implantation 15-25 nm beneath the diamond surface and annealing. The observed charge state of the defects as a function of optical exposure demonstrates that laser oxidation provides a way to precisely tune the Fermi level over a range of at least 2.00 eV. We also observe a significantly larger oxidation rate for implanted surfaces compared to unimplanted surfaces under ambient conditions. Combined with knowledge of the electron affinity of a surface, these results suggest KPFM is a powerful, high-spatial-resolution technique to advance surface Fermi level engineering for charge stabilization of quantum defects.

TI Terahertz Sources Based on Metrological-Grade Frequency Combs
SO LASER & PHOTONICS REVIEWS
AB Broadband metrological-grade frequency comb (FC) synthesizers with a rich number of phase locked modes are the ideal sources for quantum sensing and quantum metrology. At terahertz (THz) frequencies, electrically pumped quantum cascade lasers (QCLs) have shown quantum-limited frequency noise operation, phase/frequency absolute referencing and self-starting FC operation, albeit over a rather restricted dynamic range, governed by the nature of the quantum gain media that entangles group velocity dispersion at the different bias points. Here, a technological approach is conceived to achieve FC operation over the entire available gain bandwidth at THz frequencies. The intracavity light intensity of a multistack QCL, inherently showing a giant Kerr nonlinearity, is altered by increasing the mirror losses of its Fabry-Perot cavity through coating the back facet with an epitaxially-grown multilayer graphene film. This enables a frequency modulated THz FC showing a proliferation of emitted modes over the entire gain bandwidth and across more than 60% of its operational range, with approximate to 0.18 mW per mode optical power. The QCL FC is then experimentally characterized to assess its phase coherence, reconstructing its intensity emission profile, instantaneous frequency, and electric field, thus proving its metrological nature.

TI Microscale fiber-integrated vector magnetometer with on-tip field
   biasing using N-V  ensembles in diamond microcrystals
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB In quantum sensing of magnetic fields, ensembles of nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond offer high sensitivity, high bandwidth and outstanding spatial resolution while operating in harsh environments. Moreover, the orientation of defect centers along four crystal axes forms an intrinsic coordinate system, enabling vector magnetometry within a single diamond crystal. While most vector magnetometers rely on a known bias magnetic field for full recovery of three-dimensional (3D) field information, employing external 3D Helmholtz coils or permanent magnets results in bulky, laboratory-bound setups, impeding miniaturization of the device. Here, a novel approach is presented that utilizes a fiber-integrated microscale coil at the fiber tip to generate a localized uniaxial magnetic field. The same fiber-tip coil is used in parallel for spin control by combining dc and microwave signals in a bias tee. To implement vector magnetometry using a uniaxial bias field, the orientation of the diamond crystal is preselected and then fully characterized by rotating a static magnetic field in three planes of rotation. The measurement of vector magnetic fields in the full solid angle is demonstrated with a shot-noise-limited sensitivity of 19.4 nT/Hz1/2 and microscale spatial resolution while achieving a fiber sensor head cross section of less than 1 mm2.

TI Long Spin Relaxation Times in CVD-Grown Nanodiamonds
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB Currently, the primary applications of fluorescent nanodiamonds (FNDs) are in the area of biosensing, by using photoluminescence or spin properties of color centres, mainly represented by the nitrogen vacancy (NV) point defect. The sensitivity of NV-FNDs to external fields is, however, limited by crystallographic defects, which influence their key quantum state characteristics - the spin longitudinal (T1) and spin transversal (T2) relaxation and coherence times, respectively. This paper reports on utilizing an advanced FND growth technique consisting of heterogeneous nucleation on pre-engineered sites to create FNDs averaging around 60 nm in size, with mean longitudinal coherence times of 800 mu$\umu$s and a maximum over 1.8 ms, close to bulk theoretical values. This is a major, nearly ten-fold improvement over commercially available nanodiamonds for the same size range of 50 to 150 nm. Heavy-N doped nanodiamond shells, important for sensing events in nm proximity to the diamond surface, are fabricated and discussed in terms of re-nucleation and twinning on {111} crystal facets. The scalability issues are discussed in order to enable the production of FND volumes matching the needs of sensing applications.

TI High-Resolution, High-Contrast Optical Interface for Defect Qubits
SO ACS PHOTONICS
AB Point defects in crystals provide important building blocks for quantum applications. Since we optically address these defect qubits, having an efficient optical interface is a highly important aspect. However, conventional confocal fluorescence microscopy of high-refractive-index crystals suffers from limited photon collection efficiency and spatial resolution. Here, we demonstrate high-resolution, high-contrast imaging of defects in diamonds using microsphere-assisted confocal microscopy. A microsphere provides an excellent optical interface for point defects with a magnified virtual image that increases the spatial resolution up to lambda/5, as well as the optical signal-to-noise ratio by four times. These features enable individual optical addressing of single photons and single spins of multiple defects that are spatially unresolved in conventional confocal microscopy, with improved signal contrast. Combined with optical tweezers, this system also demonstrates the possibility of positioning or scanning the microspheres. The approach does not require any complicated fabrication or additional optical systems, but uses simple, off-the-shelf micro-optics. From these distinctive advantages of microspheres, our approach provides an efficient way to image and address closely spaced defects with much better resolution and sensitivity.

TI Double-Terminal Quenching Topology for Threefold After-Pulsing
   Reduction: Model and Experimental Validation
SO IEEE SENSORS JOURNAL
AB Single-photon avalanche diodes (SPADs) have emerged as crucial devices across a multitude of applications, ranging from fluorescence lifetime imaging (FLIM) to quantum technologies and light detection and ranging (LiDAR) systems. The increasing demand for fastening the acquisition rate of these applications has spurred significant interest in minimizing the SPAD dead time (DT) to a few nanoseconds. However, attempts to minimize its duration often exacerbate the after-pulsing (AP) phenomenon, posing a significant challenge in optimizing system performance. In this article, we propose a novel strategy to address this trade-off. We introduce a method that exploits passive or active quenching at the cathode terminal of SPADs, combined with an active quenching circuit (AQC) at the anode node. This combined approach aims at mitigating AP effects while simultaneously minimizing DT. We developed a comprehensive model and validation methodology to rigorously evaluate the effectiveness of this strategy. Finally, we demonstrate that how it is possible to achieve a strong reduction inAP compared with standard approaches.

TI Witnessing light-driven entanglement using time-resolved resonant
   inelastic X-ray scattering
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Characterizing and controlling entanglement in quantum materials is crucial for the development of next-generation quantum technologies. However, defining a quantifiable figure of merit for entanglement in macroscopic solids is theoretically and experimentally challenging. At equilibrium the presence of entanglement can be diagnosed by extracting entanglement witnesses from spectroscopic observables and a nonequilibrium extension of this method could lead to the discovery of novel dynamical phenomena. Here, we propose a systematic approach to quantify the time-dependent quantum Fisher information and entanglement depth of transient states of quantum materials with time-resolved resonant inelastic x-ray scattering. Using a quarter-filled extended Hubbard model as an example, we benchmark the efficiency of this approach and predict a light-enhanced many-body entanglement due to the proximity to a phase boundary. Our work sets the stage for experimentally witnessing and controlling entanglement in light-driven quantum materials via ultrafast spectroscopic measurements.
   Quantum Fisher information is a measure of entanglement that has been previously extracted from equilibrium spectra of quantum materials. Here the authors extend this approach to non-equilibrium systems probed by time-resolved resonant inelastic x-ray scattering measurements.

TI Wavelength dependence of nitrogen vacancy center charge cycling
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB Optically active spin qubits in wide-band-gap semiconductors exist in several charge states, though typically only specific charge states exhibit desirable spin or photonic properties. An understanding of how interconversion between different charge states occurs is important for most applications seeking to employ such defects in quantum sensing and information processing, and additionally serves as a means of testing and verifying models of the defect electronic structure. Here, we use charge-sensitive confocal imaging to study the wavelength dependence of optical carrier generation in diamonds hosting nitrogen vacancy (NV) centers, silicon vacancy (SiV) centers, and substitutional nitrogen (N). We study the generation of distinctive charge-capture patterns formed when photogenerated charge carriers are captured by photoluminescent defects, using light spanning 405-633 nm (1.96-3.06 eV). We observe distinct regimes where one- or two-photon ionization or recombination processes dominate, and a third regime where anti-Stokes mediated recombination drives weak NV charge cycling with red light. We then compare red-induced charge cycling to fast charge carrier transport between isolated single NV centers driven with green and blue light. This work reports optically mediated charge cycling processes of the NV centers, and has consequences for schemes using charge transfer to identify nonluminescent defects and photoelectric detection, where ambiguity exists as to the source of photocurrent.

TI Preparation and controllable tuning of a high-quality factor
   phonon-laser in the optomechanical microsphere cavity
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS D-APPLIED PHYSICS
AB Low-threshold, narrow linewidth phonon lasers can greatly improve the detection resolution of sensors and have enormous potential for development in classical and quantum sensing fields, as well as information processing. However, its development is limited due to unfavorable factors such as the complex process, low quality factor (Q-factor), difficult tuning, and harsh environments requirements. Here, we report an easy-to-excite phonon laser with an ultra-narrow linewidth in silica whispering gallery mode microsphere optomechanical resonators at room temperature and ambient pressure. The microsphere cavity is fabricated by high-temperature melting with a CO2 laser and designed by controlling the proportion of the sphere to the stem (sphere-to-stem ratio) to reduce mechanical damping. By using a single-frequency laser as the pump source, the microsphere optomechanical resonator exhibited multiple breathing mode phonon lasers with ultra-high optical Q-factor (1.78 x 10(9)), mechanical Q-factor (3.1 x 10(7)), and low threshold (2.4 mu W). It is the first time to achieve such a high mechanical Q-factor in the microsphere cavity system of this kind to the best of our knowledge, which opens up an avenue to develop highly sensitive sensors.

TI Efficient Fabrication of High-Density Ensembles of Color Centers via Ion
   Implantation on a Hot Diamond Substrate
SO ADVANCED PHYSICS RESEARCH
AB Nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamonds are one of the most promising systems for quantum technologies, including quantum metrology and sensing. A promising strategy for the achievement of high sensitivity to external fields relies on the exploitation of large ensembles of NV centers, whose fabrication by ion implantation is upper limited by the amount of radiation damage introduced in the diamond lattice. In this work an approach is demonstrated to increase the density of NV centers upon the high-fluence implantation of MeV N2+ ions on a hot target substrate (>550 degrees C). The results show that with respect to room-temperature implantation, the high-temperature process increases the vacancy density threshold required for the irreversible conversion of diamond to a graphitic phase, thus enabling to achieve higher density ensembles. Furthermore, the formation efficiency of color centers is investigated on diamond substrates implanted at varying temperatures with MeV N2+ and Mg+ ions revealing that the formation efficiency of both NV centers and magnesium-vacancy (MgV) centers increases with the implantation temperature.

Here, we report an SPE in hBN with an energy of 2.2444 +/- 0.0013 eV created via carbon implantation that exhibits a small inhomogeneity of the emission energy. Polarization-resolved measurements reveal aligned absorption and emission dipole orientations with a 3-fold distribution, which follows the crystal symmetry. Photoluminescence excitation (PLE) spectroscopy results show the predictability of polarization is associated with a reproducible PLE band, in contrast with the non-reproducible bands found in previous hBN SPE species. Photon correlation measurements are consistent with a three-level model with weak coupling to a shelving state. Our ab initio excited-state calculations shed light on the atomic origin of this SPE defect, which consists of a pair of substitutional carbon atoms located at boron and nitrogen sites separated by a hexagonal unit cell.

TI Quantum sensors in diamonds for magnetic resonance spectroscopy: Current
   applications and future prospects
SO APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS
AB Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and electron spin resonance (ESR) methods are indispensable techniques that utilize the spin of particles to probe matter, with applications in various disciplines, including fundamental physics, chemistry, biology, and medicine. Despite their versatility, the technique's sensitivity, particularly for NMR, is intrinsically low, which typically limits the detection of magnetic resonance (MR) signals to macroscopic sample volumes. In recent years, atom-sized magnetic field quantum sensors based on nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond paved the way to detect MR signals at the micro- and nanoscale, even down to a single spin. In this perspective, we offer an overview of the most promising directions in which this evolving technology is developing. Significant advancements are anticipated in the life sciences, including applications in single molecule and cell studies, lab-on-a-chip analytics, and the detection of radicals or ions. Similarly, NV-MR is expected to have a substantial impact on various areas in the materials research, such as surface science, catalysis, 2D materials, thin films, materials under extreme conditions, and quantum technologies.

TI Inertial measurement with solid-state spins of nitrogen-vacancy center
   in diamond
SO ADVANCES IN PHYSICS-X
AB The nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center is one of the major platforms in the evolving field of quantum technologies. The inertial surveying technology based on NV centers in diamond is a developing field with both scientific and technological importance. Inertial measurement using the solid-state spin of the NV center has demonstrated potential in both high-precision and small-volume low-cost devices. In terms of rotation measurement, the geometric phase theory has provided a perspective of the rotation measurement mechanism via the solid-state spin of the NV center. A new type of gyroscope based on the solid-state spin in diamond according to the theory has attracted considerable attention. In addition, combined with the ingenious quantum mechanics manipulation and transform mechanism, acceleration measurement can be achieved through an efficient quantum detection technology of the NV center. This review summarizes the recent research progress in diamond-based inertial measurement, including sensitivity optimization methods for inertial measurement systems based on the NV center.

TI Self-Injection Locked Frequency Conversion Laser
SO LASER & PHOTONICS REVIEWS
AB High-coherence visible and near-visible laser sources are centrally important to the operation of advanced position/navigation/timing systems as well as classical/quantum sensing systems. However, the complexity and size of these bench-top lasers are an impediment to their transition beyond the laboratory. Here, a system-on-chip that emits high-coherence near-visible lightwaves is demonstrated. The devices rely upon a new approach wherein wavelength conversion and coherence increase by self-injection locking are combined within a single nonlinear resonator. This simplified approach is demonstrated in a hybridly-integrated device and provides a short-term linewidth of around 4.7 kHz (10 kHz before filtering). On-chip converted optical power over 2 mW is also obtained. Moreover, measurements show that heterogeneous integration can result in a conversion efficiency higher than 25% with an output power over 11 mW. Because the approach uses mature III-V pump lasers in combination with thin-film lithium niobate, it can be scaled for low-cost manufacturing of high-coherence visible emitters. Also, the coherence generation process can be transferred to other frequency conversion processes, including optical parametric oscillation, sum/difference frequency generation, and third-harmonic generation.

TI Widefield quantum microscopy with nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond:
   Strengths, limitations, and prospects
SO JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS
AB A dense layer of nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers near the surface of a diamond can be interrogated in a widefield optical microscope to produce spatially resolved maps of local quantities such as magnetic field, electric field, and lattice strain, providing potentially valuable information about a sample or device placed in proximity. Since the first experimental realization of such a widefield NV microscope in 2010, the technology has seen rapid development and demonstration of applications in various areas across condensed matter physics, geoscience, and biology. This Perspective analyzes the strengths and shortcomings of widefield NV microscopy in order to identify the most promising applications and guide future development. We begin with a brief review of quantum sensing with ensembles of NV centers and the experimental implementation of widefield NV microscopy. We then compare this technology to alternative microscopy techniques commonly employed to probe magnetic materials and charge flow distributions. Current limitations in spatial resolution, measurement accuracy, magnetic sensitivity, operating conditions, and ease of use are discussed. Finally, we identify the technological advances that solve the aforementioned limitations and argue that their implementation would result in a practical, accessible, high-throughput widefield NV microscope.

TI Organic Diradicals Bridged by Inverted Singlet-Triplet Units for
   Optical-Spin Interfaces
SO JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL THEORY AND COMPUTATION
AB Molecular platforms for optically addressable spin states are emerging as fascinating alternatives to solid-state spin centers, offering scalable synthesis, structural tunability, and chemical versatility. Here, we present a molecular design strategy for achieving photoinduced spin polarization in organic diradicals bridged by systems featuring an inverted singlet-triplet (InveST) energy gap. These InveST units possess HOMO and LUMO orbitals localized on complementary atomic sites. By covalently linking the non-SOMO-bearing positions of alternant hydrocarbon radicals to the LUMO-localized atoms of the InveST bridge, we construct diradicals in which the radical centers remain electronically decoupled in the ground state, yielding degenerate singlet and triplet configurations. Upon photoexcitation, the population of the InveST LUMO activates an excited-state exchange interaction between the radicals, generating a finite singlet-triplet gap and enabling spin-selective intersystem crossing to polarized triplet states. Using a combination of model Hamiltonians and multireference ab initio calculations, we establish design principles for tuning exchange interactions and spin-orbit coupling to achieve molecular-level control over optical-spin interfaces. The resulting InveST-bridged diradicals have emerged as promising scaffolds for molecular quantum technologies.

TI Enhancing polarization transfer from nitrogen-vacancy centers to
   external nuclear spins via dangling bond mediators
SO COMMUNICATIONS PHYSICS
AB The use of nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond as a non-invasive platform for hyperpolarizing nuclear spins in molecular samples is a promising area of research with the potential to enhance the sensitivity of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) experiments. Transferring NV polarization out of the diamond structure has been achieved on nanoscale targets using dynamical nuclear polarization methods, but extending this polarization transfer to relevant NMR volumes poses significant challenges. One major technical hurdle is the presence of paramagnetic defects in the diamond surface which interfere with polarization outflow. However, these defects can be harnessed as intermediaries for the interaction between NVs and nuclear spins. We present a method that benefits from existing microwave sequences, namely the PulsePol, to transfer polarization efficiently and robustly using dangling bonds or other localized electronic spins, with the potential to increase polarization rates under realistic conditions.
   The use of nitrogen vacancy (NV) centers in diamond is a powerful approach for quantum sensing and can enhance the sensitivity of other techniques such as nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). Here, the authors present a dynamic nuclear polarization technique, which enhances the efficiency of polarisation transfer from the NV centre at volumes suitable for NMR without being disrupted by other defects within the diamond.

TI A Return to Niels Bohr's "Light and Life" (1932)
SO BIOLOGICAL THEORY
AB In August of 1932, quantum physicist Niels Bohr (1885-1962) delivered to the Second International Congress on Light Therapy meeting in Copenhagen his most extended treatment to that date concerning his reflections on the relevance of the new quantum mechanics for biological questions. Developing this against the backdrop of the "mechanism-vitalism" debate, he sketched out how he envisioned the relations of the new physics with classical issues of function, purpose, and teleology in biology. His address, republished here in its earliest English version, was also given in the context of his ongoing discussions of the relations of physics and biology with the German theoretical quantum physicist Ernst Pascual Jordan (1902-1980). Jordan's subsequent interpretation of Bohr's arguments resulted in considerable controversy and a long-term misunderstanding of Bohr's main points. This contribution gives a detailed summary of this historical discussion and the controversies that surrounded Bohr's arguments. It also examines Bohr's final statements on the relations of physics and biology in the period before his death in November of 1962. A closing discussion considers the relevance of Bohr's insights for contemporary discussions of biological reductionism and the place of the human knower in the scientific process. This is followed by the transcription of the rare 1932 text.

TI Near infrared quantum ghost spectroscopy for threats detection
SO EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL PLUS
AB Quantum sensing is a rapidly growing branch of research within the area of quantum science and technology offering key resources, beyond classical ones, with potential for commercialization of novel (quantum) sensors. The exploitation of quantum resources offered by photons can boost the performance of quantum sensors for innovative and challenging applications. In this paper, we build on the idea that quantum ghost spectroscopy (QGS), i.e. the counterpart in the frequency domain of quantum ghost imaging (QGI), can target specific applications in the detection of possible threats. This is implemented by exploiting the opportunities offered by quantum optics, i.e. the generation of photon pairs characterized by spectral correlations. We will discuss our main results obtained with pure QGS experiments showing that it is possible to assess the presence of a target dealing with a low resources measurement. The time-frequency domain reveals a huge potential for several applications, and frequency correlations represent a versatile tool that can be exploited to enable the spectral analysis of objects where a direct measurement would not be feasible (e.g. due to security). The use of non-degenerate sources of correlated photons allowed to reveal spectral features in the near-infrared wavelengths employing the usual detectors for the visible region, showing the effectiveness of this technique.

TI The Role of Auxiliary Stages in Gaussian Quantum Metrology
SO PHOTONICS
AB The optimization of the passive and linear networks employed in quantum metrology, the field that studies and devises quantum estimation strategies to overcome the levels of precision achievable via classical means, appears to be an essential step in certain metrological protocols achieving the ultimate Heisenberg-scaling sensitivity. This optimization is generally performed by adding degrees of freedom by means of auxiliary stages, to optimize the probe before or after the interferometric evolution, and the choice of these stages ultimately determines the possibility to achieve a quantum enhancement. In this work we review the role of the auxiliary stages and of the extra degrees of freedom in estimation schemes, achieving the ultimate Heisenberg limit, which employ a squeezed-vacuum state and homodyne detection. We see that, after the optimization for the quantum enhancement has been performed, the extra degrees of freedom have a minor impact on the precision achieved by the setup, which remains essentially unaffected for networks with a larger number of channels. These degrees of freedom can thus be employed to manipulate how the information about the structure of the network is encoded into the probe, allowing us to perform quantum-enhanced estimations of linear and non-linear functions of independent parameters.

TI Adaptive quantum estimation and optimal control method for SERF
   gyroscope
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB The accuracy of quantum state estimation and dynamic signal tracking is crucial for the reliability and performance of quantum sensing instruments such as spin-exchange relaxation-free (SERF) co-magnetometers and gyroscopes. To improve the performance of the SERF gyroscope for future quantum navigation applications, an adaptive quantum estimation and closed-loop optimal control method based on fault detection and isolation (FDI) and an adaptive Kalman filter is proposed. Firstly, the system model of the SERF gyroscope is established, and a real-time angular velocity measurement method is provided. Then, the stochastic model of the SERF gyroscope is analyzed based on an adaptive quantum Kalman observer to track and compensate for real-time angular velocity error with the assistance of FDI. Finally, the real-time LQI (Linear-Quadratic-Integral) control method is adopted to improve the dynamic response and accuracy of the overall system. Simulations and experiments are conducted based on the SERF gyroscope platform. The results show that the system can achieve optimal tracking accuracy for polarization estimation and effectively isolate fault information. The dynamic response time has been improved by 58.2% under environmental disturbance, which provides a foundation for subsequent navigation applications.

TI Diamond-defect engineering of NV-centers using ion beam irradiation
SO DIAMOND AND RELATED MATERIALS
AB The interplay between ion beam modification techniques in the MeV range and the controlled generation of negatively charged nitrogen-vacancy (NV-) centers in nitrogen-doped synthetic diamond crystals is explored. An experimental approach employing both light (H+) and heavy (Br+6) ions was followed to assess their respective impacts on the creation of NV-centers, using different ion energies or fluences to generate varying amounts of vacancies. Photoluminescence spectroscopy was applied to characterize NV- and neutral NV0 centers. Initially, no NV centers were detected post-irradiation, despite the presence of substitutional nitrogen and vacancies. However, after annealing at 800 degrees C (and in some cases at 900 degrees C), most samples exhibited a high density of NV0 and especially NV- centers. This demonstrates that thermal treatment is essential for vacancy-nitrogen recombination and NV- formation, often through electron capture from nearby nitrogen atoms. Notably, we achieved high NV- densities without graphitization, which is essential for preserving the material's properties for quantum applications. This study underscores and quantifies the effectiveness of MeV-range ions in controlling vacancy distributions and highlights their potential for optimizing NV- center formation to enhance the sensitivity of diamond-based quantum magnetic sensors.

TI Fabrication of tips for scanning probe magnetometry by diamond growth
SO MATERIALS FOR QUANTUM TECHNOLOGY
AB The use of quantum sensors is promising detailed insights into physical phenomena such as magnetism or superconductivity. One example of such quantum sensors is a microscopic diamond tip containing nitrogen vacancy (NV) centers, which is capable of producing correlated measurements of vectorial magnetic fields and the sample topography on the nanoscale. In this study, we present a chemical vapor deposition (CVD) process to produce diamond tips with NV centers by overgrowing microstructured diamond substrates. The resulting diamond tips exhibit a radius of curvature of approximately 10 nm, suitable for use as a probe in an atomic force microscope. The magnetic sensitivity of the CVD-grown diamond tips is characterized with pulsed measurements of the optically detected magnetic resonance, which yield a minimum magnetic sensitivity of 60 mu T Hz-1 . The growth of the diamond microstructures is observed to differ from the commonly used geometric model predicting CVD growth of bulk diamond crystals. We identify an empirical model for the growth behavior of the microstructures by taking into account processes described in the step flow growth model for crystals. Additionally, we demonstrate the applicability of the developed CVD growth process to membrane substrates required for the preparation of magnetometry-capable diamond tips.

TI Light-driven plasmonic microrobot for nanoparticle manipulation
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Recently light-driven microdrones have been demonstrated, making use of plasmonic nanomotors based on directional resonant chiral light scattering. These nanomotors can be addressed individually, without requiring the tracking of a focused laser, leading to exceptional 2D maneuverability which renders microdrones a versatile robotic platform in aqueous environments. Here, we incorporate a light-operated manipulator, a plasmonic nano-tweezer, into the microdrone platform, rendering it a microrobot by enabling precise, all-optical transport and delivery of single nanoparticles suspended in solution. The plasmonic nano-tweezer consists of a resonant cross-antenna nanostructure exhibiting a central near-field hot spot, extending the ability of traditional optical tweezers based on focused laser beams to the trapping of nanoparticles. However, most of plasmonic nano-tweezers are fixed to the substrates and lack mobility. Our plasmonic microrobot utilizes circularly polarized light to control both motors and for stable trapping of a 70-nanometer fluorescent nanodiamond in the cross-antenna center. Complex sequences of microrobot operations, including trap-transport-release-trap-transport actions, demonstrate the microrobot's versatility and precision in picking up and releasing nanoparticles. Our microrobot design opens potential avenues in advancing nanotechnology and life sciences, with applications in targeted drug delivery, single-cell manipulation, and by providing an advanced quantum sensing platform, facilitating interdisciplinary research at the nanoscale.

TI Topological Properties of Bilayer α-T3 Lattice Induced by
   Polarized Light
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB Tthe topological properties of photon-dressed energy bands are investigated in bilayer alpha-T-3 lattices under off-resonant circularly polarized light, focusing on aligned and cyclic stacking configurations. Analytical expressions for quasi-energy bands are derived for aligned stacking, while numerical results address cyclic stacking at Dirac points. Circularly polarized light breaks the time-reversal symmetry, lifting the degeneracies at the intersections ta,c, leading to the appearance of a Haldane-type Chern insulator in the absence of a magnetic field. At alpha = 1/root 2, orbital magnetic moments of corrugated and flat bands exhibit opposite signs, as do their Berry curvatures. For 0 < alpha < 1, light-induced band deformations near Dirac points create gaps in the quasi-energy spectrum, where the chemical potential modulates orbital magnetization. Linear magnetization variations align with Chern numbers, yielding quantized anomalous Hall conductivity across stacking types. Notable particle-hole symmetry breaking within 0 < alpha < 1 suggests applications in valley caloritronics and quantum sensing. At alpha = 1, flat and corrugated bands remain undistorted; while the flat band contributes no Berry curvature, it produces a finite negative orbital magnetic moment, contrasting with the positive moment of the corrugated band.

TI Dynamical phase-field model of cavity electromagnonic systems
SO NPJ COMPUTATIONAL MATERIALS
AB Cavity electromagnonic system, which simultaneously consists of cavities for photons, magnons (quanta of spin waves), and acoustic phonons, provides an exciting platform to achieve coherent energy transduction among different physical systems down to single quantum level. Here we report a dynamical phase-field model that allows simulating the coupled dynamics of the electromagnetic waves, magnetization, and strain in 3D multiphase systems. As examples of application, we computationally demonstrate the excitation of hybrid magnon-photon modes (magnon polaritons), Floquet-induced magnonic Aulter-Townes splitting, dynamical energy exchange (Rabi oscillation) and relative phase control (Ramsey interference) between the two magnon polariton modes. The simulation results are consistent with analytical calculations based on Floquet Hamiltonian theory. Simulations are also performed to design a cavity electro-magno-mechanical system that enables the triple phonon-magnon-photon resonance, where the resonant excitation of a chiral, fundamental (n = 1) transverse acoustic phonon mode by magnon polaritons is demonstrated. With the capability to predict coupling strength, dissipation rates, and temporal evolution of photon/magnon/phonon mode profiles using fundamental materials parameters as the inputs, the present dynamical phase-field model represents a valuable computational tool to guide the fabrication of the cavity electromagnonic system and the design of operating conditions for applications in quantum sensing, transduction, and communication.

TI Fabrication of high-density nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center-enriched
   diamond particles through methyl trityl amine (C20H19N) seeding
SO DIAMOND AND RELATED MATERIALS
AB Diamond particles (DPs) show promise for advanced applications in bioimaging and quantum sensing due to the presence of defect centers. This work reports a unique growth process for diamond particles composed of nitrogen-vacancy centers (NV-DPs) using a methyl trityl amine (C20H19N) diamondoid seed, which acts as a nitrogen source for NV creation. Growth was performed via microwave plasma-assisted chemical vapor deposition in a CH4/H-2 plasma. Tantalum plates were chosen as the substrate to facilitate the release of the NV-rich DPs after growth. Raman spectra of NV-DPs grown at 550 degrees C showed a sharp, intense peak at similar to 1334 cm(-1), while those grown at 750 degrees C exhibited a broader, high intensity peak at 1336 cm(-1). Photoluminescence revealed the formation of high-density NV centers, with the highest intensity for NV-DPs grown at 750 degrees C and 20 Torr. Optically detected magnetic resonance confirmed the presence of NV centers, especially for DPs grown at 750 degrees C. This seeding process enables precise nitrogen incorporation into diamond crystals to generate required spin properties by growing high-quality, well-faceted NV-DPs with customizable NV densities.

TI Preparations and applications of single color centers in the diamond
SO ADVANCES IN PHYSICS-X
AB As a non-classical light source, single-photon source plays an essential role in the foundation of quantum physics and has been attracting a lot of attention of researchers over the world. Up to now, among different kinds of single-photon sources, single color centers in the diamond are very outstanding for the stable emission at room temperature as well as the spin controllability at ambient environment. Those color centers in the diamond with excellent properties are usually formed by impurity atoms and lattice vacancies. Nowadays, complex environments are necessary to the preparation of color centers generally. This restricts the research and applications of those color centers to a certain extent. Therefore, to develop efficient and high-precision fabrication methods of single color centers in the diamond at ambient environment is a need. On this condition, femtosecond (fs) laser process, a mature micro-nano processing technology, have been demonstrated to be a feasible, efficient, and fast production of the color centers in the diamond. This review discusses the state of the art in the preparation of single color centers in the diamond and their applications in different areas.

TI Fate of Quantum Many-Body Scars in the Presence of Disorder
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Experiments performed on strongly interacting Rydberg atoms have revealed surprising persistent oscillations of local observables. These oscillations have been attributed to a special set of nonergodic states, referred to as quantum many-body scars. Although these states have enriched our understanding of thermalization in quantum systems, their interplay with disorder in realistic quantum simulators has remained unclear. We address this question by studying numerically and analytically the magnetization and spatiotemporal correlators of a scar model of disordered and interacting qubits that can be realized in present-day simulators. While the oscillation amplitudes of these observables decay with time as the disorder strength is increased, their oscillation frequency remains remarkably constant. This stability stems from resonances of the disordered spectrum in the overlap with the clean scar eigenstates that are approximately centered at the same scar energies of the clean system. We also find that multiple additional sets of scar resonances become accessible due to the presence of disorder and further enhance the oscillation amplitudes. Our results show the robustness of nonergodic dynamics in scar systems, and opens the door to understanding their behavior in near-term quantum devices and potentially using them as a resource in quantum-sensing protocols to calibrate quantum hardware.

SO ANTIBODIES
AB Considering the COVID-19 pandemic, this research aims to investigate some herbs as probable therapies for this disease. Achillea millefolium (Yarrow), Alkanet, Rumex patientia (Patience dock), Dill, Tarragon, and sweet fennel, including some principal chemical compounds of achillin, alkannin, cuminaldehyde, dillapiole, estragole, and fenchone have been selected. The possible roles of these medicinal plants in COVID-19 treatment have been investigated through quantum sensing methods. The formation of hydrogen bonding between the principal substances selected in anti-COVID natural drugs and Tyr-Met-His (the database amino acids fragment), as the active area of the COVID protein, has been evaluated. The physical and chemical attributes of nuclear magnetic resonance, vibrational frequency, the highest occupied molecular orbital energy and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital energy, partial charges, and spin density have been investigated using the DFT/TD-DFT method and 6-311+G (2d,p) basis set by the Gaussian 16 revision C.01 program toward the industry of drug design. This research has exhibited that there is relative agreement among the results that these medicinal plants could be efficient against COVID-19 symptoms.

TI Micro-photoluminescence spectroscopy of detonation nanodiamonds
   containing germanium-vacancy centres
SO NANOSCALE ADVANCES
AB A germanium-vacancy (GeV) centre in nanodiamond is a promising candidate for bright single-photon emitters, fluorescence labelling and quantum sensing due to its narrow zero-phonon line (ZPL) and large Debye-Waller factor. Recently, the GeV centre-containing nanodiamond (GeV-ND) was fabricated by a detonation process, which provides a scalable method capable of producing large quantities of ND particles. However, the optical properties of the GeV-ND at the single-particle level have not been well studied. In this study, we conducted spatially resolved photoluminescence (PL) mapping on sparsely distributed GeV-ND particles to examine luminescence characteristics across individual particles. The GeV-ND exhibited a narrow ZPL accompanied with a broad emission band. By comparing with well-characterized PL spectra of nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centres in detonation NDs reported in previous single-particle-level studies for magnetometry sensing applications, we attribute the broad background to luminescence from the NV centres coexisting with the GeV centres in NDs. By subtracting this background, we identified the pure GeV emission. Some GeV-NDs showed ZPL linewidths as narrow as 28 meV at room temperature, suggesting the presence of optically promising GeV centres. These findings clarify the origins of PL observed in GeV-NDs and demonstrate their potential as scalable quantum emitters.

TI Imaging the Meissner effect in hydride superconductors using quantum
   sensors
SO NATURE
AB By directly altering microscopic interactions, pressure provides a powerful tuning knob for the exploration of condensed phases and geophysical phenomena(1). The megabar regime represents an interesting frontier, in which recent discoveries include high-temperature superconductors, as well as structural and valence phase transitions(2-6). However, at such high pressures, many conventional measurement techniques fail. Here we demonstrate the ability to perform local magnetometry inside a diamond anvil cell with sub-micron spatial resolution at megabar pressures. Our approach uses a shallow layer of nitrogen-vacancy colour centres implanted directly within the anvil(7-9); crucially, we choose a crystal cut compatible with the intrinsic symmetries of the nitrogen-vacancy centre to enable functionality at megabar pressures. We apply our technique to characterize a recently discovered hydride superconductor, CeH9 (ref.(10)). By performing simultaneous magnetometry and electrical transport measurements, we observe the dual signatures of superconductivity: diamagnetism characteristic of the Meissner effect and a sharp drop of the resistance to near zero. By locally mapping both the diamagnetic response and flux trapping, we directly image the geometry of superconducting regions, showing marked inhomogeneities at the micron scale. Our work brings quantum sensing to the megabar frontier and enables the closed-loop optimization of superhydride materials synthesis.

TI Circuit-theoretic phenomenological model of an electrostatic
   gate-controlled bi-SQUID
SO SUPERCONDUCTOR SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY
AB A numerical model based on a lumped circuit element approximation for a bi-superconducting quantum interference device (bi-SQUID) operating in the presence of an external magnetic field is presented in this paper. Included in the model is the novel ability to capture the resultant behaviour of the device when a strong electric field is applied to its Josephson junctions by utilising gate electrodes. The model is used to simulate an all-metallic SNS (Al-Cu-Al) bi-SQUID, where good agreement is observed between the simulated results and the experimental data. The results discussed in this work suggest that the primary consequences of the superconducting field effect induced by the gating of the Josephson junctions are accounted for in our minimal model; namely, the suppression of the junctions super-current. Although based on a simplified semi-empirical model, our results may guide the search for a microscopic origin of this effect by providing a means to model the voltage response of gated SQUIDs. Also, the possible applications of this effect regarding the operation of SQUIDs as ultra-high precision sensors, where the performance of such devices can be improved via careful tuning of the applied gate voltages, are discussed at the end of the paper.

TI Coincidence measurements of two quantum-correlated photon pairs widely
   separated in the frequency domain
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Quantum correlation is a key concept characterizing the properties of quantum light sources and is important for developing quantum applications with superior performance. In particular, it enables photon pairs that are widely separated in the frequency domain, one in the visible region, the other in the infrared region, to be used for quantum infrared sensing without direct detection of infrared photons. Here, simultaneous multiwavelength and broadband phase matching in a nonlinear crystal could provide versatile photon-pairs source for broadband infrared quantum sensing. This paper describes direct generation and detection of two quantum-correlated photon pairs produced via simultaneous phase-matched processes in periodic crystals. These simultaneous photon pairs provide a correlated state with two frequency modes in a single pass. To confirm the correlation, we constructed an infrared-photon counting system with two repetition-synchronized fiber lasers. We performed coincidence measurements between two pairs, 980 nm and 3810 nm, and 1013 nm and 3390 nm, which yielded coincidence-to-accidental ratios of 6.2 and 6.5, respectively. We believe that our novel correlated light source with two separate pairs in the visible and infrared region complements a wide-range of multi-dimensional quantum infrared processing applications.

TI Sensitivity enhancement of nonlinear refractive index measurement by
   Gaussian-Bessel beam assisted z-scan method
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Characterizing the nonlinear optical properties of numerous materials plays a prerequisite role in nonlinear imaging and quantum sensing. Here, we present the evaluation of the nonlinear optical properties of Rb vapor by the Gaussian-Bessel beam assisted z-scan method. Owed to the concentrated energy in the central waist spot and the constant intensity of the beam distribution, the Gaussian-Bessel beam enables enhanced sensitivity for nonlinear refractive index measurement. The nonlinear self-focusing and self-defocusing effects of the Rb vapor are illustrated in the case of blue and red frequency detunings from 5S(1/2) - 5P(3/2) transition, respectively. The complete images of the evolution of nonlinear optical properties with laser power and frequency detuning are acquired. Furthermore, the nonlinear refractive index n(2) with a large scale of 10(-6) cm(2)/W is determined from the measured transmittance peak-to-valley difference of z-scan curves, which is enhanced by a factor of similar to 1.73 compared to the result of a equivalent Gaussian beam. Our research provides an effective method for measuring nonlinear refractive index, which will considerably enrich the application range of nonlinear material.

TI Diamond nanoneedles for biosensing
SO NANOTECHNOLOGY
AB Nanoparticles and nanomaterials are revolutionizing medicine by offering diverse tools for diagnosis and therapy, including devices, contrast agents, drug delivery systems, adjuvants, therapeutics, and theragnostic agents. Realizing full applied potential requires a deep understanding of the interactions of nano dimensional objects with biological cells. In this study, we investigate interaction of single-crystal diamond nanoneedles (SCDNNs) containing silicon vacancy (SiV-) color centers with biological substances. Four batches of the diamond needles with sizes ranging between 200 nm and 1300 nm and their water suspensions were used in these studies. The human lung fibroblast cells were used for the proof-of-concept demonstration. Employing micro-photoluminescence (PL) mapping, confocal microscopy, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) viability tests, we evaluated the cellular response to the SCDNNs. Intriguingly, our investigation with PL spectroscopy revealed that the cells and SCDNNs can coexist together with approved efficient registration of SiV- centers presence. Notably, LDH release remained minimal in cells exposed to optimally sized SCDNNs, suggesting a small number of lysed cells, and indicating non-cytotoxicity in concentrations of 2-32 mu g ml-1. The evidence obtained highlights the potential of SCDNNs for extra- or/and intracellular drug delivery when the surface of the needle is modified.

TI Magnetic ordering through itinerant ferromagnetism in a metal-organic
   framework
SO NATURE CHEMISTRY
AB The development of metal-organic magnets that combine tunable magnetic properties with other desirable physical properties remains challenging despite numerous potential applications. Now, a mixed-valent chromium-triazolate material has been prepared that exhibits itinerant ferromagnetism with a magnetic ordering temperature of 225 K, a high conductivity and large negative magnetoresistance (23%).
   Materials that combine magnetic order with other desirable physical attributes could find transformative applications in spintronics, quantum sensing, low-density magnets and gas separations. Among potential multifunctional magnetic materials, metal-organic frameworks, in particular, bear structures that offer intrinsic porosity, vast chemical and structural programmability, and the tunability of electronic properties. Nevertheless, magnetic order within metal-organic frameworks has generally been limited to low temperatures, owing largely to challenges in creating a strong magnetic exchange. Here we employ the phenomenon of itinerant ferromagnetism to realize magnetic ordering at T-C = 225 K in a mixed-valence chromium(ii/iii) triazolate compound, which represents the highest ferromagnetic ordering temperature yet observed in a metal-organic framework. The itinerant ferromagnetism proceeds through a double-exchange mechanism, which results in a barrierless charge transport below the Curie temperature and a large negative magnetoresistance of 23% at 5 K. These observations suggest applications for double-exchange-based coordination solids in the emergent fields of magnetoelectrics and spintronics.

TI Environmental risks: viruses. The border between classical and quantum
SO ANALES DE GEOGRAFIA DE LA UNIVERSIDAD COMPLUTENSE
AB Viruses are almost-species that need a host in order to replicate their own RNA and survive. They parasitize all kinds of species; in some cases, they do not cause any damage to the host, and on the other hand, in other cases they can cause their death, even indirectly by the damage they end up causing to the immune system. They live in a world that is on the threshold of the classical and the quantum. They can live in a vacuum and without oxygen, but they need the conditions found in our proper world in order to be able to evolve, mutate and survive. Their way of life makes them governed by quantum physics, within the quantum world in which they live. This article seeks to find that threshold, and thus better understand what we are facing, and whether the current state of the arts is the right one to provide a satisfactory solution. The cells of living beings have evolved to eject this threat, on many occasions they succumb, and outside help is needed through appropriate prophylaxis in each case. The unstoppable deterioration of the ecosystems around us, mainly due to the imbalance we have introduced in them, makes it easier for viruses to pass from species to species, since the natural hosts, which reduce the viral load, have often disappeared.

TI The Luminescence Hypothesis of Olfaction
SO SENSORS
AB A new hypothesis for the mechanism of olfaction is presented. It begins with an odorant molecule binding to an olfactory receptor. This is followed by the quantum biology event of inelastic electron tunneling as has been suggested with both the vibration and swipe card theories. It is novel in that it is not concerned with the possible effects of the tunneled electrons as has been discussed with the previous theories. Instead, the high energy state of the odorant molecule in the receptor following inelastic electron tunneling is considered. The hypothesis is that, as the high energy state decays, there is fluorescence luminescence with radiative emission of multiple photons. These photons pass through the supporting sustentacular cells and activate a set of olfactory neurons in near-simultaneous timing, which provides the temporal basis for the brain to interpret the required complex combinatorial coding as an odor. The Luminescence Hypothesis of Olfaction is the first to present the necessity of or mechanism for a 1:3 correspondence of odorant molecule to olfactory nerve activations. The mechanism provides for a consistent and reproducible time-based activation of sets of olfactory nerves correlated to an odor. The hypothesis has a biological precedent: an energy feasibility assessment is included, explaining the anosmia seen with COVID-19, and can be confirmed with existing laboratory techniques.

TI Spatiotemporal Multiplexed Rydberg Receiver
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM ENGINEERING
AB Rydberg states of alkali atoms, where the outer valence electron is excited to high principal quantum numbers, have large electric dipole moments allowing them to be used as sensitive, wideband, electric field sensors. These sensors use electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) to measure incident electric fields. The characteristic timescale necessary to establish EIT determines the effective speed at which the atoms respond to time-varying radio frequency (RF) radiation. Previous studies have predicted that this EIT relaxation rate causes a performance rolloff in EIT-based sensors beginning at an RF data symbol rate of less than 10 MHz. Here, we propose an architecture for increasing the response speed of Rydberg sensors to greater than 100 MHz, through spatiotemporal multiplexing (STM) of the probe laser. We present experimental results validating the architecture's temporal multiplexing component using a pulsed laser. We benchmark a numerical model of the sensor to these experimental data and use the model to predict the STM sensor's performance as an RF communications receiver. For an on-off keyed waveform, we use the numerical model to predict bit error ratios as a function of RF power and data rates demonstrating the feasibility of error-free communications up to 100 Mb/s with an STM Rydberg sensor.

TI Quantum magnetic imaging of iron organelles within the pigeon cochlea
SO PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF
   AMERICA
AB The ability of pigeons to sense geomagnetic fields has been conclusively established despite a notable lack of determination of the underlying biophysical mechanisms. Quasi-spherical iron organelles previously termed "cuticulosomes" in the cochlea of pigeons have potential relevance to magnetoreception due to their location and iron composition; however, data regarding the magnetic susceptibility of these structures are currently limited. Here quantum magnetic imaging techniques are applied to characterize the magnetic properties of individual iron cuticulosomes in situ. The stray magnetic fields emanating from cuticulosomes are mapped and compared to a detailed analytical model to provide an estimate of the magnetic susceptibility of the individual particles. The images reveal the presence of superparamagnetic and ferrimagnetic domains within individual cuticulosomes and magnetic susceptibilities within the range 0.029 to 0.22. These results provide insights into the elusive physiological roles of cuticulosomes. The susceptibilities measured are not consistent with a torque-based model of magnetoreception, placing iron storage and stereocilia stabilization as the two leading putative cuticulosome functions. This work establishes quantum magnetic imaging as an important tool to complement the existing array of techniques used to screen for potential magnetic particle-based magnetoreceptor candidates.

TI Imaging Spin-Wave Damping Underneath Metals Using Electron Spins in
   Diamond
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB Spin waves in magnetic insulators are low-damping signal carriers that can enable a new generation of spintronic devices. The excitation, control, and detection of spin waves by metal electrodes is crucial for interfacing these devices to electrical circuits. As such, it is important to understand metal-induced damping of spin-wave transport, but characterizing this process requires access to the underlying magnetic films. Here it is shown that electronic sensor spins in diamond enable imaging of spin waves that propagate underneath metals in magnetic insulators. This capability is then used to reveal a 100-fold metal-induced increase in spin-wave damping. The damping enhancement is attributed to spin-wave-induced electrical currents as well as, above a certain frequency, three-magnon scattering processes. This interpretation is supported by deriving expressions for the current-induced damping and the three-magnon threshold from the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation that agree well with the observations. The detection of buried scattering centers further highlights the technique's power for assessing spintronic device quality. These results open new avenues for studying metal - spin-wave interactions and provide access to interfacial processes such as spin-wave injection via the spin-Hall effect.

TI Energy-Constrained LOCC-Assisted Quantum Capacity of the Bosonic
   Dephasing Channel
SO ENTROPY
AB We study the LOCC-assisted quantum capacity of a bosonic dephasing channel with energy constraint on the input states. We start our analysis by focusing on the energy-constrained squashed entanglement of the channel, which is an upper bound for the energy-constrained LOCC-assisted quantum capacity. As computing energy-constrained squashed entanglement of the channel is challenging due to a double optimization (over the set of density matrices and the isometric extensions of a squashing channel), we first derive an upper bound for it, and then, we discuss how tight that bound is for the energy-constrained LOCC-assisted quantum capacity of the bosonic dephasing channel. In doling so, we prove that the optimal input state is diagonal in the Fock basis. Then, we analyze two explicit examples of squashing channels through which we derive explicit upper and lower bounds for the energy-constrained LOCC-assisted quantum capacity of the bosonic dephasing channel in terms of its quantum capacity with different noise parameters. As the difference between upper and lower bounds becomes smaller by increasing the dephasing parameter, the bounds become tighter.

TI An Open Question: Is Non-Ionizing Radiation a Tool for Controlling
   Apoptosis-Induced Proliferation?
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR SCIENCES
AB Non-ionizing radiation is commonly used in the clinical setting, despite its known ability to trigger oxidative stress and apoptosis, which can lead to damage and cell death. Although induction of cell death is typically considered harmful, apoptosis can also be beneficial in the right context. For example, cell death can serve as the signal for new tissue growth, such as in apoptosis-induced proliferation. Recent data has shown that exposure to non-ionizing radiation (such as weak static magnetic fields, weak radiofrequency magnetic fields, and weak electromagnetic fields) is able to modulate proliferation, both in cell culture and in living organisms (for example during tissue regeneration). This occurs via in vivo changes in the levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which are canonical activators of apoptosis. This review will describe the literature that highlights the tantalizing possibility that non-ionizing radiation could be used to manipulate apoptosis-induced proliferation to either promote growth (for regenerative medicine) or inhibit it (for cancer therapies). However, as uncontrolled growth can lead to tumorigenesis, much more research into this exciting and developing area is needed in order to realize its promise.

TI Polarization control of above-threshold ionization spectrum in
   elliptically polarized two-color laser fields
SO CHINESE PHYSICS B
AB We study the above-threshold ionization (ATI) process of atoms exposed to fundamental and high-frequency lasers with arbitrary ellipticity by applying the frequency-domain theory. It is found that the angular-resolved ATI spectrum is sensitive to ellipticities of two lasers and emitted angles of the photoelectron. Particularly for the photon energy of the high-frequency laser more than atomic ionization potential, the width of plateau tends to a constant with increasing ellipticity of fundamental field, the dip structure disappears with increasing ellipticity of the high-frequency field. With the help of the quantum channel analysis, it is shown that the angular distribution depends mainly on the ellipticity of high-frequency field in the case that its frequency is high. Moreover, one can see that the maximal and minimal energies in quantum numerical results are in good agreement with the classical prediction. Our investigation may provide theoretical support for experimental research on polarization control of ionization in elliptically polarized two-color laser fields.

TI Low frequency signal detection via correlated Ramsey measurements
SO JOURNAL OF MAGNETIC RESONANCE
AB The low frequency region of the spectrum is a challenging regime for quantum probes. We support the idea that, in this regime, performing Ramsey measurements carefully controlling the time at which each measurement is initiated is an excellent signal detection strategy. We use the Fisher information to demonstrate a high quality performance in the low frequency regime, compared to more elaborated measurement sequences, and to optimize the correlated Ramsey sequence according to any given experimental parameters, showing that correlated Ramsey rivals with state-of-the-art protocols, and can even outperform commonly employed sequences such as dynamical decoupling in the detection of low frequency signals. Contrary to typical quantum detection protocols for oscillating signals, which require adjusting the time separation between pulses to match the half period of the target signal, and consequently see their scope limited to signals whose period is shorter than the characteristic decoherence time of the probe, or to those protocols whose target is primarily static signals, the time-tagged correlated Ramsey sequence simultaneously tracks the amplitude and the phase information of the target signal, regardless of its frequency, which crucially permits correlating measurements in post-processing, leading to efficient spectral reconstruction.

TI Towards Precision Muonic X-ray Measurements of Charge Radii of Light
   Nuclei
SO PHYSICS
AB We, the QUARTET Collaboration, propose an experiment to measure the nuclear charge radii of light elements with up to 20 times higher accuracy. These are essential both for understanding nuclear physics at low energies, and for experimental and theoretical applications in simple atomic systems. Such comparisons advance the understanding of bound-state quantum electrodynamics and are useful for searching for new physics beyond the Standard Model. The energy levels of muonic atoms are highly susceptible to nuclear structure, especially to the mean square charge radius. The radii of the lightest nuclei (with the atomic number, Z=1,2) have been determined with high accuracy using laser spectroscopy in muonic atoms, while those of medium mass and above were determined using X-ray spectroscopy with semiconductor detectors. In this communication, we present a new experiment, aiming to obtain precision measurements of the radii of light nuclei 3 <= Z <= 10 using single-photon energy measurements with cryogenic microcalorimeters; a quantum-sensing technology capable of high efficiency with outstanding resolution for low-energy X-rays.

TI Millihertz magnetic resonance spectroscopy combining the heterodyne
   readout based on solid-spin sensors
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB The sensitivities of quantum sensing in metrology and spectroscopy are drastically influenced by the resolution of the frequency spectrum. However, the resolution is hindered by the decoherence effect between the sensor and the environment. Along these lines, the continue-wave optically detected magnetic resonance (CWODMR) method combined with the heterodyne readout was proposed to break the limitation of the sensor's coherence time. The frequency of the magnetic field was swept to match the unknown signal, and the signal can be transformed to a real-time frequency-domain curve via the heterodyne readout, with a frequency resolution of 4.7 millihertz. Using the nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center ensemble in a diamond as the solid-spin sensors, it was demonstrated that the frequency resolution and precision could be improved proportionally to the low-pass filter parameters of T-c(-1) and T-c(-1.5), respectively. Furthermore, the introduced method performed the sensing of arbitrary audio signals with a sensitivity of 7.32 nT center dot Hz(-1/2)@10 kHz. Our generic approach can be extended to several fields, such as molecular structure determination and biomagnetic field detection, where high-fidelity detection properties across multiple frequency bands are required within small sensing volumes (similar to mm(3)).

TI Diamond Relaxometry as a Tool to Investigate the Free Radical Dialogue
   between Macrophages and Bacteria
SO ACS NANO
AB Although free radicals, which are generated by macrophages play a key role in antimicrobial activities, macrophages sometimes fail to kill Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) as bacteria have evolved mechanisms to withstand oxidative stress. In the past decades, several ROS-related staphylococcal proteins and enzymes were characterized to explain the microorganism's antioxidative defense system. Yet, time-resolved and site-specific free radical/ROS detection in bacterial infection were full of challenges. In this work, we utilize diamond-based quantum sensing for studying alterations of the free radical response near S. aureus in macrophages. To achieve this goal we used S. aureus-fluorescent nanodiamond conjugates and measured the spin- lattice relaxation (T1) of NV defects embedded in nanodiamonds. We observed an increase of intracellular free radical generation when macrophages were challenged with S. aureus. However, under a high intracellular oxidative stress environment elicited by lipopolysaccharides, a lower radical load was recorded on the bacteria surfaces. Moreover, by performing T1 measurements on the same particles at different times postinfection, we found that radicals were dominantly scavenged by S. aureus from 80 min postinfection under a high intracellular oxidative stress environment.

TI Millikelvin Intracellular Nanothermometry with Nanodiamonds
SO ADVANCED SCIENCE
AB Nanothermometry within living cells is an important endeavor in physics, as the mechanisms of heat diffusion in such complex and dynamic environments remain poorly understood. In biology, nanothermometry may offer new insights into cellular biology and open new avenues for drug-discovery. Previous studies using various nanothermometers have reported temperature variations of up to several Kelvins during metabolic stimulation, but these findings have remained controversial as they appear to contradict the law of heat diffusion in the presence of heating rates that are consistent with physiological parameters. Here, nanodiamond nanothermometry are reported inside macrophages by measuring the optically detected magnetic resonance spectra of nitrogen-vacancy centers. The spectra are analyzed when cells are metabolically stimulated and after cell death. It is shown that, in the experimental setting, the apparent spin resonant spectral shifts can be misinterpreted as temperature changes but are actually caused by electrical field changes on the nanodiamond's surface. These artifacts are addressed with optimized nanodiamonds and a more robust sensing protocol to measure temperature inside cells with precision down to 100 mK (52 mK outside cells). No significant temperature changes upon metabolic stimulation are found, a finding consistent with the implementation of the heat diffusion law and expected physiological heating rates.

TI Nuclear spin metrology with nitrogen vacancy center in diamond for axion
   dark matter detection
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
AB We present a method to directly detect the axion dark matter using nitrogen vacancy centers in diamonds. In particular, we use metrology leveraging the nuclear spin of nitrogen to detect axion-nucleus couplings. This is achieved through protocols designed for dark matter searches, which introduce a novel approach of quantum sensing techniques based on the nitrogen vacancy center. Although the coupling strength of the magnetic fields with nuclear spins is three orders of magnitude smaller than that with electron spins for conventional magnetometry, the axion interaction strength with nuclear spins is the same order of magnitude as that with electron spins. Furthermore, we can take advantage of the long coherence time by using the nuclear spins for the axion dark matter detection. Our method has the potential to be sensitive to a broad frequency range 100 Hz corresponding to the axion mass ma 4 x 10-13 eV. We present the detection limit of our method for both the axion-neutron and the axion-proton couplings and discuss its significance in comparison with other proposed ideas. We also show that the sensitivities of the NV center sensor to various spin species will open up new directions for constructing protocols that can mitigate magnetic noise effects.

TI Ferrimagnetic Oscillator Magnetometer
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB Quantum sensors offer unparalleled precision, accuracy, and sensitivity for a variety of measurement applications. We report a compact magnetometer based on a ferrimagnetic sensing element in an oscillator architecture that circumvents challenges common to other quantum sensing approaches such as limited dynamic range, limited bandwidth, and dependence on vacuum, cryogenic, or laser components. The device exhibits a fixed, calibration-free response governed by the electron gyromagnetic ratio. Exchange narrowing in the ferrimagnetic material produces submegahertz transition linewidths despite the high unpaired spin density (approximately 1022 cm-3). The magnetometer achieves a minimum sensitivity of 100 fT/root Hz to ac magnetic fields of unknown phase and a sensitivity below 200 fT/root Hz over a 1 MHz bandwidth. By encoding magnetic field in frequency rather than amplitude, the device provides a dynamic range in excess of 1 mT. The passive, thermal initialization of the sensor's quantum state requires only a magnetic bias field, greatly reducing power requirements compared to laser-initialized quantum sensors. With additional development, this device promises to be a leading candidate for high-performance mag-netometry outside the laboratory, and the oscillator architecture is expected to provide advantages across a wide range of sensing platforms.

TI Floquet spin states in OLEDs
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Electron and hole spins in organic light-emitting diodes constitute prototypical two-level systems for the exploration of the ultrastrong-drive regime of light-matter interactions. Floquet solutions to the time-dependent Hamiltonian of pairs of electron and hole spins reveal that, under non-perturbative resonant drive, when spin-Rabi frequencies become comparable to the Larmor frequencies, hybrid light-matter states emerge that enable dipole-forbidden multi-quantum transitions at integer and fractional g-factors. To probe these phenomena experimentally, we develop an electrically detected magnetic-resonance experiment supporting oscillating driving fields comparable in amplitude to the static field defining the Zeeman splitting; and an organic semiconductor characterized by minimal local hyperfine fields allowing the non-perturbative light-matter interactions to be resolved. The experimental confirmation of the predicted Floquet states under strong-drive conditions demonstrates the presence of hybrid light-matter spin excitations at room temperature. These dressed states are insensitive to power broadening, display Bloch-Siegert-like shifts, and are suggestive of long spin coherence times, implying potential applicability for quantum sensing. Organic semiconductors employed in light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) allow for magnetic resonance studies that explore light-matter interactions in the ultrastrong-drive regime, where the Rabi frequency exceeds the Larmor frequency. The authors report the formation of Floquet spin states in OLEDs.

TI Existential unforgeability in quantum authentication from quantum
   physical unclonable functions based on random von Neumann measurement
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Physical unclonable functions (PUFs) leverage inherent, nonclonable physical randomness to generate unique input-output pairs, serving as secure fingerprints for cryptographic protocols like authentication. Quantum PUFs (QPUFs) extend this concept by using quantum states as input-output pairs, offering advantages over classical PUFs, such as challenge reusability via public channels and eliminating the need for trusted parties due to the no-cloning theorem. Recent work introduced a generalized mathematical framework for QPUFs. It was shown that random unitary QPUFs cannot achieve existential unforgeability against quantum polynomial time (QPT) adversaries. Security was possible only with additional uniform randomness. To avoid the cost of external randomness, we propose a novel measurement-based scheme. Here, the randomness naturally arises from quantum measurements. Additionally, we introduce a second model where the QPUF functions as a nonunitary quantum channel, which guarantees existential unforgeability. These are the first models in the literature to demonstrate a high level of provable security. Finally, we show that the quantum phase estimation (QPE) protocol, applied to a Haar random unitary, serves as an approximate implementation of the second type of QPUF by approximating a von Neumann measurement on the unitary's eigenbasis.

TI Dynamics of multipartite quantum coherence in asymmetric spin-orbit
   coupled system
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB The time evolution of multipartite quantum coherence is studied in a three-body spin system with an asymmetric interaction. The l(1) norm measurement is used to estimate the degree of quantum coherence in the spin system. The decoherence of all components of quantum coherence in the three-body spin system is analyzed by the exact diagnolization and numerical method based on quantum master equation. The environmental noise induced by the spontaneous decay can be simulated by the quantum amplitude damping model. It is found that the time evolution of quantum coherence component is closely related to the quantum property of the whole initial state. When the initial state is a separable pure one, the asymmetric interactions can conduce to the enhancement of the degree of multipartite quantum coherence in a short time interval. Under the influence of quantum noise, the degree of quantum coherence decreases gradually. We pay much attention to the spatial distribution of the degree of quantum coherence in a many-body system. The additivity relationship of bipartite component and tripartite coherence can exist if the initial state is chosen to be a Werner-like state. This kind of the coherence additivity between all bipartite components and global coherence can be extended to an arbitrary N-body Werner-like state. But this additivity relationship depends on the l(1) norm coherence measurement. Owing to the asymmetric interaction and noise, the degree of tripartite quantum coherence is more than the sum of all degrees of bipartite quantum coherence. The difference between the degree of tripartite coherence and the sum of all degrees of bipartite coherence is increased in a short time interval. The environmental noise can also suppress the difference in the coherence degree. The degree of the nearest neighboring bipartite coherence decreases more quickly than those of other bipartite coherences. The asymmetric interaction gives rise to the improvement in the degree of bipartite coherence and tripartite coherence. The coherence of the next-nearest neighboring two systems can be robust against the environmental noise. These results are helpful in preparing the multipartite quantum resources. We can utilize the system of coupled micro-cavities to realize the quantum spin system with controllable asymmetric interaction. In this way, the global coherence and bipartite coherence can be manipulated effectively by the quantum electromagnetic technology.

TI Local topological order and boundary algebras
SO FORUM OF MATHEMATICS SIGMA
AB We introduce a set of axioms for locally topologically ordered quantum spin systems in terms of nets of local ground state projections, and we show they are satisfied by Kitaev's Toric Code and Levin-Wen type models. For a locally topologically ordered spin system on $\mathbb {Z}<^>{k}$ , we define a local net of boundary algebras on $\mathbb {Z}<^>{k-1}$ , which provides a mathematically precise algebraic description of the holographic dual of the bulk topological order. We construct a canonical quantum channel so that states on the boundary quasi-local algebra parameterize bulk-boundary states without reference to a boundary Hamiltonian. As a corollary, we obtain a new proof of a recent result of Ogata [Oga24] that the bulk cone von Neumann algebra in the Toric Code is of type $\mathrm {II}$ , and we show that Levin-Wen models can have cone algebras of type $\mathrm {III}$ . Finally, we argue that the braided tensor category of DHR bimodules for the net of boundary algebras characterizes the bulk topological order in (2+1)D, and can also be used to characterize the topological order of boundary states.

TI Optically detected magnetic resonance of wafer-scale hexagonal boron
   nitride thin films
SO MATERIALS FOR QUANTUM TECHNOLOGY
AB Hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) has recently been shown to host native defects exhibiting optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) with applications in nanoscale magnetic sensing and imaging. To advance these applications, deposition methods to create wafer-scale hBN films with controlled thicknesses are desirable, but a systematic study of the ODMR properties of the resultant films is lacking. Here we perform ODMR measurements of thin films (3-2000 nm thick) grown via three different methods: metal-organic chemical vapour deposition (MOCVD), CVD, and molecular beam epitaxy. We find that they all exhibit an ODMR response, including the thinnest 3 nm film, albeit with different characteristics. The best volume-normalized magnetic sensitivity obtained is 30 mu T Hz -1/2 mu m 3/2. We study the effect of growth temperature on a series of MOCVD samples grown under otherwise fixed conditions and find 800 degrees C-900 degrees C to be an optimum range for magnetic sensitivity, with a significant improvement (up to two orders of magnitude) from post-growth annealing. This work provides a useful baseline for the magnetic sensitivity of hBN thin films deposited via standard methods and informs the feasibility of future sensing applications.

TI Magnetic field characterization of edge currents in quantum spin Hall
   insulators
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB Quantum spin Hall (QSH) insulators are materials with nontrivial topological properties, characterized by helical edge currents. In 2D strips, the application of a bias voltage along the edge generates a magnetization that can be measured using quantum sensors and magnetometry techniques. In this work, we calculate the magnetic field in the vicinity of the edge and explore the potential role of nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond as local probes for the characterization of QSH edge states in topological insulators. We characterize the magnetic field near the edges produced by both electron currents and spin accumulation at the edge. We focus on identifying the position from the edge at which the effects of spin accumulation become detectable. We observe that a larger gap between the conduction and valence bands, along with a lower Fermi velocity, results in a stronger magnetic field, with the detectable spin accumulation being more concentrated near the edge. Conversely, a smaller gap results in a slight reduction in the magnetic field magnitude, but the field associated with spin accumulation becomes detectable further from the edge. This work provides insights that could be useful for the characterization of topological materials and the development of novel electro-optical devices.

TI Integrated photonics cascaded attenuation circuit towards single-photon
   detector calibration
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Integrated photonics platforms are a key driver for advancing scalable photonics technologies. To rigorously characterize and calibrate on -chip integrated photodetectors for ultra -sensitive applications such as quantum sensing and photonic computing, a low -power calibration source down to single -photon levels is required. To date, such sources still largely rely on off -chip bulk or fiber optic setups to accurately attenuate a laser beam referenced to a sub-mW-level primary standard. Here, we demonstrate an on -chip integrated attenuation solution where a mW-level beam is coupled to a silicon nitride photonics circuit, and is attenuated by a series of cascaded directional couplers (DCs). With an integrated silicon photodetector, we measured an attenuation at 685 nm wavelength of up to 16.61 dB with an expanded uncertainty of 0.24 dB for one DC stage. With appropriate scattering mitigation, we infer from our results that a total attenuation of 149.5 dB (expanded uncertainty of 0.5 dB) can be obtained with 9 stages of cascaded DCs, thus allowing single -photon power levels to be obtained directly on -chip from a moderate -power laser source.

TI Improving few-photon optomechanical effects with coherent feedback
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Few-photon effects such as photon blockade and tunneling have potential applications in modern quantum technology. To enhance the few-photon effects in an optomechanical system, we introduce a coherent feedback loop to cavity mode theoretically. By studying the second-order correlation function, we show that the photon blockade effect can be improved with feedback. Under appropriate parameters, the photon blockade effect exists even when cavity decay rate is larger than the single-photon optomechanical coupling coefficient, which may reduce the difficulty of realizing single-photon source in experiments. Through further study of the third-order correlation function, we show that the tunneling effect can also be enhanced by feedback. In addition, we discuss the application of feedback on Schrodinger-cat state generation in an optomechanical system. The result shows that the fidelity of cat state generation can be improved in the presence of feedback loop.

TI Spin echo from erbium implanted silicon
SO APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS
AB Erbium implanted silicon as a quantum technology platform has both telecommunications and integrated circuit processing compatibility. In Si implanted with Er to a concentration of 3x10(17) cm(-3) and O to a concentration of 10(20) cm(-3), the electron spin coherence time, T-2, and the spin-lattice relaxation time, T-1, were measured to be 7.5 mu s and similar to 1 ms, respectively, at 5 K. The spin echo decay profile displayed strong modulation, which was consistent with the super-hyperfine interaction between Er3+ and a spin bath of Si-29 nuclei. The calculated spectral diffusion time was similar to the measured T-2, which indicated that T-2 was limited by spectral diffusion due to T-1-induced flips of neighboring Er3+ spins. The origin of the echo is an Er center surrounded by six O atoms with monoclinic C-1h site symmetry. Published under an exclusive license by AIP Publishing.

Various improvements on the original quantum phase estimation-based QAE have been proposed for resource reduction.

This paper investigates the bias in IQAE. Through the numerical experiments to simulate IQAE, we reveal that the estimate by IQAE is biased and the bias is enhanced for some specific values of a. We see that the termination criterion in IQAE that the estimated accuracy of a falls below the threshold is a source of the bias.

TI Non-adiabatic linear response in open quantum systems
SO SCIPOST PHYSICS
AB Adiabatic theorem and non-adiabatic corrections have been widely applied in modern quantum technology. Recently, non-adiabatic linear response theory has been developed to probe the many-body correlations in closed systems. In this work, we generalize the non-adiabatic linear response theory to open quantum many-body systems. We show that, similar to the closed case, the first-order deviation from the instantaneous steady state is memoryless-it depends only on the final parameters and not on the initial state or ramping path. When ramping the Hamiltonian, the linear response of observables is governed by the derivative of the retarded Green's function, as in closed systems. In contrast, ramping the dissipation gives rise to a different response, characterized by a high-order correlation function defined in the steady state. Our results offer a compact and physically transparent formulation of non-adiabatic response in open systems, and demonstrate that ramping dynamics can serve as a versatile tool for probing many-body correlations beyond equilibrium.

TI Tunable single emitter-cavity coupling strength through
   waveguide-assisted energy quantum transfer
SO LIGHT-SCIENCE & APPLICATIONS
AB The emitter-cavity strong coupling manifests crucial significance for exploiting quantum technology, especially in the scale of individual emitters. However, due to the small light-matter interaction cross-section, the single emitter-cavity strong coupling has been limited by its harsh requirement on the quality factor of the cavity and the local density of optical states. Herein, we present a strategy termed waveguide-assisted energy quantum transfer (WEQT) to improve the single emitter-cavity coupling strength by extending the interaction cross-section. Multiple ancillary emitters are optically linked by a waveguide, providing an indirect coupling channel to transfer the energy quantum between target emitter and cavity. An enhancement factor of coupling strength g/g>10 can be easily achieved, which dramatically release the rigorous design of cavity. As an extension of concept, we further show that the ancillae can be used as controlling bits for a photon gate, opening up new degrees of freedom in quantum manipulation.

TI Transmetalation in Surface-Confined Single-Layer Organometallic Networks
   with Alkynyl-Metal-Alkynyl Linkages
SO ACS NANO
AB Transmetalation represents an appealing strategy toward fabricating and tuning functional metal-organic polymers and frameworks for diverse applications. In particular, building two-dimensional metal-organic and organometallic networks affords versatile nanoarchitectures of potential interest for nanodevices and quantum technology. The controlled replacement of embedded metal centers holds promise for exploring versatile material varieties by serial modification and different functionalization. Herein, we introduce a protocol for the modification of a single-layer carbon-metal-based organometallic network via transmetalation. By integrating external Cu atoms into the alkynyl-Ag organometallic network constructed with 1,3,5-triethynylbenzene precursors, we successfully realized in situ its highly regular alkynyl-Cu counterpart on the Ag(111) surface. While maintaining a similar lattice periodicity and pore morphology to the original alkynyl-Ag sheet, the Cu-based network exhibits increased thermal stability, guaranteeing improved robustness for practical implementation.

TI Twin-Capture Rydberg State Excitation Enhanced with Few-Cycle Laser
   Pulses
SO CHINESE PHYSICS LETTERS
AB Quantum excitation is usually regarded as a transient process occurring instantaneously, leaving the underlying physics shrouded in mystery. Recent research shows that Rydberg-state excitation with ultrashort laser pulses can be investigated and manipulated with state-of-the-art few-cycle pulses. We theoretically find that the efficiency of Rydberg state excitation can be enhanced with a short laser pulse and modulated by varying the laser intensities. We also uncover new facets of the excitation dynamics, including the launching of an electron wave packet through strong-field ionization, the re-entry of the electron into the atomic potential and the crucial step where the electron makes a U-turn, resulting in twin captures into Rydberg orbitals. By tuning the laser intensity, we show that the excitation of the Rydberg state can be coherently controlled on a sub-optical-cycle timescale. Our work paves the way toward ultrafast control and coherent manipulation of Rydberg states, thus benefiting Rydberg-state-based quantum technology.

TI Ultrabroadband Heterogeneous THz Quantum Cascade Laser
SO ACS PHOTONICS
AB Broadband emission in the terahertz spectral region is a prerequisite for applications such as spectroscopy or white light sources. Appropriate signal powers and a compact design are advantageous for this use. A technology which meets these requirements are terahertz quantum cascade lasers. These electrically pumped, on-chip semiconductor lasers provide high output powers and the freedom of tailoring their emission wavelength by bandstructure engineering. By combining multiple active region designs emitting at different wavelengths in a single structure, one can obtain broadband emission from a single device. Here, we present a heterogeneous terahertz quantum cascade laser consisting of five individual active regions based on a three-well, LO-phonon depopulation design. The devices lase in pulsed and continuous-wave operation and emit in a spectral range from 1.9 to 4.5 THz, covering a bandwidth of 1.37 octaves. The use of the three-well design, which was optimized for high temperature operation, leads to a maximum operating temperature in the pulsed operation of 143 K.

TI NbN films with high kinetic inductance for high-quality compact
   superconducting resonators
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB Niobium nitride (NbN) is a particularly promising material for quantum technology applications, as it shows the degree of reproducibility necessary for large-scale superconducting circuits. We demonstrate that resonators based on NbN thin films present a one-photon internal quality factor above 10(5) maintaining a high impedance (larger than 2k ohm), with a footprint of approximately 50 x 100 mu m(2) and a Kerr nonlinearity of few tenths of a hertz. These quality factors, mostly limited by losses induced by the coupling to two-level systems, have been maintained for kinetic inductances ranging from tenths to hundreds of pico-Henry per square. We also demonstrate minimal variations in the performance of the resonators during multiple cooldowns over more than nine months. Our work proves the versatility of niobium nitride high-kinetic-inductance resonators, opening perspectives towards the fabrication of compact, high-impedance, and high-quality multimode circuits, with sizable interactions.

TI An Approach to Quantum Physics Teaching through Analog Experiments
SO PHYSICS
AB With quantum physics being a particularly difficult subject to teach because of its contextual distance from everyday life, the need for multiperspective teaching material arises. Quantum physics education aims at exploring these methods but often lacks physical models and haptic components. In this paper, we provide two analog models and corresponding teaching concepts that present analogies to quantum phenomena for implementation in secondary school and university classrooms: While the first model focuses on the polarization of single photons and the deduction of reasoning tools for elementary comprehension of quantum theory, the second model investigates analog Hardy experiments as an alternative to Bell's theorem. We show how working with physical models to compare classical and quantum perspectives has proven helpful for novice learners to grasp the abstract nature of quantum experiments and discuss our findings as an addition to existing quantum physics teaching concepts.

TI Mirror-coupled microsphere can narrow the angular distribution of
   photoluminescence from WS2 monolayers
SO APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS
AB Engineering optical emission from two-dimensional, transition metal dichalcogenides, such as tungsten disulfide (WS2), has implications in creating and understanding nanophotonic sources. One of the challenges in controlling the optical emission from two-dimensional materials is to achieve narrow angular spread using simple photonic geometry. In this article, we study how the photoluminescence of a monolayer WS2 can be controlled when coupled to a film coupled microsphere dielectric antenna. Specifically, by employing Fourier plane microscopy and spectroscopic techniques, we quantify the wavevector distribution in the momentum space. As a result, we show the beaming of the WS2 photoluminescence with angular divergence as low as theta(1/2) = 4.6 degrees. Furthermore, the experimental measurements have been supported by three-dimensional numerical simulations. We envisage that the discussed results can be generalized to a variety of two-dimensional materials and can be harnessed for on-chip nonlinear and quantum technology.

   tris(2,4,6-trichlorophenyl)methyl-diradical and its interaction with
   circularly polarized light
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY C
AB Chiral diradicals that interact with light represent interesting molecules with potential applications in quantum technology. Here, we report the synthesis of such a novel tris(2,4,6-trichlorophenyl)methyl derived diradical, which is coupled to a chiral bis-acetylene [2.2]paracyclophane using Sonogashira cross-coupling. Its optical properties are compared with those of a non-chiral [2.2]paracyclophane diradical homologue and a phenylacetylene tris(2,4,6-trichlorophenyl)methyl radical reference compound. We study the weak electronic and magnetic interactions between the two unpaired electrons and the chiroptical properties of the diradicals. The enantiomers of the chiral diradical are separated via chiral HPLC and studied by circular dichroism. Magnetic characterization reveals triplet state population, due to near-degenerate singlet-triplet energy levels with a vanishingly small splitting (Delta E-ST < 0.1 kJ mol(-1)), consistent with the results from DFT calculations.

TI Ultrafast Coulomb blockade in an atomic-scale quantum dot
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Controlling electron dynamics at optical clock rates is a fundamental challenge in lightwave-driven nanoelectronics and quantum technology. Here, we demonstrate ultrafast charge-state manipulation of individual selenium vacancies in monolayer and bilayer tungsten diselenide using picosecond terahertz source pulses, focused onto the junction of a scanning tunneling microscope. Using pump-probe time-domain sampling of the defect charge population, we capture atomic-scale snapshots of the transient Coulomb blockade, a hallmark of charge transport via quantized defect states. We leverage the Franck-Condon blockade, which restricts accessible vibronic transitions and promotes unidirectional charge transport, to effectively mitigate back tunneling to the tip electrode. Our master equation approach models the non-reciprocal tunneling process due to vibrations and angular momentum multiplicities, accurately reproducing the time-dependent tunneling current across different coupling regimes. Capturing and controlling ultrafast charge dynamics in low-dimensional materials at the atomic scale opens frontiers in lightwave-driven nanoscale science and technology.

TI Heisenberg uncertainty principle: an advanced undergraduate laboratory
   experiment based on quantum quadrature operators
SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB The Heisenberg uncertainty principle (HUP) plays an important role in quantum mechanics. It is necessary to demonstrate this principle experimentally for undergraduates to understand HUP clearly. In this paper, we originally employ the quantum quadrature operators to demonstrate HUP in undergraduate laboratories. Starting from the quantization of electromagnetic field, we briefly review the definition of quadrature operators and demonstrate HUP via the variances of quadrature operators. And the scheme of HUP demonstration with homodyne detection is introduced. More importantly, we develop a tabletop experimental apparatus for the demonstration of HUP in undergraduate laboratories. Our proposal focuses on the basic quantum mechanics concepts, experimental principles, and instruction as well as experimental techniques. It provides a way to help undergraduates, especially the ones who will go on graduate study in quantum technology in the future, make connections between abstract quantum mechanics concepts and concrete experiments, which makes the concepts better understood.

TI Visible to Infrared Dielectric Metasurfaces and their Applications
SO INDIAN JOURNAL OF PURE & APPLIED PHYSICS
AB Dielectric metasurfaces, two-dimensional variant of metamaterials, have received significant attention from the scientific community due to enormous potential and ability to cater to various spectral bands of the electromagnetic spectrum and pave the way to achieve multi-functionalities in a single device, which was not possible earlier. Dielectric metasurfaces have the edge over their metallic counterparts in terms of zero-ohmic propagation losses, high efficiency, or ultra-high-quality factor and are compatible with existing CMOS technology. They support both electric and magnetic resonances in the optical domain. Here, we provide a comprehensive review of dielectric metasurfaces, encompassing visible to far-infrared wavelength regions, and discuss selective applications which may find its commercial value in the near future. Finally, we provide an outlook and perspective on dielectric metasurfaces for nonlinear and quantum applications.

TI Towards identification of silicon vacancy-related electron paramagnetic
   resonance centers in 4H-SiC
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB The negatively charged silicon vacancy (V-Si(-)) in silicon carbide (SiC) is a paramagnetic and optically active defect in hexagonal SiC. The V(Si)(- )defect possesses S = 3/2 spin with long spin coherence time, and it can be optically manipulated even at room temperature. Recently, electron spin resonance signals have been observed besides those associated with the V-Si(- ) defects in the 4H polytype of SiC. The corresponding centers share properties akin to those of the V-Si(- ) defects and thus they may be promising candidates for quantum technology applications. However, the exact origin of the new signals is unknown. In this paper, we report V-1-related pair defect models as possible candidates for the unknown centers. We determine the corresponding electronic structures and magneto-optical properties as obtained by density functional theory calculations. We propose models for the recently observed electron paramagnetic resonance centers, and we predict their optical signals for identification in future experiments.

TI Fast Quantifier of High-Dimensional Frequency Entanglement through
   Hong-Ou-Mandel Interference
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB High-dimensional frequency entanglement is an enabling resource in quantum technology due to its high information capacity and error resilience. A concise yet efficient method for precisely quantifying its dimensionality remains an open challenge, owing to the difficulties for performing required superposition measurements in energy-time domains, and the complexity associated with full quantum state tomography that scales unfavorably with dimensions. With the assistance of Hong-Ou-Mandel experiment that performs a Fourier transform between the entangled photons in terms of joint spectral intensities and the quantum interference in terms of biphoton temporal coincidences, the concept of Shannon dimensionality as a fast quantifier of bipartite continuous frequency entanglement is unlocked. This quantitative technique reveals the complete distribution of frequency entanglement but without suffering from any limitation of modal capacity of the detection geometry. These results may significantly facilitate the use of quantum interference for characterizing the high-dimensional entanglement nature by avoiding some stringent conditions.

TI Exploring van der Waals Cuprate Superconductors Using a Hybrid Microwave
   Circuit
SO NANO LETTERS
AB The advent of two-dimensional van der Waals materials is a frontier of condensed matter physics and quantum devices. However, characterizing such materials remains challenging due to the limitations of bulk material techniques, necessitating the development of specialized methods. Here, we investigate the superconducting properties of Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+x flakes by integrating them with a hybrid superconducting microwave resonator. The hybrid resonator is significantly modified by the interaction with the flake while maintaining a high quality factor (3 x 104). We also observe a significant upshift of the resonator frequency with increasing temperature, as well as a positive nonlinearity. These effects originate from a presently unknown microscopic mechanism within the flake, and can be modeled as a two-level system bath interacting with the resonant mode. Our findings open a path for high quality hybrid circuits with van der Waals flakes for exploring novel materials and developing new devices for quantum technology.

TI Quantum control and quantum speed limits of single-well systems
SO RESULTS IN PHYSICS
AB Achieving precise control and efficient manipulation of different quantum states is one of the most important goals of quantum technology. We study the quantum control and quantum speed limits of single -well systems by taking a harmonic oscillator whose frequency is a power function of time as an example when the transitionless quantum driving is imposed. For different eigenstates, we reveal the effects of control time and power exponent on Bures angle, fidelity, time -averaged cost, and quantum -speed -limit time. We find that the shortest control time for any eigenstate is proportional to the control parameter (i.e., power exponent). For different eigenstates meeting the same high fidelity requirements, it is shown that an optimal control parameter can always be obtained. Our findings provide theoretical support for the rapid and efficient manipulation of quantum states in single -well systems by using shortcut-to-adiabaticity technique experimentally.

TI Interaction of edge exciton polaritons with engineered defects in the
   hyperbolic material Bi2Se3
SO COMMUNICATIONS MATERIALS
AB Hyperbolic materials exhibit unique properties that enable intriguing applications in nanophotonics. The topological insulator Bi2Se3 represents a natural hyperbolic optical medium, both in the THz and visible range. Here, using cathodoluminescence spectroscopy and electron energy-loss spectroscopy, we demonstrate that Bi2Se3 supports room-temperature exciton polaritons and explore the behavior of hyperbolic edge exciton polaritons, which are hybrid modes resulting from the coupling of the polaritons bound to the upper and lower edges of Bi2Se3 nanoplatelets. We compare Fabry-Perot-like resonances emerging in edge polariton propagation along pristine and artificially structured edges and experimentally demonstrate the possibility to steer edge polaritons by means of grooves and nanocavities. The observed scattering of edge polaritons by defect structures is found to be in good agreement with finite-difference time-domain simulations. Our findings reveal the extraordinary capability of hyperbolic polariton propagation to cope with the presence of defects, providing an excellent basis for applications such as nanooptical circuitry, nanoscale cloaking and nanoscopic quantum technology.

TI Scalable InAs/InGaAs DWELL structures for broadband infrared emission
   spanning the E- to O-band
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB This study presents the optimization of MOCVD growth conditions for InAs/InGaAs quantum dots-in-a-well (DWELL) structures on 4-inch GaAs substrates incorporating an InGaP seed layer. By precisely tuning the arsenic-to-indium (As/In) ratio, growth temperature, and deposition duration, we achieved accurate control over the size and density of quantum dots (QDs), enabling a broad tuning of infrared emission wavelengths from 1200 to 1450 nm. Using photoluminescence spectroscopy and numerical modeling, we investigated the impact of In content of the InxGa1-xAs strain-reducing cap layers on the optical properties of the DWELL structures. A linear correlation was observed between In concentration and the emission peak wavelength, highlighting the significant role of the capping layer composition in tuning QD emission characteristics. This work highlights the critical importance of growth parameter optimization in engineering QD-based heterostructures paving the way for their integration into advanced optoelectronic and quantum technology applications.

TI High-Yield Production of Quantum Corrals in a Surface Reconstruction
   Pattern
SO NANO LETTERS
AB The power of surface chemistry to create atomically precise nanoarchitectures offers intriguing opportunities to advance the field of quantum technology. Strategies for building artificial electronic lattices by individually positioning atoms or molecules result in precisely tailored structures but lack structural robustness. Here, taking the advantage of strong bonding of Br atoms on noble metal surfaces, we report the production of stable quantum corrals by dehalogenation of hexabromobenzene molecules on a preheated Au(111) surface. The byproducts, Br adatoms, are confined within a new surface reconstruction pattern and aggregate into nanopores with an average size of 3.7 & PLUSMN; 0.1 nm, which create atomic orbital-like quantum resonance states inside each corral due to the interference of scattered electron waves. Remarkably, the atomic orbitals can be hybridized into molecular-like orbitals with distinct bonding and antibonding states. Our study opens up an avenue to fabricate quantum structures with high yield and superior robustness.

TI Micro-cavity length stabilization for fluorescence enhancement using
   schemes based on higher-order spatial modes
SO REVIEW OF SCIENTIFIC INSTRUMENTS
AB We report on the experimental investigation of potential high-performance cavity length stabilization using odd-indexed higher-order spatial modes. Schemes based on higher-order modes are particularly useful for micro-cavities that are used for enhanced fluorescence detection of a few emitters, which need to minimize photons leaking from a stabilization beam. We describe the design and construction of an assembly for a microcavity setup with tunable high passive stability. In addition, different types of active stabilization techniques based on higher-order modes are then implemented and characterized based on their performance. We achieved a stability of about 0.5 pm rms, while the error photons leaking from the continuous locking beam to a fluorescence detector are suppressed by more than 100-fold. We expect these results to be important for quantum technology implementations of various emitter-cavity setups, where these techniques provide a useful tool to meet the highly challenging demands.

TI Quantum Gas-Enabled Direct Mapping of Active Current Density in
   Percolating Networks of Nanowires
SO NANO LETTERS
AB Electrically percolating nanowire networks are among the most promising candidates for next-generation transparent electrodes. Scientific interest in these materials stems from their intrinsic current distribution heterogeneity, leading to phenomena like percolating pathway rerouting and localized self-heating, which can cause irreversible damage. Without an experimental technique to resolve the current distribution and an underpinning nonlinear percolation model, one relies on empirical rules and safety factors to engineer materials. We introduce Bose-Einstein condensate microscopy to address the longstanding problem of imaging active current flow in 2D materials. We report on performance improvement of this technique whereby observation of dynamic redistribution of current pathways becomes feasible. We show how this, combined with existing thermal imaging methods, eliminates the need for assumptions between electrical and thermal properties. This will enable testing and modeling individual junction behavior and hot-spot formation. Investigating both reversible and irreversible mechanisms will contribute to improved performance and reliability of devices.

TI Nanograting-Enhanced Optical Fibers for Visible and Infrared Light
   Collection at Large Input Angles
SO PHOTONICS
AB The efficient incoupling of light into particular fibers at large angles is essential for a multitude of applications; however, this is difficult to achieve with commonly used fibers due to low numerical aperture. Here, we demonstrate that commonly used optical fibers functionalized with arrays of metallic nanodots show substantially improved large-angle light-collection performances at multiple wavelengths. In particular, we show that at visible wavelengths, higher diffraction orders contribute significantly to the light-coupling efficiency, independent of the incident polarization, with a dominant excitation of the fundamental mode. The experimental observation is confirmed by an analytical model, which directly suggests further improvement in incoupling efficiency through the use of powerful nanostructures such as metasurface or dielectric gratings. Therefore, our concept paves the way for high-performance fiber-based optical devices and is particularly relevant within the context of endoscopic-type applications in life science and light collection within quantum technology.

TI Writing and deleting skyrmions with electric fields in a multiferroic
   heterostructure
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Magnetic skyrmions are topological spin textures that can be used as information carriers for the next-generation information storage and processing. The electric-field controlling of skyrmions in such devices is essential but remains technologically challenging. Here, using the first-principle calculation and the Ginzburg-Landau theory, we propose a reliable process for writing and deleting skyrmions by electric fields, on the platform of a multiferroic heterostructure, particularly the Cr2Ge2Te6/In2Se3 heterostructure. We show that the electric field controls the electric polarization and indirectly influences the antisymmetric Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) between the magnetic moments. The latter is responsible for the generation and removal of the skyrmion spin textures, and we study this mechanism by the Ginzburg-Landau analysis. We discuss the real-space Berry curvature, topological Hall effects, possible quantum anomalous Hall effect, and other competing magnetic structures. These results represent examples of quantum technology and may have potential applications in future skyrmionics and the device fabrication.

TI Influence of flexible multibeam intensity distributions on selective
   laser-induced etching process regimes
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB The precision and versatility of selective laser-induced etching in fused silica render it indispensable for many applications in medical engineering, the semiconductor industry, and quantum technology. However, its process-limited productivity renders it unsuitable for a wider set of applications, particularly those that require cost-effective solutions. As the process is largely concerned with microprocessing applications, a promising method to enhance process efficiency is through parallelization using multiple beams with high packing density. This study examines the dynamics of flexible multibeam intensity distributions relative to the number of beamlets and spacing. The study identifies stable process regimes, examines the increased absorption from interactions among parallel modified tracks, and develops a strategy for optimized processing using flexible multibeams. The final demonstration illustrates the generation of multibeam fabricated through glass vias with varying degrees of complexity.

TI Exceptional-point-assisted entanglement, squeezing, and reset in a chain
   of three superconducting resonators
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB The interplay between coherent and dissipative dynamics required in various control protocols of quantum technology has motivated studies of open-system degeneracies, referred to as exceptional points (EPs). Here, we introduce a scheme for fast quantum-state synthesis using exceptional-point engineering in a lossy chain of three superconducting resonators. We theoretically find that the rich physics of EPs can be used to identify regions in the parameter space that favor a fast and quasistable transfer of squeezing and entanglement or a fast reset of the system. For weakly interacting resonators with the coupling strength g, the obtained quasistabilization timescales & RADIC; are identified as 1/(2 2g), and reset infidelities below 10-5 are obtained with a waiting time of roughly 6/g in the case of weakly squeezed resonators. Our results shed light on the role of EPs in multimode Gaussian systems and pave the way for optimized distribution of squeezing and entanglement between different nodes of a photonic network using dissipation as a resource.

AB The development of diverse fields like acousto-optics, spintronics, quantum technology raises new demand on precise phonon manipulation, while surface acoustic wave (SAW) on piezoelectric substrate is a promising platform. Besides the widely studied on-propagating manipulation issues, the emission of phonon also serves as an important design consideration in the system. In this work, through ion slicing technology, heterogeneous substrate with 42 degrees Y cut LiTaO3 thin film directly bonded on 4H-SiC is fabricated. The heterogeneous substrate enables double-modes natural unidirectional transducer (DMNUDT). Determined by the vibrating mode, unidirectional emission of shear horizontal SAW phonons and longitudinal leaky SAW phonons to opposite direction by symmetric transducers is realized, which is beyond the capability of previous asymmetric unidirectional transducers. Based on the fascinating phonon radiation features of DMNUDT, we propose the minimal on-chip frequency splitter, that can split mixed frequency components of AC signal into channel. The demonstrated piezoelectric frequency splitter can achieve transmission ratio of greater than 15 dB within the footprint of a resonator.

TI Ensuring Responsible Nanotechnology Innovation
SO NANOETHICS
AB The challenge of considering the ethical, environmental, economic, social, legal and cultural (E3LSC) dimensions of nanotechnology innovation is of enduring and increasing importance for societies worldwide. This is made more pressing due to rising public interest in the realms of AI and quantum technology. Drawing on an interdisciplinary collaboration between nanotechnology and social science researchers, this paper discusses how E3LSC dimensions are negotiated in practice and what lessons can be brought forward to develop E3LSC considerations as nanotechnology and nanoscience continue to advance. Drawing on sociological data from 34 semi-structured interviews with academic scientists researching nanotechnology in Australia, we discuss the contemporary challenges facing nanotechnology researchers. These included acknowledgement of the complexities of navigating E3LSC within the realities of the contemporary university landscape; the increasing turn toward commercialisation in Australia, and the enduring challenges of multidisciplinarity. We discuss how these challenges are complex, but suggest that effective embedding of disciplinary training can contribute to 'upstreaming' E3LSC considerations for the betterment of nanotechnology innovation and society alike.

TI Theoretical characterization of NV-like defects in 4H-SiC using ADAQ
   with SCAN and r2SCAN meta-GGA functionals
SO APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS
AB Kohn-Sham density functional theory is widely used for screening color centers in semiconductors. While the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) generalized gradient approximation functional is efficient, its accuracy in describing defects is often not sufficient. The Heyd-Scuseria-Ernzerhof (HSE) functional is more accurate but computationally expensive, making it impractical for large-scale screening. This study evaluates the strongly constrained and appropriately normed (SCAN) family of meta-GGA functionals as potential alternatives to PBE for characterizing NV-like color centers in 4H-SiC using the Automatic Defect Analysis and Qualification (ADAQ) framework. We examine nitrogen, oxygen, fluorine, sulfur, and chlorine vacancies in 4H-SiC, focusing on applications in quantum technology. Our results show that SCAN and r(2)SCAN achieve a greater accuracy than PBE, approaching HSE's precision at a lower computational cost. This suggests that the SCAN family offers a practical improvement for screening new color centers, with computational demands similar to PBE.

TI Growth of Few-Layer Molecular Crystals of PTCDI on Hexagonal Boron
   Nitride by Microspacing Air-Gap Sublimation
SO ACS APPLIED OPTICAL MATERIALS
AB Extended two-dimensional (2D) crystals of dye molecules adsorbed on 2D material substrates such as boron nitride have recently become a subject of intense study, with potential applications ranging from quantum technology to optoelectronics. The most established technique for the production of these films is physical vapor transport in a vacuum. We demonstrate that few-layer crystalline films of the organic dye molecule perylenetetracarboxylic diimide (PTCDI) on boron nitride can be produced by microspacing in-air sublimation, a radically simplified technique that does not require complicated vacuum systems. The resulting layers display clearly resolved atomic step terraces in atomic force microscopy and a clear polarization anisotropy in their fluorescence, confirming molecular alignment and long-range order. Using density functional theory and classical molecular dynamics simulations, the canted motif is identified as the most likely building block for the morphology of a PTDCI monolayer on the hBN substrate.

TI Demonstration of a Compact Magneto-Optical Trap on an Unstaffed Aerial

AB The extraordinary performance offered by cold atom-based clocks and sensors has the opportunity to profoundly affect a range of applications, for example in gravity surveys, enabling long term monitoring applications through low drift measurements. While ground-based devices are already starting to enter the commercial market, significant improvements in robustness and reductions to size, weight, and power are required for such devices to be deployed by Unstaffed Aerial Vehicle systems (UAV). In this article, we realise the first step towards the deployment of cold atom based clocks and sensors on UAV's by demonstrating an UAV portable magneto-optical trap system, the core package of cold atom based systems. This system is able to generate clouds of 2.1 +/- 0.2 x 10(7) atoms, in a package of 370 mm x 350 mm x 100 mm, weighing 6.56 kg, consuming 80 W of power.

TI Realization of robust quantum noise characterization in the presence of
   coherent errors
SO AVS QUANTUM SCIENCE
AB Complex quantum systems and their various applications are susceptible to noise of coherent and incoherent nature. Characterization of noise and its sources is an open, key challenge in quantum technology applications, especially in terms of distinguishing between inherent incoherent noise and systematic coherent errors. In this paper, we study a scheme of repeated sequential measurements that enables the characterization of incoherent errors by reducing the effects of coherent errors. We demonstrate this approach using a coherently controlled nitrogen vacancy in diamond, coupled to both a natural nuclear spin bath (non-Markovian) and to experimentally controlled relaxation through an optical pumping process (nearly Markovian). Our results show mitigation of coherent errors both for Markovian and non-Markovian incoherent noise profiles. We apply this scheme to the estimation of the dephasing time ( T-2*) due to incoherent noise. We observe an improved robustness against coherent errors in the estimation of dephasing time ( T-2*) compared to the standard (Ramsey) measurement.

TI Nanowire bolometer using a 2D high-temperature superconductor
SO NANOTECHNOLOGY
AB Superconducting nanowires are very important due to their applications ranging from quantum technology to astronomy. In this work, we implement a non-invasive process to fabricate nanowires of high-T (c) superconductor Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+delta . We demonstrate that our nanowires can be used as bolometers in the visible range with very high responsivity of 9.7 x 10(3) V W-1. Interestingly, in a long (30 mu m) nanowire of 9 nm thickness and 700 nm width, we observe bias current-dependent localized spots of maximum photovoltage. Moreover, the scalability of the bolometer responsivity with the normal state resistance of the nanowire could allow further performance improvement by increasing the nanowire length in a meander geometry. We observe phase slip events in nanowires with small cross-sections (12 nm thick, 300 nm wide, and 3 mu m long) at low temperatures. Our study presents a scalable method for realizing sensitive bolometers working near the liquid-nitrogen temperature.

TI Spatially Resolved Dynamics of Cobalt Color Centers in ZnO Nanowires
SO ADVANCED SCIENCE
AB The dynamics of color centers, being a promising quantum technology, is strongly dependent on the local environment. A synergistic approach of X-ray fluorescence analysis and X-ray excited optical luminescence (XEOL) using a hard X-ray nanoprobe is applied. The simultaneous acquisition provides insights into compositional and functional variations at the nanoscale demonstrating the extraordinary capabilities of these combined techniques. The findings on cobalt doped zinc oxide nanowires show an anticorrelation between the band edge emission of the zinc oxide host and the intra-3d cobalt luminescence, indicating two competing recombination paths. Moreover, time-resolved XEOL measurements reveal two exponential decays of the cobalt luminescence. The fast and newly observed one can be attributed to a recombination cascade within the cobalt atom, resulting from direct excitation. Thus, this opens a new fast timescale for potential devices based on cobalt color centers in ZnO nanowires in photonic circuits.

TI Exploring the neighborhood of 1-layer QAOA with instantaneous quantum
   polynomial circuits
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB We embed 1-layer QAOA circuits into the larger class of parametrized instantaneous quantum polynomial circuits to produce an improved variational quantum algorithm for solving combinatorial optimization problems. The use of analytic expressions to find optimal parameters classically makes our protocol robust against barren plateaus and hardware noise. The average overlap with the ground state scales as 2-0.31(2)N with the number of qubits N for random Sherrington-Kirkpatrick (SK) Hamiltonians of up to 29 qubits, a polynomial improvement over 1-layer QAOA. Additionally, we observe that performing variational imaginary time evolution on the manifold approximates low-temperature pseudo-Boltzmann states. Our protocol outperforms 1-layer QAOA on the recently released Quantinuum H2 trapped-ion quantum hardware and emulator, where we obtain an average approximation ratio of 0.985 across 312 random SK instances of 7 to 32 qubits, from which almost 44% are solved optimally using only 4 to 1208 shots per instance.

TI Spectral density reconstruction with Chebyshev polynomials
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW E
AB Accurate calculations of the spectral density in a strongly correlated quantum many-body system are of fundamental importance to study its dynamics in the linear response regime. Typical examples are the calculation of inclusive and semiexclusive scattering cross sections in atomic nuclei and transport properties of nuclear and neutron star matter. Integral transform techniques play an important role in accessing the spectral density in a variety of nuclear systems. However, their accuracy is in practice limited by the need to perform a numerical inversion which is often ill-conditioned. In the present work we extend a recently proposed quantum algorithm which circumvents this problem. We show how to perform controllable reconstructions of the spectral density over a finite energy resolution with rigorous error estimates. An appropriate expansion in Chebyshev polynomials allows for efficient simulations also on classical computers. We apply our idea to obtain the local density of states for graphene in a magnetic field as a proof of principle. This paves the way for future applications in nuclear and condensed matter physics.

TI A self-assembled two-dimensional hypersonic phononic insulator
SO NANOPHOTONICS
AB The coupling between the electromagnetic field and the motional degrees of freedom of a nanoscale object offers an interesting control-knob for light-matter interaction. However, this interaction is rather weak so, in general, a precise control over the mechanical vibrations of the object becomes desirable for enhancing and fine-tuning this coupling. Phonon insulation is a base-line to achieve nanoscale vibration control by inducing constructive and destructive phonon interference, which opens phononic band gaps at various frequencies. Phonon insulators are essential for managing and directing mechanical vibrations in advanced mechanical systems, such as resonators and acousto-optic modulators. Conventional fabrication methods, such as electron-beam lithography, are highly robust and efficient but also very demanding and limited in accessibility due to their cost and technical requirements. Self-assembly offers an alternative route for fabricating mechanical structures from diverse materials, allowing for innovative designs with improved functionalities. By using natural self-organizing processes, production is simplified and accelerated, with components assembling automatically in a low-cost, scalable manner. Here, we present a simple self-assembled device that functions as a phonon insulator in the GHz frequency range and can be easily integrated onto silicon. This integration opens the door to a wide range of applications, including optical communication, quantum computing, and ultra-sensitive sensors, where efficient control over mechanical vibrations is vital.

TI Topological superconductivity from unconventional band degeneracy with
   conventional pairing
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB We present a new scheme for Majorana modes in systems with nonsymmorphic-symmetry-protected band degeneracy. We reveal that when the gapless fermionic excitations are encoded with conventional superconductivity and magnetism, which can be intrinsic or induced by proximity effect, topological superconductivity and Majorana modes can be obtained. We illustrate this outcome in a system which respects the space group P4/nmm and features a fourfold-degenerate fermionic mode at (pi, pi) in the Brillouin zone. We show that in the presence of conventional superconductivity, different types of topological superconductivity, i.e., first-order and second-order topological superconductivity, with coexisting fragile Wannier obstruction in the latter case, can be generated in accordance with the different types of magnetic orders; Majorana modes are shown to exist on the boundary, at the corner and in the vortices. To further demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, another example related to the space group P4/ncc based on this scheme is also provided. Our study offers insights into constructing topological superconductors based on bulk energy bands and conventional superconductivity and helps to find new material candidates and design new platforms for realizing Majorana modes.
   Topological superconductors are highly sought-after systems with potential applications in topological quantum computing. Here, the authors propose a scheme for realizing topological superconductivity based on the bulk energy bands and conventional superconductivity.

TI On resolving the tension between visiting mathematical works and
   questioning the quantum world
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL EDUCATION IN SCIENCE AND
   TECHNOLOGY
AB For the past 40 years, researchers in didactics of mathematics have developed and utilised didactic engineering as a methodology for design-based research. In this article we discuss its second step, the so-called a priori analysis. In the framework of the Anthropological Theory of the Didactic, engineering is in the form of the implementation of a study and research path (SRP), an inquiry-based course. SRPs may be either finalised, that is aimed at the teaching of a particular piece of knowledge, or rather open, that is solely aimed at answering a given question. This tension between sometimes competing goals especially shows in the a priori analysis of SRPs, a phenomenon we address in this paper. Our study is based on pieces of evidence collected by setting up an SRP two years in a row at the interface between mathematics and quantum mechanics, in third year of bachelor's degree. We take a particular care in explicating the rationale behind the a priori analysis and its connection with the preliminary analysis. We bring out the significance of spelling out one's epistemological stance, as didactic engineer, emphasising the value of the notion of reference epistemological models to do so.

TI Variational Quantum Linear Solver Enhanced Quantum Support Vector
   Machine
SO ADVANCES IN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AND MACHINE LEARNING
AB Quantum Support Vector Machines (QSVM) play a vital role in using quantum resources for supervised machine learning tasks, such as classification. However, current methods are strongly limited in terms of scalability on Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices. In this work, we propose a novel approach called the Variational Quantum Linear Solver (VQLS) enhanced QSVM. This is built upon our idea of utilizing the variational quantum linear solver to solve system of linear equations of a Least Squares-SVM on a NISQ device. The implementation of our approach is evaluated by an extensive series of numerical experiments with the Iris dataset, which consists of three distinct iris plant species. Based on this, we explore the effectiveness of our algorithm by constructing a classifier capable of classification in a feature space ranging from one to seven dimensions. Furthermore, we exploit both classical and quantum computing for various subroutines of our algorithm, and effectively mitigate challenges associated with the implementation. These include significant improvement in the trainability of the variational ansatz and notable reductions in run-time for cost calculations. Based on the numerical experiments, our approach exhibits the capability of identifying a separating hyperplane in an 8-dimensional feature space. Moreover, it consistently demonstrated strong performance across various instances with the same dataset.

TI Multi-Pose Facial Expression Recognition Using Hybrid Deep Learning
   Model with Improved Variant of Gravitational Search Algorithm
SO INTERNATIONAL ARAB JOURNAL OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY
AB The recognition of human facial expressions with the variation of poses is one of the challenging tasks in real-time applications such as human physiological interaction detection, intention analysis, marketing interest evaluation, mental disease diagnosis, etc. This research work addresses the problem of expression recognition from different facial poses at the yaw angle. The major contribution of the paper is the proposal of an autonomous pose variant facial expression recognition framework using the amalgamation of a hybrid deep learning model with an improved quantum inspired gravitational search algorithm. The hybrid deep learning model is the integration of the convolutional neural network and recurrent neural network. The applicability of the hybrid deep learning model can be considered as significant if the feature set is efficiently optimized to have the discriminative features respective to each expression class. Here, the Improved Quantum Inspired Gravitational Search Algorithm (IQI-GSA) is utilized for the selection and optimization of features. The IQI-GSA method is significant for optimizing the features compared to quantum-behaved binary gravitation search algorithm for handing the local optima and stochastic characteristics. Comparing with state-of-art techniques, the proposed framework exhibits the outperformed recognition rate for experimentation on Karolinska Directed Emotional Faces (KDEF) and Japanese Female Facial Expression (JAFFE) datasets.

TI Energy-Filtered Excited States and Real-Time Dynamics Served in a
   Contour Integral
SO JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL THEORY AND COMPUTATION
AB It is observed that the Cauchy integral formula (CIF) can be used to represent holomorphic functions of diagonalizable operators on a finite domain. This forms the theoretical foundation for applying various operators in the form of a contour integral to a state, while filtering away eigen-components that are not included by the contour. As a special case, the identity operator in the integral form-the Riesz projector-is used to design an algorithm for finding a given number of eigen-pairs whose energies are close to a specified value in the equation-of-motion coupled cluster singles and doubles (EOM-CCSD) framework, with applications to calculate core excited states of molecules which is relevant for the X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS). As a generalization, I showcase a novel real-time electron dynamics (RT-EOM-CCSD) algorithm based on the CIF form of the exponential time-evolution operator, which admits extremely large time steps while preserving accurate spectral information.

TI Better-than-classical Grover search via quantum error detection and
   suppression
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB We report better-than-classical success probabilities for a complete Grover quantum search algorithm on the largest scale demonstrated to date, of up to five qubits, using two different IBM platforms. This is enabled by error suppression via robust dynamical decoupling. Further improvements arise after the use of measurement error mitigation, but the latter is insufficient by itself for achieving better-than-classical performance. For two qubits, we demonstrate a 99.5% success probability via the use of the [[4, 2, 2]] quantum error-detection (QED) code. This constitutes a demonstration of quantum algorithmic breakeven via QED. Along the way, we introduce algorithmic error tomography (AET), a method that provides a holistic view of the errors accumulated throughout an entire quantum algorithm, filtered via the errors detected by the QED code used to encode the circuit. We demonstrate that AET provides a stringent test of an error model based on a combination of amplitude damping, dephasing, and depolarization.

TI A Decentralized Signcryption Scheme Based on CFL
SO SENSORS
AB The rapid advancement of quantum computing technology poses a significant threat to conventional public key cryptographic infrastructure. The SM2 (state key cryptography algorithm no. 2) elliptic curve public key cryptographic algorithm, which adopts elliptic curve cryptography, has demonstrated strong resistance to quantum attacks. However, existing signcryption schemes remain vulnerable due to their reliance on a single certification authority (CA) managing all keys. The cryptography fundamental logics (CFL) authentication process eliminates the need for third-party involvement, achieving decentralized authentication and reducing the burden on certificate generation centers. Therefore, a decentralized signcryption scheme based on CFL was proposed using the SM2 national cryptographic algorithm. Unlike traditional signcryption schemes, this approach does not depend on the certification authority's private key during the public-private key generation process. This innovation helps avoid risks associated with certification authority private key leakage and ensures decentralized characteristics. The proposed scheme was rigorously verified under the random oracle model (ROM) and based on the complexity assumption of the elliptic curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH) problem. The theoretical analysis and experimental results demonstrate that compared to traditional methods, the proposed scheme exhibits higher efficiency in communication and computation. Specifically, the proposed scheme reduces computational overheads by approximately 30% and communication overheads by approximately 20% in practical working environments. These quantitative improvements highlight the scheme's promising application prospects and practical value.

TI Review of Physical Layer Security in Integrated Satellite-Terrestrial
   Networks
SO ELECTRONICS
AB With the success and commercialization of 5G, 3GPP has started working toward the sixth generation of communication systems. While 5G explored the concept of non-terrestrial networks like satellites and unmanned aerial vehicles working alongside terrestrial networks, 6G is expected to take this integration a step further, aiming to achieve a more coherent network where satellites and terrestrial infrastructure work together seamlessly. However, the complexity and uniqueness of such networks create numerous attack surfaces that make them vulnerable to cyberattacks. The solution to such cyberattacks can be addressed by encryption and other upper-layer authentication methods. However, with the move to higher-frequency bands, such encryption techniques are difficult to scale for low-latency networks. In addition, the recent progress in quantum computing will make networks more vulnerable. To address such challenges, physical layer security (PLS) is proposed as a secure and quantum-resistant way to implement security by taking advantage of the physics of the channel and transceiver. This article reviews the latest trends and progress in PLS in integrated satellite-terrestrial networks (ISTNs) from a signal processing perspective. This work provides a comprehensive survey of the state-of-the-art research conducted, challenges, and future directions in the PLS of ISTNs.

TI Low Temperature (Down to 6 K) and Quantum Transport Characteristics of
   Stacked Nanosheet Transistors with a High-K/Metal Gate-Last Process
SO NANOMATERIALS
AB Silicon qubits based on specific SOI FinFETs and nanowire (NW) transistors have demonstrated promising quantum properties and the potential application of advanced Si CMOS devices for future quantum computing. In this paper, for the first time, the quantum transport characteristics for the next-generation transistor structure of a stack nanosheet (NS) FET and the innovative structure of a fishbone FET are explored. Clear structures are observed by TEM, and their low-temperature characteristics are also measured down to 6 K. Consistent with theoretical predictions, greatly enhanced switching behavior characterized by the reduction of off-state leakage current by one order of magnitude at 6 K and a linear decrease in the threshold voltage with decreasing temperature is observed. A quantum ballistic transport, particularly notable at shorter gate lengths and lower temperatures, is also observed, as well as an additional bias of about 1.3 mV at zero bias due to the asymmetric barrier. Additionally, fishbone FETs, produced by the incomplete nanosheet release in NSFETs, exhibit similar electrical characteristics but with degraded quantum transport due to additional SiGe channels. These can be improved by adjusting the ratio of the channel cross-sectional areas to match the dielectric constants.

TI Effect of Strain on the Resistivity and Thermal Conductivity of High
   Purity Niobium
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON APPLIED SUPERCONDUCTIVITY
AB High purity niobium (Nb) is a technologically important material for large-scale accelerator and nano-scale quantum computing applications in microwave frequency range. The high thermal conductivity and low resistivity of Nb are critical to the high performance at temperature range of 0.01-4.0 K. The presence of interstitials such as O, N, H, and C act as scattering centers and alter the mean free path, reducing resistivity and thermal conductivity, and contributing significantly to Nb's thermal performance for temperatures of 2.0 K and above. The residual resistivity ratio (RRR), defined as the ratio of the normal state resistivity at 300 K to that at 4.2 K (Nb, T-c = 9.2 K), is an accepted direct estimate of the impurity content of fully recrystallized Nb. Complete re-crystallization of Nb is challenging unless very high temperatures are employed, which is often impractical, hence, in practice, dislocation and dislocation structures impact the thermal performance of Nb due to strong phonon scattering contributions. This paper reports on the degradation of thermal conductivity and RRR of high purity Nb large grain, single crystal with fixed impu-rity, varying strain, and dislocation content levels. Experimental thermal conductivity data fits the Boltzmann transport equation incorporating dislocation density.

TI Magnetic-Field Regulation of Nodal Topological Superconducting States in
   Monolayer Ising Superconductor NbSe2
SO PHYSICA STATUS SOLIDI-RAPID RESEARCH LETTERS
AB The nodal topological superconducting (NTSC) state with Majorana flat bands (MFBs) is an exotic matter of state hosting Majorana fermions that obey non-Abelian statistics. Recently, monolayer Ising superconductor NbSe2 is shown to be an ideal platform for realizing an NTSC state. Through tight-binding calculations based on the Bogoliubov-de-Gennes Hamiltonian, it is demonstrated that the in-plane magnetic field B combined with superconducting pairing Delta(s), Rashba spin-orbit coupling (SOC) V-r, and chemical potential mu can regulate the topological properties of the NTSC state. First, B larger than Delta(s) effectively induces an NTSC state with nodal points (NPs) located on the high-symmetry line of the Brillouin zone. The length of the resulting MFBs in the ribbon increases with B. Second, Rashba SOC greatly affects the number and locations of NPs by tilting bands near Fermi level (E-F), leading to unidirectional Majorana edge states. Finally, when B > Delta(s), mu affects the bulk band structure at E-F, resulting in an NTSC state with 6, 12, 18, 24 NPs and 0, 2, 3, 4 MFBs. These results are important to clarifying the behavior of the NTSC state under a B and designing a quantum computing platform based on exotic Majorana fermions.

TI Rashba effects in lead-free ferroelectric semiconductor
   [CH3PH3]SnBr3
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW MATERIALS
AB First-principles density functional theory computations are used to predict Rashba effects cofunctional with ferroelectricity in a recently synthesized lead-free hybrid organic-inorganic perovskite MPSnBr3 (MP=methylphosphonium, [CH3PH3](+)). The ground state of the material is polar monoclinic with calculated spontaneous polarization of 3.01 mu C/cm(2). It exhibits near band edges' spin splitting of up to 3.3 meV and Rashba coefficient up to 0.62 eV angstrom. The spin textures have different topology in the conduction and valence band, which originates from the difference in the spin-momentum coupling strengths. They occur in two orthogonal planes of the Brillouin zone and are coupled to the direction of spontaneous polarization. These features persist at a finite temperature of 293 K. At 333 K, that is, above monoclinic to orthorhombic phase transition, spontaneous polarization is reduced to 0.15 mu C/cm(2), while the maximum spin splitting and Rashba coefficient reduce slightly to the values of 2.9 meV and 0.41 eV angstrom, respectively. The spin textures remain coupled with the polarization direction. We investigate the dependence of the aforementioned properties on the choice of computational methodology to extend the first-principles predictions to include finite temperature effects. We find that the predictions are sensitive to the methodology. Our study reveals the potential of MPSnBr3 for low-temperature applications in spintronics and quantum computing.

TI Noise Reduction Methods for Charge Stability Diagrams of Double Quantum
   Dots
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM ENGINEERING
AB Operating semiconductor quantum dots as quantum bits requires isolating single electrons by adjusting gate voltages. The transitions of electrons to and from the dots appear as a honeycomb-like pattern in recorded charge stability diagrams (CSDs). Thus, detecting the pattern is essential to tune a double dot, but manual tuning is seriously time-consuming. However, automation of this process is difficult because the transitions' contrast is often low, and noise and background disorder potential shifts disturb the CSDs. Therefore, the signal-to-noise ratio needs to be increased to improve the detection of the line pattern. For this purpose, we evaluate a representative set of edge-preserving smoothing filters and compare them both quantitatively and qualitatively by suitable metrics and visual assessment. We generate artificial data to use full-reference metrics for the evaluation procedure and to optimize the filter parameters. Based on the results of this article, the methods attain a moderate to good amount of noise reduction and structure improvement dependent on the different CSD qualities. In conclusion, we suggest introducing the block-matching and three-dimensional transform-domain filter into the automated tuning processing pipeline. If the data are corrupted by significant amounts of random telegraph noise, the bilateral filter and the rolling guidance filter are also good choices.

TI Imaging and controlling vortex dynamics in mesoscopic
   superconductor-normal-metal-superconductor arrays
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB Harnessing the properties of vortices in superconductors is crucial for fundamental science and technological applications; thus, it has been an ongoing goal to locally probe and control vortices. Here, we use a scanning probe technique that enables studies of vortex dynamics in superconducting systems by leveraging the resonant behavior of a raster-scanned, magnetic-tipped cantilever. This experimental setup allows us to image and control vortices, as well as extract key energy scales of the vortex interactions. Applying this technique to lattices of superconductor island arrays on a metal, we obtain a variety of striking spatial patterns that encode information about the energy landscape for vortices in the system. We interpret these patterns in terms of local vortex dynamics and extract the relative strengths of the characteristic energy scales in the system, such as the vortex-magnetic field and vortex-vortex interaction strengths, as well as the vortex chemical potential. We also demonstrate that the relative strengths of the interactions can be tuned and show how these interactions shift with an applied bias. The high degree of tunability and local nature of such vortex imaging and control not only enable new understanding of vortex interactions, but also have potential applications in more complex systems such as those relevant to quantum computing.

AB Hybrid quantum-classical algorithms have shown great promise in leveraging the computational potential of quantum systems. However, the efficiency of these algorithms is severely constrained by the limitations of current quantum hardware architectures. These architectures, which typically feature a decoupled design, lack both hardware support for low-latency communication and software support for fine-grained optimization.
   In this paper, we propose Qtenon, a tightly coupled system for efficient hybrid quantum-classical algorithm acceleration. Qtenon is composed of both hardware part and software part. To enable efficient communication and computation, the hardware part provides a unified memory hierarchy, an efficient quantum controller, as well as a multi-stage processing pipeline. The unified memory hierarchy functions as a communication buffer between host and quantum accelerators, with dedicated data paths and interfaces provided by the quantum controller. The multi-stage pipeline leverages hardware pipelines to fully exploit parallelism. To program hybrid quantum-classical algorithms on the hardware, our software part provides a set of instructions for data communication and computation. The instructions also enable fine-grained synchronization and efficient scheduling for quantum-host interaction. We design Qtenon as a RISC-V extended chip and implement it using Chisel. In evaluation, we achieve up to 14.9x end-to-end speedup compared to state-of-the-art work for hybrid quantum-classical algorithms.

TI Skyrmion dynamics in attractive and repulsive local magnetic fields
SO JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS
AB The study of the behavior of magnetic skyrmions in local magnetic fields' nanometric length-scale has gained increasing interest in recent years due to the theoretical proposal of magnetic skyrmion-superconducting vortex pairs as potential hosts for topologically protected bound states, which hold high promise for applications in quantum computing. From a magnetic interaction point-of-view, the key interest lies in understanding the skyrmion dynamics triggered by the magnetic energy landscape generated by the superconducting vortex. Here, we present a micromagnetic study of the dynamics of nanometric skyrmions inside a Gaussian magnetic field profile, which is used as a simplified version of the vortex magnetic flux. On the one hand, our calculations show that local non-linear magnetic fields can be very effective in controlling the dynamics of magnetic skyrmions; in particular, they offer the appealing possibility to manipulate skyrmions in a two dimensional space. On the other hand, they also show that the dynamics of a skyrmion in a local magnetic field can be manipulated via a uniform external magnetic field without any change in the magnetic field gradient. An analytical expression for the skyrmion velocity is given, and the corresponding microscopic dynamics are confirmed by the micromagnetic simulations.

TI Synergistic Effects of Interfacial Electric Fields and Cryogenic
   Temperatures on the Performance of Li-Ion Electronic Synapses
SO ADVANCED ENGINEERING MATERIALS
AB The cryogenic neuromorphic computing (NC) system is considered a potential future of computing due to its low energy consumption and high parallel computation power when combined with quantum computing (QC). However, the electronic synapse in this system, which serves as the memory function, should be positioned as close as possible to the QC to store the information generated by the QC, and it must operate effectively at cryogenic temperatures. In this work, the properties of the LiCoO2 (LCO) electronic synapse at both cryogenic and room temperatures have been thoroughly investigated. The Li-ion nanoreservoir, Al-rich LiCoO2 (LACO), is believed to perform three major functions: stabilizing the Li ions, decreasing the interfacial electric field, and reducing the leakage current. Additionally, cryogenic temperatures slow down Li-ion and electron diffusion, enhancing the influence of the electric field. As a result, the bottom electrode and temperature factors improve the performance of the LCO electronic synapse in terms of memory window (from approximate to 1.6 to approximate to 423), linearity (long-term-potentiation linearity from 3.89 to 0.97, long-term-depression linearity from -4.56 to -3.58), and spike-time-dependent plasticity (STDP) characteristics (a twofold improvement in the STDP window and a 1.5-times faster spike response time).

AB Let A be an s-sparse Hermitian matrix, f(x) be a univariate function, and i, j be two indices. In this work, we investigate the query complexity of approximating < i vertical bar f(A)vertical bar j >. We show that for any continuous function f(x):[-1,1]-> [-1,1], the quantum query complexity of computing < i vertical bar f(A)vertical bar j > +/- epsilon/4 is lower bounded by Omega((deg) over tilde (epsilon)(f)). The upper bound is at most quadratic in (deg) over tilde (epsilon)(f) and is linear in (deg) over tilde (epsilon)(f) under certain mild assumptions on A. Here the approximate degree (deg) over tilde (epsilon)(f) is the minimum degree such that there is a polynomial of that degree approximating f up to additive error epsilon in the interval [-1,1]. We also show that the classical query complexity is lower bounded by (Omega) over tilde (epsilon)((s/2)(((deg) over tilde2 epsilon(f)-1)/6)) for any s >= 4. Our results show that the quantum and classical separation is exponential for any continuous function of sparse Hermitian matrices, and also imply the optimality of implementing smooth functions of sparse Hermitian matrices by quantum singular value transformation. The main techniques we used are the dual polynomial method for functions over the reals, linear semi-infinite programming, and tridiagonal matrices.

TI Integrating 2D Materials and Plasmonics on Lithium Niobate Platforms for
   Pulsed Laser Operation at the Nanoscale
SO LASER & PHOTONICS REVIEWS
AB The current need for coherent light sources for integrated (nano)photonics motivates the search for novel laser designs emitting at technologically relevant wavelengths with high-frequency stability and low power consumption. Here, a new monolithic architecture that integrates monolayer MoS2 and chains of silver nanoparticles on a rare-earth (Nd3+) doped LiNbO3 platform is developed to demonstrate Q-switched lasing operation at the nanoscale. The localized surface plasmons provided by the nanoparticle chains spatially confine the gain generated by Nd3+ ions at subwavelength scales, and large-area monolayer MoS2 acts as saturable absorber. As a result, an ultra-compact coherent pulsed light source delivering stable train pulses with repetition rates of hundreds of kHz and pulse duration of 1 mu s is demonstrated without the need of any voltage-driven optical modulation. Moreover, the monolithic integration of the different elements is achieved without sophisticated processing, and it is compatible with LiNbO3-based photonics. The results highlight the robustness of the approach, which can be extended to other 2D materials and solid-state gain media. Potential applications in communications, quantum computing, or ultra-sensitive sensing can benefit from the synergy of the materials involved in this approach, which provides a wealth of opportunities for light control at reduced scales.

TI Designing spintronic devices in two-dimensional γ-graphyne: from
   ultrafast spin dynamics to logic applications
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS D-APPLIED PHYSICS
AB The integration of two-dimensional materials into spintronics represents a frontier in the development of novel computational devices. In this work, by utilizing ab initio many-body theory, we investigate the spin dynamics within the Co-doped gamma-graphyne structure, with a particular emphasis on the role of cobalt atoms as magnetic centers. The result reveals that each cobalt atom on the gamma-graphyne hosts states with enough spin-density localization to facilitate both local spin flips and global spin transfers. The spin-dynamic processes in our study are characterized by ultrafast time scales and high fidelities, demonstrating efficient spin control in the system. Building upon these spin-dynamic processes, we theoretically construct a spin-based Reset-Set latch, thus demonstrating the feasibility of sophisticated logic operations in our system. Such spin-based devices exhibit the advantages of nano-spintronics over conventional-electronic approaches, offering lower energy consumption, faster operational speeds, and greater potential for miniaturization. The results highlight the efficacy of gamma-graphyne nanoflakes doped with cobalt atoms as spin-information processing units, signifying a pivotal advancement in the incorporation of graphyne-based materials into sophisticated spintronic devices. This research paves the way for their application in areas such as data storage, quantum computing, and the development of complex logic-processing architectures.

TI Advances in Computational Methods for Modeling Photocatalytic Reactions:
   A Review of Recent Developments
SO MATERIALS
AB Photocatalysis is a fascinating process in which a photocatalyst plays a pivotal role in driving a chemical reaction when exposed to light. Its capacity to harness light energy triggers a cascade of reactions that lead to the formation of intermediate compounds, culminating in the desired final product(s). The essence of this process is the interaction between the photocatalyst's excited state and its specific interactions with reactants, resulting in the creation of intermediates. The process's appeal is further enhanced by its cyclic nature-the photocatalyst is rejuvenated after each cycle, ensuring ongoing and sustainable catalytic action. Nevertheless, comprehending the photocatalytic process through the modeling of photoactive materials and molecular devices demands advanced computational techniques founded on effective quantum chemistry methods, multiscale modeling, and machine learning. This review analyzes contemporary theoretical methods, spanning a range of lengths and accuracy scales, and assesses the strengths and limitations of these methods. It also explores the future challenges in modeling complex nano-photocatalysts, underscoring the necessity of integrating various methods hierarchically to optimize resource distribution across different scales. Additionally, the discussion includes the role of excited state chemistry, a crucial element in understanding photocatalysis.

TI Efficient Spin-Direction Coupling between Circular Polarized Electric
   and Magnetic Dipoles and Photonic Modes
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB Integrated single photon sources are essential elements in quantum computing, simulation, communication, and photonic neural networks. The directional radiation and scattering of single-photon sources play a crucial role in light manipulation and rely on electric and magnetic dipole moments. Although clever physical insights and designer intuition strategies have been successfully applied in the development of integrated sources, inverse strategies could enhance and maximize its performance. Recently, topology-optimized couplers for on-chip single-photon sources are designed to efficiently couple a guided mode and an electric dipole. However, the superposition of orthogonal electric and magnetic dipoles can also be harnessed due to the additional degrees of freedom via their interference. Here, the authors have extended the strategy to couplers that enhance spin-direction coupling of circularly polarized, Huygens, and Janus dipoles. The authors demonstrate that optimization not only increases the coupling to a desire mode but also enhances the electric and magnetic local density of states (LDOS) while maintaining the amplitude and phase relation between the orthogonal dipoles for unidirectional coupling. Currently, coupling efficiency and enhanced LDOS of up to 88%, 94%, and 93% and up to 9.4, 18.6, and 14.9 are obtained for these dipoles. The topology optimization improves the performances of 3D integrated photonic devices.

TI Helical Stacking Assembly of Orderly Silicon Nanowire Multilayers for
   Ultrastrong Dissymmetrical Amplification of Circularly Polarized Light
SO ADVANCED OPTICAL MATERIALS
AB Circularly polarized organic light-emitting diodes (CP-OLEDs) are ideal candidates to explore novel applications such as 3D displays, optical storage, and quantum computing. However, the low dissymmetry (g) factor of most chiral organic materials remains as a major challenge for practical applications. In this work, a helical stacking assembly of orderly silicon nanowires (hs-SiNWs) into a flexible multilayer 3D superstructure is demonstrated to accomplish a strong chiroptical activity. These orderly SiNWs are batch-fabricated via a low temperature in-plane solid-liquid-solid growth mechanism, with precisely-controlled spatial arrangement and mean diameter and length of D-nw = 126 +/- 24 nm and L-nw > 100 mu m, respectively. To construct such helically-stacked superstructure, the SiNW arrays are transferred and stacked upon transparent glass or flexible polymer substrates, with incremental rotational angle for each layer, which can strongly augment the circularly polarized electroluminescence (CPEL) from conventional CP-OLEDs. Strikingly, the dissymmetry factor increases with more stacking layer up to g = +/- 0.17, which is more than 40 times of magnitude higher than that of the original CPEL, among the highest ones reported for CP-OLEDs. These results indicate a promising helical-stacking avenue to boost the chiroptical performance of various CP-OLEDs for scalable and flexible chiroptical applications.

TI Simulating Energy Transfer in Molecular Systems with Digital Quantum
   Computers
SO JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL THEORY AND COMPUTATION
AB Quantum computers have the potential to simulate chemical systems beyond the capability of classical computers. Recent developments in hybrid quantum-classical approaches enable the determinations of the ground or low energy states of molecular systems. Here, we extend near-term quantum simulations of chemistry to time-dependent processes by simulating energy transfer in organic semiconducting molecules. We developed a multiscale modeling workflow that combines conventional molecular dynamics and quantum chemistry simulations with hybrid variational quantum algorithm to compute the exciton dynamics in both the single excitation subspace (i.e., Frenkel Hamiltonian) and the full-Hilbert space (i.e., multiexciton) regimes. Our numerical examples demonstrate the feasibility of our approach, and simulations on IBM Q devices capture the qualitative behaviors of exciton dynamics, but with considerable errors. We present an error mitigation technique that combines experimental results from the variational and Trotter algorithms, and obtain significantly improved quantum dynamics. Our approach opens up new opportunities for modeling quantum dynamics in chemical, biological, and material systems with quantum computers.

TI Efficient Simulation of Quantum Chemistry Problems in an Enlarged Basis
   Set
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB We propose a quantum algorithm to simulate the dynamics in quantum chemistry problems. It is based on adding fresh qubits at each Trotter step, which enables a simpler implementation of the dynamics in the extended system. After each step, the extra qubits are recycled, so that the whole process accurately approximates the correct unitary evolution. A key ingredient of the approach is an isometry that maps a simple diagonal Hamiltonian in the extended system to the original one, and we give a procedure to compute this isometry. We estimate the error at each time step, as well as the number of gates, which scales as O(N2), where N is the number of orbitals. We illustrate our results with three examples: the hydrogen chain, small molecules, and the FeMoco (Fe7MoS9C) molecule. In the hydrogen chain and the hydrogen molecule, we observe that the error scales in the same way as the Trotter error. For FeMoco, we estimate the number of gates in a fault-tolerant setup.

TI Enantio-Recognition and Charge Transfer Complex Formation Involving
   Tetrathiafulvalene-Appended Chiral 1,2-Cyclohexane-Diamine: An
   Integrated Experimental and Theoretical Study
SO CHIRALITY
AB In this work, we exploit the electronic features of tetrathiafulvalene (TTF) as a backbone in synthesizing chiral derivatives. The aim is to make use of TTF's well-known and unique redox and semiconducting properties in the fields of enantio-selective recognition and chiral charge transfer (CT) complex preparation, with the ultimate objective of obtaining devices with various potential applications, ranging from plasmonics to quantum computing. In particular, both cyclohexane-bis (TTF-amide)-based enantiomers 1-(S,S) and 1-(R,R), stable under an oxidation regime, have been selected, and under these conditions, the electrochemical enantiospecific response of the four possible systems, coming from the combination with L- and D-tartaric acid, respectively, was tested. The 1:tartaric acid adducts show lower oxidation potentials than the pristine 1, together with clear enantio-discrimination demonstrated by sizeable potential differences in the range of 29-46 mV between the diastereomeric adducts. Because the oxidation potential of 1 suggests the possibility of the formation of CT complexes, impedance and FT-IR spectra were recorded to confirm this hypothesis in the case of the CT complex 1:I2. The experimental results obtained through the FT-IR analysis were also compared with the theoretical results deriving from the DFT-based calculations.

TI Towards scalable cryogenic quantum dot biasing using memristor-based DC
   sources
SO CRYOGENICS
AB Cryogenic memristor-based DC sources offer a promising avenue for in situ biasing of quantum dot arrays. In this study, we present experimental results and discuss the scaling potential for such DC sources. We first demonstrate the operation of a commercial discrete operational amplifier down to 1.2 K which is used on the DC source prototype. Then, the tunability of the memristor-based DC source is validated by performing several 250 mV-DC sweeps with a resolution of 10 mV at room temperature and at 1.2 K. Additionally, the DC source prototype exhibits a limited output drift of approximate to 1 mu V s -1 at 1.2 K. This showcases the potential of memristor-based DC sources for quantum dot biasing. Limitations in power consumption and voltage resolution using discrete components highlight the need for a fully integrated and scalable complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor-based (CMOSbased) approach. To address this, we propose to monolithically co-integrate emerging non-volatile memories (eNVMs) and 65 nm CMOS circuitry. Simulations reveal a reduction in power consumption, down to 10 mu W per DC source and in footprint. This allows for the integration of up to one million eNVM-based DC sources at the 4.2 K stage of a dilution fridge, paving the way for near term large-scale quantum computing applications.

TI A 65nm Cryogenic CMOS Design and Performance at 4.2K for Quantum State
   Controller Application
SO IEEE JOURNAL OF THE ELECTRON DEVICES SOCIETY
AB A performance evaluation of cryogenic CMOS circuit at liquid-helium temperature (4.2K) is conducted using a standard 65nm bulk CMOS for quantum state controller (QSC) applications. The ON-current (Ion) of the core n/pMOSFET are increased by 25% and 9% with excellent gate modulation (Ion/Ioff= similar to 10(9)). The cryogenic characteristics of copper interconnects in the back end of the line (BEOL), including line and via resistances, capacitances, and Joule-heating effect (JHE) are accurately assessed. The interconnect and via resistances decrease with temperature due to a reduction of electron-phonon scattering, resulting in resistances that are 75% and 20% lower at 4.2K compared to those at room temperature(RT). No significant change in inter-line capacitance and no severe JHE are observed in the Cu BEOL at 4.2K. The developed cell libraries for Simulation Program with Integrated Circuit Emphasis (SPICE) model and the technology file, which includes RC interconnect parameters, enable precise design of CMOS circuits at 4.2K. This results in a demonstrated +18.3% increase in speed or -16% reduction in power consumption for ring-oscillator (ROSC) at 4.2K, aligning well with the simulation results obtained from the developed model.

TI A systematic review of the purposes of Blockchain and fog computing
   integration: classification and open issues
SO JOURNAL OF CLOUD COMPUTING-ADVANCES SYSTEMS AND APPLICATIONS
AB The fog computing concept was proposed to help cloud computing for the data processing of Internet of Things (IoT) applications. However, fog computing faces several challenges such as security, privacy, and storage. One way to address these challenges is to integrate blockchain with fog computing. There are several applications of blockchain-fog computing integration that have been proposed, recently, due to their lucrative benefits such as enhancing security and privacy. There is a need to systematically review and synthesize the literature on this topic of blockchain-fog computing integration. The purposes of integrating blockchain and fog computing were determined using a systematic literature review approach and tailored search criteria established from the research questions. In this research, 181 relevant papers were found and reviewed. The results showed that the authors proposed the combination of blockchain and fog computing for several purposes such as security, privacy, access control, and trust management. A lack of standards and laws may make it difficult for blockchain and fog computing to be integrated in the future, particularly in light of newly developed technologies like quantum computing and artificial intelligence. The findings of this paper serve as a resource for researchers and practitioners of blockchain-fog computing integration for future research and designs.

TI Spontaneous emission modulation in biaxial hyperbolic van der Waals
   material
SO JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS
AB As a natural van der Waals crystal, alpha-MoO3 has excellent in-plane hyperbolic properties and essential nanophotonics applications. However, its tunable properties are generally neglected. Here, we achieve effective modulation of spontaneous emission (SE) from a single-layer flat plate by changing the crystal directions. Numerical results and theoretical analysis show that alpha-MoO3 exhibits good tunability when the crystal directions of alpha-MoO3 are different in y-z or x-y planes. A modulation factor of more than three orders of magnitude is obtained at 634cm(-1). This phenomenon is caused by the excitation of hyperbolic phonon polaritons in alpha-MoO3 at specific bands. However, when the crystal directions of alpha-MoO3 are different in the x-z plane, the SE of the material exhibits strong angle independence. Additionally, for the semi-infinite alpha-MoO3 flat structure, we determine the distribution of the modulation factor of SE using the wavenumber and rotation angle. Finally, we extend the calculation results from semi-infinite media to finite thickness films. We obtain the general evolution law of the peak angle of the modulation factor with thickness, increasing the modulation factor to approximately 2000, which exceeds the maximum modulation factor observed in previous works by 48 times. We believe this work could guide the SE modulation of anisotropic materials and benefit the field of micro-/nano-lasers and quantum computing.

TI Advances in intelligent epitaxy of semiconductor materials
SO PROGRESS IN QUANTUM ELECTRONICS
AB The semiconductor industry is increasingly reliant on advances in epitaxial technologies to meet the demands of high-performance applications such as advanced photonics, quantum computing, and power electronics. However, the nonlinear dynamics of crystal epitaxial growth, combined with stochastic interfacial fluctuations, present significant challenges. These challenges create fundamental difficulties between the control of empirical parameters and the stringent material quality requirements, which hinder systematic improvements in material performance. This paper reviews recent progress in Intelligent Epitaxy, a transformative framework that employs an autonomous architecture consisting of sensing, decision-making, and execution. This framework integrates machine learning with precise characterization and control through three core modules: the Multimodal Sensing Module, the Knowledge-Informed Decision Module, and the Adaptive Control Module. Together, these modules enable comprehensive monitoring of growth dynamics, causal analysis of the relationships between parameters, growth states, and outcomes, as well as the autonomous regulation of growth processes. Additionally, we discuss and address current challenges and issues in this field, providing insights and perspectives for future research. Our review aims to guide the development of a new technological trajectory that goes beyond traditional approaches, positioning intelligent epitaxy as the foundation for next-generation autonomous semiconductor manufacturing.

TI Emerging Ta4C3 and
   Mo2Ti2C3 MXene Nanosheets for Ultrafast
   Photonics
SO ADVANCED OPTICAL MATERIALS
AB Ultrafast nonlinear optical (NLO) response, fast carrier recovery, broadband absorption, and resistance to radiation and heat make 2D materials promising for photonic technologies. However, low electronic conductivity and carrier concentration limit the performance of semiconducting or semimetallic materials. This work investigates the ultrafast NLO properties and carrier dynamics of Ta4C3Tx and out-of-plane ordered Mo2Ti2C3Tx MXenes using Z-scan and pump-probe optical Kerr effect techniques under visible and infrared femtosecond laser pulses. Their NLO response surpasses all previously studied MXenes and most other 2D nanomaterials, attaining exceptionally high third-order susceptibility (chi(3)) values on the order of 10-13 esu. Mo2Ti2C3Tx exhibits the strongest NLO response under both excitation regimes, attributed to charge transfer between Mo and Ti layers in the MXene structure. Under visible excitation, the studied MXenes display pronounced saturable absorption, while under infrared excitation, they exhibit strong reverse saturable absorption, resulting in efficient optical limiting. Additionally, pump-probe experiments identify two distinct relaxation processes: a fast one on the sub-picosecond timescale and a slower one a few picoseconds after photoexcitation. The results indicate that these MXenes are among the strongest NLO materials. They show their great potential for advanced photonic and optoelectronic applications in laser technologies, optical protection, telecommunications, and optical/quantum computing.

TI Evidence for efficient anchoring in nitroxyl radical thin films: an
   experimental XPS/NEXAFS and theoretical DFT/TD-DFT study
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY C
AB Studies of persistent organic radical films on conductive metal surfaces can pave the way for diverse applications such as improved spin probes and labels, data control and storage, spintronics, and quantum computing. We grew monolayer films of three nitroxyl radicals (NRs), viz. TEMPO and two carbamoyl-proxyl radicals (nit8 and nit9) under ultra-high vacuum conditions on Au(111) and Cu(111) surfaces. The electronic properties of the films and NR adsorption mechanisms were analyzed by means of X-ray photoelectron (XPS) and absorption (NEXAFS) spectroscopies, with the aid of density functional theory (DFT) and time-dependent DFT computations performed on large unit cells (rev-PBE) and clusters (CAM-B3LYP). We found that all three NRs physisorb weakly on Au. In the case of nit8 and nit9, H-bonded monolayers are formed that recline parallel to the Au surface. Stronger interactions with Cu resulted in chemisorption and robust films, with nit8 and nit9 exhibiting upright orientation due to the amide group acting as an efficient binding anchor. Conversely, TEMPO binds to Cu necessarily via NO which is observed to lead to the destruction of the spin-carrying NO functionality. Computational evidence highlighted the decisive role of Cu surface defects in the partial fragmentation of the CONH2 anchor upon chemisorption of nit8 and nit9.
   Nitroxide radicals' adsorption mechanisms and film properties tunable by appropriately selecting the substrate.

TI Hosohedral nodal-line superconductivity in hexagonal ABC Dirac
   semimetals
SO COMMUNICATIONS PHYSICS
AB The recently identified hexagonal non-polar phase of KZnBi, an archetypal topological semimetal, has been found to cohost superconductivity on the surface. We propose that KZnBi can realize an unconventional topological superconductor featuring the hosohedral formation of nodal lines and Bogoliubov Fermi surface emerging under a magnetic field. Our density functional theory (DFT)-based low-energy model shows that the nonsymmorphic band degeneracy of the Dirac bands generically triggers topological nodal line superconductivity fostered by inter-band Coulomb interaction. In particular, the nodal lines of the gap resemble a hexagonal hosohedron with the Schlafli symbol of {2, 6}. Remarkably, the holohedral nodal line superconductor defines the topological phase boundary of the Bogoliubov Fermi surface in the limit where time-reversal symmetry is restored. Our results demonstrate that line nodes readily inflate to the Bogoliubov Fermi surface under an external magnetic field. We provide an experimentally verifiable explanation for the observed superconductivity and suggest a feasible platform for observing topological superconductivity in the hexagonal ABC ternary systems class.
   Topological superconductivity is anticipated to provide an appropriate platform for realizing Majorana fermions, garnering significant interest for the development of quantum computing. Here, using DFT and many-body mean-field theory, the authors investigate the bulk superconductivity of KZnBi where their calculations suggest the presence of hosohedral nodal-line superconductivity.

TI Classical and Quantum Processing in the Deep Physical Layer
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB The objective of this paper is to examine the processing of the electromagnetic field in the physical communication channel of wireless systems using the concept of the "Deep Physical Layer" (DPL), a layer that is positioned below the Physical Layer of the OSI model. The article delves into the fundamental concept of DPL and presents several numerical findings on devices that can process the field directly in the DPL. These devices are called Electromagnetic field Processing Devices (EPDs) and consist of reflective elements that are extensively distributed in space. They can intelligently modify the spatial configuration of the electromagnetic field to achieve efficient processing. The study reveals that EPDs offer the potential to encode a massive amount of information in the spatial domain. Additionally, the results suggest that quantum computers are an indispensable technology to gain unrestricted access to the large resources that utilizing EPDs in the DPL can unlock. To fully utilize this vast resource necessitates addressing the challenge of searching an unstructured database, which poses a difficulty for classical computers. However, this problem can be efficiently solved by quantum computers using Grover's algorithm.

TI A Scalable Small-Signal and Noise Model for High-Electron-Mobility
   Transistors Working Down to Cryogenic Temperatures
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON MICROWAVE THEORY AND TECHNIQUES
AB This article reports on a scalable, temperature-dependent small-signal and noise model of a 50-nm metamorphic high-electron-mobility transistor (HEMT) technology. The model is valid for temperatures ranging from 5 to 297 K. The highest scalability is achieved by using a distributed model topology. The model is able to predict the small-signal and noise performance of 2-8 finger transistors with absolute gate widths ranging from 10 to 480 mu m. Short gate width transistor fingers (5 mu m) and wide transistor fingers (100 mu m) are covered by the model. The model is valid over a very broad bandwidth from 0.1 to at least 150 GHz. Furthermore, the model covers all reasonable bias points of the given transistor technology. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first scalable HEMT model that is able to predict the small-signal and noise performance at arbitrary cryogenic temperatures. The scaling ratio related to the absolute gate width of the model is the highest among small-signal models reported in the literature.

TI Difference of Convex Algorithm for Warm-Start Quantum Approximate
   Optimization Algorithm
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB The Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) stands as a hybrid classical-quantum algorithm utilized for addressing combinatorial optimization challenges. Central to its effectiveness is the initial mixer, which is responsible for instigating the optimization process by generating the starting state. However, conventional QAOA implementations often assign equal probabilities to all solutions at the outset, potentially resulting in suboptimal performance when tackling complex combinatorial optimization problems. In this study, a novel enhancement is proposed to the QAOA, leveraging the Difference of Convex Algorithm (DCA). This method aims to refine QAOA's performance by facilitating the discovery of optimal parameters through a continuous warm-start approach, as originally introduced by Egger et al. Through experimentation utilizing datasets from prior studies focusing on the weighted maximum cut problem, the efficacy of our proposed method is evaluated. Comparative analysis against existing methodologies reveals a significant improvement in the approximate ratio achieved by our approach.

TI Aharonov-Bohm Caging of an Electron in a Quantum Fractal
SO PHYSICA STATUS SOLIDI-RAPID RESEARCH LETTERS
AB Fractal geometries exhibit complex structures with scale invariance self-similar pattern over various length scales. An artificially designed quantum fractal geometry embedded in a uniform magnetic flux has been explored in this study. It has been found that due to quantum mechanical effect, such quantum fractal display an exotic electronic property, which is reflected in its transport characteristics. Owing to this uniform magnetic flux piercing through each closed-loop building block of the fractal structure, an electron traversing through such a fractal geometry will pick up a nontrivial Aharonov-Bohm phase factor, which will influence its transport through the system. It is shown that, one can completely block the transmission of an electron in this fractal geometry by setting the value of the uniform magnetic flux to half flux quantum. This phenomenon of Aharonov-Bohm caging of an electron in this quantum fractal geometry has been supported by the computation of the energy spectrum, two-terminal transport and persistent current in its various generations. This result is very robust against disorder and could be useful in designing efficient quantum algorithms using a quantum fractal network.

TI Post-quantum anonymous authentication for Web3: a lattice-based
   decentralized linkable anonymous credential scheme
SO JOURNAL OF SUPERCOMPUTING
AB Web3, the next-generation decentralized Internet aimed at providing secure and user-centric network services, has attracted significant attention. Anonymous credentials, a privacy-preserving authentication technique, allow users to prove possession of specific qualifications or attributes without disclosing additional identity information. Although lattice-based anonymous credentials have been proposed to counter quantum computing threats, their reliance on trusted issuers introduces risks of single points of failure and limits their compatibility with Web3. To address these challenges, we propose a lattice-based anonymous credential scheme with threshold credential issuance. In our solution, a valid credential proof can be generated only if the user obtains partial credentials from at least t out of N authorities, thereby showing possession of the user attributes required for service access. To mitigate the risk of credential abuse and prevent financial losses for service providers, we enhance the proposed anonymous credential system by introducing linkability. All credential proofs generated by the same user for the same event are linked, and their anonymity can be forcibly revoked to trace the user's identity. The proposed scheme achieves anonymity, unforgeability, and linkability, constituting a post-quantum solution for privacy-preserving authentication in Web3. Concrete parameters are also provided to instantiate our scheme with 128-bit security.

TI PQES: Post-quantum encryption and signature scheme based on
   FFT-accelerated polynomial ring lattice for IoT devices
SO JOURNAL OF SYSTEMS ARCHITECTURE
AB With the rapid advancement of quantum computing, traditional public-key cryptosystems (e.g., RSA and ECC) are facing severe threats from quantum attacks (e.g., Shor's algorithm). To address the demand for efficient and secure communication in resource-constrained scenarios such as the Internet of Things (IoT), this paper proposes an integrated quantum-resistant encryption and signature scheme based on polynomial ring lattices and accelerated by the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). The scheme combines the Ring Learning With Errors (Ring-LWE) and Ring-LWE-Short Integer Solution (Ring-SIS) problems, optimizing operations over the polynomial ring Zq[x]/(xN + 1) to significantly reduce key and ciphertext sizes. Additionally, FFT techniques are introduced to accelerate polynomial multiplication, while finite field FFT and floating-point error correction mechanisms address precision issues. Experimental results demonstrate that for polynomial degrees N >= 1024, the encryption time is reduced by 23% compared to CRYSTALS-Kyber, with a 35% decrease in memory consumption. Moreover, Our signature verification mechanism demonstrates significantly lower resource consumption compared to both CRYSTALS-Dilithium and Falcon implementations under equivalent security parameters, making it suitable for low-overhead verification on edge devices and efficient signing on servers.

TI Grating Coupler Design for Low-Cost Fabrication in Amorphous Silicon
   Photonic Integrated Circuits
SO PHOTONICS
AB Photonic circuits find applications in biomedicine, manufacturing, quantum computing and communications. Photonic waveguides are crucial components, typically having cross-section orders of magnitude inferior when compared with other photonic components (e.g., optical fibers, light sources and photodetectors). Several light-coupling methods exist, consisting of either on-plane (e.g., adiabatic and end-fire coupling) or off-plane methods (e.g., grating and vertical couplers). The grating coupler is a versatile light-transference technique which can be tested at wafer level, not requiring specific fiber terminations or additional optical components, like lenses, polarizers or prisms. This study focuses on fully-etched grating couplers without a bottom reflector, made from hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H), deposited over a silica substrate. Different coupler designs were tested, and of these we highlight two: the superimposition of two lithographic masks with different periods and an offset between them to create a random distribution and a technique based on the quadratic refractive-index variation along the device's length. Results were obtained by 2D-FDTD simulation. The designed grating couplers achieve coupling efficiencies for the TE-like mode over -8 dB (mask overlap) and -3 dB (quadratic variation), at a wavelength of 1550 nm. The coupling scheme considers a 220 nm a-Si:H waveguide and an SMF-28 optical fiber.

TI Thermal Stability of SU-8 Low-Loss Optical Coupling Interconnects at 850
   nm
SO IEEE PHOTONICS TECHNOLOGY LETTERS
AB Ultra-low-loss optical coupling between photonic circuits and components is crucial in many applications such as photonic quantum computing, sensing and optical communications. This letter presents the thermal stability of a SU-8 based taper optical interconnect by characterizing its optical coupling efficiency (CE) and structural robustness after exposure to elevated temperatures. The taper is heated from 280 degrees C to 400 degrees C for duration from 1 min to 120 min. The experimental results reveal that CE loss is linear with the duration of the high temperature, while the relation between the temperature and duration adheres to a logarithmic model at a specific CE loss level. This offers a valuable means to predict the maximum temperature and duration before exceeding a CE loss threshold, enabling the determination of material processing. A limit temperature-duration curve for a maximum 0.1 dB optical coupling degradation is derived. This analysis demonstrates that the SU-8 tapers can withstand a temperature of 300 degrees C for 9 min and 350 degrees C for 1min and 30 s with less than 0.1 dB optical loss. The structural mechanical stability of the taper is confirmed up to 400 degrees C for 1 hour, well above the aforementioned optical limit.

TI Machine learning assisted construction of a shallow depth dynamic ansatz
   for noisy quantum hardware
SO CHEMICAL SCIENCE
AB The development of various dynamic ansatz-constructing techniques has ushered in a new era, making the practical exploitation of Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) hardware for molecular simulations increasingly viable. However, such ansatz construction protocols incur substantial measurement costs during their execution. This work involves the development of a novel protocol that capitalizes on regenerative machine learning methodologies and many-body perturbation theoretical measures to construct a highly expressive and shallow ansatz within the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) framework with limited measurement costs. The regenerative machine learning model used in our work is trained with the basis vectors of a low-rank expansion of the N-electron Hilbert space to identify the dominant high-rank excited determinants without requiring a large number of quantum measurements. These selected excited determinants are iteratively incorporated within the ansatz through their low-rank decomposition. The reduction in the number of quantum measurements and ansatz depth manifests in the robustness of our method towards hardware noise, as demonstrated through numerical applications. Furthermore, the proposed method is highly compatible with state-of-the-art neural error mitigation techniques. This resource-efficient approach is quintessential for determining spectroscopic and other molecular properties, thereby facilitating the study of emerging chemical phenomena in the near-term quantum computing framework.

TI AlCl3-Dosed Si(100)-2 x 1: Adsorbates, Chlorinated Al Chains,
   and Incorporated Al
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY C
AB The adsorption of AlCl3 on Si(100) and the effect of annealing the AlCl3-dosed substrate were studied to reveal key surface processes for the development of atomic-precision, acceptor-doping techniques. This investigation was performed via scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. At room temperature, AlCl3 readily adsorbed to the Si substrate dimers and dissociated to form a variety of species. Annealing the AlCl3-dosed substrate at temperatures below 450 degrees C produced unique chlorinated aluminum chains (CACs) elongated along the Si(100) dimer row direction. An atomic model for the chains is proposed with supporting DFT calculations. Al was incorporated into the Si substrate upon annealing at 450 degrees C and above, and Cl desorption was observed for temperatures beyond 450 degrees C. Al-incorporated samples were encapsulated in Si and characterized by secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) depth profiling to quantify the Al atom concentration, which was found to be in excess of 1020 cm(-3) across a similar to 2.7 nm-thick d-doped region. The Al concentration achieved here and the processing parameters utilized promote AlCl3 as a viable gaseous precursor for novel acceptor-doped Si materials and devices for quantum computing.

AB Linear Software Models enable rigorous linear algebraic procedures for modular design of classical software systems. These procedures apply a spectral approach to matrix representations - e.g. the Laplacian - of the software system.
   Recent intensive research efforts towards quantum computers have increased expectations that quantum computing could in due time materialize as a practical alternative to classical computing. It is reasonable to inquire about quantum software desirable features and prepare in advance modular design procedures for quantum software systems.
   However, it does not make sense to have two totally separate procedures for modular design, one for classical software systems and another for quantum software systems. This paper claims that there should be just a single unified and rigorous design procedure for both classical and quantum software systems.
   Our common design procedure starting point for both classical and quantum software systems is Von Neumann's quantum notion of Density Operator and its Density Matrix representation. This paper formulates and demonstrates modular design in terms of projection operators obtained from a design Density Matrix and shows their equivalence to the Linear Software Models results of the Laplacian matrix spectrum for the classical case. The application in practice of the design procedure for both classical and quantum software is illustrated by case studies.

TI Determination of ligand field parameters of single-molecule magnets from
   magnetic susceptibility using deep learning based inverse models
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB Lanthanide-based single-molecule magnets (SMMs) have garnered extensive attention in recent decades for their potential applications in magnetic memory and quantum computing. In ligand field theory, the magnetic properties of a lanthanide ion may have to be characterized by up to 27 ligand field parameters. However, common experimental data such as temperature-dependent susceptibility curves measured on powder samples typically lack distinctive features. This leads to a massive over-parametrization, where multiple parameter sets can equally describe the data. In this work the issue is tackled by applying a deep learning architecture which combines a variational autoencoder (VAE) with an invertible neural network (INN). This VAE-INN architecture is shown to be capable of determining multiple ligand field parameter sets by extracting hidden parameters from the magnetic data and mapping them to the space of ligand field parameters. The approach is tested on simulated and experimental susceptibility data in magnetic models involving second-order ligand field parameters and is gradually extended to higher-order parameters until it is found limited by dimensionality issues. Compared with traditional least-squares fitting methods, the proposed approach exhibits enhanced generalization, robustness, and convergence. The present investigation of the VAE-INN architecture can be hoped to pave the way for further exploration of higher-order ligand field parameters.

TI Short-Term Power Load Forecasting Based on the Quantum Genetic Algorithm
   Artificial Recurrent Memory Network
SO ELECTRONICS
AB Accurate power load forecasting is crucial for maintaining the equilibrium between power supply and demand and for safeguarding the stability of power systems. Through a comprehensive optimization of both the parameters and structure of the traditional load forecasting model, this study developed a short-term power load prediction model (QGA-RMNN) based on a quantum genetic algorithm to optimize an artificial recurrent memory network. The model utilizes the principle of quantum computing to improve the search mechanism of the genetic algorithm. It also combines the memory characteristics of the recurrent neural network, combining the advantages of the maturity and stability of traditional algorithms, as well as the intelligence and efficiency of advanced algorithms, and optimizes the memory, input, and output units of the LSTM network by using the artificial excitation network, thus improving the prediction accuracy. Then, the hyperparameters of the RMNN are optimized using quantum genetics. After that, the proposed prediction model was rigorously validated using case studies employing load datasets from a microgrid and the Elia grid in Belgium, Europe, and was compared and analyzed against the classical LSTM, GA-RBF, GM-BP, and other algorithms. Compared to existing algorithms, the results show that this model demonstrates significant advantages in predictive performance, offering an effective solution for enhancing the accuracy and stability of load forecasting.

TI Quantum service-oriented computing: current landscape and challenges
SO SOFTWARE QUALITY JOURNAL
AB The development that quantum computing technologies are achieving is beginning to attract the interest of companies that could potentially be users of quantum software. Thus, it is perfectly feasible that during the next few years hybrid systems will start to appear integrating both the classical software systems of companies and new quantum ones providing solutions to problems that still remain unmanageable today. A natural way to support such integration is Service-Oriented Computing. While conceptually the invocation of a quantum software service is similar to that of a classical one, technically there are many differences and technological limitations, which refer to platform independence, decoupling, scalability, etc. To highlight these differences and the difficulties to develop quality quantum services, this paper takes a well-known problem to which a quantum solution can be provided, integer factorization, making use of the Amazon Braket quantum service platform. The exercise of trying to provide the factorization as a quantum service is carried out following the best practices, design patterns and standards existing in the implementation of classical services. This case study is used to highlight the rough edges and limitations that arise in the integration of classical-quantum hybrid systems using service-oriented computing. The conclusion of the study allows us to point out directions in which to focus research efforts in order to achieve effective quantum service-oriented computing.

TI Self-Powered InP Nanowire Photodetector for Single-Photon Level
   Detection at Room Temperature
SO ADVANCED MATERIALS
AB Highly sensitive photodetectors with single-photon level detection are one of the key components to a range of emerging technologies, in particular the ever-growing field of optical communication, remote sensing, and quantum computing. Currently, most of the single-photon detection technologies require external biasing at high voltages and/or cooling to low temperatures, posing great limitations for wider applications. Here, InP nanowire array photodetectors that can achieve single-photon level light detection at room temperature without an external bias are demonstrated. Top-down etched, heavily doped p-type InP nanowires and n-type aluminium-doped zinc oxide (AZO)/zinc oxide (ZnO) carrier-selective contact are used to form a radial p-n junction with a built-in electric field exceeding 3 x 10(5) V cm(-1) at 0 V. The device exhibits broadband light sensitivity and can distinguish a single photon per pulse from the dark noise at 0 V, enabled by its design to realize near-ideal broadband absorption, extremely low dark current, and highly efficient charge carrier separation. Meanwhile, the bandwidth of the device reaches above 600 MHz with a timing jitter of 538 ps. The proposed device design provides a new pathway toward low-cost, high-sensitivity, self-powered photodetectors for numerous future applications.

TI Multiple topological phases of magnons induced by Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya
   and pseudodipolar anisotropic exchange interactions in kagome
   ferromagnets
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB Kagome magnets naturally hosting Dirac points and flat bands exhibit novel topological phases, enabling rich interplays between interactions and topologies. The discovery of two-dimensional (2D) magnets generally coexisting with different types of magnetic interactions poses a challenge for topological magnonic manipulation. Here we investigate the topological magnon phases of 2D kagome ferromagnet with multiple magnetic anisotropic interactions, i.e., Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) and pseudodipolar interaction (PDI). It is found that the different sole magnetic anisotropic interactions introduce completely distinct topological phase diagrams and topological states. The multiple topological magnon phases with high Chern number emerge due to the distinct anisotropic interactions. Moreover, the interplay of the multiple anisotropic DMI and PDI interactions involved with Dirac and flat bands controls a variety of topological phase transitions, implying greater manipulation potential. In addition, the sign reversal of thermal Hall and Nernst conductivities induced by temperature is found in particular topological phase regions, namely topological origin, relating to the energy gap and Berry curvature (Chern number) in the vicinity of magnetic phase transition from the thermal fluctuations, providing a possible explanation for the experimental puzzles. All these results demonstrate that the novel topological magnonic properties in kagome magnet with multiple magnetic anisotropic interactions can realize a potential platform for magnonic devices and quantum computing.

AB Financial market forecasting remains challenging due to complex nonlinear dynamics and regime-dependent behaviors that traditional models struggle to capture effectively. This research introduces the Adaptive Financial Reservoir Network with Hypernetwork Flow (AFRN-HyperFlow) framework, a novel ensemble architecture integrating Echo State Networks, temporal convolutional networks, mixture density networks, adaptive Hypernetworks, and deep state-space models for enhanced financial time-series prediction. Through comprehensive feature engineering incorporating technical indicators, spectral decomposition, reservoir-based representations, and flow dynamics characteristics, the framework achieves superior forecasting performance across diverse market conditions. Experimental validation on 26,817 balanced samples demonstrates exceptional results with an F1-score of 0.8947, representing a 12.3% improvement over State-of-the-Art baseline methods, while maintaining robust performance across asset classes from equities to cryptocurrencies. The adaptive Hypernetwork mechanism enables real-time regime-change detection with 2.3 days average lag and 95% accuracy, while systematic SHAP analysis provides comprehensive interpretability essential for regulatory compliance. Ablation studies reveal Echo State Networks contribute 9.47% performance improvement, validating the architectural design. The AFRN-HyperFlow framework addresses critical limitations in uncertainty quantification, regime adaptability, and interpretability, offering promising directions for next-generation financial forecasting systems incorporating quantum computing and federated learning approaches.

TI Braided interferometer mesh for robust photonic matrix-vector
   multiplications with non-ideal components
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Matrix-vector multiplications (MVMs) are essential for a wide range of applications, particularly in modern machine learning and quantum computing. In photonics, there is growing interest in developing architectures capable of performing linear operations with high speed, low latency, and minimal loss. Traditional interferometric photonic architectures, such as the Clements design, have been extensively used for MVM operations. However, as these architectures scale, improving stability and robustness becomes critical. In this paper, we introduce a novel photonic braid interferometer architecture that outperforms both the Clements and Fldzhyan designs in these aspects. Using numerical simulations, we evaluate the performance of these architectures under ideal conditions and systematically introduce non-idealities such as insertion losses, beam splitter imbalances, and crosstalk. The results demonstrate that the braid architecture offers superior robustness due to its symmetrical design and reduced layer count. Further analysis shows that the braid architecture is particularly advantageous in large-scale implementations, delivering better performance as the size of the interferometer increases. We also assess the footprint and total insertion losses of each architecture. Although waveguide crossings in the braid architecture slightly increase the footprint and insertion loss, recent advances in crossing technology significantly minimize these effects. Our study suggests that the braid architecture is a robust solution for photonic neuromorphic computing, maintaining high fidelity in realistic conditions where imperfections are inevitable.

TI All-optical manipulation of bandgap dynamics via coherent phonons
SO OPTICA
AB The ability to actively and dynamically control electronic states at ultrafast timescales opens up a wide range of potential applications across optoelectronics, quantum computing and sensing, energy conversion and storage, etc. Yet, achieving dynamic electronic manipulation via coherent phonons has posed a considerable challenge. Here, employing time- resolved high-harmonic generation (tr-HHG) spectroscopy, we demonstrate the manipulation of bandgap dynamics in a BaF2 crystal by coherent phonons. The tr-HHG spectrum perturbed by a triply degenerate phonon mode T2g exhibits simultaneously a remarkable two-dimensional (2D) sensitivity, i.e., in both intensity and energy domains. The dynamic compression and enhancement of the harmonics in the intensity domain showed a pi / 2 phase shift compared to the manifestation of shifts of the harmonics in the energy domain, an astounding example of a physical phenomenon being observed simultaneously in two different perspectives. We employed a quantum model incorporating the electron- phonon coupling to complement our experimental observations, successfully reproducing the results. In addition, we demonstrated complete control over the strength and initial phase of the coherent phonon oscillations by varying the incident electric field polarizations across different crystal orientations. Our findings lay a foundation for engineering the electronic structure through coherent phonons within the terahertz frequency and picosecond to nanosecond time regimes.

TI Edge-induced excitations in Bi2Te3 from spatially-resolved electron
   energy-gain spectroscopy
SO ULTRAMICROSCOPY
AB Among the many potential applications of topological insulator materials, their broad potential for the development of novel tunable plasmonics at THz and mid-infrared frequencies for quantum computing, terahertz detectors, and spintronic devices is particularly attractive. The required understanding of the intricate relationship between nanoscale crystal structure and the properties of the resulting plasmonic resonances remains, however, elusive for these materials. Specifically, edge-and surface-induced plasmonic resonances, and other collective excitations, are often buried beneath the continuum of electronic transitions, making it difficult to isolate and interpret these signals using techniques such as electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS). Here we focus on the experimentally clean energy-gain EELS region to characterise collective excitations in the topologically insulating material Bi2Te3 and correlate them with the underlying crystalline structure with nanoscale resolution. We identify with high significance the presence of a distinct energy-gain peak around -0.8 eV, with spatially-resolved maps revealing that its intensity is markedly enhanced at the edge regions of the specimen. Our findings illustrate the reach of energy-gain EELS analyses to accurately map collective excitations in quantum materials, a key asset in the quest towards new tunable plasmonic devices.

TI Sensor Duty Cycle for Prolonging Network Lifetime Using Quantum Clone
   Grey Wolf Optimization Algorithm in Industrial Wireless Sensor Networks
SO JOURNAL OF SENSORS
AB The application of industrial wireless sensor networks (IWSNs) frequently appears in modern industry, and it is usually to deploy a large quantity of sensor nodes in the monitoring area. This way of deployment improves the robustness of the IWSNs but introduces many redundant nodes, thereby increasing unnecessary overhead. The purpose of this paper is to increase the lifetime of IWSNs without changing the physical facilities and ensuring the coverage of sensors as much as possible. Therefore, we propose a quantum clone grey wolf optimization (QCGWO) algorithm, design a sensor duty cycle model (SDCM) based on real factory conditions, and use the QCGWO to optimize the SDCM. Specifically, QCGWO combines the concept of quantum computing and the clone operation for avoiding the algorithm from falling into a local optimum. Subsequently, we compare the proposed algorithm with the genetic algorithm (GA) and simulated annealing (SA) algorithm. The experimental results suggest that the lifetime of the IWSNs based on QCGWO is longer than that of GA and SA, and the convergence speed of QCGWO is also faster than that of GA and SA. In comparison with the traditional IWSN working mode, our model and algorithm can effectively prolong the lifetime of IWSNs, thus greatly reducing the maintenance cost without replacing sensor nodes in actual industrial production.

TI A Computational Interpretation of Compact Closed Categories: Reversible
   Programming with Negative and Fractional Types
SO PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACM ON PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES-PACMPL
AB Compact closed categories include objects representing higher-order functions and are well-established as models of linear logic, concurrency, and quantum computing. We show that it is possible to construct such compact closed categories for conventional sum and product types by defining a dual to sum types, a negative type, and a dual to product types, a fractional type. Inspired by the categorical semantics, we define a sound operational semantics for negative and fractional types in which a negative type represents a computational effect that "reverses execution flow" and a fractional type represents a computational effect that "garbage collects" particular values or throws exceptions.
   Specifically, we extend a first-order reversible language of type isomorphisms with negative and fractional types, specify an operational semantics for each extension, and prove that each extension forms a compact closed category. We furthermore show that both operational semantics can be merged using the standard combination of backtracking and exceptions resulting in a smooth interoperability of negative and fractional types. We illustrate the expressiveness of this combination by writing a reversible SAT solver that uses backtracking search along freshly allocated and de-allocated locations. The operational semantics, most of its meta-theoretic properties, and all examples are formalized in a supplementary Agda package.

TI Hybrid classical-quantum autoencoder for anomaly detection
SO QUANTUM MACHINE INTELLIGENCE
AB We propose a hybrid classical-quantum autoencoder (HAE) model, which is a synergy of a classical autoencoder (AE) and a parametrized quantum circuit (PQC) that is inserted into its bottleneck. The PQC augments the classical latent space by lifting it to a quantum latent space whereby further data manipulations occur before performing a measurement and collapsing the state to its original classical latent space representation. From this resulting data, a standard outlier detection method is applied to search for anomalous data points within a classical dataset. Using this model and applying it to both standard benchmarking datasets, and a specific use-case dataset, which relates to predictive maintenance of gas power plants, we show that the addition of the PQC to the autoencoder bottleneck leads to a performance enhancement in terms of precision, recall, and F1 score. Furthermore, we probe different PQC Ansatze and analyze which PQC features make them effective for this task.

TI Prediction of the Topologically Nontrivial Phase in Three-Dimensional
   ABX Zintl Compounds
SO ACS OMEGA
AB Zintl compounds have garnered research interest due to their diverse technological applications. Utilizing first-principles calculations, we performed a systematic study of ABX (A = Li, Na, K, Rb, or Cs; B = Si, Ge, Sn, or Pb; and X = P, As, Sb, or Bi) Zintl materials with the P63 mc KSnSb-type structure. Notably, six ABX Zintl compounds (RbSiBi, CsSiBi, LiGeBi, KGeBi, RbGeBi, and CsGeBi) were found to have topologically nontrivial phases, as demonstrated by the Z 2 invariant computed using the hybrid functional HSE06. Among them, RbGeBi and CsGeBi were identified as topological insulators with nontrivial bandgaps of 28 and 116 meV, respectively. The topological phase transition arises as a result of spin-orbit coupling, as demonstrated in the representative material, CsGeBi. Additionally, the existence of gapless surface states further confirmed the topologically nontrivial phases of the six materials. Moreover, phonon spectra and formation energy calculations verified that all identified nontrivial materials under the hybrid functional are dynamically and structurally stable, except LiGeBi which exhibited imaginary phonon frequencies. Finally, the thermodynamic stability of the representative material CsGeBi was verified through elastic constants and ab initio molecular dynamics simulations. These results provide foundational insights that could drive further experimental research and synthesis, potentially enabling the application of ABX Zintl compounds in electronic technologies such as quantum computing or spintronics.

TI Learning with Limited Samples: Meta-Learning and Applications to
   Communication Systems
SO FOUNDATIONS AND TRENDS IN SIGNAL PROCESSING
AB Deep learning has achieved remarkable success in many machine learning tasks such as image classification, speech recognition, and game playing. However, these breakthroughs are often difficult to translate into real-world engineering systems because deep learning models require a massive number of training samples, which are costly to obtain in practice. To address labeled data scarcity, few-shot meta-learning optimizes learning algorithms that can efficiently adapt to new tasks quickly. While meta-learning is gaining significant interest in the machine learning literature, its working principles and theoretic fundamentals are not as well understood in the engineering community.
   This review monograph provides an introduction to meta-learning by covering principles, algorithms, theory, and engineering applications. After introducing meta-learning in comparison with conventional and joint learning, we describe the main meta-learning algorithms, as well as a general bilevel optimization framework for the definition of meta-learning techniques. Then, we summarize known results on the generalization capabilities of meta-learning from a statistical learning viewpoint. Applications to communication systems, including decoding and power allocation, are discussed next, followed by an introduction to aspects related to the integration of meta-learning with emerging computing technologies, namely neuromorphic and quantum computing. The monograph is concluded with an overview of open research challenges.

TI Topologically trivial gap-filling in superconducting Fe(Se,Te) by
   one-dimensional defects
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Structural distortions and imperfections are a crucial aspect of materials science, on the macroscopic scale providing strength, but also enhancing corrosion and reducing electrical and thermal conductivity. At the nanometre scale, multi-atom imperfections, such as atomic chains and crystalline domain walls have conversely been proposed as a route to topological superconductivity, whose most prominent characteristic is the emergence of Majorana Fermions that can be used for error-free quantum computing. Here, we shed more light on the nature of purported domain walls in Fe(Se,Te) that may host 1D dispersing Majorana modes. We show that the displacement shift of the atomic lattice at these line-defects results from sub-surface impurities that warp the topmost layer(s). Using the electric field between the tip and sample, we manage to reposition the sub-surface impurities, directly visualizing the displacement shift and the underlying defect-free lattice. These results, combined with observations of a completely different type of 1D defect where superconductivity remains fully gapped, highlight the topologically trivial nature of 1D defects in Fe(Se,Te).
   Previous measurements of FeSe0.45Te0.55 found one-dimensional (1D) defects that were interpretated as domain walls hosting propagating Majorana topological modes. Here, the authors reveal that these 1D defects correspond to sub-surface debris and show that the filling of the superconducting gap on these defects is topologically trivial.

TI A Fast Hybrid Classification Algorithm with Feature Reduction for
   Medical Images
SO APPLIED BIONICS AND BIOMECHANICS
AB In this paper, we are introducing a fast hybrid fuzzy classification algorithm with feature reduction for medical images. We incorporated the quantum-based grasshopper computing algorithm (QGH) with feature extraction using fuzzy clustering technique (C-means). QGH integrates quantum computing into machine learning and intelligence applications. The objective of our technique is to the integrate QGH method, specifically into cervical cancer detection that is based on image processing. Many features such as color, geometry, and texture found in the cells imaged in Pap smear lab test are very crucial in cancer diagnosis. Our proposed technique is based on the extraction of the best features using a more than 2600 public Pap smear images and further applies feature reduction technique to reduce the feature space. Performance evaluation of our approach evaluates the influence of the extracted feature on the classification precision by performing two experimental setups. First setup is using all the extracted features which leads to classification without feature bias. The second setup is a fusion technique which utilized QGH with the fuzzy C-means algorithm to choose the best features. In the setups, we allocate the assessment to accuracy based on the selection of best features and of different categories of the cancer. In the last setup, we utilized a fusion technique engaged with statistical techniques to launch a qualitative agreement with the feature selection in several experimental setups.

AB This review paper focuses on semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) embedded inside semiconductor heterostructures prepared by Metalorganic Vapor Phase Epitaxy (MOVPE) technology and based on our contribution in [1]. Semiconductor direct-bandgap materials have much higher energy conversion efficiency than the light emission from atoms/molecules in a glass matrix or from most other light sources, but they have a broad band or multimode light emission spectra. QDs created and embedded inside semiconductor heterostructures can fundamentally improve the quality of emitted light spectrum, temperature dependencies and efficiency of emission.
   QDs exhibit unique electronic and optical properties, intermediate between those of bulk semiconductors and discrete atoms or molecules. The reason for this is that the size of QDs is comparable with the de Broglie wavelength of an electron in a crystal. Electrons (and holes) inside QDs behave differently from that found in a "bulk" material. The most important difference is that inside the QDs, electrons (and holes) can occupy only discrete energy levels due to strong localization. The position of energy levels depends mainly on the smallest dimension of a QD. Applications include QD lasers for integrated silicon photonics and quantum computing, QD LEDs for highly efficient solid-state lighting, QDs for intermediate band solar cells and multi-exciton generation and QDs for bio-medical labeling, imaging, targeted drug delivery, sensing, and therapy.

TI Narrowband 10-ps-class mode-locked erbium-doped fiber laser oscillator
SO OPTICS COMMUNICATIONS
AB We demonstrate a narrowband erbium-doped fiber (EDF) laser oscillator having a linear cavity based on the design of bulk laser oscillators mode-locked by a semiconductor saturable absorber mirror (SESAM) and out coupled by a fiber Bragg grating. The EDF laser oscillator has an average power of 7.06 +/- 0.04 mW with a 3 dB bandwidth of 0.37 nm and a pulse duration of 12 ps at a repetition rate of 50.47 MHz. A pulse energy of 140 pJ is the highest ever reported in SESAM mode-locked EDF laser oscillators with a nearly Fourier-limited pulse duration demonstrating power scalability of a bulk laser and compactness of a nearly all-fiber laser. The repetition rate has a free-running fluctuation of only 312 Hz over 7 h of operation making it a promising light source for application to laser spectroscopy. The long pulse duration makes this EDF laser oscillator a suitable source for seeding a high-average-power amplifier using a large mode-area photonic crystal or tapered gain fiber without the need of pulse stretching. Moreover, this laser oscillator could be an alternative solution to the development of complicated bulk narrowband laser sources suitable for building an ion trap for application to quantum computing.

TI A Provably Secure Lattice-Based Fuzzy Signature Scheme Using Linear
   Sketch
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Fuzzy signatures (FS) are a kind of signature scheme that employs a noisy string (e.g., biometric data) as the secret key without requiring the user-specific auxiliary data. As the quantum computing era approaches, some research has been dedicated to developing quantum-resistant FS schemes, which can be classified into fuzzy extractor (FE) approach and linear sketch (LS) approach. However, the existing schemes utilizing FEs to obtain (variants of) fuzzy signatures require to produce the user-specific auxiliary information known as helper data to retrieve secret keys, leading to an additional computational cost. In light of the circumstance, we seek to construct a fuzzy signature scheme by employing a linear sketch, since this approach does not require the user-specific auxiliary data to derive secret keys. We modify the linear sketch which is an essential ingredient of the most practical fuzzy signature proposed by Katsumata et al. (CCS' 21). Then we combine it with Lyubashevsky's lattice-based signature scheme (EUROCRYPT' 12) to construct our lattice-based fuzzy signature scheme. Moreover, to further demonstrate the security of our proposed scheme, we provide a rigorous security proof in the random oracle model. Finally, the comparison indicates that our proposed FS scheme not only avoids the use of FE but also shows a promising tendency in efficiency among the existing quantum-resistant FS schemes.

TI Vortex bound states and Majorana zero mode in electron-doped FeSe-based
   high-temperature superconductor
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB As a novel quantum state in condensed matter physics, Majorana zero mode has become a popular research topic at present because of its potential value in topological quantum computing. Theory predicts that Majorana zero mode appears in the vortex core of the topological superconductor as a unique bound state. However, due to various factors such as the existence of conventional low energy bound states or impurity states, it is difficult to identify the Majorana zero mode and to put it into the specific applications. Nowadays, it is still urgent to find a suitable topological superconducting system and identify the clean Majorana zero mode in experiment. In this paper, we study the vortex states of electron-doped iron-selenium-based superconductors (Li, Fe)OHFeSe and single-layer FeSe/SrTiO3 with extremely high energy resolution STM. There exists a robust and clean Majorana zero mode in the free vortex core of (Li, Fe)OHFeSe, which has the quantized conductance. As for single-layer FeSe/SrTiO3 film, it has only conventional Caroli-de Gennes-Matricon (CdGM) bound states without zero energy mode. These experimental results provide a suitable platform for further studying the physical properties of Majorana zero mode, and also shed light on the source of topological superconductivity in iron-based superconductors.

TI QIR: a novel quaternion-based image representation for reversible image
   steganography
SO CONNECTION SCIENCE
AB Image steganography involves concealing data within a digital image. Reversible steganography is considered as the complete restoration of the original image after the embedded secret data have been extracted. In this research work, a novel quaternion-based image representation technique is proposed for effective representation of images for processing it in quantum computational units. The proposed model is evaluated by implementing the representation of images for reversible image steganography where the images that are represented should be decrypted without loss. The images that were used in this study involve three different sizes $ 256 \times 256 $ 256x256, $ 512 \times 512 $ 512x512, $ 1024 \times 1024 $ 1024x1024. Here the numerical results of the proposed work shows that the average PSNR value of the original image to the stego image is 44 dB and the average PSNR value to the original image and quantum decrypted image using quaternion function is 74 dB approximately which is 40% greater than the previous quantum representation and the SSIM and MSE values obtained are 95% similar to the previous works. The importance of our contribution is the stego image which is represented using 3-D quaternion rotation undergoes a decryption using LSB-MSB technique which then recovers the original secret and cover image with minimum loss. This shows that the stego image is not affected by the proposed quantum representation.

TI Detect anomalous quartic gauge couplings at muon colliders with quantum
   kernel k-means
SO EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL C
AB In recent years, with the increasing luminosities of colliders, handling the growing amount of data has become a major challenge for future New Physics (NP) phenomenological research. In order to improve efficiency, machine learning algorithms have been introduced into the field of high-energy physics. As a machine learning algorithm, kernel k-means has been demonstrated to be useful for searching NP signals. It is well known that the kernel k-means algorithm can be carried out with the help of quantum computing, which suggests that quantum kernel k-means (QKKM) is also a potential tool for NP phenomenological studies in the future. This paper investigates how to search for NP signals using QKKM. Taking the mu(+)mu(- )-> nu nu<overline>gamma gamma process at a muon collider as an example, the dimension-8 operators contributing to anomalous quartic gauge couplings (aQGCs) are studied. The expected coefficient constraints obtained using the QKKM of three different forms of quantum kernels, as well as the constraints obtained by the classical k-means algorithm are presented, and it can be shown that QKKM can help to find the signal of aQGCs. Comparing the classical k-means anomaly detection algorithm with QKKM, it is indicated that the QKKM is able to archive a better cut efficiency.

TI Computational studies of a series of closely related acenaphthopyrazine
   derivative
SO RESULTS IN SURFACES AND INTERFACES
AB The novelty of the study is in the use of quantum computing analysis of acenaphthopyrazine derivatives using Density Functional Theory (DFT) with the B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) basis set. The research focused on intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) and its influence on non-linear optical (NLO) properties. The NLO analysis revealed that the protonated forms of these compounds exhibit higher dipole moments, indicating their potential for NLO applications. Natural Bond Orbital (NBO) analysis identified molecule 5 as having the highest E(2) value of 509.41 kcal/mol, signifying strong electron donation from nitrogen to hydrogen atoms. The study also evaluated the thermal properties, showing that the Gibbs free energy remained positive across a wide temperature range, suggesting that none of the compounds are spontaneously formed in either neutral or protonated states. Additionally, Monte Carlo simulations indicated favorable adsorption energies for these derivatives on the Fe (110) surface, with compound 5 demonstrating the most significant inhibitory potential. We conduced of that, lower negative adsorption energy (-216.729) compound 1 are confirm with highest energy gap (3.396 eV), and smaller refractive index, and electrical conductivityof compound 1 indicates a small metal-inhibitor molecule interaction, as well as are agreement with Monte Carlo simulation for adsorption on Fe (110) non protonated case.

TI Fusion of Cyclohepta[def]fluorene Units: Toward Synthesis of
   High-Spin Non-Benzenoid Nanographenes
SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF ORGANIC CHEMISTRY
AB Non-benzenoid diradicaloids possessing high-spin ground states are attractive synthetic targets given their high potential for spintronics and quantum computing. Nevertheless, the synthesis of such compounds remains highly challenging due to their inherent instability. In this work, we present the synthetic attempt towards creating a non-benzenoid diradicaloid (1) with a triplet ground state by fusing two cyclohepta[def]fluorene units onto a benzene ring. Our synthetic approach involves both oxidation and reduction pathways. In the oxidation path, we obtained the partially dehydrogenated products 1+H and 1+2H containing an indeno[1,2-b]fluorene core from the tetrahydro precursor (2). However, further dehydrogenation to afford the target molecule (1) did not proceed. On the other hand, with the reduction pathway, a novel tetraketone precursor (9) with two pairs of pentagons and heptagons was successfully synthesized. The subsequent nucleophilic attack however was proved to be difficult probably due to the unselective nucleophilic addition on the zigzag nanographene ketones. Furthermore, UV-vis absorption, cyclic voltammetry, and theoretical calculations were conducted to explore the optical, electrochemical properties, and aromaticity of all the obtained molecules (1+H, 1+2H and 9). Although the desired target 1 is not achieved, our work provides insight into designing novel high-spin non-benzenoid NGs based on nonalternant cyclohepta[def]fluorene system.

TI Nanoscale spin ordering and spin screening effects in tunnel
   ferromagnetic Josephson junctions
SO COMMUNICATIONS MATERIALS
AB Magnetic Josephson junctions (MJJs) have emerged as a prominent playground to explore the interplay between superconductivity and ferromagnetism. A series of fascinating experiments have revealed striking phenomena at the superconductor/ferromagnet (S/F) interface, pointing to tunable phase transitions and to the generation of unconventional spin-triplet correlations. Here, we show that the Josephson effect, being sensitive to phase space variation on the nanoscale, allows a direct observation of the spin polarization of the S/F interface. By measuring the temperature dependence of the Josephson magnetic field patterns of tunnel MJJs with strong and thin F-layer, we demonstrate an induced nanoscale spin order in S along the superconducting coherence length at S/F interface, i.e., the inverse proximity effect, with the first evidence of full spin screening at very low temperatures, as expected by the theory. A comprehensive phase diagram for spin nanoscale ordering regimes at S/F interfaces in MJJs has been derived in terms of the magnetic moment induced in the S-layer. Our findings contribute to drive the design and the tailoring of S/F interfaces also in view of potential applications in quantum computing.
   Magnetic Josephson junctions are important for studying the interplay between superconductivity and ferromagnetism. Here, an inverse proximity effect with tunable nanoscale spin ordering at the superconductor/ferromagnet interface of Nb-permalloy structures is observed, confirming theoretical predictions on these systems.

TI Efficient and Scalable Post-Layout Optimization for Field-Coupled
   Nanotechnologies
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON COMPUTER-AIDED DESIGN OF INTEGRATED CIRCUITS AND
   SYSTEMS
AB As conventional computing technologies approachtheir physical limits, the quest for increased computationalpower intensifies, heightening interest in post-CMOS technolo-gies. Among these,Field-coupled Nanocomputing(FCN), whichoperates through the repulsion of physical fields at the nanoscale,emerges as a promising alternative. However, realizing specificfunctionalities within this technology necessitates the develop-ment of dedicated FCN physical design methods. Althoughvarious methods have been proposed, their reliance on heuristicapproaches often results in suboptimal quality, highlightinga significant opportunity for enhancement. In the realm ofconventional CMOS design, post-layout optimization techniquesare employed to capitalize on this potential, yet such methods forFCN are either not scalable or lack efficiency. This work bridgesthis gap by introducing the first scalable and efficient post-layout optimization algorithm for FCN. Experimental evaluationsdemonstrate the efficiency of this approach: when applied tolayouts obtained by astate-of-the-artheuristic method, theproposed post-layout optimization achieves area reductions ofup to73.75 %(45.58 %on average). This significant improve-ment underscores the transformative potential of post-layoutoptimization in FCN. Moreover, unlike existing algorithms, themethod exhibits scalability even in optimizing layouts with over20 million tiles. Implementations of the proposed methods arepublicly available as part of theMunich Nanotech Toolkit(MNT)at https://github.com/cda-tum/fiction.

SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB A prompt diagnosis of breast cancer in its earliest phases is necessary for effective treatment. While Computer-Aided Diagnosis systems play a crucial role in automated mammography image processing, interpretation, grading, and early detection of breast cancer, existing approaches face limitations in achieving optimal accuracy. This study addresses these limitations by hybridizing the improved quantum-inspired binary Grey Wolf Optimizer with the Support Vector Machines Radial Basis Function Kernel. This hybrid approach aims to enhance the accuracy of breast cancer classification by determining the optimal Support Vector Machine parameters. The motivation for this hybridization lies in the need for improved classification performance compared to existing optimizers such as Particle Swarm Optimization and Genetic Algorithm. Evaluate the efficacy of the proposed IQI-BGWO-SVM approach on the MIAS dataset, considering various metric parameters, including accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity. Furthermore, the application of IQI-BGWO-SVM for feature selection will be explored, and the results will be compared. Experimental findings demonstrate that the suggested IQI-BGWO-SVM technique outperforms state-of-the-art classification methods on the MIAS dataset, with a resulting mean accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of 99.25%, 98.96%, and 100%, respectively, using a tenfold cross-validation datasets partition.

AB Ensuring the secure provision of data and services using critical information infrastructures amidst the evolving technology landscape is a crucial yet recurrent task. However, these infrastructures can become vulnerable due to developments in quantum computing and modifying the infrastructures with quantum-safe (QS) technology is unlike regular control and maintenance. Organizations need to modify their cryptographic layers, which act as the fundamental building blocks of infrastructures. For organizations, many uncertainties pose challenges across technological, organizational and ecosystem areas. While QS technology is new and not yet available for implementation and adoption, changes in critical information infrastructures require collaboration among multiple public and private organizations spanning industries and borders. By understanding the roles, organizations may better understand what should be done for QS transitions. Until now, there has been no academic research examining the roles that government could or should play in QS transitions. This paper reveals 12 different roles, showing the diversity and breadth of actions needed. While there are many possible roles that still need to be allocated for coordinated efforts, there is a high reliance on the government, and organizations are waiting for and expecting governments to take more active roles in QS transitions. The results also signals that QS transition research is at its early stage with a clear governance void and lack of collective urgency in the ecosystem.

TI Uncovering anisotropic effects of electric high-moment dipoles on the
   tunneling current in δ-layer tunnel junctions
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB The precise positioning of dopants in semiconductors using scanning tunneling microscopes has led to the development of planar dopant-based devices, also known as delta layer-based devices, facilitating the exploration of new concepts in classical and quantum computing. Recently, it has been shown that two distinct conductivity regimes (low-and high-bias regimes) exist in delta-layer tunnel junctions due to the presence of quasi-discrete and continuous states in the conduction band of delta-layer systems. Furthermore, discrete charged impurities in the tunnel junction region significantly influence the tunneling rates in delta-layer tunnel junctions. Here we demonstrate that electrical dipoles, i.e. zero charge defects, present in the tunnel junction region can also significantly alter the tunneling rate, depending, however, on the specific conductivity regime, and orientation and moment of the dipole. In the low-bias regime, with high-resistance tunneling mode, dipoles of nearly all orientations and moments can alter the current, indicating the extreme sensitivity of the tunneling current to the slightest imperfection in the tunnel gap. In the high-bias regime, with low-resistivity, only dipoles with high moments and oriented in the directions perpendicular to the electron tunneling direction can significantly affect the current, thus making this conductivity regime significantly less prone to the influence of dipole defects with low-moments or oriented in the direction parallel to the tunneling.

   applications
SO NANOPHOTONICS
AB Metasurfaces, composed of artificial meta-atoms of subwavelength size, can support strong light-matter interaction based on multipolar resonances and plasmonics, hence offering the great capability of empowering nonlinear generation. Recently, owing to their ability to manipulate the amplitude and phase of the nonlinear emission in the subwavelength scale, metasurfaces have been recognized as ultra-compact, flat optical components for a vast range of applications, including nonlinear imaging, quantum light sources, and ultrasensitive sensing. This review focuses on the recent progress on nonlinear metasurfaces for those applications. The principles and advances of metasurfaces-based techniques for image generation, including image encoding, holography, and metalens, are investigated and presented. Additionally, the overview and development of spontaneous photon pair generation from metasurfaces are demonstrated and discussed, focusing on the aspects of photon pair generation rate and entanglement of photon pairs. The recent blossoming of the nonlinear metasurfaces field has triggered growing interest to explore its ability to efficiently up-convert infrared images of arbitrary objects to visible images and achieve spontaneous parametric down-conversion. This recently emerged direction holds promising potential for the next-generation technology in night-vision, quantum computing, and biosensing fields.

TI Solutions of the Yang-Baxter Equation and Automaticity Related to
   Kronecker Modules
SO COMPUTATION
AB The Kronecker algebra K is the path algebra induced by the quiver with two parallel arrows, one source and one sink (i.e., a quiver with two vertices and two arrows going in the same direction). Modules over K are said to be Kronecker modules. The classification of these modules can be obtained by solving a well-known tame matrix problem. Such a classification deals with solving systems of differential equations of the form Ax=Bx', where A and B are mxn, F-matrices with F an algebraically closed field. On the other hand, researching the Yang-Baxter equation (YBE) is a topic of great interest in several science fields. It has allowed advances in physics, knot theory, quantum computing, cryptography, quantum groups, non-associative algebras, Hopf algebras, etc. It is worth noting that giving a complete classification of the YBE solutions is still an open problem. This paper proves that some indecomposable modules over K called pre-injective Kronecker modules give rise to some algebraic structures called skew braces which allow the solutions of the YBE. Since preprojective Kronecker modules categorize some integer sequences via some appropriated snake graphs, we prove that such modules are automatic and that they induce the automatic sequences of continued fractions.

TI Quantum Search Approaches to Sampling-Based Motion Planning
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB In this paper, we present a novel formulation of traditional sampling-based motion planners as database-oracle structures that can be solved via quantum search algorithms. We consider two complementary scenarios: for simpler sparse environments, we formulate the Quantum Full Path Search Algorithm (q-FPS), which creates a superposition of full random path solutions, manipulates probability amplitudes with Quantum Amplitude Amplification (QAA), and quantum measures a single obstacle free full path solution. For dense unstructured environments, we formulate the Quantum Rapidly Exploring Random Tree algorithm, q-RRT, that creates quantum superpositions of possible parent-child connections, manipulates probability amplitudes with QAA, and quantum measures a single reachable state, which is added to a tree. As performance depends on the number of oracle calls and the probability of measuring good quantum states, we quantify how these errors factor into the probabilistic completeness properties of the algorithm. We then numerically estimate the expected number of database solutions to provide an approximation of the optimal number of oracle calls in the algorithm. We compare the q-RRT algorithm with a classical implementation and verify quadratic run-time speedup in the largest connected component of a 2D dense random lattice. We conclude by evaluating a proposed approach to limit the expected number of database solutions and thus limit the optimal number of oracle calls to a given number.

TI Evaluation of QAOA based on the approximation ratio of individual
   samples
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB The quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) is a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm to solve binary-variable optimization problems. Due to the short circuit depth and its expected robustness to systematic errors it is a promising candidate likely to run on near-term quantum devices. We simulate the performance of QAOA applied to the Max-Cut problem and compare it with some of the best classical alternatives. When comparing solvers, their performance is characterized by the computational time taken to achieve a given quality of solution. Since QAOA is based on sampling, we utilize performance metrics based on the probability of observing a sample above a certain quality. In addition, we show that the QAOA performance varies significantly with the graph type. In particular for three-regular random graphs, QAOA performance shows improvement by up to two orders of magnitude compared to previous estimates, strongly reducing the performance gap with classical alternatives. This was possible by reducing the number of function evaluations per iteration and optimizing the variational parameters on small graph instances and transferring to large via training. Because QAOA's performance guarantees are only known for limited applications and contexts, we utilize a framework for the search for quantum advantage which incorporates a large number of problem instances and all three classical solver modalities: exact, approximate, and heuristic.

TI Magnon-magnon coupling efficiency of η=0.25 in weakly pinned synthetic
   antiferromagnets
SO APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS
AB Synthetic antiferromagnets consist of two ferromagnetic layers that are antiferromagnetically coupled. These systems support complex dynamical magnetic excitations, where interlayer coupling gives rise to both in-phase (acoustic) and anti-phase (optical) magnonic modes. Typically, simultaneous excitation of both modes requires breaking the symmetry between the ferromagnetic layers - commonly achieved through slight misalignment of the experimental setup or by modifying the intrinsic magnetic properties. In our approach, we utilize a pinned synthetic antiferromagnet, where one of the ferromagnetic layers is exchange-coupled to an antiferromagnet. We demonstrate that by tuning the thickness of the antiferromagnet and slightly enhancing the magnetic anisotropy of the pinned layer, both acoustic and optical modes can be efficiently excited - without the need for experimental misalignment or changes to the intrinsic material properties. Under specific conditions, the magnon dispersion relations exhibit anti-crossing behavior, resulting in the emergence of a magnonic bandgap - a clear signature of strong magnon-magnon coupling. The coupling efficiency eta, defined as the ratio between the bandgap and the characteristic frequency, reaches eta=0.25, well in the ultrastrong and approaching the deep-strong coupling regime of eta >= 1. The combination of strong mode hybridization, a sizable magnonic bandgap, and high ferromagnetic resonance coherence over large areas - all achieved at room temperature without cryogenic cooling - underscores the potential of these systems for quantum magnonic applications, including quantum computing.

TI Detection and Manipulation of Interaction Between Magnetic
   DyPc2 Molecules and Superconducting Pb(111) Surface
SO ADVANCED MATERIALS INTERFACES
AB Lanthanide double-decker phthalocyanine (LnPc(2)) complexes are highly coveted for their prospective uses in ultrahigh-density data storage and quantum computing. Notably, the quantum spin systems comprising these complexes and superconducting substrates exhibit unique quantum magnetic interactions. Through scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and spectroscopy (STS) experiments, the interaction between the magnetic double-decker DyPc2 molecules and the superconducting Pb(111) substrate is investigated. Three distinct adsorption patterns of DyPc2 on Pb(111) are experimentally observed. Combined with DFT calculations, it is found that the ligand spin of the normal DyPc2 molecules in the self-assembled monolayer (SAM) is quenched, which is attributed to strong charge transfer from Pb(111). However, special DyPc2 molecules embedded in the SAM maintain ligand spin due to weak charge transfer, forming a complex quantum spin system with the superconducting substrate. Similarly, DyPc2 molecules located on the second layer exhibit the same behavior. Under zero magnetic field, the Yu-Shiba-Rusinov (YSR) resonances are observed within the superconducting energy gap of both spin quantum systems. The Kondo resonance and the superconducting pairing occur at similar energy scales, indicating their coexistence and competition. This ultimately results in a Kondo-screened state. By controlling the sample bias, the special molecule can be switched to a normal molecule.

TI Investigation of the Mechanical, Electronic, and Optical Properties in
   PtLuSb (Platinum-Lutetium Antimonide) Topological Insulator
SO ADVANCES IN CONDENSED MATTER PHYSICS
AB Topological insulators (TIs) are becoming a great, fascinating compound due to their multidimensional applications in quantum computing, spintronics, and advanced technology. Recently, some half-Heusler compounds exhibit topologically insulating behaviors and are predicted to be TIs. In this paper, a half-Heusler compound, PtLuSb, and its properties are studied. This paper demonstrates the mechanical, electronic, and optical properties of PtLuSb on different photon energies using density functional theory (DFT). The observed electronic band structure indicates zero bandgap at the G-point. The total density of states (TDOSs) graph exhibits strong hybridization between atomic orbitals around -26.9 eV. The optical properties, such as absorption coefficient, reflectivity, refractive index, extinction coefficient, optical conductivity, and dielectric function, are analyzed. PtLuSb shows maximum absorption at 32.2 eV. The strong reflectivity phenomena are noticed in the photon energy range between 36 and 43 eV. The optical conductivity graph displays high conductivity, indicating several peaks at the photon energies of 19.9, 21.9, 27.1, and 30.3 eV. The obtained maximum optical conductivity is 9.19 (1/fs). PtLuSb TI highlights a more effective optical response to the extreme ultraviolet (EUV) photons. It makes PtLuSb more suitable for different EUV applications, such as lithography, optics, advanced spectroscopy, and photonic devices.

TI Photonic- Plasmonic Hybrid Microcavity with Ultra-High Quality Factor
   Regulated by Bowtie Plasmonic Nanoantenna
SO LASER & OPTOELECTRONICS PROGRESS
AB Ultra-high quality factor optical microcavities are key components for constructing various integrated photonic devices. Hybrid microcavities based on the photonic crystal microcavities provide a novel platform for realizing a strong light-matter interaction that possesses extensive application prospects in many fields, including cavity quantum electrodynamics, integrated single photon sources, and quantum computing. In this paper, we theoretically propose a novel photonic- plasmonic hybrid microcavity functioning in the visible light band based on the basic double heterostructure photonic crystal cavity with a gold bowtie plasmonic nanoantenna. Here, the structural parameters of the bowtie plasmonic nanostructures ( i. e., gap, angle, length, thickness, and relative position) were adjusted to investigate the regulation effects on the quality factor Q, effective mode volume V, and figure of merit Q/V of the cavity using a three-dimensional finite-difference time-domain method. The simulation results reveal that the effective mode volume and the figure of merit of the hybrid microcavity are stable on the order of 10(- 6) (lambda/ n)(3) and 10(8) (lambda/ n)(-3), respectively. Moreover, we achieved the highest Q/ V value of 5. 730689x10(8) (lambda/n)(-3), depicting a value much better than that of other microcavities.

TI Thin films of silicon nitride deposited at room temperature by
   non-reactive magnetron sputtering: radiofrequency power and deposition
   time influence on the formation of a-Si3N4 and its
   optical properties
SO FRONTIERS IN PHYSICS
AB Silicon nitride's excellent electronic and optical properties have positioned it as an indispensable element in silicon-based photonic platforms and photonic quantum computing. Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD) and Plasma Enhanced CVD (PECVD) techniques predominate in high-performance silicon nitride thin film manufacture. Unfortunately, Chemical Vapor Deposition and Plasma Enhanced CVD are expensive techniques that use hazardous gases and very high substrate temperatures. In this work, we used the sputtering technique to grow a-Si3N4 thin films at room temperature. We identified that by applying radiofrequency powers between 30 and 50 W combined with deposition times below 120 min, we could achieve the growth of silicon nitride (SiNX) films with uniformly distributed crystalline particles, limited formation of clusters, and minimal alterations in atomic ordering. The Volmer-Weber model governs the film's growth, which favors its continuity and surface roughness. The optical bandgaps of our SiNX films ranged from 2.3 to 3.9 eV, and their RMS roughness never exceeded 4 nm. We observed a quasi-linear deposition rate concerning radiofrequency power and deposition time, whereby we were able to grow SiNX films controllably and reproducibly with thicknesses ranging from 45 to 500 nm.

TI A study of the formation of isotopically pure 28Si layers for
   quantum computers using conventional ion implantation
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS D-APPLIED PHYSICS
AB We have investigated the use of conventional ion implantation to fabricate enriched Si-28 layers for use in quantum computers. The final compositions of samples enriched using ultra-low energy (ULE) (800 eV and 2 keV) and low energy (20 keV) Si-28 implants of varying fluences (1 x 10(16)-3.8 x 10(17) cm(-2)) using two different implanters were measured using channelled Rutherford Backscattering Spectroscopy (RBS). The dynamic, binary collision approximation program TRIDYN was used to model the implantation profiles to guide the analysis of the RBS spectra. It was found that ULE implants achieved high Si-28 enrichment levels but were heavily contaminated with oxygen due to poor vacuum in the implanter wafer end station. It was shown that oxidation could be reduced by using an accelerator with an end station with better vacuum and increasing the implant energy to 20 keV. However, TRIDYN simulations predict that the best Si-28 enrichment levels that could be achieved under these conditions would saturate at similar to 99.2% due to self-sputtering. We modelled a range of conditions with TRIDYN and so recommend low energies (<3 keV), ultra-high vacuum implantation for high Si-28 enrichment (>99.9%) with the lowest possible fluences (similar to 5-10 x 10(17) cm(-2)).

TI Significant inverse magnetocaloric effect induced by quantum criticality
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB The criticality-enhanced magnetocaloric effect (MCE) near a field-induced quantum critical point (QCP) in the spin systems constitutes a very promising and highly tunable alternative to conventional adiabatic demagnetization refrigeration. Strong fluctuations in the low-T quantum critical regime can give rise to a large thermal entropy change and thus significant cooling effect when approaching the QCP. In this work, through efficient and accurate many-body calculations, we show there exists a significant inverse MCE (iMCE) in the spin-1 quantum chain materials (CH3)(4)NNi(NO2)(3) (TMNIN) and NiCl2-4SC(NH2)(2) (DTN), where DTN has substantial low-T refrigeration capacity while requiring only moderate magnetic fields. The iMCE characteristics, including the adiabatic temperature change Delta T-ad, isothermal entropy change Delta S, differential Gruneisen parameter, and the entropy change rate, are obtained with quantum many-body calculations at finite temperature. The cooling performance, i.e., the efficiency factor and hold time, of the two compounds is also discussed. Based on the many-body calculations on realistic models for the spin-chain materials, we conclude that the compound DTN constitutes a very promising and highly efficient quantum magnetic coolant with pronounced iMCE properties. We advocate that such quantum magnets can be used in cryofree refrigeration for space applications and quantum computing environments.

TI Performance optimization of epoxy resin-based modified liquid asphalt
   mixtures
SO CASE STUDIES IN CONSTRUCTION MATERIALS
AB This study proposes a performance optimization scheme of liquid asphalt mixtures (LAMs) based on epoxy resin-based material modification and investigates its various performances. First, thermogravimetric analysis and headspace gas chromatography-mass spectrometry were used to analyze the differences between liquid asphalt before and after curing to clarify the formation mechanism of its adhesive force. Second, a molecular model was established. The best epoxy resin and curing agent types were evaluated using an improved Flory-Huggins model and the quantum computing method. Finally, two performance optimization schemes were established to reinforce the performance defects of the mixture caused by residual diluents. Results show that liquid asphalt solidification is a physical process of volatilization of diluents. Bisphenol A epoxy resin and a polyether amine curing agent are compatible with liquid asphalt and prone to curing re-actions; thus, they are most suitable as epoxy resin-based modifiers. A solution obtained by adding 2% waterborne epoxy resin and 30% mineral powder replaced with cement can signifi-cantly improve the initial strength, strength generation rate, and low-temperature crack resis-tance of the LAM while optimizing high-temperature performance. This LAM modification can ensure that roads repaired using the modified LAM in a low-temperature environment can be quickly opened to use and improve the durability of the road surface.

TI First-Principles Investigation of a High-Chern-Number Quantum Anomalous
   Hall Insulator Mn2Bi2O6 and Its
   BN-Coupled Multilayer Heterostructures
SO CHEMPHYSCHEM
AB In modern condensed matter physics, the quantum anomalous Hall effect (QAHE), an important manifestation of topological quantum states, has attracted much attention due to its ability to exhibit the quantum Hall effect without the need for an external magnetic field. In this study, the discovery of a new high-Chern-number quantum anomalous Hall insulator, Mn2Bi2O6 is reported. Utilizing first-principles calculations based on density functional theory (DFT), its electronic and topological properties are systematically investigated. The results reveal that monolayer Mn2Bi2O6 possesses a remarkable energy gap of 110 meV and a Chern number of 3, corresponding to three intrinsic conductive edge channels. The material exhibits both strong robustness and stability upon applied strain. Moreover, by stacking double layers with a boron nitride (BN) insulating layer, a heterostructure system with a larger bandgap (117.4 meV) and an increased Chern number of 6 can be realized. When substituting the upper layer's oxygen atoms with tellurium atoms, it forms a Janus structure, accompanied by a transition of Chern number from 3 to 1. This work not only introduces new candidates for expanding the class of QAHE materials but also establishes a new platform for applications in low-power electronic devices and topological quantum computing.

TI Chirality manipulation of ultrafast phase switches in a correlated
   CDW-Weyl semimetal
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Light engineering of correlated states in topological materials provides a new avenue of achieving exotic topological phases inaccessible by conventional tuning methods. Here we demonstrate a light control of correlation gaps in a model charge-density-wave (CDW) and polaron insulator (TaSe4)2I recently predicted to be an axion insulator. Our ultrafast terahertz photocurrent spectroscopy reveals a two-step, non-thermal melting of polarons and electronic CDW gap via the fluence dependence of a longitudinal circular photogalvanic current. This helicity-dependent photocurrent reveals continuous ultrafast phase switches from the polaronic state to the CDW (axion) phase, and finally to a hidden Weyl phase as the pump fluence increases. Additional distinctive attributes aligning with the light-induced switches include: the mode-selective coupling of coherent phonons to the polaron and CDW modulation, and the emergence of a non-thermal chiral photocurrent above the pump threshold of CDW-related phonons. The demonstrated ultrafast chirality control of correlated topological states here holds large potentials for realizing axion electrodynamics and advancing quantum-computing applications.
   The charge-density-wave Weyl semimetal (TaSe4)2I is a candidate for an axion insulator, however it may be obscured by polaron physics. Here, using ultrafast terahertz photocurrent spectroscopy, the authors realize phase switches from the polaronic state, to the charge density wave phase, and to the Weyl phase.

TI Lanthanide photonics on the path to future: from gas lighting to optical
   computers
SO JOURNAL OF LUMINESCENCE
AB In 1891, Austrian scientist and entrepreneur Carl Auer von Welsbach filed a groundbreaking patent for a cotton mantle impregnated with cerium-doped thorium oxide, which converted the light and heat of gas lamps into a brilliant white glow. This marked the birth of lanthanide photonics and phosphor chemistry-a field that now underpins countless essential technologies, from solid-state lighting to cancer phototherapy and quantum computing information processing. This perspective explores the remarkable scientific journey of lanthanide photonics, highlighting recent breakthroughs and key developments. We begin with a historical overview before delving into fundamental advances including quantum chemical models, antenna effect and energy transfer mechanisms, the design of inorganic phosphors, the influence of electric and magnetic fields, molecular and circularly polarized luminescence, upconversion processes, and quantum bits. The final section focuses on cutting-edge applications, such as solid-state lighting, photovoltaics, mechanoluminescence, and biomedical innovations (optical imaging, cancer diagnosis, and photodynamic therapy), while briefly touching on other emerging uses. Rather than providing an exhaustive review, this article offers a concise yet broad overview of the field, spotlighting pivotal contributions from the past decade. Our goal is to capture the dynamism and interdisciplinary impact of lanthanide photonics as it continues to shape science and technology.

TI High spin axion insulator
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Axion insulators possess a quantized axion field theta = pi protected by combined lattice and time-reversal symmetry, holding great potential for device applications in layertronics and quantum computing. Here, we propose a high-spin axion insulator (HSAI) defined in large spin-s representation, which maintains the same inherent symmetry but possesses a notable axion field theta = (s + 1/2)2 pi. Such distinct axion field is confirmed independently by the direct calculation of the axion term using hybrid Wannier functions, layer-resolved Chern numbers, as well as the topological magneto-electric effect. We show that the guaranteed gapless quasi-particle excitation is absent at the boundary of the HSAI despite its integer surface Chern number, hinting an unusual quantum anomaly violating the conventional bulk-boundary correspondence. Furthermore, we ascertain that the axion field theta can be precisely tuned through an external magnetic field, enabling the manipulation of bonded transport properties. The HSAI proposed here can be experimentally verified in ultra-cold atoms by the quantized non-reciprocal conductance or topological magnetoelectric response. Our work enriches the understanding of axion insulators in condensed matter physics, paving the way for future device applications.
   Existing proposals of axion insulators are limited to spin-1/2 systems. Here the authors put forward a concept of a high spin axion insulator with several peculiar properties, such as the absence of gapless surface states and tunability of the axion field by an external magnetic field.

TI Enhancing the Carrier Transport in Monolayer MoS2 through
   Interlayer Coupling with 2D Covalent Organic Frameworks
SO ADVANCED MATERIALS
AB The coupling of different 2D materials (2DMs) to form van der Waals heterostructures (vdWHs) is a powerful strategy for adjusting the electronic properties of 2D semiconductors, for applications in opto-electronics and quantum computing. 2D molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) represents an archetypical semiconducting, monolayer thick versatile platform for the generation of hybrid vdWH with tunable charge transport characteristics through its interfacing with molecules and assemblies thereof. However, the physisorption of (macro)molecules on 2D MoS2 yields hybrids possessing a limited thermal stability, thereby jeopardizing their technological applications. Herein, the rational design and optimized synthesis of 2D covalent organic frameworks (2D-COFs) for the generation of MoS2/2D-COF vdWHs exhibiting strong interlayer coupling effects are reported. The high crystallinity of the 2D-COF films makes it possible to engineer an ultrastable periodic doping effect on MoS2, boosting devices' field-effect mobility at room temperature. Such a performance increase can be attributed to the synergistic effect of the efficient interfacial electron transfer process and the pronounced suppression of MoS2's lattice vibration. This proof-of-concept work validates an unprecedented approach for the efficient modulation of the electronic properties of 2D transition metal dichalcogenides toward high-performance (opto)electronics for CMOS digital circuits.

TI Relaxation of a dense ensemble of spins in diamond under a continuous
   microwave driving field
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Decoherence of Rabi oscillation in a two-level quantum system consists of two components, a simple exponential decay and a damped oscillation. In dense-ensemble spin systems like negatively charged nitrogen-vacancy (NV-) centers in diamond, fast quantum state decoherence often obscures clear observation of the Rabi nutation. On the other hand, the simple exponential decay (or baseline decay) of the oscillation in such spin systems can be readily detected but has not been thoroughly explored in the past. This study investigates in depth the baseline decay of dense spin ensembles in diamond under continuously driving microwave (MW). It is found that the baseline decay times of NV- spins decrease with the increasing MW field strength and the MW detuning dependence of the decay times shows a Lorentzian-like spectrum. The experimental findings are in good agreement with simulations based on the Bloch formalism for a simple two-level system in the low MW power region after taking into account the effect of inhomogeneous broadening. This combined investigation provides new insight into fundamental spin relaxation processes under continuous driving electromagnetic fields and paves ways to better understanding of this underexplored phenomena using single NV- centers, which have shown promising applications in quantum computing and quantum metrology.

TI Quarter- and half-filled quantum Hall states and their topological
   orders revealed by daughter states in bilayer graphene
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Even-denominator fractional quantum Hall states are promising candidates for fault-tolerant quantum computing due to their underlying non-Abelian topological order. However, the topological order of these states remains hotly debated. Here, we report transport measurements on ultra-clean bilayer graphene heterostructures, where we observed four quarter-filled states and their corresponding Levin-Halperin daughter states, constraining their topological order. Moreover, we complete the sequence of half-filled plateaus by detecting states at nu=-32\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$\nu=-\frac{3}{2}$$\end{document} and nu=12\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$\nu=\frac{1}{2}$$\end{document} whose daughters suggest an alternating sequence of non-Abelian orders. This pattern suggests a universal origin supporting their use in identifying topological order at even-denominator fillings, though further confirmation is needed via direct measurements. The observed quarter- and half-filled states appear in N = 0 and N = 1 Landau levels, respectively, and thus highlight a competition between interactions favoring paired states of either four- or two-flux composite fermions. Additionally, we observe several 'next-generation' quantum Hall states that require strong interactions between composite fermions.

TI A novel perspective on denoising using quantum localization with
   application to medical imaging
SO AIP ADVANCES
AB Background noise in many fields, such as medical imaging, poses significant challenges for accurate diagnosis, prompting the development of denoising algorithms. Traditional methodologies, however, often struggle to address the complexities of noisy environments in high dimensional imaging systems. This paper introduces a novel quantum-inspired approach for image denoising, drawing upon principles of quantum and condensed matter physics. Our approach views medical images as amorphous structures akin to those found in condensed matter physics, and we propose an algorithm that incorporates the concept of mode resolved localization directly into the denoising process. Notably, unlike previous studies that considered localization as a hindrance, our approach considers quantum localization as a fundamental component of image reconstruction, which is used to differentiate between noisy and non-noisy modes based on diffusivity and localization measurements. This perspective eliminates the need for hyperparameter tuning, making the proposed method a standalone algorithm that can be implemented with minimal manual intervention and can perform automatic filtering of noise regardless of noise level. Through numerical validation, we showcase the effectiveness of our approach in addressing noise-related challenges in imaging, and especially medical imaging, underscoring its relevance for possible quantum computing applications.

TI Spin-exchange induced spillover on poor man's Majoranas in minimal
   Kitaev chains
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS-CONDENSED MATTER
AB The 'poor man's Majoranas' (PMMs) (Leijnse and Flensberg 2012 Phys. Rev. B 86 134528) devoid of topological protection can 'spill over' from one edge into another of the minimal Kitaev chain when perturbed electrostatically. As aftermath, this leads to a delocalized Majorana fermion (MF) at both the edges. Additionally, according to recent differential conductance measurements in a pair of superconducting and spinless quantum dots (QDs), such a PMM picture was brought to reality (Dvir et al 2023 Nature 614 445; ten Haaf et al 2024 Nature 630 329). Based on this scenario, we propose the spillover of the PMM when its QD is exchange coupled to a quantum spin S. We show that if this QD is perturbed by the exchange coupling J, solely the half 2S+1 (2S+2) of the fine structure stays explicit for a fermionic (bosonic) S. Concurrently, the other half squeezes itself as the delocalized MF zero-mode. Particularly, turning-off the superconductivity the multiplicity 2S+1 holds regardless the spin statistics. Meanwhile, the PMM spillover induced by J becomes a statistics dependent effect. Hence, our findings contribute to the comprehension of spin-phenomena interplay with superconductivity in minimal Kitaev chains, offering insights for future quantum computing devices hosting PMMs.

AB We have developed a powerful table-top cryogenic platform for Quantum computing applications below 1 Kelvin. The system offers a cold plate optimized for the CMOS-spin qubits technology developed by CEA/LETI. The first step is to demonstrate a 100 qubits system. The cryogenic system is designed for 100 mW cooling power at 500 mK, required by this R&D activity. The solution chosen is a high-flow helium-3 Joule-Thomson cycle pre-cooled by a two-stage 4 Kelvin Pulse-Tube (PT420-RM). The table-top architecture is preferred in order to keep an easy access to the quantum processor and the control cryoelectronics components. The pulse-tube and the high flow Joule-Thomson recuperative heat exchangers are mounted into a separate coldbox. The remote cryostat offers three temperature stages: a 50 K stage, coupled to the pulse-tube first stage by a pressurized helium cooling loop; a 5 K stage, coupled to the second pulse-tube stage by a conductive copper link; and a 500 mK stage coupled to the Joule-Thomson cycle evaporator. The pumping speed required (similar to 1000 L/s) is achieved by several dry compact turbopumps in order to reach the required helium-3 flow of 4 mmol/s at 10 Pa. We report the performances achieved with helium-4 and helium-3 on the prototype system.

TI Integrated Photonic Passive Building Blocks on Silicon-on-Insulator
   Platform
SO PHOTONICS
AB Integrated photonics on Silicon-On-Insulator (SOI) substrates is a well developed research field that has already significantly impacted various fields, such as quantum computing, micro sensing devices, biosensing, and high-rate communications. Although quite complex circuits can be made with such technology, everything is based on a few 'building blocks' which are then combined to form more complex circuits. This review article provides a detailed examination of the state of the art of integrated photonic building blocks focusing on passive elements, covering fundamental principles and design methodologies. Key components discussed include waveguides, fiber-to-chip couplers, edges and gratings, phase shifters, splitters and switches (including y-branch, MMI, and directional couplers), as well as subwavelength grating structures and ring resonators. Additionally, this review addresses challenges and future prospects in advancing integrated photonic circuits on SOI platforms, focusing on scalability, power efficiency, and fabrication issues. The objective of this review is to equip researchers and engineers in the field with a comprehensive understanding of the current landscape and future trajectories of integrated photonic components on SOI substrates with a 220 nm thick device layer of intrinsic silicon.

TI Stability verification of quantum non-i.i.d. sources
SO PHYSICA SCRIPTA
AB We introduce the problem of stability verification of quantum sources which are non-i.i.d.. The problem consists in ascertaining whether a given quantum source is stable or not, in the sense that it produces always a desired quantum state or if it suffers deviations. Stability is a statistical notion related to the sparsity of errors. This problem is closely related to the problem of quantum verification first proposed by Pallister et al (2018 Phys. Rev. Lett. 120), however, it extends the notion of the original problem. We introduce a family of states that come from these non-i.i.d. sources which we call a Markov state. These sources are more versatile than the i.i.d. ones as they allow statistical deviations from the norm instead of the more coarse previous approach. We prove in theorem 1 that the Markov states are not well described with tensor products over a changing source. In theorem 2 we further provide a lower bound on the trace distance between two Markov states, or conversely, an upper bound on the fidelity between these states. This is a bound on the capacity of determining the stability property of the source, which shows that it is exponentially easier to ascertain this with respect to n, the number of outcomes from the source.

TI Structural determinations of homo and heterodi- or tetra-nuclear
   lanthanide complexes and their characterization by μ-Squid experiments
SO POLYHEDRON
AB Two families of homo- and heterodinuclear complexes are prepared and structurally characterized, thus demonstrating that genuine complexes involving two lanthanide ions closely located in the lanthanide series can be obtained, taking into account a simple rule that necessitates introduction of the better Lewis acid Ln ion (the smallest Ln ion) into the inner coordination site of the main ligand used in this synthesis. In the first family, the presence of a deprotonated orthovanillin ligand (ovan) around the Ln ion positioned in the outer coordination site of the main ligand allows a good isolation of the dinuclear complexes. These complexes behave as SMSs when a Dy ion is coordinated in the outer site but a weak magnetic magnetic Ln-Dy interaction is needed to create a weak magnetic field able to suppress collapsing of the hysteresis loops in zero external applied field at very low temperature. In the second family, the ovan ligand is replaced by a chloride ligand, so that two dinuclear units are linked together by two Cl...HOMe hydrogen bonds to yield tetranuclear complexes that are not SMMs. Eventually these two preparation pathways are expected to give novel and genuine examples of homo or heterodinuclear and tetranuclear lanthanide complexes likely to furnish in future coordination complexes useful in quantum computing.

TI Detector of UV light chirality based on a diamond metasurface
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Circularly polarized light (CPL) finds diverse applications in fields such as quantum communications, quantum computing, circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy, polarization imaging, and sensing. However, conventional techniques for detecting CPL face challenges related to equipment miniaturization, system integration, and high-speed operation. In this study, we propose a novel design that addresses these limitations by employing a quarter waveplate constructed from a diamond metasurface, in combination with a linear polarizer crafted from metallic aluminum. The diamond array, with specific dimensions (a = 84 nm, b = 52 nm), effectively transforms left-handed and right-handed circularly polarized light into two orthogonally linearly polarized beams who have a polarization degree of approximately 0.9. The aluminum linear polarizer then selectively permits the transmission of these transformed linearly polarized beams.Our proposed design showcases remarkable circular dichroism performance at a wavelength of 280 nm, concurrently maintaining high transmittance and achieving a substantial extinction ratio of 25. Notably, the design attains an ultraviolet wavelength transmission efficiency surpassing 80%. Moreover, our design incorporates a rotation mechanism that enables the differentiation of linearly polarized light and singly circularly polarized light. In essence, this innovative design introduces a fresh paradigm for ultraviolet circularly polarized light detection, offering invaluable insights and references for applications in polarization detection, imaging, biomedical diagnostics, and circular dichroic spectroscopy.(c) 2023 Optica Publishing Group under the terms of the Optica Open Access Publishing Agreement

TI A survey on security in internet of things with a focus on the impact of
   emerging technologies
SO INTERNET OF THINGS
AB Internet of Things (IoT) have opened the door to a world of unlimited possibilities for implementations in varied sectors in society, but it also has many challenges. One of those challenges is security and privacy. IoT devices are more susceptible to security threats and attacks. Due to constraints of the IoT devices such as area, power, memory, etc., there is a lack of security solutions that are compatible with IoT devices and applications, which is leading this world of securely connected things to the "internet of insecure things." A promising solution to this problem is going beyond the standard or classical techniques to implementing the security solutions in the hardware of the IoT device. The integration of emerging technologies in IoT networks, such as machine learning, blockchain, fog/edge/cloud computing, and quantum computing have added more vulnerable points in the network. This paper introduces a comprehensive study on IoT security threats and solutions. Additionally, this survey outlines how emerging technologies such as machine learning and blockchain are integrated in IoT, challenges resulted from this integration, and potential solutions to these challenges. The paper utilizes the 4-layer IoT architecture as a reference to identify security issues with corresponding solutions.

TI Interactions and non-magnetic fractional quantization in one-dimension
SO APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS
AB In this Perspective article, we present recent developments on interaction effects on the carrier transport properties of one-dimensional (1D) semiconductor quantum wires fabricated using the GaAs/AlGaAs system, particularly the emergence of the long predicted fractional quantization of conductance in the absence of a magnetic field. Over three decades ago, it was shown that transport through a 1D system leads to integer quantized conductance given by N:2e(2)/h, where N is the number of allowed energy levels (N = 1, 2, 3, horizontal ellipsis). Recent experiments have shown that a weaker confinement potential and low carrier concentration provide a testbed for electrons strongly interacting. The consequence leads to a reconfiguration of the electron distribution into a zigzag assembly which, unexpectedly, was found to exhibit quantization of conductance predominantly at 1/6, 2/5, 1/4, and 1/2 in units of e(2)/h. These fractional states may appear similar to the fractional states seen in the Fractional Quantum Hall Effect; however, the system does not possess a filling factor and they differ in the nature of their physical causes. The states may have promise for the emergent topological quantum computing schemes as they are controllable by gate voltages with a distinct identity.

TI Improved Verifier-Based Three-Party Password-Authenticated Key Exchange
   Protocol from Ideal Lattices
SO SECURITY AND COMMUNICATION NETWORKS
AB With the advent of large-scale social networks, two communication users need to generate session keys with the help of a remote server to communicate securely. In the existing three-party authenticated key exchange (3PAKE) protocols, users' passwords need to be stored on the server; it cannot resist the server disclosure attack. To solve this security problem, we propose a more efficient 3PAKE protocol based on the verification element by adopting a public-key cryptosystem and approximate smooth projection hash (ASPH) function on an ideal lattice. Using the structure of separating authentication from the server, the user can negotiate the session key only after two rounds of communication. The analysis results show that it can improve the efficiency of computation and communication and resist the server disclosure attack, quantum algorithm attack, and replay attack; moreover, it has session key privacy to the server. This protocol can meet the performance requirement of the current communication network.

TI 50 years of Operations Research in public transport
SO EURO JOURNAL ON TRANSPORTATION AND LOGISTICS
AB The planning and operations of public transport has benefited from the development and application of Operations Research (OR) techniques in the past half a century. In this article, we describe OR-related techniques and applications in the public transport domain in the last 50 years (1975-2025) since the origin of the intersection of these two research fields. Following a brief description of the public transport planning process, we outline how different topics, models, and solution approaches have evolved throughout this period. For each topic-varying from network assignment, line planning and crew scheduling to real-time management and demand-responsive transport-we review seminal works, key approaches and developments as well as comment on the applicability thereof and recent trends. In addition, we identify primary cross-cutting themes of research: integrating different planning stages, system resilience, dealing with uncertainties and energy-efficient public transport, as well as pricing and equity considerations. Moreover, reinforcement learning and quantum computing are expected to play an increasingly important role in OR applications in public transport. In the next half a century OR in public transport will undoubtedly continue to evolve in response to the technical developments in the transport sector, the developments in algorithms, software and hardware for computing, and by the challenges society faces.

TI Adaptive evolution and early diversification of photonic nanomaterials
   in marine diatoms
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB The discovery of natural slab photonic crystals in diatoms has sparked questions regarding their prevalence and functional role in nature. These advanced nanomaterials open so-called photonic stopbands in two dimensions, enabling precise light manipulation essential in technologies like quantum computing and photonics. However, the natural role of these advanced properties remains a mystery. In this study, we adopted a multidisciplinary approach, combining taxonomic, evolutionary, and photonic property analyses. Using scanning electron micrographs, we examined the girdle elements of the silicon dioxide shell from several hundred diatom species to explore the potential correlation between occurrence of slab photonic crystals and taxonomic relationship. Girdle slab photonic crystals emerged among the oldest diatom classes, with stopband properties covering the visible to mid-infrared spectral range. Square lattice formations emerged first, evolving from quasi-ordered templates, and later diverged into more efficiently packed hexagonal structures. This study shows how photonic nanomaterials developed from quasi order to order over evolutionary trajectories and provides a sustainable inventory of natural slab photonic crystals for application and deeper investigation. Understanding how diatoms utilize these structures can inspire innovative principles for smarter energy management systems as well serve as a model for the evolution of order and symmetry in cellular processes and organization.

TI Theoretical Analysis of Efficient Thermo-Optic Switching on
   Si3N4 Waveguide Platform Using SiOC-Based
   Plasmo-Photonics
SO NANOMATERIALS
AB Photonic integrated circuits (PICs) are crucial for advanced applications in telecommunications, quantum computing, and biomedical fields. Silicon nitride (SiN)-based platforms are promising for PICs due to their transparency, low optical loss, and thermal stability. However, achieving efficient thermo-optic (TO) modulation on SiN remains challenging due to limited reconfigurability and high power requirements. This study aims to optimize TO phase shifters on SiN platforms to enhance power efficiency, reduce device footprint, and minimize insertion losses. We introduce a CMOS-compatible plasmo-photonic TO phase shifter using a SiOC material layer with a high TO coefficient combined with aluminum heaters on a SiN platform. We evaluate four interferometer architectures-symmetric and asymmetric Mach-Zehnder Interferometers (MZIs), an MZI with a ring resonator, and a single-arm design-through opto-thermal simulations to refine performance across power, losses, footprint, and switching speed metrics. The asymmetric MZI with ring resonator (A-MZI-RR) architecture demonstrated superior performance, with minimal power consumption (1.6 mW), low insertion loss (2.8 dB), and reduced length (14.4 mu m), showing a favorable figure of merit compared to existing solutions. The optimized SiN-based TO switches show enhanced efficiency and compactness, supporting their potential for scalable, energy-efficient PICs suited to high-performance photonic applications.

TI Key enabling technologies for smart city development: a comprehensive
   overview
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL ON SMART SENSING AND INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS
AB The integration of emerging technologies, such as wireless sensor networks (WSN), big data analytics (BDA), artificial intelligence (AI), internet of things (IoT), and 5G connectivity, is driving the development of smart cities toward sustainable, efficient, and secure urban environments. This paper presents a systematic literature review (SLR) of 149 peer-reviewed studies to identify key enabling technologies, implementation challenges, and future research directions, including nanotechnology and quantum computing. A pilot case study on smart surveillance is introduced for secluded and underdeveloped areas where conventional video-based monitoring is impractical. The system employs variable-range passive infrared sensors (PIR), low-power MSP430 manufacturer is Texas Instruments https://www.ti.com/product-category/microcontrollers-processors/msp430-mcus/overview.html, and HC12 Subgig module purchased from vendor https://www.seeedstudio.com/ to detect and track non-cooperative moving targets with minimal energy and bandwidth requirements. Field deployment achieved an average detection accuracy of 80.82% and a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.88 m. The proposed approach demonstrates a scalable, privacy-conscious, and energy-efficient solution for enhancing safety in smart city applications, with future enhancements including solar-powered nodes and multitarget tracking capabilities.

TI Symbolic Plithogenic Numbers in RSA Cryptography: A Path to Post-Quantum
   Security
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB The RSA algorithm, with its strong mathematical foundation rooted in number theory and its wide range of applications in secure communication, is one of the most widely used public-key encryption methods. However, advancements in classical computing and the emergence of quantum computers have introduced significant risks that threaten the security of traditional RSA-based systems. Therefore, new mathematical structures, referred to as extended number systems, are needed to increase algebraic complexity and provide more secure encryption. In this context, alternative number systems such as neutrosophic numbers and plithogenic numbers, which possess multidimensional and partially ordered structures, show promising potential for offering stronger cryptographic solutions against both classical and quantum-based attacks. This study presents a reconstruction of the RSA algorithm using symbolic 2-plithogenic and 3-plithogenic numbers, which represent an extended version of the classical and neutrosophic number systems. These numbers differ from traditional integers by incorporating two symbolic components, thereby forming a multidimensional structure. Consequently, the algebraic structure obtained in the processes of encryption and key generation becomes significantly more complex compared to classical methods. In particular, the increased difficulty of integer factorization in such multidimensional structures substantially strengthens cryptographic security.

TI Unconventional quantum oscillations and evidence of nonparabolic
   electronic states in quasi-two-dimensional electron system at complex
   oxide interfaces
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB The simultaneous occurrence of electric-field controlled superconductivity and spin-orbit interaction makes two-dimensional electron systems (2DES) constructed from perovskite transition metal oxides promising candidates for the next generation of spintronics and quantum computing. It is, however, essential to understand the electronic bands thoroughly and verify the predicted electronic states experimentally in these 2DES to advance technological applications. Here, we present insights into the electronic states of the 2DES at oxide interfaces through comprehensive investigations of Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations in three different systems: EuO/KTaO3, LaAlO3/SrTiO3, and amorphous-LaAlO3/KTaO3. To accurately resolve these oscillations, we conducted transport measurements in high magnetic fields up to 60 T and low temperatures down to 100 mK. For 2D confined electrons at these interfaces, we observed a progressive increase of oscillations frequency and cyclotron mass with the magnetic field. We interpret these universal and intriguing findings by considering the existence of nontrivial electronic bands, for which the E - k dispersion incorporates both linear and parabolic relations. In addition to providing experimental evidence for nonparabolic electronic states in KTaO3 and SrTiO3 2DES, the unconventional oscillations presented in this study establish a paradigm for quantum oscillations in 2DES based on perovskite transition metal oxides, where the oscillation frequencies in 1/B exhibit quadratic dependence on the magnetic field.

TI Colossal Strain Tuning of Ferroelectric Transitions in KNbO3
   Thin Films
SO ADVANCED MATERIALS
AB Strong coupling between polarization (P) and strain (epsilon) in ferroelectric complex oxides offers unique opportunities to dramatically tune their properties. Here colossal strain tuning of ferroelectricity in epitaxial KNbO3 thin films grown by sub-oxide molecular beam epitaxy is demonstrated. While bulk KNbO3 exhibits three ferroelectric transitions and a Curie temperature (T-c) of approximate to 676 K, phase-field modeling predicts that a biaxial strain of as little as -0.6% pushes its T-c > 975 K, its decomposition temperature in air, and for -1.4% strain, to T-c > 1325 K, its melting point. Furthermore, a strain of -1.5% can stabilize a single phase throughout the entire temperature range of its stability. A combination of temperature-dependent second harmonic generation measurements, synchrotron-based X-ray reciprocal space mapping, ferroelectric measurements, and transmission electron microscopy reveal a single tetragonal phase from 10 K to 975 K, an enhancement of approximate to 46% in the tetragonal phase remanent polarization (P-r), and a approximate to 200% enhancement in its optical second harmonic generation coefficients over bulk values. These properties in a lead-free system, but with properties comparable or superior to lead-based systems, make it an attractive candidate for applications ranging from high-temperature ferroelectric memory to cryogenic temperature quantum computing.

TI Explainable Artificial Intelligence Using Expressive Boolean Formulas
SO MACHINE LEARNING AND KNOWLEDGE EXTRACTION
AB We propose and implement an interpretable machine learning classification model for Explainable AI (XAI) based on expressive Boolean formulas. Potential applications include credit scoring and diagnosis of medical conditions. The Boolean formula defines a rule with tunable complexity (or interpretability) according to which input data are classified. Such a formula can include any operator that can be applied to one or more Boolean variables, thus providing higher expressivity compared to more rigid rule- and tree-based approaches. The classifier is trained using native local optimization techniques, efficiently searching the space of feasible formulas. Shallow rules can be determined by fast Integer Linear Programming (ILP) or Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) solvers, potentially powered by special-purpose hardware or quantum devices. We combine the expressivity and efficiency of the native local optimizer with the fast operation of these devices by executing non-local moves that optimize over the subtrees of the full Boolean formula. We provide extensive numerical benchmarking results featuring several baselines on well-known public datasets. Based on the results, we find that the native local rule classifier is generally competitive with the other classifiers. The addition of non-local moves achieves similar results with fewer iterations. Therefore, using specialized or quantum hardware could lead to a significant speedup through the rapid proposal of non-local moves.

TI Direct evidence of microstructure dependence of magnetic flux trapping
   in niobium
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Elemental type-II superconducting niobium is the material of choice for superconducting radiofrequency cavities used in modern particle accelerators, light sources, detectors, sensors, and quantum computing architecture. An essential challenge to increasing energy efficiency in rf applications is the power dissipation due to residual magnetic field that is trapped during the cool down process due to incomplete magnetic field expulsion. New SRF cavity processing recipes that use surface doping techniques have significantly increased their cryogenic efficiency. However, the performance of SRF Nb accelerators still shows vulnerability to a trapped magnetic field. In this manuscript, we report the observation of a direct link between flux trapping and incomplete flux expulsion with spatial variations in microstructure within the niobium. Fine-grain recrystallized microstructure with an average grain size of 10-50 mu m leads to flux trapping even with a lack of dislocation structures in grain interiors. Larger grain sizes beyond 100-400 mu m do not lead to preferential flux trapping, as observed directly by magneto-optical imaging. While local magnetic flux variations imaged by magneto-optics provide clarity on a microstructure level, bulk variations are also indicated by variations in pinning force curves with sequential heat treatment studies. The key results indicate that complete control of the niobium microstructure will help produce higher performance superconducting resonators with reduced rf losses(1) related to the magnetic flux trapping.

TI Ghost states and surface structures of the charge density wave kagome
   metal ScV6 Sn6
SO APPLIED SURFACE SCIENCE
AB We investigate the high -temperature phase of the kagome metal ScV 6 Sn 6 using scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy (STM/S) and density functional theory calculations. STM topographic images of the cleaved sample reveal two distinct surface terminations: flat islands with Sn termination and trenches terminated by kagome layers with Sn as the outermost atomic layer. STS measurements on the Sn-terminated and kagome-terminated surfaces show significant differences, in particular the presence of large density of states near the Fermi level in the former case. Our first -principles calculations reveal that the charge density on the kagome-terminated surface gives rise to "ghost states"which show intensity away from surface atoms, arising due to hybridization of orbitals above the surface. These states can obscure the intrinsic properties of the surface, potentially leading to misattribution of the surface termination. This underscores the need for careful interpretation in STM studies, especially when discerning surface states of localized states. Understanding the surface structure of this versatile quantum material provides essential information for interpreting surface -sensitive experiments, tailoring material properties, engineering interfaces, and controlling stability and reactivity. This knowledge paves the way for further exploration and potential applications of kagome lattice materials in various fields, including quantum computing, topological physics, and advanced electronic devices.

TI Topological Nodal Surface and Quadratic Dirac Semimetal States and van
   Hove Singularities in ScH3 and LuH3 Superconductors
SO ACS OMEGA
AB The coexistence of non-trivial topology and superconductivity in a material may induce a novel physical phenomenon known as topological superconductivity. Topological superconductors have been the subject of intense research, yet there are severe limitations in their application due to a lack of suitable materials. Topological nodal surface semimetals with nearly flat nodal surfaces near the Fermi level can be promising materials to achieve topological superconductivity. Here, we use first-principles calculations to examine the topological electronic characteristics of two new superconductors, ScH3 and LuH3, at both ambient and high pressures. Our studies show that both ScH3 and LuH3 have van Hove singularities, which confirms their superconductivity. Interestingly, both materials host topological nodal surface states under the protection of time reversal and spatial inversion symmetries in the absence of spin-orbit coupling (SOC). These nodal surfaces are distinguished by a pair of unique drum-head-like surface states not previously observed in nodal surface semimetals. Moreover, the nodal surfaces transform into essential spin-orbit quadratic Dirac points when SOC is included. Our findings demonstrate that ScH3 and LuH3 are good candidates to investigate the exotic properties of both nodal surface semimetals (NSSMs) and quadratic Dirac semimetal states and also provide a platform to explore the coexistence of topology and superconductivity in NSSMs with promising applications in high-speed electronics and topological quantum computing.

TI Mode coupling bi-stability and spectral broadening in buckled carbon
   nanotube mechanical resonators
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Computing, memories, and digital electronics are based on the operation principle of bi-stable systems. Here, Yaish et al. report the unusual non-linear behaviour of buckled up carbon nanotubes mechanical resonators, which allows high electrical frequency tunability and snap-through bi-stability.
   Bi-stable mechanical resonators play a significant role in various applications, such as sensors, memory elements, quantum computing and mechanical parametric amplification. While carbon nanotube based resonators have been widely investigated as promising NEMS devices, a bi-stable carbon nanotube resonator has never been demonstrated. Here, we report a class of carbon nanotube resonators in which the nanotube is buckled upward. We show that a small upward buckling yields record electrical frequency tunability, whereas larger buckling can achieve Euler-Bernoulli bi-stability, the smallest mechanical resonator with two stable configurations to date. We believe that these recently-discovered carbon nanotube devices will open new avenues for realizing nano-sensors, mechanical memory elements and mechanical parametric amplifiers. Furthermore, we present a three-dimensional theoretical analysis revealing significant nonlinear coupling between the in-plane and out-of-plane static and dynamic modes of motion, and a unique three-dimensional Euler-Bernoulli snap-through transition. We utilize this coupling to provide a conclusive explanation for the low quality factor in carbon nanotube resonators at room temperature, key in understanding dissipation mechanisms at the nano scale.

TI Structure prediction of epitaxial inorganic interfaces by lattice and
   surface matching with Ogre
SO JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS
AB We present a new version of the Ogre open source Python package with the capability to perform structure prediction of epitaxial inorganic interfaces by lattice and surface matching. In the lattice matching step, a scan over combinations of substrate and film Miller indices is performed to identify the domain-matched interfaces with the lowest mismatch. Subsequently, surface matching is conducted by Bayesian optimization to find the optimal interfacial distance and in-plane registry between the substrate and the film. For the objective function, a geometric score function is proposed based on the overlap and empty space between atomic spheres at the interface. The score function reproduces the results of density functional theory (DFT) at a fraction of the computational cost. The optimized interfaces are pre-ranked using a score function based on the similarity of the atomic environment at the interface to the bulk environment. Final ranking of the top candidate structures is performed with DFT. Ogre streamlines DFT calculations of interface energies and electronic properties by automating the construction of interface models. The application of Ogre is demonstrated for two interfaces of interest for quantum computing and spintronics, Al/InAs and Fe/InSb. Published under an exclusive license by AIP Publishing.

TI Digitalization of health care in low- and middle-income countries
SO BULLETIN OF THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION
AB The rising incidence of noncommunicable diseases, combined with the costs of mitigating climate change, sovereign debt and regional conflicts, is undermining global health security and threatening progress towards achieving the sustainable development goals of the United Nations. The negative impact of these polycrises is disproportionately borne by low- and middle-income countries, which have the highest disease burden and lowest health-care spending. Health digitalization is emerging as a promising countermeasure, accelerated by artificial intelligence (AI) software and quantum computing hardware. We provide a multisector critical analysis of the three key enablers - governance, infrastructure and security - of the responsible AI-enabled digitalization for safe, affordable, equitable and sustainable healthcare systems in low- and middle-income countries. We consider leading use cases in public-private partnerships, democratized sovereign AI and embedded human security. Our analysis proposes that these use cases demonstrate how digital AI-accelerated global health may be advanced as human-centred managed strategic competition. We conducted our analysis through an inclusive range of theoretical perspectives and practical experience spanning academia, industry and practice across the world. We provide recommendations for the responsible management of the key enablers to accelerate global health for all. We anticipate that this paper will be useful for public health decision-makers, both in low- and middle-income countries leading local health digitalization, and in high-income countries supporting this transaction through their technologies, funding and knowledge exchange.

TI Successive data injection in conditional quantum GAN applied to time
   series anomaly detection
SO IET QUANTUM COMMUNICATION
AB Classical GAN architectures have shown interesting results for solving anomaly detection problems in general and for time series anomalies in particular, such as those arising in communication networks. In recent years, several quantum GAN (QGAN) architectures have been proposed in the literature. When detecting anomalies in time series using QGANs, huge challenges arise due to the limited number of qubits compared to the size of the data. To address these challenges, a new high-dimensional encoding approach, named Successive Data Injection (SuDaI) is proposed. In this approach, SuDaI explores a larger portion of the quantum state, compared to the conventional angle encoding method used predominantly in the literature. This is achieved through repeated data injections into the quantum state. SuDaI encoding allows the authors to adapt the QGAN for anomaly detection with network data of a much higher dimensionality than with the existing known QGANs implementations. In addition, SuDaI encoding applies to other types of high-dimensional time series and can be used in contexts beyond anomaly detection and QGANs, opening up therefore multiple fields of application.
   This article provides a scheme for encoding high dimensional sequential data into a quantum state. This scheme is then used to build a quantum conditional generative adversarial network. This model is then tested in the case of anomaly detection on time series. image

TI A Post-Quantum Cross-Domain Authentication Scheme Based on Multi-Chain
   Architecture
SO CMC-COMPUTERS MATERIALS & CONTINUA
AB Due to the rapid advancements in network technology, blockchain is being employed for distributed data storage. In the Internet of Things (IoT) scenario, different participants manage multiple blockchains located in different trust domains, which has resulted in the extensive development of cross -domain authentication techniques. However, the emergence of many attackers equipped with quantum computers has the potential to launch quantum computing attacks against cross -domain authentication schemes based on traditional cryptography, posing a significant security threat. In response to the aforementioned challenges, our paper demonstrates a post -quantum crossdomain identity authentication scheme to negotiate the session key used in the cross -chain asset exchange process. Firstly, our paper designs the hiding and recovery process of user identity index based on lattice cryptography and introduces the identity -based signature from lattice to construct a post -quantum cross -domain authentication scheme. Secondly, our paper utilizes the hashed time -locked contract to achieves the cross -chain asset exchange of blockchain nodes in different trust domains. Furthermore, the security analysis reduces the security of the identity index and signature to Learning With Errors (LWE) and Short Integer Solution (SIS) assumption, respectively, indicating that our scheme has post -quantum security. Last but not least, through comparison analysis, we display that our scheme is efficient compared with the cross -domain authentication scheme based on traditional cryptography.

TI RNA folding using quantum computers
SO PLOS COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY
AB The 3-dimensional fold of an RNA molecule is largely determined by patterns of intramolecular hydrogen bonds between bases. Predicting the base pairing network from the sequence, also referred to as RNA secondary structure prediction or RNA folding, is a non-deterministic polynomial-time (NP)-complete computational problem. The structure of the molecule is strongly predictive of its functions and biochemical properties, and therefore the ability to accurately predict the structure is a crucial tool for biochemists. Many methods have been proposed to efficiently sample possible secondary structure patterns. Classic approaches employ dynamic programming, and recent studies have explored approaches inspired by evolutionary and machine learning algorithms. This work demonstrates leveraging quantum computing hardware to predict the secondary structure of RNA. A Hamiltonian written in the form of a Binary Quadratic Model (BQM) is derived to drive the system toward maximizing the number of consecutive base pairs while jointly maximizing the average length of the stems. A Quantum Annealer (QA) is compared to a Replica Exchange Monte Carlo (REMC) algorithm programmed with the same objective function, with the QA being shown to be highly competitive at rapidly identifying low energy solutions. The method proposed in this study was compared to three algorithms from literature and, despite its simplicity, was found to be competitive on a test set containing known structures with pseudoknots.

TI Non-monotonic variation of the Kramers point band gap with increasing
   magnetic doping in BiTeI
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Polar Rashba-type semiconductor BiTeI doped with magnetic elements constitutes one of the most promising platforms for the future development of spintronics and quantum computing thanks to the combination of strong spin-orbit coupling and internal ferromagnetic ordering. The latter originates from magnetic impurities and is able to open an energy gap at the Kramers point (KP gap) of the Rashba bands. In the current work using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) we show that the KP gap depends non-monotonically on the doping level in case of V-doped BiTeI. We observe that the gap increases with V concentration until it reaches 3% and then starts to mitigate. Moreover, we find that the saturation magnetisation of samples under applied magnetic field studied by superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) magnetometer has a similar behaviour with the doping level. Theoretical analysis shows that the non-monotonic behavior can be explained by the increase of antiferromagnetic coupled atoms of magnetic impurity above a certain doping level. This leads to the reduction of the total magnetic moment in the domains and thus to the mitigation of the KP gap as observed in the experiment. These findings provide further insight in the creation of internal magnetic ordering and consequent KP gap opening in magnetically-doped Rashba-type semiconductors.

AB Data management systems impose structure on data via a static representation schema or data structure. Information from the data is extracted by executing queries based on predefined operators. This paradigm restricts the searchability of the data to concepts and relationships that are known or assumed to exist among the objects. While this is an effective and efficient means of retrieving simple information, we propose that such a structure severely limits the ability to derive breakthrough knowledge that exists in data under the guise of "unknown unknowns." A dynamic system will alleviate this dependence, allowing theoretically infinite projections of the data to reveal discoverable relationships that are hidden by traditional use case-driven, static query systems. In this paper, we propose a framework for a data-responsive query algebra based on a dynamic hyperbolic surface model. Such a model could provide more intuitive access to analytics and insights from massive, aggregated datasets than existing methods. This model will significantly alter the means of addressing the underlying data by representing it as an arrangement on a dynamic, hyperbolic plane. Consequently, querying the data can be viewed as a process similar to quantum annealing, in terms of characterizing data representation as an energy minimization problem with numerous minima.

TI Collaborative penetration testing suite for emerging generative AI
   algorithms
SO APPLIED INTELLIGENCE
AB Generative artificial intelligence systems remain vulnerable to sophisticated cyber threats and the emerging challenges posed by quantum computing. This study proposes and evaluates a new penetration testing suite to address quantum security concerns. The suite integrates dynamic and static application security testing (DAST and SAST) using OWASP ZAP, Burp Suite, SonarQube, and Fortify to detect and resolve vulnerabilities across application lifecycles. Real-time monitoring through interactive application security testing (IAST) with Contrast Assess near-real-time analysis facilitates pre-emptive remediation and remediation of insecure data handling and encryption flaws. Blockchain-enhanced logging, implemented via Hyperledger Fabric, provides tamper-proof and auditable records of all security activities. Furthermore, quantum-resistant cryptographic protocols, including lattice-based cryptography and RLWE, safeguard against quantum decryption threats, validated through simulated quantum attack scenarios. AI-driven red team simulations emulate adversarial and quantum-assisted attacks, uncovering vulnerabilities overlooked by traditional methods. Key results include the identification and remediation of over 300 vulnerabilities, a 70% reduction in high-severity issues within two weeks of testing, and a 90% resolution efficiency for blockchain-logged vulnerabilities. Quantum-resistant protocols exhibited strong resilience under adversarial conditions against simulated quantum attacks, achieving secure API encryption and data transmission. This research establishes a new protocol for securing generative AI systems, combining advanced tools, methodologies, and industry-tested methods.

TI Bayesian optimization of hybrid quantum LSTM in a mixed model for
   precipitation forecasting
SO MACHINE LEARNING-SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Precipitation forecasting has important applications in meteorological research. Accurate forecasting is of great significance for reducing the impact of floods, optimizing crop planting plans, rationally allocating water resources, and ensuring traffic safety. However, the factors affecting precipitation are complex and nonlinear, and have spatiotemporal variability, making rainfall forecasting extremely challenging. In response to these challenges, this paper proposes a hybrid model based on temporal convolutional network, quantum long short-term memory network (QLSTM), and random forest regression (RFR) to achieve more accurate rainfall forecasting. The hyperparameters of the model are optimized using the Bayesian optimization algorithm to obtain the best performance. Experiments are conducted on meteorological datasets from Seattle and Ukraine, and the results are verified using mean absolute error (MAE), root mean square error (RMSE), and bias evaluation indicators. The results show that the proposed hybrid model outperforms traditional models such as RFR, support vector machine, K-nearest neighbor, LSTM, and QLSTM in terms of MAE, RMSE, and bias. The proposed model achieves improvements of 1.89 % MAE, 2.65 % RMSE, and 31 % Bias, respectively. These results highlight the improved forecast accuracy and robustness of the proposed hybrid model. This research provides a new approach to weather forecasting and demonstrates the potential of combining quantum computing with traditional machine learning techniques.

TI Single molecule magnet's (SMM) effects on antiferromagnet-based magnetic
   tunnel junction
SO AIP ADVANCES
AB Single-molecule magnets (SMMs) are pivotal in molecular spintronics, showing unique quantum behaviors that can advance spin-based technologies. By incorporating SMMs into magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs), new possibilities emerge for low-power, energy-efficient data storage, memory devices and quantum computing. This study explores how SMMs influence spin-dependent transport in antiferromagnet-based MTJ molecular spintronic devices (MTJMSDs). We fabricated cross-junction MTJ devices with an antiferromagnetic Ta/FeMn bottom electrode and ferromagnetic NiFe/Ta top electrode, with a similar to 2 nm AlOx layer, designed so that the AlOx barrier thickness at the junction intersection matched the SMM length, allowing them to act as spin channels bridging the two electrodes. Following SMM treatment, the MTJMSDs exhibited significant current enhancement, reaching a peak of 40 mu A at 400 mV at room temperature. In contrast, bare MTJ junctions experienced a sharp current reduction, falling to the pA range at 0 degrees C and remaining stable at lower temperatures-a suppression notably greater than in SMM-treated samples (Ref: Sankhi et al., Journal of Magnetism and Magnetic Materials, p. 172608, 2024). Additional vibration sample magnetometry on pillar shaped devices of same material stacks indicated a slight decrease in magnetic moment after incorporating SMMs, suggesting an effect on magnetic coupling of molecule with electrodes. Overall, this work highlights the promise of antiferromagnetic materials in optimizing MTJMSD devices and advancing molecular spintronics.

TI Light-induced magnetic switching in a coumarin-based Tb single molecule
   magnet
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY C
AB We present the intriguing magneto-optical properties of the lanthanide complex [Tb(coum)(3)(batho)]center dot[0.7EtOH], named Tb-batho, based on coum = 3-acetyl-4-hydroxylato-coumarin and batho = bathophenanthroline ligands. Tb-batho displays visible-range luminescence with a notable quantum yield (58%) upon sensitization of the "antenna" ligands. Employing a SQUID magnetometer equipped with a magneto-optic option, we conducted comprehensive in situ measurements of light-induced magnetization changes across varied magnetic fields, temperatures, and frequencies, utilizing light wavelengths ranging from 275 to 800 nm. A reversible magnetic modulation of magnetization is observed upon toggling the light "on" and "off," particularly pronounced at 380 nm excitation, resulting in a magnetization change Delta M(off/on) = 0.376 mu(B) fu(-1) (ca. 42.6% of the magnetization) at 1.8 K and 1 kOe. Although Tb-batho exhibits field-induced single ion magnet (SIM) behavior, characterized by a thermally-activated process with an activation energy of U-eff/k(B) = 16.6 K @ 3 kOe and a slow direct process influenced by bottleneck effects, light irradiation does not noticeably alter its dynamic properties. All in all, Tb-batho emerges as a versatile multifunctional molecular material integrating SIM behavior, luminescence and light-induced magnetic switching, holding interest for diverse electronic applications, sensors, or quantum computing.

TI Transport and thermoelectric properties of the
   Pb1-xSnxTe topological crystalline insulator in
   the vicinity of the band inversion
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS AND CHEMISTRY OF SOLIDS
AB Semiconductor solid solutions Pb1-xSnx are well known as promising materials widely used in the IR electronics, thermoelectricity and other fields of science and technology. Recently, it has been found that these alloys in certain concentration ranges exhibit the properties characteristic of the new quantum objects of solid-state physics - topological crystalline insulators (TCIs), whose unique properties define new possibilities for practical use of these materials in spintronics, quantum computing and thermoelectricity. The fact that in Pb1-xSnx the band inversion near some composition x(c), leads to the emergence of the TCI states stimulates a detailed study of the behavior of transport and thermoelectric properties near x(c). In this work, for the Pb1-xSnx solid solutions in the composition range x = 0.59-0.68, we obtained the dependences of electrical conductivity, the Hall coefficient, charge carrier mobility, the Seebeck coefficient, and thermoelectric power factor on x at fixed temperatures in the interval (77-300) K. In the isotherms of all studied properties, we observed peaks at x similar to 0.62 and attributed them to the band inversion and transition into the TCI state, which are accompanied by the self-organization processes in the crystal lattice.

TI Massively parallel probabilistic computing with sparse Ising machines
SO NATURE ELECTRONICS
AB Solving computationally hard problems using conventional computing architectures is often slow and energetically inefficient. Quantum computing may help with these challenges, but it is still in the early stages of development. A quantum-inspired alternative is to build domain-specific architectures with classical hardware. Here we report a sparse Ising machine that achieves massive parallelism where the flips per second-the key figure of merit-scales linearly with the number of probabilistic bits. Our sparse Ising machine architecture, prototyped on a field-programmable gate array, is up to six orders of magnitude faster than standard Gibbs sampling on a central processing unit, and offers 5-18 times improvements in sampling speed compared with approaches based on tensor processing units and graphics processing units. Our sparse Ising machine can reliably factor semi-primes up to 32 bits and it outperforms competition-winning Boolean satisfiability solvers in approximate optimization. Moreover, our architecture can find the correct ground state, even when inexact sampling is made with faster clocks. Our problem encoding and sparsification techniques could be applied to other classical and quantum Ising machines, and our architecture could potentially be scaled to 1,000,000 or more p-bits using analogue silicon or nanodevice technologies.
   Sparsification techniques can be used to create Ising machines prototyped on field-programmable gate arrays that can quickly and efficiently solve combinatorial optimization problems.

TI A 50-nm Gate-Length Metamorphic HEMT Technology Optimized for Cryogenic
   Ultra-Low-Noise Operation
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON MICROWAVE THEORY AND TECHNIQUES
AB This article reports on the investigation and optimization of cryogenic noise mechanisms in InGaAs metamorphic high-electron-mobility transistors (mHEMTs). HEMT technologies with a gate length of 100, 50, and 35 nm are characterized both under room temperature and cryogenic conditions. Furthermore, two additional technology variations with 50-nm gate length are investigated to decompose different noise mechanisms in HEMTs. Therefore, cryogenic extended Ku-band low-noise amplifiers of the investigated technologies are presented to benchmark their noise performance. Technology C with a 50-nm gate length exhibits an average effective noise temperature of 4.2 K between 8 and 18 GHz with a minimum of 3.3 K when the amplifier is cooled to 10 K. The amplifier provides an average gain of 39.4 dB at optimal noise bias. The improved noise performance has been achieved by optimization of the epitaxial structure of the 50-nm technology, which leads to low gate leakage currents and high gain at low drain current bias. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first time that an average noise temperature of 4.2 K has been demonstrated in the Ku-band.

TI Implementation of finite state logic machines via the dynamics of atomic
   systems
SO RESULTS IN OPTICS
AB Following the success of Moore's predictions, we are approaching a limit in the miniaturization of semiconductors for computing materials. This has led to the exploration of various research paths in search of alternative computing paradigms, such as quantum computing, 3D transistors, molecular logic, and continuous logic. In this context, we propose a novel approach in which the dynamics of a two-level atom is used to execute classical Boolean logic operations. Unlike traditional combinational logic circuits, where the output depends solely on the input, we suggest a finite-state machine-like computing model, where the output is influenced by both the input and the system's initial state. The proposed mechanism leverages the dynamics of a two-level quantum state, with information encoded in observable quantities. These observables, the density matrix's population (diagonal) and coherence (off-diagonal) elements, were analyzed using the Liouville equation. The selection of observables within the Liouville space allows us to encode more variables. Although environmental noise may cause some loss of encoded information, fast computations can still be performed before it dissipates. In addition, logic operations can be read in parallel, enabling complex computations. This system can also be scaled to an N-level configuration.

TI Quantum dual-branch neural networks with transfer learning for early
   detection of skin cancer
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TRANSLATIONAL RESEARCH
AB Background: Accurate classification of skin cancer is critical for early detection and timely treatment, significantly improving patient survival rates. While quantum neural networks combined with transfer learning show promise in medical image analysis, quantum noise remains a major challenge, compromising the stability and reliability of these systems. This study aims to address this limitation by developing a robust quantum-based framework for skin cancer classification. Methods: We propose a Quantum Dual-Branch Neural Network (QDBNN) that employs two independently trained network branches without shared weights. Dual-modal features are fused at the fully connected layer, and a Variational Quantum Classifier (VQC) is utilized for final classification. The model is evaluated on two datasets: the multiclass HAM10000 and the binary Malignant vs. Benign dataset. Results: QDBNN achieved state-of-the-art accuracies of 93.6% on HAM10000 and 93.5% on the Malignant vs. Benign dataset, outperforming classical and quantum transfer learning baselines. The dual-branch architecture and weighted feature fusion demonstrated enhanced robustness against quantum noise while improving generalization. Conclusion: QDBNN effectively mitigates quantum noise interference and leverages quantum-classical hybrid advantages for skin cancer classification. Its success highlights the potential of quantum-inspired architectures in medical imaging, offering a pathway toward clinically deployable tools for early diagnosis. Future work will focus on hardware optimization and scalability to larger datasets.

TI Colloquium: Spin-orbit effects in superconducting hybrid
   structures
SO REVIEWS OF MODERN PHYSICS
AB Spin-orbit coupling (SOC) relates to the interaction between an electron's motion and its spin and is ubiquitous in solid -state systems. Although the effect of SOC in normal -state phenomena has been extensively studied, its role in superconducting hybrid structures and devices elicits many unexplored questions. In conjunction with broken symmetries and material inhomogeneities within superconducting hybrid structures, SOC may have contributions beyond its effects in homogeneous materials. Notably, even with well-established magnetic or nonmagnetic materials and conventional s-wave spinsinglet superconductors, SOC leads to emergent phenomena including equal-spin-triplet pairing and topological superconductivity (hosting Majorana states), a modified current-phase relationship in Josephson junctions, and nonreciprocal transport, including superconducting diode effects. SOC is also responsible for transforming quasiparticles in superconducting structures, which enhances the spin Hall effect and changes the spin dynamics. Taken together, SOC in superconducting hybrid structures and the potential for electric tuning of the SOC strength create interesting possibilities to advance superconducting spintronic devices for energy-efficient computing and enable topological fault-tolerant quantum computing. By providing a description of experimental techniques and theoretical methods to study SOC, this Colloquium describes the current understanding of resulting phenomena in superconducting structures and offers a framework to select and design a growing class of materials systems where SOC plays an important role.

TI Green Transition: The Frontier of the Digicircular Economy Evidenced
   from a Systematic Literature Review
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB Today, the issue of economic circularity is certainly not a new concept. It represents an essential issue in any production system since it is an alternative to the current production and consumption model. The importance of the topic is confirmed worldwide. However, there is still a "circularity gap " that can be bridged in the short and medium term, probably with the use of innovative and digital technologies. In fact, many researchers agree that the sustainable future can be achieved in the long term thanks to digital technologies (i.e., IoT, artificial intelligence, quantum computing etc.) which, thanks to their speed of calculation, are able to identify the right solutions at the right time. The challenge, therefore, will be to develop innovative technologies and tools for the efficient use of resources in industries for sustainable production. Thus, the aim of this study is to define the current state of the art and future research developments in this very promising field. To achieve this goal, the integration of a "set " of tools, based on the AHP method and the PRISMA protocol, is proposed. The results aim to be a guideline for decision makers and researchers interested in this topic.

TI SPUF-KG and SSL-TRNG Enhanced lightweight IoT authentication and key
   exchange protocol
SO JOURNAL OF KING SAUD UNIVERSITY COMPUTER AND INFORMATION SCIENCES
AB With the rapid advancement of Internet of Things (IoT) applications, the frequency of data interactions has increased significantly, exposing security vulnerabilities in key storage due to the constrained security capabilities of IoT devices. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a lightweight IoT authentication and key exchange protocol based on SRAM PUF Key Generator (SPUF-KG) and Semiconductor Superlattice True Random Number Generator (SSL-TRNG), designed for IoT Device-to-Server (D2S) and Device-to-Device (D2D) scenarios. SPUF-KG eliminates repeated helper data transmission during protocol interaction, while SSL-TRNG provides a highly secure initial challenge for the protocol. Security analysis demonstrates that the number produced by SPUF-KG exhibits excellent uniformity, uniqueness, and reliability, while SSL-TRNG is capable of generating random numbers that pass the NIST SP 800-22 Statistical Testing. The protocol is verified by using scyther automatic verification tool and informal security analysis to confirm that the protocol has resistance to Man-in-the-Middle (MiTM), Replay, Physical, Quantum Computing, and Modeling attacks. In terms of performance, our approach has significantly low computational complexity while reducing D2S communication costs by 18.99%, D2D by 5.09%, and server storage overhead by 17.4% compared to existing PUF-based protocols.

TI Electro-Optic-Locked, Frequency-Agile Integrated Pockels Laser Driving
   Ultra-Precise Ranging
SO LASER & PHOTONICS REVIEWS
AB Integrated semiconductor lasers drive advancements in modern information society, with their transition to III-V/external cavity structures enhancing coherence and tunability for diverse coherent detection applications. However, challenges remain in key aspects of integrated lasers including close-to-carrier frequency noise and chirp nonlinearity. This work presents an electro-optic-locked, frequency-agile integrated Pockels laser to address these problems. It applies a self-injection locking architecture based on lithium niobate on insulator platform, combining a 10-MHz tuning operation and an over-4-GHz chirp bandwidth. Leveraging the Pockels dynamics for real-time electro-optic locking, it realizes an integral linewidth of 2.58 kHz @ 1 ms and a relative chirp nonlinearity of 8.2x10-5$8.2 \times 10<^>{-5}$, which sets a record in integrated Pockels lasers. This Pockels laser directly drives precise ranging, where consistent results across 100 measurements are achieved for both 26-m LiDAR ranging and 20-km fiber ranging, featuring centimeter-level resolutions. Furthermore, its long-term coherence is highlighted by demonstrating signal-to-noise ratio improvement via coherent pulse accumulation. Unifying high coherence, broadband and precise tunability, and high-speed operation, this Pockels laser opens up new opportunities in LiDAR and fiber sensing, and is expected to promote microwave photonics, quantum computing and beyond.

TI Spin splitting tunable optical band gap in polycrystalline GdN thin
   films for spin filtering
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB Rare-earth nitrides, such as gadolinium nitride (GdN), have great potential for spintronic devices due to their unique magnetic and electronic properties. GdN has a large magnetic moment, low coercitivity, and strong spin polarization suitable for spin transistors, magnetic memories, and spin-based quantum computing devices. Its large spin splitting of the optical band-gap functions as a spin filter that offers the means for spin-polarized current injection into metals, superconductors, topological insulators, two-dimensional layers, and other novel materials. As spintronics devices require thin films, a successful implementation of GdN demands a detailed investigation of the optical and magnetic properties in very thin films. With this objective, we investigate the dependence of the direct and indirect optical band gaps (Eg) of half-metallic GdN, using the trilayer structure AlN (10 nm)/GdN (t)/AlN (10 nm) for GdN film thickness t ranging from 6 to 350 nm, in both paramagnetic (PM) and ferromagnetic (FM) phases. Our results show a band gap of 1.6 eV in the PM state, while in the FM state the band gap splits for the majority (0.8 eV) and minority (1.2 eV) spin states. As the GdN film becomes thinner, the spin-split magnitude increases by 60%, going from 0.290 to 0.460 eV. Our results point to methods for engineering GdN films for spintronic devices.

TI Classicality of single quantum particles in curved spacetime through the
   hydrodynamical reformulation of quantum mechanics
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS A-MATHEMATICAL AND THEORETICAL
AB Single-particle physics focuses on the behavior and properties of individual particles, providing insight into the building blocks of quantum mechanics. The theory of quantum particles in curved spacetime has been getting attention in recent years for gaining a deeper understanding of the relationship between quantum mechanics and general relativity, the two pillars of modern physics. In this note, we show how single quantum particles can obtain classical behavior. In particular, for a quantum particle that follows the Klein-Gordon equation in curved spacetime in the presence of external potential, we show that when the amplitude of its wavefunction follows the Klein-Gordon equation with an arbitrary effective mass, empty curved spacetime, but with the same curved geometry appearing in the original Klein-Gordon equation of the wavefunction, the quantum force of the particle vanishes, providing a classical description of the quantum particle using a system of coupled classical equations. The result relies on the Madelung hydrodynamical reformulation of quantum mechanics. Understanding how quantum systems transition to a classical behavior is a long-standing challenge in mesoscopic physics, with important implications for a wide range of applications, from quantum computing to condensed matter physics. The result provides a fresh perspective on the relations between quantum and classical effects in curved spacetime.

TI A study of the effective Hamiltonian method for decay dynamics*
SO COMMUNICATIONS IN THEORETICAL PHYSICS
AB The decay dynamic of an excited quantum emitter (QE) is one of the most important contents in quantum optics. It has been widely applied in the field of quantum computing and quantum state manipulation. When the electromagnetic environment is described by several pseudomodes, the effective Hamiltonian method based on the multi-mode Jaynes-Cummings model provides a clear physical picture and a simple and convenient way to solve the decay dynamics. However, in previous studies, only the resonant modes are taken into account, while the non-resonant contributions are ignored. In this work, we study the applicability and accuracy of the effective Hamiltonian method for the decay dynamics. We consider different coupling strengths between a two-level QE and a gold nanosphere. The results for dynamics by the resolvent operator technique are used as a reference. Numerical results show that the effective Hamiltonian method provides accurate results when the two-level QE is resonant with the plasmon. However, when the detuning is large, the effective Hamiltonian method is not accurate. In addition, the effective Hamiltonian method cannot be applied when there is a bound state between the QE and the plasmon. These results are of great significance to the study of the decay dynamics in micro-nano structures described by quasi-normal modes.

AB Software under test can be analyzed dynamically, while it is being executed, to find defects. However, as the number and possible values of input parameters increase, the cost of dynamic testing rises.
   This paper examines whether quantum computers (QCs) can help speed up the dynamic testing of programs written for classical computers (CCs). To accomplish this, an approach is devised involving the following three steps: (1) converting a classical program to a quantum program; (2) computing the number of inputs causing errors, denoted by K, using a quantum counting algorithm; and (3) obtaining the actual values of these inputs using Grover's search algorithm.
   This approach can accelerate exhaustive and non-exhaustive dynamic testing techniques. On the CC, the computational complexity of these techniques is O (N), where.. represents the count of combinations of input parameter values passed to the software under test. In contrast, on the QC, the complexity is O (epsilon(-1)root N/K), where.. is a relative error of measuring...
   The paper illustrates how the approach can be applied and discusses its limitations. Moreover, it provides a toy example executed on a simulator and an actual QC. This paper may be of interest to academics and practitioners as the approach presented in the paper may serve as a starting point for exploring the use of QC for dynamic testing of CC code.

TI Colossal Cryogenic Electro-Optic Response Through Metastability in
   Strained BaTiO3 Thin Films
SO ADVANCED MATERIALS
AB The search for thin film electro-optic materials that can retain superior performance under cryogenic conditions has become critical for quantum computing. Barium titanate thin films show large linear electro-optic coefficients in the tetragonal phase at room temperature, which is severely degraded down to approximate to 200 pm V-1 in the rhombohedral phase at cryogenic temperatures. There is immense interest in manipulating these phase transformations and retaining superior electro-optic properties down to liquid helium temperature. Utilizing the thermodynamic theory of optical properties, a large low-temperature electro-optic response is designed by engineering the energetic competition between different ferroelectric phases, leading to a low-symmetry monoclinic phase with a massive electro-optic response. The existence of this phase is demonstrated in a strain-tuned BaTiO3 thin film that exhibits a linear electro-optic coefficient of 2516 +/- 100 pm V-1 at 5 K, which is an order of magnitude higher than the best reported performance thus far. Importantly, the electro-optic coefficient increases by 100 x during cooling, unlike the conventional films, where it degrades. Further, at the lowest temperature, significant higher order electro-optic responses also emerge. These results represent a new framework for designing materials with property enhancements by stabilizing highly tunable metastable phases with strain.

TI Computation and machine learning for materials: Past, present, and
   future perspectives
SO MRS BULLETIN
AB Computational methods and machine learning (ML) are reshaping materials science by accelerating their discovery, design, and optimization. Traditional approaches such as density functional theory and molecular dynamics have been instrumental in studying materials at the atomic level. However, their high computational cost and, in certain cases, limited accuracy can restrict the scope of in silico exploration. ML promises to accelerate material property prediction and design. However, in many areas, the volume and fidelity of the data are critical barriers. Active learning can reduce the reliance on large data sets, and simulation has emerged as a critical tool for generating data on the fly. Despite these advances, challenges remain, particularly in data quality, model interpretability, and bridging the gap between computational predictions and experimental validation. Future research should develop automated frameworks capable of designing and testing materials for specific applications, and integrating ML with traditional simulations and experiments can contribute to this goal.Graphic abstractA schematic diagram illustrates the evolution of computational materials science, from early density functional theory (DFT) and molecular dynamics (MD) methods to the integration of high-throughput simulations and machine learning (ML). It also highlights artificial intelligence (AI)-driven discovery, generative models, and quantum computing as key future directions for accelerating materials innovation

TI Open quantum systems with particle and bath driven by time-dependent
   fields
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We derive a generalized quantum Langevin equation and its fluctuation-dissipation relation describing the quantum dynamics of a tagged particle interacting with a medium (environment), where both the particle and the environment are driven by an external time-dependent (e.g. oscillating) field. We specialize on the case of a charged tagged particle interacting with a bath of charged oscillators, under an external ac electric field, although the results are much more general and can be applied to any type of external time-dependent fields. We derive the corresponding quantum Langevin equation, which obeys a modified fluctuation-dissipation relation (FDR) where the ac field plays an explicit role. The modified FDR is non-Markovian even if the undriven particle-bath system is Markovian without the external field. We provide an illustration of the usefulness of these results and derive a new form of the quantum Nyquist noise for the voltage fluctuations in electrical circuits under ac conditions (finite frequency), which is the most general since it also accounts for the response of the heat bath (e.g. lattice ions) to the applied ac electric field in the GHz-THz region, of relevance for 5G/6G wireless technologies. This generalized quantum fluctuation-dissipation relation for driven systems can also find other applications ranging from quantum noise in quantum optics to quantum computing with trapped ions.

TI Search for Majorana neutrinos exploiting millikelvin cryogenics with
   CUORE
SO NATURE
AB The possibility that neutrinos may be their own antiparticles, unique among the known fundamental particles, arises from the symmetric theory of fermions proposed by Ettore Majorana in 1937(1). Given the profound consequences of such Majorana neutrinos, among which is a potential explanation for the matter-antimatter asymmetry of the universe via leptogenesis(2), the Majorana nature of neutrinos commands intense experimental scrutinyglobally; one of the primary experimental probes is neutrinoless double beta (Ov beta beta) decay. Here we show results from the search for Ov beta beta decay of(130)Te, using the latest advanced cryogenic calorimeters with the CUORE experiment(3). CUORE, operating just 10 millikelvin above absolute zero, has pushed the state of the art on three frontiers: the sheer mass held at such ultralow temperatures, operational longevity, and the low levels of ionizing radiation emanating from the cryogenic infrastructure. We find no evidence for Ov beta beta decay and set a lower bound of the process half-life as 2.2 x 10(25) years at a 90 per cent credibility interval. We discuss potential applications of the advances made with CUORE to other fields such as direct dark matter, neutrino and nuclear physics searches and large-scale quantum computing, which can benefit from sustained operation of large payloads in a low-radioactivity, ultralow-temperature cryogenic environment.

TI Can We Break the Landauer Bound in Spin-Based Electronics?
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB We found that the minimum energy of reading or erasing a spin datum should be expressed by Delta E = 2 mu B-B, in contrast to Delta E = k(B)T ln(2) proposed by Landauer in 1961. The physics of using a spin's orientation to represent a bit of information is fundamentally different from that of using a particle's position in classical charge-based data storage: the former is quantum-dynamic (independent of temperature below the Curie point), whereas the latter is thermodynamic (dependent on temperature). Quantitatively, this new energy bound associated with a new information erasure protocol was estimated as 1.64 x 10(-36) J, 15 orders of magnitude lower than the Landauer bound (3 x 10(-21) J), at no cost of angular momentum and increased total entropy. In this new information erasure protocol, there is no need to move the electron from one side of the potential well to the other side otherwise the energy used to retain the defined spin state still needs to be greater than the existing thermal fluctuation (the Landauer bound). We verified our new energy bound based on a number of experiments including the Rydberg atom and the spin-spin interaction.

TI Implementation of spectral methods on Ising machines: toward flow
   simulations on quantum annealers
SO FLUID DYNAMICS RESEARCH
AB We investigate the possibility and current limitations of flow computations using quantum annealers by solving a fundamental flow problem on Ising machines. As a fundamental problem, we consider the one-dimensional advection-diffusion equation. We formulate it in a form suited to Ising machines (i.e. both classical and quantum annealers), perform extensive numerical tests on a classical annealer, and finally test it on an actual quantum annealer. To make it possible to process with an Ising machine, the problem is formulated as a minimization problem of the residual of the governing equation discretized using either the spectral method or the finite difference method. The resulting system equation is then converted to the quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) form through the quantization of variables. It is found in numerical tests using a classical annealer that the spectral method requiring a smaller number of variables has a particular merit over the finite difference method because the accuracy deteriorates with the increase of the number of variables. We also found that the computational error varies depending on the condition number of the coefficient matrix. In addition, we extended it to a two-dimensional problem and confirmed its fundamental applicability. From the numerical test using a quantum annealer, however, it turns out that the computation using a quantum annealer is still challenging due largely to the structural difference from the classical annealer, which leaves a number of issues toward its practical use.

TI Epitome of polyoxotungstate-coordinated lanthanide-based single-molecule
   magnets
SO CHEMICAL COMMUNICATIONS
AB Single-molecule magnets (SMMs) have garnered significant interest due to their possible use in high-density data storage devices and quantum computing. SMMs based on lanthanide-encapsulated polyoxotungstate (POT) have emerged due to their stability under ambient conditions and potential application in magnetic devices. The POTs can stabilize various anisotropic lanthanide ions (Ln(iii)) with a range of strong to moderate ligand fields. The systematic combination of Ln(iii) ions with POTs leads to significant perturbation in the electronic structure of the Ln(iii) ion, which notably influences their magnetic properties. The magnetic properties of Ln(iii)-POT clusters are highly dependent on the first coordination geometry and ligand field strength around the Ln(iii) ions. Moreover, the bulky and diamagnetic POTs efficiently minimize the intermolecular magnetic interactions. As a result, the under-barrier magnetic relaxation is suppressed, and magnetic performance is enhanced. Over the years, a diverse array of Ln-POT SMMs have enriched the literature containing vacant POTs as building blocks (such as Keggin, Lindqvist, Wells-Dawson, and Preyssler types). In this review, we have discussed and summarized the effects of structural and bonding diversities of POTs on the SMM behaviour of Ln-POT clusters. This review aims to provide future direction and exploration of the challenging and compelling field of POT-based SMMs.

TI Site-specific photo-crosslinking in a double crossover DNA tile
   facilitated by squaraine dye aggregates: advancing thermally stable and
   uniform DNA nanostructures
SO BIOMATERIALS SCIENCE
AB We investigated the role of dichloro-squaraine (SQ) dye aggregates in facilitating thymine-thymine interstrand photo-crosslinking within double crossover (DX) tiles, to develop thermally stable and structurally uniform two-dimensional (2D) DNA-based nanostructures. By strategically incorporating SQ modified thymine pairs, we enabled site-selective [2 + 2] photocycloaddition under 310 nm UV light. Strong dye-dye interactions, particularly through the formation of aggregates, facilitated covalent bond formation between proximal thymines. To evaluate the impact of dye aggregation on crosslinking efficiency, ten DX tile variants with varying SQ-modified thymine positions were tested. Our results demonstrated that SQ dye aggregates significantly enhanced crosslinking, driven by precise SQ-modified thymine dimer placement within the DNA tiles. Analytical techniques, including denaturing PAGE and UV-visible spectroscopy, validated successful crosslinking in DNA tiles with multiple SQ-modified thymine pairs. This non-phototoxic method offers a potential route for creating thermally stable, homogeneous higher-order DNA-dye assemblies with potential applications in photoactive and exciton-based fields such as optoelectronics, nanoscale computing, and quantum computing. The insights from this study establish a foundation for further exploration of advanced DNA-dye systems, enabling the design of next-generation DNA nanostructures with enhanced functional properties.

TI QuantumNet: An enhanced diabetic retinopathy detection model using
   classical deep learning-quantum transfer learning
SO METHODSX
AB Diabetic Retinopathy (DR), a diabetes-related eye condition, damages retinal blood vessels and can lead to vision loss if undetected early. Precise diagnosis is challenging due to subtle, varied symptoms. While classical deep learning (DL) models like CNNs and ResNet's are widely used, they face resource and accuracy limitations. Quantum computing, leveraging quantum mechanics, offers revolutionary potential for faster problem-solving across fields like cryptography, optimization, and medicine. This research introduces QuantumNet, a hybrid model combining classical DL and quantum transfer learning to enhance DR detection. QuantumNet demonstrates high accuracy and resource efficiency, providing a transformative solution for DR detection and broader medical imaging applications. The method is as follows: center dot Evaluate three classical deep learning models -CNN, ResNet50, and MobileNetV2 -using the APTOS 2019 blindness detection dataset on Kaggle to identify the best-performing model for integration. center dot QuantumNet combines the best-performing classical DL model for feature extraction with a variational quantum classifier, leveraging quantum transfer learning for enhanced diagnostics, validated statistically and on Google Cirq using standard metrics. center dot QuantumNet achieves 94.11 % accuracy, surpassing classical DL models and prior research by 11.93 percentage points, demonstrating its potential for accurate, efficient DR detection and broader medical imaging applications.

TI A Cooperative Hybrid Quantum-Inspired Salp Swarm and Differential
   Evolution for Solving CEC 2022 Benchmark and Controller Placement
   Problems in Software Defined Networks
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB This paper introduces a Cooperative Model of Salp Swarm Optimization (CMSSO), which combines four algorithms: Salp Swarm Algorithm (SSA), Elite Opposition Learning-based SSA (EOSSA), Elite Opposition Quantum-inspired SSA (EQSSA), and Individual Dependent Approach for Differential Evolution (IDA-DE). These algorithms collaborate to tackle single-objective numerical optimization benchmarks from CEC-2022. SSA is a robust population-based metaheuristic renowned for its efficacy in practical optimization tasks. EOL and Quantum-inspired evolutionary algorithms exhibit enhanced capabilities in navigating search spaces compared to standard evolutionary algorithms. The objective of this cooperative model is to preserve the diversity and computational prowess of SSA while leveraging the strengths of these advanced algorithms. The multiobjective controller placement problem in Software Defined Networks (SDN) involves assigning switches to controllers, impacting network Quality of Service (QoS). Previous studies often focused on propagation latency for this assignment. However, our paper addresses this problem considering propagation latency between switches and controllers, inter-controller latency, and load balancing as multiobjective optimization. The experimental results confirmed the effectiveness of the proposed approach and showed that CMSSO is competitive with the standard SSA approaches.

TI AQRS: Anti-quantum ring signature scheme for secure epidemic control
   with blockchain
SO COMPUTER NETWORKS
AB Epidemics, such as Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), have serious consequences globally, of which the most effective way to control the infection is contact tracing. Nowadays, research related to privacy-preserving epidemic infection control has been conducted, nevertheless, current researchers do not regard the authenticity of records and infection facts as well as poor traceability. Moreover, with the emergence of quantum computing, there is a bottleneck in upholding privacy, security and efficiency. Our paper proposes a privacy -preserving epidemic infection control scheme through lattice-based linkable ring signature in blockchain, called AQRS. Firstly, our scheme adopts a blockchain with three ledgers to store information in a distributed manner, which offers transparency and immunity from the Single Point of Failure (SPoF) and Denial of Service (DoS) attacks. Moreover, we design a lattice-based linkable ring signature scheme to secure privacy-preserving of epidemic infection control. Significantly, we are the first to introduce the lattice-based linkable ring signature into privacy preserving in epidemic control scenario. Security analysis indicates that our scheme ensures unconditional users anonymity, record unforgeability, signature linkability, link non-slanderability and contact traceability. Finally, the comprehensive performance evaluation demonstrates that our scheme has an efficient time-consuming, storage consumption and system communication overhead and is practical for epidemic and future pandemic privacy-preserving.

TI Novel high-performance QCA Fredkin gate and designing scalable QCA
   binary to gray and vice versa
SO JOURNAL OF SUPERCOMPUTING
AB In the design of digital logic circuits, QCA technology is an excellent alternative to CMOS technology. Its advantages over CMOS include low power consumption, fast circuit switching, and nanoscale design. Circuits that convert data between different formats are code converters. Code converters have an essential role in high-performance computing and signal processing. In this paper, first, we proposed a novel QCA structure for the quantum reversible Fredkin gate. Second, we proposed 4-bit and 8-bit QCA binary-to-gray converter and vice versa. For the second proposal, both reversible and irreversible structures are suggested. The proposed structures are scalable up to N bits. To change the conversion type from B2G to G2B, we use a 2:1 QCA multiplexer. The proposed QCA Fredkin is applied in the reversible design of QCA code converters as multiplexers. The suggested designs are simulated using the QCADesigner tool. Then we calculated figures of merit, including cell counts, occupied areas, and clock zones. Finally, we compare the proposed structures to existing research. Our proposed approach is the first quantum-dot cellular automata design to perform B2G conversion and G2B in a single QCA circuit. The proposed designs are scalable. Specifications are reported.

TI Understanding AI adoption in manufacturing and production firms using an

SO TECHNOLOGICAL FORECASTING AND SOCIAL CHANGE
AB This study aims to identify how environmental, technological, and social factors influence the adoption of Industry 4.0 in the context of digital manufacturing. The Industry 4.0 era has brought a breakthrough in advanced technologies in fields such as nanotechnology, quantum computing, biotechnology, artificial intelligence, robotics, the Internet of Things, fifth-generation wireless technology, fully autonomous vehicles, 3D printing and so on. In this study, we attempted to identify the socioenvironmental and technological factors that influence the adoption of artificial intelligence embedded technology by digital manufacturing and production organizations. In doing so, the extended technology-organization-environment (TOE) framework is used to explore the applicability of Industry 4.0. A conceptual model was proposed that used an integrated technology acceptance model (TAM)-TOE model and was tested using survey-based data collected from 340 employees of small, medium and large organizations. The results highlight that all the relationships, except organizational readiness, organizational compatibility and partner support on perceived ease of use, were found to be significant in the context of digital manufacturing and production organizations. The results further indicated that leadership support acts as a countable factor to moderate such an adoption.

TI Quantum optimization of complex systems with a quantum annealer
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We perform an in-depth comparison of quantum annealing with several classical optimization techniques, namely, thermal annealing, Nelder-Mead, and gradient descent. The focus of our study is large quasicontinuous potentials that must be encoded using a domain wall encoding. To do this, it is important to first understand the properties of a system that is discretely encoded onto an annealer, in terms of its quantum phases, and the importance of thermal versus quantum effects. We therefore begin with a direct study of the 2D Ising model on a quantum annealer, and compare its properties directly with those of the thermal 2D Ising model. These properties include an Ising-like phase transition that can be induced by either a change in "quantumness" of the theory (by way of the transverse field component on the annealer), or by scaling the Ising couplings up or down. This behavior is in accord with what is expected from the physical understanding of the quantum system. We then go on to demonstrate the efficacy of the quantum annealer at minimizing several increasingly hard two-dimensional potentials. For all potentials, we find the general behavior that Nelder-Mead and gradient descent methods are very susceptible to becoming trapped in false minima, while the thermal anneal method is somewhat better at discovering the true minimum. However, and despite current limitations on its size, the quantum annealer performs a minimization very markedly better than any of these classical techniques. A quantum anneal can be designed so the system almost never gets trapped in a false minimum, and rapidly and successfully minimizes the potentials.

TI Vacuum entanglement probes for ultra-cold atom systems
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB This study explores the transfer of nonclassical correlations from an ultra-cold atom system to a pair of pulsed laser beams. Through nondestructive local probe measurements, we introduce an alternative to destructive techniques for mapping Bose-Einstein Condensate (BEC) entanglement. Operating at ultra-low temperatures, BEC density fluctuations emulate a relativistic vacuum field. We show that lasers can serve as Unruh-DeWitt detectors for vacuum BEC phonons. A quantum vacuum holds intrinsic entanglement, transferable to distant probes briefly interacting with it-a phenomenon termed 'entanglement harvesting'. Our study accomplishes two primary objectives: first, establishing a mathematical connection between a pair of pulsed laser probes interacting with an effective relativistic field and the entanglement harvesting protocol; and second, to closely examine the potential and persisting obstacles for realising this protocol in an ultra-cold atom experiment.

SO APL MACHINE LEARNING
AB The discovery of the quantum tunneling (QT) effect-the transmission of particles through a high potential barrier-was one of the most impressive achievements of quantum mechanics made in the 1920s. Responding to the contemporary challenges, I introduce a deep neural network (DNN) architecture that processes information using the effect of QT. I demonstrate the ability of QT-DNN to recognize optical illusions like a human. Tasking QT-DNN to simulate human perception of the Necker cube and Rubin's vase, I provide arguments in favor of the superiority of QT-based activation functions over the activation functions optimized for modern applications in machine vision, also showing that, at the fundamental level, QT-DNN is closely related to biology-inspired DNNs and models based on the principles of quantum information processing.

TI Fast transport of Bose-Einstein condensates in anharmonic traps
SO PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY A-MATHEMATICAL PHYSICAL
   AND ENGINEERING SCIENCES
AB We present a method to transport Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) in anharmonic traps and in the presence of atom-atom interactions in short times without residual excitation. Using a combination of a variational approach and inverse engineering methods, we derive a set of Ermakov-like equations that take into account the coupling between the centre of mass motion and the breathing mode. By an appropriate inverse engineering strategy of those equations, we then design the trap trajectory to achieve the desired boundary conditions. Numerical examples for cubic or quartic anharmonicities are provided for fast and high-fidelity transport of BECs. Potential applications are atom interferometry and quantum information processing.This article is part of the theme issue 'Shortcuts to adiabaticity: theoretical, experimental and interdisciplinary perspectives'.

AB Dynamical decoupling (DD) is a promising technique for mitigating errors in near-term quantum devices. However, its effectiveness depends on both hardware characteristics and algorithm implementation details. This paper explores the synergistic effects of dynamical decoupling and optimized circuit design in maximizing the performance and robustness of algorithms on near-term quantum devices. By utilizing eight IBM quantum devices, we analyze how hardware features and algorithm design impact the effectiveness of DD for error mitigation. Our analysis takes into account factors such as circuit fidelity, scheduling duration, and hardware-native gate set. We also examine the influence of algorithmic implementation details, including specific gate decompositions, DD sequences, and optimization levels. The results reveal an inverse relationship between the effectiveness of DD and the inherent performance of the algorithm. Furthermore, we emphasize the importance of gate directionality and circuit symmetry in improving performance. This study offers valuable insights for optimizing DD protocols and circuit designs, highlighting the significance of a holistic approach that leverages both hardware features and algorithm design for the high-quality and reliable execution of near-term quantum algorithms.

AB This is a case study of the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) method using numerical simulations to test the influence of noise on the accuracy of the underlying circuit ansatz. We investigate a computational chemistry application of VQE to calculate the electronic ground state and its energy for Sodium Hydride (NaH), a prototypical two-electron problem. Using a one-parameter ansatz derived from unitary coupled cluster (UCC) theory, we simulate the effects of noise on the energy expectation value and variance with respect to the ansatz parameter. These numerical simulations provide insights into the accuracy of the prepared quantum state and the efficiency of the classical optimizer that iteratively refines the ansatz. We conduct a comparative study between analytical results derived for the UCC ansatz in the absence of noise and the noisy numerical simulation results obtained using an isotropic depolarizing noise model for each gate. We also compare the relative increase in noise on logically equivalent UCC ansatz circuits generated by randomized compiling. Notably, we observe that the intrinsic variance in the energy due to the simplicity of the ansatz itself compares with the noise induced by the bare circuit.

TI Smart Readout of Nondestructive Image Sensors with Single
   Photon-Electron Sensitivity
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Image sensors with nondestructive charge readout provide single-photon or single-electron sensitivity, but at the cost of long readout times. We present a smart readout technique to allow the use of these sensors in visible light and other applications that require faster readout times. The method optimizes the readout noise and time by changing the number of times pixels are read out either statically, by defining an arbitrary number of regions of interest in the array, or dynamically, depending on the charge or energy of interest in the pixel. This technique is tested in a Skipper CCD showing that it is possible to obtain deep subelectron noise, and therefore, high resolution of quantized charge, while dynamically changing the readout noise of the sensor. These faster, low noise readout techniques show that the skipper CCD is a competitive technology even where other technologies such as electron multiplier charge coupled devices, silicon photo multipliers, etc. are currently used. This technique could allow skipper CCDs to benefit new astronomical instruments, quantum imaging, exoplanet search and study, and quantum metrology.

TI Time-Efficient Object Recognition in Quantum Ghost Imaging
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB Acquiring information at the fastest possible rate is often desirable, particularly in quantum ghost imaging which suffers from slow reconstruction speeds. Many computationally intense deep-learning methods have been implemented in an effort to speed up image acquisition times by retrieving image information. Often over-looked, machine learning methods can offer the same, if not better, speed up in image acquisition time by an object recognition process. Four machine learning algorithms are implemented and trained on a uniquely generated, noised, and blurred dataset of numerical digits 1 through 9. Of the tested recognition algorithms, logistic regression shows a 10x speed up in image acquisition time with a 99% prediction accuracy. Additionally, this reduction in acquisition time is achieved without any image denoising or enhancement prior to recognition, thereby reducing training and implementation time, as well as the computational intensity of the approach. This method can be implemented in real-time, requiring only 1/10(th) of the measurements needed for a general solution, making it ideal for quantum imaging and recognition of light sensitive structure.

AB The transition to post-quantum cryptography has been an enormous challenge and effort for cryptographers over the last decade, with impressive results such as the future NIST standards. However, the latter has so far only considered central cryptographic mechanisms (signatures or KEM) and not more advanced ones, e.g., targeting privacy-preserving applications. Of particular interest is the family of solutions called blind signatures, group signatures and anonymous credentials, for which standards already exist, and which are deployed in billions of devices. Such a family does not have, at this stage, an efficient post-quantum counterpart although very recent works improved this state of affairs by offering two different alternatives: either one gets a system with rather large elements but a security proved under standard assumptions or one gets a more efficient system at the cost of ad-hoc interactive assumptions or weaker security models. Moreover, all these works have only considered size complexity without implementing the quite complex building blocks their systems are composed of. In other words, the practicality of such systems is still very hard to assess, which is a problem if one envisions a post-quantum transition for the corresponding systems/standards.
   In this work, we propose a construction of so-called signature with efficient protocols (SEP), which is the core of such privacy-preserving solutions. By revisiting the approach by Jeudy et al. (Crypto 2023) we manage to get the best of the two alternatives mentioned above, namely short sizes with no compromise on security. To demonstrate this, we plug our SEP in an anonymous credential system, achieving credentials of less than 80 KB. In parallel, we fully implemented our system, and in particular the complex zero-knowledge framework of Lyubashevsky et al. (Crypto'22), which has, to our knowledge, not be done so far. Our work thus not only improves the state-of-the-art on privacy-preserving solutions, but also significantly improves the understanding of efficiency and implications for deployment in real-world systems.

TI Mermin polynomials for non-locality and entanglement detection in
   Grover's algorithm and Quantum Fourier Transform
SO QUANTUM INFORMATION PROCESSING
AB The non-locality and thus the presence of entanglement of a quantum system can be detected using Mermin polynomials. This gives us a means to study non-locality evolution during the execution of quantum algorithms. We first consider Grover's quantum search algorithm, noticing that states during the execution of the algorithm reach a maximum for an entanglement measure when close to a predetermined state, which allows us to search for a single optimal Mermin operator and use it to evaluate non-locality through the whole execution of Grover's algorithm. Then the Quantum Fourier Transform is also studied with Mermin polynomials. A different optimal Mermin operator is searched for at each execution step, since in this case nothing hints us at finding a predetermined state maximally violating the Mermin inequality. The results for the Quantum Fourier Transform are compared to results from a previous study of entanglement with Cayley hyperdeterminant. All our computations can be repeated thanks to a structured and documented open-source code that we provide.

TI Two-photon induced coherence without induced emission
SO SCIENCE ADVANCES
AB At the heart of recent advances in quantum imaging and spectroscopy with undetected photons is the quantum optical effect known as induced coherence without induced emission. This quantum interference effect has enabled access to challenging wavelength regimes for imaging and spectroscopic applications. However, the potential of undetected photon quantum metrology, particularly the enhanced phase sensitivity offered by Fock or N00N states, has not yet been realized, as prior work focused only on single-photon phenomena. Here, we report the observation of two-photon induced coherence without induced emission. Using a two-photon Fock state, we establish quantum coherence between pairs of two-photon spontaneous emission amplitudes, resulting in a doubling of interferometric phase modulation. Specifically, we show that a phase shift phi applied to undetected 1016-nanometer photons leads to a 2 phi modulation in the detection of 632-nanometer photons. This demonstrates genuine two-photon induced coherence without induced emission and opens possibilities for quantum-enhanced phase measurements using multiphoton coherence without detecting the modulated photons.

TI Reducing the resources required by ADAPT-VQE using coupled exchange
   operators and improved subroutines
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Adaptive variational quantum algorithms arguably offer the best prospects for quantum advantage in the Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum era. Since the inception of the first such algorithm, the Adaptive Derivative-Assembled Problem-Tailored Variational Quantum Eigensolver (ADAPT-VQE), many improvements have appeared in the literature. We combine the key improvements along with a novel operator pool-which we term Coupled Exchange Operator (CEO) pool-to assess the cost of running state-of-the-art ADAPT-VQE on hardware in terms of measurement counts and circuit depth. We show a dramatic reduction of these quantum computational resources compared to the early versions of the algorithm: CNOT count, CNOT depth and measurement costs are reduced by up to 88%, 96% and 99.6%, respectively, for molecules represented by 12 to 14 qubits (LiH, H6 and BeH2). We also find that our state-of-the-art CEO-ADAPT-VQE outperforms the Unitary Coupled Cluster Singles and Doubles ansatz, the most widely used static VQE ansatz, in all relevant metrics, and offers a five order of magnitude decrease in measurement costs as compared to other static ans & auml;tze with competitive CNOT counts.

TI Improving quantum metrology protocols with programmable photonic
   circuits
SO NANOPHOTONICS
AB Photonic quantum metrology enables the measurement of physical parameters with precision surpassing classical limits by using quantum states of light. However, generating states providing a large metrological advantage is hard because standard probabilistic methods suffer from low generation rates. Deterministic protocols using non-linear interactions offer a path to overcome this problem, but they are currently limited by the errors introduced during the interaction time. Thus, finding strategies to minimize the interaction time of these non-linearities is still a relevant question. In this work, we introduce and compare different deterministic strategies based on continuous and programmable Jaynes-Cummings and Kerr-type interactions, aiming to maximize the metrological advantage while minimizing the interaction time. We find that programmable interactions provide a larger metrological advantage than continuous operations at the expense of slightly larger interaction times. We show that while for Jaynes-Cummings non-linearities the interaction time grows with the photon number, for Kerr-type ones it decreases, favoring the scalability to big photon numbers. Finally, we also optimize different measurement strategies for the deterministically generated states based on photon-counting and homodyne detection.

TI U(1)-symmetric recurrent neural networks for quantum state
   reconstruction
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Generative models are a promising technology for the enhancement of quantum simulators. These machine learning methods are capable of reconstructing a quantum state from experimental measurements, and can aid in the calculation of physical observables. In this paper, we employ a recurrent neural network (RNN) to reconstruct the ground state of the spin-1/2 XY model, a prototypical Hamiltonian explored in trapped ion simulators. We explore its performance after enforcing a U(1) symmetry, which was recently shown by Hibat-Allah et al. [Phys. Rev. Res. 2, 023358 (2020)] to preserve the autoregressive nature of the RNN. By studying the reconstruction of the XY model ground state from projective measurement data, we show that imposing U(1) symmetry on the RNN significantly increases the efficiency of learning, particularly in the early epoch regime. We argue that this performance increase may result from the tendency of the enforced symmetry to alleviate vanishing and exploding gradients, which helps stabilize the training process. Thus, symmetry-enforced RNNs may be particularly useful for applications of quantum simulators where a rapid feedback between optimization and circuit preparation is necessary, such as in hybrid classical-quantum algorithms.

TI Empirical performance bounds for quantum approximate optimization
SO QUANTUM INFORMATION PROCESSING
AB The quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) has been put forth as a method for near-term quantum computers to solve optimization problems. However, assessments of QAOA performance have mostly focused on small structured problem instances while performance on more general instances is less clear. Here, we numerically simulate QAOA pure state dynamics for every instance of MaxCut on non-isomorphic unweighted graphs with nine or fewer vertices with depth parameters p <= 3. We find the approximation ratios and optimized circuit parameters concentrate across graphs of a given size and empirically show increases in concentration as graph size increases. The parameter concentration leads to two median-angle heuristics that overcome difficulties in QAOA parameter optimization and obtain mean approximation ratios within 3% and 0.2% of the optimal. We also analyze the probability to measure an optimal solution and find increasing variations between graphs as depth increases, in stark contrast to the approximation ratios which concentrate as depth increases. The resulting benchmark data set gives empirical bounds for on-going experimental realizations and lays groundwork for theoretical extensions to greater problem sizes and depths where QAOA may prove important for practically relevant problems.

SO ULTRAMICROSCOPY
AB Coherent spin resonance methods such as nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and electron spin resonance (ESR) spectroscopy have led to spectrally highly sensitive, non-invasive quantum imaging techniques with groundbreaking applications in fields such as medicine, biology, and physics. Meanwhile, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) offers detailed investigations with sub-atomic resolution, but often inflicts significant radiation damage. Here we exploit synergies and report on an integration of ESR spectroscopy in a TEM. Our miniaturized ESR setup, optimized for microscopic sample sizes, is implemented on a standard TEM sample holder and leverages the strong magnetic field of the TEM polepiece to align and energetically separate spin states. This integration will facilitate in situ studies of spin systems and their dynamics, quantum materials, radicals, electrochemical reactions, and radiation damage - properties that have, until now, been difficult to access using conventional electron microscopic tools. Moreover, this development marks a significant technological advancement towards microwave-driven quantum spin studies with a highly controlled electron probe at the nanoscale.

TI High-speed photon correlation monitoring of amplified quantum noise by

SO APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS
AB Precision experimental determination of photon correlation requires massive amounts of data and extensive measurement time. We present a technique to monitor second-order photon correlation g((2))(0) of amplified quantum noise based on wideband balanced homodyne detection and deep-learning acceleration. The quantum noise is effectively amplified by an injection of weak chaotic laser, and the g((2))(0) of the amplified quantum noise is measured with a real-time sample rate of 1.4 GHz. We also exploit a photon correlation convolutional neural network accelerating correlation data using a few quadrature fluctuations to perform a parallel processing of g((2))(0) for various chaos injection intensities and effective bandwidths. The deep-learning method accelerates the g((2))(0) experimental acquisition with a high accuracy, estimating 6107 sets of photon correlation data with a mean square error of 0.002 in 22 s and achieving a three orders of magnitude acceleration in the data acquisition time. This technique contributes to a high-speed and precision coherence evaluation of entropy source in secure communication and quantum imaging.

TI Quadrature squeezing of 104 spatial modes via manipulation of
   diffraction
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We propose a general and feasible approach to realize a large number of squeezed spatial modes. This is achieved by manipulation of paraxial diffraction such that the critical wave components with most significant squeezing contribute in-phase to the spatial squeezing. As an example, we then demonstrate that it is possible to achieve localized squeezing of similar to-1.51 dB at an area 10(2) mu m(2) within a homogeneously squeezed spatial regime of wp = 1 mm(2) using four-wave mixing (FWM) based on current experimental settings, corresponding to approximately 10(4) squeezed spatial modes, which is >10(2) larger in number of squeezed modes and also similar to 6 times stronger in squeezing as compared to that obtained in the state-of-the-art experiment. We also show that the obtained extremely localized squeezed light can be directly applied to enhance the signal-to-noise ratio in quantum imaging of weakly absorbing objects by a factor of similar to 3.5 at a spatial resolution of d similar to 1 mm where d is the detector size.

When the coefficients in the linear combination are positive, we observe that the eigenvalues of the resulting matrices exhibit resilience to quantum bit-flip errors. In addition, we analyze the bit flips in combination with positive and negative coefficients and the phase flips. Although matrices with mixed-sign coefficients show less resilience to the bit-flip and phase-flip errors, the numerical evidence shows that the perturbation of the eigenspectrum is very small when the rate of these errors is small. We also discuss the situation when this matrix is implemented through block encoding and there is a control register. Since any square matrix can be expressed as a linear combination of permutations multiplied by two scaling matrices from the left and right (via Sinkhorn's theorem), this paper gives a framework to study matrix computations in quantum algorithms related to numerical linear algebra. In addition, it can give ideas to design more error-resilient algorithms that may involve quantum registers with different error characteristics.

TI String-net formulation of Hamiltonian lattice Yang-Mills theories and
   quantum many-body scars in a nonabelian gauge theory
SO JOURNAL OF HIGH ENERGY PHYSICS
AB We study the Hamiltonian lattice Yang-Mills theory based on spin networks that provide a useful basis to represent the physical states satisfying the Gauss law constraints. We focus on SU(2) Yang-Mills theory in (2 + 1) dimensions. Following the string-net model, we introduce a regularization of the Kogut-Susskind Hamiltonian of lattice Yang-Mills theory based on the q deformation, which respects the (discretized) SU(2) gauge symmetry as quantum group, i.e., SU(2)(k), and enables implementation of the lattice Yang-Mills theory both in classical and quantum algorithms by referring to those of the string-net model. Using the regularized Hamiltonian, we study quantum scars in a nonabelian gauge theory. Quantum scars are nonthermal energy eigenstates arising in the constrained quantum many-body systems. We find that quantum scars from zero modes, which have been found in abelian gauge theories arise even in a nonabelian gauge theory. We also show the spectrum of a single-plaquette model for SU(2)(k )and SU(3)(k ) with naive cutoff and that based on the q-deformation to discuss cutoff dependence of the formulation.

TI Total functions in QMA
SO QUANTUM INFORMATION PROCESSING
AB The complexity class QMA is the quantum analog of the classical complexity class NP. The functional analogs of NP and QMA, called functional NP (FNP) and functional QMA (FQMA), consist in either outputting a (classical or quantum) witness or outputting NO if there does not exist a witness. The classical complexity class total functional NP (TFNP) is the subset of FNP for which it can be shown that the NO outcome never occurs. TFNP includes many natural and important problems. Here we introduce the complexity class total functional QMA (TFQMA), the quantum analog of TFNP. We show that FQMA and TFQMA can be defined in such a way that they do not depend on the values of the completeness and soundness probabilities. We provide examples of problems that lie in TFQMA, coming from areas such as the complexity of k-local Hamiltonians and public key quantum money. In the context of black-box groups, we note that group non-membership, which was known to belong to QMA, in fact belongs to TFQMA. We also provide a simple oracle with respect to which we have a separation between FBQP and TFQMA.

TI Chaotic roots of the modular multiplication dynamical system in Shor's
   algorithm
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Shor's factoring algorithm, believed to provide an exponential speedup over classical computation, relies on finding the period of an exactly periodic quantum modular multiplication operator. This exact periodicity is the hallmark of an integrable system, which is paradoxical from the viewpoint of quantum chaos, given that the classical limit of the modular multiplication operator is a highly chaotic system that occupies the "maximally random" Bernoulli level of the classical ergodic hierarchy. In this work, we approach this apparent paradox from a quantum dynamical systems viewpoint, and consider whether signatures of ergodicity and chaos may indeed be encoded in such an "integrable" quantization of a chaotic system. We show that Shor's modular multiplication operator, in specific cases, can be written as a superposition of quantized A-baker's maps exhibiting more typical signatures of quantum chaos and ergodicity. This work suggests that the integrability of Shor's modular multiplication operator may stem from the interference of other "chaotic" quantizations of the same family of maps, and paves the way for deeper studies on the interplay of integrability, ergodicity, and chaos in and via quantum algorithms.

TI Sideband transitions in a two-mode Josephson circuit driven beyond the
   rotating-wave approximation
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Driving quantum systems periodically in time plays an essential role in the coherent control of quantum states. The rotating-wave approximation (RWA) is a good approximation technique for weak and nearly resonance driven fields. However, these experiments sometimes require large detuning and strong driving fields, for which the RWA may not hold. In this work, we experimentally, numerically, and analytically explore strongly driven two-mode Josephson circuits in the regime of strong driving and large detuning. Specifically, we investigate beam-splitter and two-mode squeezing interaction between the two modes induced by driving a two-photon sideband transition. Using numerical simulations, we observe that the RWA is unable to correctly capture the amplitude of the sideband transition rates. We verify this finding using an analytical model that is based on perturbative corrections. We find that the breakdown of the RWA in the regime studied does not lead to qualitatively different dynamics, but gives the same results as the RWA theory at higher drive strengths, enhancing the coupling rates compared to what one would predict. This is an interesting consequence compared to the carrier transition case, where the breakdown of the RWA results in qualitatively different time evolution of the quantum state. Our work provides an insight into the behavior of time-periodically driven systems beyond the RWA. We also provide a robust theoretical framework for including these findings in the calculation and calibration of quantum protocols in circuit quantum electrodynamics.

TI Wavelength-Dependent Spin Excitation with Circularly Polarized Light in
   CdSe Nanoplatelets
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY C
AB Zinc-blende (ZB) cadmium selenide (CdSe) nanoplatelets(NPLs) havedrawn increasing attention as an ideal condensed-phase material forfacilitating photon-to-spin transduction in quantum networks. Yet,a systematic investigation of their fidelity in converting circularlypolarized light (CPL) to exciton spin polarization as a function ofexcitation wavelength is lacking. This work demonstrates using time-resolvedtransient absorption (TA) spectroscopy combined with density functionaltheory calculations that ZB CdSe NPLs exhibit wavelength-dependentCPL-induced spin polarization. The capacity of CPL to inject spinpolarization is maximized for resonant excitation of band-edge valence-to-conductionband (VB/CB) transitions, and the degree to which CPL induces spinpolarization can be modified for non-resonant excitation wavelengthsas excitation occurs at k-points away from the & UGamma;point from VB states with varying degrees of mixed heavy-hole (HH)and light-hole (LH) characters. Furthermore, it is highlighted thatspin polarization within the LH exciton (LX) population created fromresonant LH/CB excitation is retained upon LX & RARR; HH exciton(HX) relaxation due to the slow electron spin-flip rate (& SIM;1.1ps) compared to the LH & RARR; HH inter-band relaxation rate (& SIM;200fs).

TI Coupled cluster downfolding methods: The effect of double commutator
   terms on the accuracy of ground-state energies
SO JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS
AB Downfolding coupled cluster techniques have recently been introduced into quantum chemistry as a tool for the dimensionality reduction of the many-body quantum problem. As opposed to earlier formulations in physics and chemistry based on the concept of effective Hamiltonians, the appearance of the downfolded Hamiltonians is a natural consequence of the single-reference exponential parameterization of the wave function. In this paper, we discuss the impact of higher-order terms originating in double commutators. In analogy to previous studies, we consider the case when only one- and two-body interactions are included in the downfolded Hamiltonians. We demonstrate the efficiency of the many-body expansions involving single and double commutators for the unitary extension of the downfolded Hamiltonians on the example of the beryllium atom, and bond-breaking processes in the Li-2 and H2O molecules. For the H2O system, we also analyze energies obtained with downfolding procedures as functions of the active space size. Published under an exclusive license by AIP Publishing.

TI Hardness of the maximum-independent-set problem on unit-disk graphs and
   prospects for quantum speedups
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Rydberg atom arrays are among the leading contenders for the demonstration of quantum speedups. Motivated by recent experiments with up to 289 qubits [Ebadi et al., Science 376, 1209 (2022)], we study the maximumindependent-set problem on unit-disk graphs with a broader range of classical solvers beyond the scope of the original paper. We carry out extensive numerical studies and assess problem hardness, using both exact and heuristic algorithms. We find that quasiplanar instances with Union-Jack-like connectivity can be solved to optimality for up to thousands of nodes within minutes, with both custom and generic commercial solvers on commodity hardware, without any instance-specific fine-tuning. We also perform a scaling analysis, showing that by relaxing the constraints on the classical simulated annealing algorithms considered in Ebadi et al., our implementation is competitive with the quantum algorithms. Conversely, instances with larger connectivity or less structure are shown to display a time-to-solution potentially orders of magnitudes larger. Based on these results, we propose protocols to systematically tune problem hardness, motivating experiments with Rydberg atom arrays on instances orders of magnitude harder (for established classical solvers) than previously studied.

TI Complementarity between success probability and coherence in Grover
   search algorithm
SO EPL
AB Coherence plays a very important role in Grover search algorithm (GSA). In this paper, we define the normalization coherence N(C), where C is a coherence measurement. By virtue of the constraint of large N and Shannon's maximum entropy principle, a surprising complementary relationship between the coherence and the success probability of GSA is obtained. Namely, P-s(t) + N(C(t)) similar or equal to 1, where C is in terms of the relative entropy of coherence and l(1) norm of coherence, t is the number of the search iterations in GSA. Moreover, the equation holds no matter either in ideal or noisy environments. Considering the number of qubits is limited in the recent noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) era, some exact numerical calculation experiments are presented for different database sizes N with different types of noises. The results show that the complementarity between the success probability and the coherence almost always holds. This work provides a new perspective to improve the success probability by manipulating its complementary coherence, and vice versa. It has an excellent potential for helping quantum algorithms design in the NISQ era. Copyright (C) 2022 EPLA

TI Depth scaling of unstructured search via quantum approximate
   optimization
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Variational quantum algorithms have become the de facto model for current quantum computations. A prominent example of such algorithms-the quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA)-was originally designed for combinatorial optimization tasks, but has been shown to be successful for a variety of other problems. However, for most of these problems the optimal circuit depth remains unknown. One such problem is unstructured search, which consists of finding a particular bit string or, equivalently, preparing a state of high overlap with a target state. To bound the optimal QAOA depth for such a problem we build on its known solution in a continuous time quantum walk (CTQW). We Trotterize a CTQW to recover a QAOA sequence, and employ recent advances on the theory of Trotter formulas to bound the query complexity (circuit depth) needed to prepare a state that approaches perfect overlap with the target state. The obtained complexity exceeds Grover's algorithm complexity O(N-1/2), but remains smaller than O(N1/2 +c) for any c > 0, which shows quantum advantage of QAOA over classical solutions. We verify our analytical predictions by numerical simulations of up to 68 qubits.

AB Hardware security is the root of trust in all modern ICT systems! Depending which community you address, it has a different meaning. It covers efficient, secure implementations of new generations of cryptography such as light-weight crypto, post-quantum crypto as well as advanced schemes such as zero-knowledge proofs, fully homomorphic encryption, and computing on encrypted data in general. On top, implementations also must resist a wide variety of side-channel, fault, and micro-architectural attacks. Post-quantum algorithms promise to resist the attacks developed for quantum computers. Yet, their implementations also must resist attacks on classic platforms.
   Besides crypto, secure systems rely on many more security modules, requiring analog and digital circuit techniques to design quality true random number generators, physically unclonable functions, secure key storage, and many more. A recent report on "Revitalizing the U.S. Semiconductor Ecosystem" (from Executive Office of the President, President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology, September 2022) describes a set of recommendations on semiconductors and system security. In this presentation, we will demonstrate how our research addresses these recommendations, and we will illustrate this with recent results.

TI Rényi relative entropy based monogamy of entanglement in tripartite
   systems
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB A comprehensive investigation of the entanglement characteristics is carried out on tripartite spin-1/2 systems, examining prototypical tripartite states, the thermal Heisenberg model, and the transverse field Ising model. The entanglement is computed using the R & eacute;nyi relative entropy. In the traditional R & eacute;nyi relative entropy, the generalization parameter \documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$\alpha$$\end{document} can take values only in the range \documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$0 \le \alpha \le 2$$\end{document} due to the requirements of joint convexity of the measure. To use the R & eacute;nyi relative entropy over a wider range of \documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$\alpha$$\end{document}, we use the sandwiched form which is jointly convex in the regime \documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$0.5 \le \alpha \le \infty$$\end{document}. In prototypical tripartite states, we find that GHZ states are monogamous, but surprisingly so are W states. On the other hand, star states exhibit polygamy, due to the higher level of purity of the bipartite subsystems. For spin models, we study the dependence of entanglement on various parameters such as temperature, spin-spin interaction, and anisotropy, and identify regions where entanglement is the largest. The R & eacute;nyi parameter \documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$\alpha$$\end{document} scales the amount of entanglement in the system. The entanglement measure based on the traditional and the sandwiched R & eacute;nyi relative entropies obey the Araki-Lieb-Thirring inequality. In the Heisenberg models, namely the XYZ, XXZ, and XY models, the system is always monogamous. However, in the transverse field Ising model, the state is initially polygamous and becomes monogamous with temperature and coupling.

TI Scalability challenges in variational quantum optimization under
   stochastic noise
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB With rapid advances in quantum hardware, a central question is whether quantum devices with or without full error correction can outperform classical computers on practically relevant problems. Variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) have gained significant attention as promising candidates in this pursuit, particularly for combinatorial optimization problems. While reports of their challenges and limitations continue to accumulate, many studies remain optimistic based on small-scale, idealized testing setups, leaving doubt about the scalability of VQAs for large-scale problems. We systematically investigate this scaling behavior by analyzing how classical optimizers minimize variational quantum loss functions for random Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization instances in the presence of uncertainty, modeled as effective Gaussian noise. We find that the critical noise threshold for successful optimization decreases rapidly as system size grows. This decline exceeds what can be explained solely by shrinking loss variance, confirming deeper, fundamental limitations in the loss landscapes of VQAs beyond barren plateaus. Translating these thresholds into required measurement shots reveals that achieving sufficient precision in the evaluated loss values quickly becomes impractical, even for moderatelysized problems. Our findings demonstrate serious scalability challenges for VQAs in optimization stemming from mere uncertainty, indicating potential barriers to achieving practical quantum advantage with current hybrid approaches.

TI qSOA ® : Dynamic integration for hybrid quantum/Classical software
   systems
SO JOURNAL OF SYSTEMS AND SOFTWARE
AB This is the "quantum decade " when quantum computers are proving to be more useful for some types of processing than their classical counterparts. The solutions of the future will combine classical IT with quantum algorithms and applications. However, there is very little work that addresses this issue. Each manufacturer provides specific tools for their products, which makes integration between quantum and classical systems a costly and time-consuming process. We believe that we should follow good software engineering principles and best practices to build platforms and tools that insulate software and systems engineers from implementation details and provide them with adequate support. In this paper we propose qSOA (R) as a mechanism for the dynamic integration of hybrid (quantum/classical) software systems and present in detail an SDK for Python. qSOA (R) provides a set of welldefined functions with which a classical system can access quantum products as if they were a piece of classical software, accessing the use case and not its complexities. In addition to some examples that illustrates its operation in real cases, we present the evaluation of qSOA (R) by 200 quantum software developers in a workshop in collaboration with AWS Braket.

TI Phase-sensitive wave function collapse in two-photon spin Hall effect
SO ADVANCED PHOTONICS
AB Photonic spin Hall effect (SHE) is a fundamental and important optical phenomenon, which originates from the spin-orbit interactions (SOI) of light, forming the cornerstone for a wide range of optical precision measurements. However, the wave function collapse in the single-photon SHE is unpredictable as spin collapse has inherent randomness governed by the Born rule. Here, nonlocal spin bunching and anti-bunching of polarization-entangled photon pairs called two-photon SHE is realized to predict and manipulate the wave function collapse, which is fundamentally different from the single-photon SHE. The two-photon SHE is sensitive to the relative phase among entangled photon pairs, enabling continuous control from nonlocal spin bunching to anti-bunching. Owing to the phase sensitivity of the two-photon SHE, an accurate and simple quantitative phase imaging scheme is realized. The two-photon SHE may pave the way for unveiling the wave function evolution in the SOI of light and manipulating spin-dependent photonic quantum effects.

TI Accelerating Falcon on ARMv8
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Falcon is one of the promising digital-signature algorithms in NIST's ongoing Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) standardization finalist. Computational efficiency regarding software and hardware is also the main criteria for PQC standardization. In this paper, we present an efficient Falcon software implementation on ARMv8 environment. Until now, most of the software optimization on PQC algorithms have been conducted on 32-bit ARM (Cortex-M4) and typical CPUs (Intel and AMD CPUs). However, ARMv8 including Cortex-A30, 50, and 70 series have been widely used for various IoT (Internet of Things) applications, Edge computing devices, and OBUs (On Board Units) in autonomous driving cars. For optimizing the performance of Falcon, we take full advantage of NEON engine which is a kind of parallel processing unit in ARMv8 MCU. The main computation in Falcon belongs to polynomial multiplications in Complex number domain and Integer domain. Typically, FFT (Fast Fourier Transformation)-based multiplication method and NTT (Number Theoriteic Transform)-based multiplication method have been widely used for efficient polynomial multiplications in Complex number domain and Integer domain, respectively. Thus, in order to enhance the overall performance of Falcon, we improve the FFT-based multiplication method and NTT-based multiplication method by utilizing NEON engine in ARMv8. Specifically, we parallelize the overall process (FFT/NTT transformation, pointwise multiplication, and inverse FFT/NTT transformation) of FFT-based polynomial multiplication method and NTT-based polynomial multiplication method with strategically utilizing the NEON engine and vector instructions. Furthermore, we minimize the number of redundant memory accesses during FFT/NTT-based polynomial multiplication by making the most of available registers in NEON engine. Through the proposed parallel FFT/NTT-based polynomial multiplications, the proposed Falcon software provides 15.1% (resp. 18.1%), 16.5% (resp. 17.1%), and 65.4% (resp. 69.4%) of performance improvement in keypair generation, signing, and verification at security level 1 (resp. 5) compared with the reference Falcon implementation submitted to the final round of NIST PQC competition. Furthermore, as far as we know, this is the first optimized implementation of Falcon on ARMv8 environment.

TI Range dependent Hamiltonian algorithms for numerical QUBO formulation
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB With the advent and development of quantum computers, various quantum algorithms that can solve linear equations and eigenvalues faster than classical computers have been developed. In particular, a hybrid solver provided by D-Wave's Leap quantum cloud service can utilize up to two million variables. Using this technology, quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) models have been proposed for linear systems, eigenvalue problems, RSA cryptosystems, and computed tomography (CT) image reconstructions. Generally, QUBO formulation is obtained through simple arithmetic operations, which offers great potential for future development with the progress of quantum computers. A common method here was to binarize the variables and match them to multiple qubits. To achieve the accuracy of 64 bits per variable, 64 logical qubits must be used. Finding the global minimum energy in quantum optimization becomes more difficult as more logical qubits are used; thus, a quantum parallel computing algorithm that can create and compute multiple QUBO models is introduced here. This new algorithm divides the entire domain each variable can have into multiple subranges to generate QUBO models. This paper demonstrates the superior performance of this new algorithm particularly when utilizing an algorithm for binary variables.

TI Potential Vulnerabilities of Cryptographic Primitives in Modern
   Blockchain Platforms
SO SCI
AB Today, blockchain technologies are a separate, rapidly developing area. With rapid development, they open up a number of scientific problems. One of these problems is the problem of reliability, which is primarily associated with the use of cryptographic primitives. The threat of the emergence of quantum computers is now widely discussed, in connection with which the direction of post-quantum cryptography is actively developing. Nevertheless, the most popular blockchain platforms (such as Bitcoin and Ethereum) use asymmetric cryptography based on elliptic curves. Here, cryptographic primitives for blockchain systems are divided into four groups according to their functionality: keyless, single-key, dual-key, and hybrid. The main attention in the work is paid to the most significant cryptographic primitives for blockchain systems: keyless and single-key. This manuscript discusses possible scenarios in which, during practical implementation, the mathematical foundations embedded in the algorithms for generating a digital signature and encrypting data using algorithms based on elliptic curves are violated. In this case, vulnerabilities arise that can lead to the compromise of a private key or a substitution of a digital signature. We consider cases of vulnerabilities in a blockchain system due to incorrect use of a cryptographic primitive, describe the problem, formulate the problem statement, and assess its complexity for each case. For each case, strict calculations of the maximum computational costs are given when the conditions of the case under consideration are met. Among other things, we present a new version of the encryption algorithm for data stored in blockchain systems or transmitted between blockchain systems using elliptic curves. This algorithm is not the main blockchain algorithm and is not included in the core of modern blockchain systems. This algorithm allows the use of the same keys that system users have in order to store sensitive user data in an open blockchain database in encrypted form. At the same time, possible vulnerabilities that may arise from incorrect implementation of this algorithm are considered. The scenarios formulated in the article can be used to test the reliability of both newly created blockchain platforms and to study long-existing ones.

TI Measure-independent description of wave-particle duality via coherence
SO PHYSICA SCRIPTA
AB Wave-particle duality as one of the expression of Bohr complementarity is a significant concept in the field of quantum mechanics. Quantitative analysis of wave-particle duality aims to establish a complementary relation between the particle and wave properties. Beyond the conventional quantitative analysis depending on special choice of quantum information measures, we are aimed to provide a measure-independent complementary relation via coherence. By employing maximally coherent states in the set of all states with fixed diagonal elements, we give a measure-independent description of wave-particle-mixedness triality in d-path interferometers. Our complementary relations reveal the relationship between wave-particle duality and quantum coherence, and also give a justification to coherence as it truly brings out the wave nature of quantum systems at its heart.

Our results are derived by a joint use of recently studied hypercontractivity and gradient estimates. These generic tools also allow us to derive generalizations of these results in a general von Neumann algebraic setting beyond the case of the quantum hypercube, including examples in infinite dimensions relevant to quantum information theory such as continuous variables quantum systems. Finally, we comment on the implications of our results as regards to noncommutative extensions of isoperimetric type inequalities, quantum circuit complexity lower bounds and the learnability of quantum observables.

TI Nonlinear quantum logic with colliding graphene plasmons
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Graphene has emerged as a promising platform to bring nonlinear quantum optics to the nanoscale, where a large intrinsic optical nonlinearity enables long-lived and actively tunable plasmon polaritons to strongly interact. Here we theoretically study the collision between two counter-propagating plasmons in a graphene nanoribbon, where transversal subwavelength confinement endows propagating plasmons with a flat band dispersion that enhances their interaction. This scenario presents interesting possibilities towards the implementation of multi -mode polaritonic gates that circumvent limitations imposed by the Shapiro no-go theorem for photonic gates in nonlinear optical fibers. As a paradigmatic example we demonstrate the feasibility of a high-fidelity conditional pi phase shift (CZ), where the gate performance is fundamentally limited only by the single-plasmon lifetime. These results open exciting avenues towards quantum information and many-body applications with strongly interacting polaritons.

TI Enhanced nonlinearity of four-wave mixing via Rydberg-Rydberg
   interactions
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB We investigate the four-wave mixing (FWM) nonlinearity in an ensemble of cold Rydberg atoms with each of them regarded as a double-ladder system. The interaction is studied from the view of generating a signal field in virtue of three applied lasers. Using an approach beyond mean-field theory, we solved the equations for the one-body and two-body correlators under perturbation, and show that the system possesses not only a local FWM nonlinearity, but also a much larger nonlocal nonlinearity due to the Rydberg-Rydberg interaction which can be further strengthened by increasing the atomic density. The results obtained may have promising applications in the quantum information processes involving the FWM nonlinearity, such as the generation of squeezed or entangled states.

TI Generic detection-based error mitigation using quantum autoencoders
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Efficient error-mitigation techniques demanding minimal resources is key to quantum information processing. We propose a generic protocol to mitigate quantum errors using detection-based quantum autoencoders. In our protocol, the quantum data are compressed into a latent subspace while leaving errors outside, the latter of which is then removed by a measurement and postselection. Compared to previously developed methods, our protocol on the one hand requires no extra qubits, and on the other hand it has a near-optimal denoising power, in which under reasonable requirements all errors detected outside of the latent subspace can be removed, while those inside the subspace cannot be removed by any means. Our detection-based quantum autoencoders are therefore particularly useful for near-term quantum devices in which controllable qubits are limited while noise reduction is important.

   Erasure

AB The Hong-Ou-Mandel (HOM) effect, also called two-photon interference, which is pivotal in quantum information processing, serves as the foundation for our coherent two-photon wind detection method, achieving time-frequency discrimination. Our method capitalizes on the complete erasure of phase and color distinctions with up-conversion detectors, allowing for the observation of HOM interference among independently sourced photons without necessitating delay tuning or active synchronization. The integration of quantum erasure enhances the bandwidth in both space-time and frequency domains, paving the way for ultrafast, continuous velocity detection up to tens of km/s. The demonstration uses just 14% pulse energy of previous levels, enabling a wind detection range up to 16 km, marking a quantum leap in remote sensing capabilities.

TI Activation of indistinguishability-based quantum coherence for enhanced
   metrological applications with particle statistics imprint
SO PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF
   AMERICA
AB Quantum coherence, an essential feature of quantum mechanics allowing quantum superposition of states, is a resource for quantum information processing. Coherence emerges in a fundamentally different way for nonidentical and identical particles. For the latter, a unique contribution exists linked to indistinguishability that cannot occur for nonidentical particles. Here we experimentally demonstrate this additional contribution to quantum coherence with an optical setup, showing that its amount directly depends on the degree of indistinguishability and exploiting it in a quantum phase discrimination protocol. Furthermore, the designed setup allows for simulating fermionic particles with photons, thus assessing the role of exchange statistics in coherence generation and utilization. Our experiment proves that independent indistinguishable particles can offer a controllable resource of coherence and entanglement for quantum-enhanced metrology.

   Waals heterostructure
SO SCIENCE ADVANCES
AB Two-dimensional (2D) materials, particularly transition metal dichalcogenides, have exceptional optoelectronic properties, making them highly promising for next-generation photonic integrated circuits. Despite great advancements in 2D optoelectronic devices, achieving ultrafast and controllable photoconductivity polarity inversion with a single device remains a fundamental challenge due to the static nature of built-in electric fields at metal/2D material interfaces. This study demonstrates a transient electric field reversal at the MoTe2/Pt Schottky junction, enabling photoconductivity inversion from negative to positive within 100 ps. By applying ultrafast photocurrent detection, a minimal voltage variation (10 mV) precisely controls this transition, and a device with a remarkable photocurrent response time of 3.8 ps is proposed. This work advances the design of ultrafast, tunable photodetectors, offering potential applications in high-speed optical communication, ultrafast imaging, and quantum information processing.

Finally, we provide an example where the Bures metric and induced quantum metric are not metric equivalent. Thus, we provide a bridge between these aspects of quantum information theory and noncommutative metric geometry.

TI Making the Thermodynamic Cost of Active Inference Explicit
SO ENTROPY
AB When describing Active Inference Agents (AIAs), the term "energy" can have two distinct meanings. One is the energy that is utilized by the AIA (e.g., electrical energy or chemical energy). The second meaning is so-called Variational Free Energy (VFE), a statistical quantity which provides an upper bound on surprisal. In this paper, we develop an account of the former quantity-the Thermodynamic Free Energy (TFE)-and its relationship with the latter. We highlight the necessary tradeoffs between these two in a generic, quantum information-theoretic formulation, and the macroscopic consequences of those tradeoffs for the ways that organisms approach their environments. By making this tradeoff explicit, we provide a theoretical basis for the different metabolic strategies that organisms from plants to predators use to survive.

TI Fractal dimension, lacunarity, and Shannon entropy of self-assembled
   macroscopic copper dendrites
SO FRONTIERS IN PHYSICS
AB Macroscopic copper dendrites are self-assembled in a porous hydrogel without the application of an external potential. The copper dendrites possess fractal characteristics. The impact of the medium thickness, the initial concentration of copper (II) ions, and the solvent polarity on the evolving copper dendrites are addressed by investigating the fractal dimension, lacunarity, and Shannon entropy (SE) of the structures. The analysis gives a quantitative description of the copper dendritic morphology and its connection to the mechanism of self-assembly. The fractal dimension of the dendrites falls in the range of 1.75-1.85. High self-similar complex systems show low lacunarity and high Shannon entropy, reflecting the low density of gaps and the high level of detail.

TI Continuous Raman sideband cooling beyond the Lamb-Dicke regime in a
   trapped ion chain
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB We report continuous Raman sideband cooling of a long ion chain close to the motional ground state beyond the Lamb-Dicke (LD) regime. By driving multiple sideband transitions simultaneously, we show that nearly all axial modes of a 24-ion chain are cooled to the ground state, with an LD parameter as large as eta = 1.3, spanning a frequency bandwidth of 4 MHz. Compared to traditional ground-state cooling methods such as pulsed sideband cooling or electromagnetically-induced-transparency cooling, our method offers two key advantages: disposal of pulse optimization, and a wide bandwidth covering the entire spectrum. This technique contributes as a crucial step for large-scale quantum information processing with linear ion chains and higher dimensions alike, and can be readily generalized to other atomic and molecular systems.

TI Tripartite genuinely entangled states from entanglement-breaking
   subspaces
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS A-MATHEMATICAL AND THEORETICAL
AB The determination of genuine entanglement is a central problem in quantum information processing. We investigate the tripartite state as the tensor product of two bipartite entangled states by merging two systems. We show that the tripartite state is a genuinely entangled (GE) state when the range of both bipartite states are entanglement-breaking (EB) subspaces. We further investigate the tripartite state when one of the two bipartite states has rank two. Our results provide the latest progress on a conjecture proposed in the paper [Yi Shen et al 2020 J. Phys. A 53 125302]. We apply our results to construct multipartite states whose bipartite reduced density operators have additive entanglement of formation (EOF). Further, such states are distillable across every bipartition under local operations and classical communications.

TI Emergence of the Wavefunction of a Non-relativistic Quantum Particle
   from QFT
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF THEORETICAL PHYSICS
AB The enormous success of the Standard Model of particle physics has clearly established quantum fields as the fundamental elements of reality of the universe unveiled to us so far. Here we present for the first time a thorough derivation of the wavefunction of a nonrelativistic quantum state directly as a physically real matrix element in the quantum field theory. Consequently, the debate about whether the wavefunction is real or epistemic can now be reasonably put to rest and nonrelativistic quantum mechanics can well be on its way as a genuine theory. This significant development in our understanding of quantum mechanics has lasting theoretical and practical implications for quantum information, computing, cryptography, and relevant technology as establishing the reality of the wavefunction immediately establishes the reality of qubits.

TI Orchestrating time and color: a programmable source of high-dimensional
   entanglement
SO OPTICA QUANTUM
AB High-dimensional encodings based on temporal modes (TMs) of photonic quantum states provide the foundations for a highly versatile and efficient quantum information science (QIS) framework. Here, we demonstrate a crucial building block for any QIS applications based on TMs: a programmable source of maximally entangled high-dimensional TM states. Our source is based on a parametric downconversion process driven by a spectrally shaped pump pulse, which facilitates the generation of maximally entangled TM states with a well-defined dimensionality that can be chosen programmatically. We characterize the effective dimensionality of the generated states via measurements of second-order correlation functions and joint spectral intensities, demonstrating the generation of bi-photon TM states with a controlled dimensionality in up to 20 dimensions.

TI A Hierarchy in Majorana Non-Abelian Tests and Hidden Variable Models
SO CHINESE PHYSICS LETTERS
AB The recent progress of the Majorana experiments paves a way for the future tests of non-Abelian braiding statistics and topologically protected quantum information processing. However, a deficient design in those tests could be very dangerous and reach false-positive conclusions. A careful theoretical analysis is necessary so as to develop loophole-free tests. We introduce a series of classical hidden variable models to capture certain key properties of Majorana system: non-locality, topologically non-triviality, and quantum interference. Those models could help us to classify the Majorana properties and to set up the boundaries and limitations of Majorana non-Abelian tests: fusion tests, braiding tests and test set with joint measurements. We find a hierarchy among those Majorana tests with increasing experimental complexity.

TI Discrimination of coherent states via atom-field interaction without
   rotation wave approximation
SO COMMUNICATIONS IN THEORETICAL PHYSICS
AB Quantum state discrimination is an important part of quantum information processing. We investigate the discrimination of coherent states through a Jaynes-Cummings (JC) model interaction between the field and the ancilla without rotation wave approximation (RWA). We show that the minimum failure probability can be reduced as RWA is eliminated from the JC model and the non-RWA terms accompanied by the quantum effects of fields (e.g. the virtual-photon process in the JC model without RWA) can enhance the state discrimination. The JC model without RWA for unambiguous state discrimination is superior to ambiguous state discrimination, particularly when the number of sequential measurements increases. Unambiguous state discrimination implemented via the non-RWA JC model is beneficial to saving resource costs.

TI Metabolic limits on classical information processing by biological cells
SO BIOSYSTEMS
AB Biological information processing is generally assumed to be classical. Measured cellular energy budgets of both prokaryotes and eukaryotes, however, fall orders of magnitude short of the power required to maintain classical states of protein conformation and localization at the angstrom, fs scales predicted by single-molecule decoherence calculations and assumed by classical molecular dynamics models. We suggest that decoherence is limited to the immediate surroundings of the cell membrane and of intercompartmental boundaries within the cell, and that bulk cellular biochemistry implements quantum information processing. Detection of Bell-inequality violations in responses to perturbation of recently-separated sister cells would provide a sensitive test of this prediction. If it is correct, modeling both intra-and intercellular communication requires quantum theory.

TI Negative result about the construction of genuinely entangled subspaces
   from unextendible product bases
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Unextendible product bases (UPBs) provide a versatile tool with various applications across different areas of quantum information theory. Their comprehensive characterization is thus of great importance and has been a subject of vital interest for over two decades now. An open question asks about the existence of UPBs, which are genuinely unextendible, i.e., they are not extendible even with biproduct vectors. In other words, the problem is to verify whether there exist genuinely entangled subspaces (GESs), subspaces composed solely of genuinely multiparty entangled states, complementary to UPBs. We solve this problem in the negative for many sizes of UPBs in different multipartite scenarios. In particular, in the all-important case of equal local dimensions, we show that there are always forbidden cardinalities for such UPBs, including the minimal ones corresponding to GESs of the maximal dimensions.

TI Entanglement generation and steering implementation in a
   double-cavity-magnon hybrid system
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB We demonstrate a scheme for the generation of bipartite and tripartite entanglement, as well as he implementation of stable and controllable long-distance one-way and asymmetric two-way steering in a cavity-magnon hybrid system. This system consists of a magnon mode and two coupled microwave cavities. The first cavity is driven by a flux-driven Josephson parametric amplifier, which generates squeezed vacuum fields, and is coupled to the other cavity through optical tunneling interaction. The second cavity and magnon mode are coupled through magnetic dipole interaction. We find that under weak coupling between the two cavities, and strong coupling between the second cavity and magnon mode, remote controllable one-way steering and tripartite entanglement can be achieved. Our scheme may have potential applications in quantum information.

TI A DDS-based integrated microwave source for fast frequency sweeping in
   quantum magnetic-resonance systems
SO AIP ADVANCES
AB Magnetic resonance is a fundamental method to manipulate qubits in spin-based quantum information processing. In such areas, the functionality of fast frequency sweeping is required to determine the resonance of the system. We provide a hardware-synchronized sweeping microwave source with a minimal latency in the sub-mu s level based on the direct digital synthesizer technique. The output frequency can be up-converted to match the requirement for particular applications. We demonstrate this module in an optically detected magnetic resonance experiment for a nitrogen-vacancy center, and the spectrum is obtained much faster than conventional schemes with high resolution. Comparing with commercial vector signal generators, our module is highly integrated on a single board with a limited area, especially suitable for engineering of quantum sensors and devices in the future.

TI Enhanced Photonic Maxwell's Demon with Correlated Baths
SO QUANTUM
AB Maxwell's Demon is at the heart of the interrelation between quantum information processing and thermodynamics. In this thought experiment, a demon generates a temperature gradient between two thermal baths initially at equilibrium by gaining information at the single-particle level and applying classical feed-forward operations, allowing for the extraction of work. Here we implement a photonic version of Maxwell's Demon with active feed-forward in a fibre-based system using ultrafast optical switches. We experimentally show that, if correlations exist between the two thermal baths, the Demon can generate a temperature difference over an order of magnitude larger than without correlations, and so extract more work. Our work demonstrates the great potential of photonic experiments - which provide a unique degree of control on the system - to access new regimes in quantum thermodynamics.

SO ANNALS OF PHYSICS
AB We investigate the ground state configuration and spin dynamics of a quantum spin spiral dimer when a magnetic field is applied to one of its constituent spins. By adiabatic changing the magnetic field, it is possible to change the non-magnetic ground state to a classical spiral state, which oscillates periodically to its inverted classical spiral state configuration. This oscillation can be halted at any time, leading to the possibility of manipulating the quantum state and the magnetic configuration of the spin dimer. Notably, this idea is not limited to spin dimers and can also be extended to quantum spin chains with an even number of spins.

TI Krylov Shadow Tomography: Efficient Estimation of Quantum Fisher
   Information
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Efficiently estimating the quantum Fisher information (QFI) is pivotal in quantum information science but remains an outstanding challenge for large systems due to its high nonlinearity. In this Letter, we tackle this long-standing challenge by integrating the Krylov subspace method-a celebrated tool from applied mathematics-into the framework of shadow tomography. The integrated technique, dubbed Krylov shadow tomography, enables us to formulate a strict hierarchy of nonpolynomial lower bounds on the QFI, among which the highest one matches the QFI exactly. We show that all the bounds can be expressed as expected values of the inverses of Hankel matrices, which are accessible via shadow tomography. Our Krylov shadow tomography therefore opens up a resource-efficient and experimentally feasible avenue to estimate not only nonpolynomial lower bounds but also the QFI itself.

TI Formation of Paramagnetic Defects in the Synthesis of Silicon Carbide
SO MICROMACHINES
AB Silicon carbide (SiC) is a very promising platform for quantum information processing, as it can host room temperature solid state defect quantum bits. These room temperature quantum bits are realized by paramagnetic silicon vacancy and divacancy defects in SiC that are typically introduced by irradiation techniques. However, irradiation techniques often introduce unwanted defects near the target quantum bit defects that can be detrimental for the operation of quantum bits. Here, we demonstrate that by adding aluminum precursor to the silicon and carbon sources, quantum bit defects are created in the synthesis of SiC without any post treatments. We optimized the synthesis parameters to maximize the paramagnetic defect concentrations-including already established defect quantum bits-monitored by electron spin resonance spectroscopy.

TI Fast spin squeezing by distance-selective long-range interactions with
   Rydberg molecule dressing
SO SCIENCE CHINA-PHYSICS MECHANICS & ASTRONOMY
AB We propose a Rydberg molecule dressing scheme to create strong and long-ranged interactions at selective distances. This is achieved through laser coupling ground-state atoms off-resonantly to an attractive molecular curve of two interacting Rydberg atoms. Although dephasing due to Rydberg state decay occurs in all dressing schemes, an advantage of the molecule dressing is that a large ratio of dressed interaction to dephasing rate can be realized at large atomic separations. In an optical lattice or tweezer setting, we show that the strong interaction permits the fast generation of spin squeezing for several tens of dressed atoms. The proposed setting offers a new route to study complex many-body dynamics and to realize quantum information processing with non-convex long-range interactions.

It is also shown that the newly established results are the refinements of some existing results in the field of integral inequalities. Analytic inequalities of this nature and especially the techniques involved have applications in various areas in which symmetry plays a prominent role.

TI LDACS Flight Trials: Demonstration and Performance Analysis of the
   Future Aeronautical Communications System
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON AEROSPACE AND ELECTRONIC SYSTEMS
AB The L-band digital aeronautical communications system (LDACS) is a key enabler of the new air traffic services and operational concepts necessary for the modernization of the air traffic management (ATM). After its initial design, compatibility tests with legacy L-band systems, and functional demonstrations in the laboratory, the system is currently undergoing the standardization process of the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO). However, LDACS has not been demonstrated in flight yet. In this article, we present the first in-flight demonstration of LDACS, which took place in March and April 2019 in southern Germany and included four LDACS ground stations and one LDACS airborne station. We detail the experimental setup of the implemented LDACS ground and airborne stations together with the flight routes, the conducted experiments, and the frequency planning to ensure compatibility with legacy systems. In addition, we describe the demonstrated ATM applications and the security measures used to protect them. Based on the obtained measurement results, we evaluate the LDACS in-flight communication performance for the first time, including the achieved communication range, the measured end-to-end message latency, and the LDACS capability to provide quality of service by effectively prioritizing safety-relevant data traffic. Furthermore, we use the in-flight received signal power to assess the applicability of a theoretical path loss model. These flight trials contribute to the final steps in the development of LDACS by providing its in-flight communication performance and by demonstrating: first, its correct functionality in a realistic environment; second, its capability of supporting ATM applications and the advanced security measures that can be used to protect them; and third, its spectrum compatibility with legacy systems. We conclude that LDACS is ready to support ATM operations and that LDACS frequency planning can safeguard legacy systems successfully.

TI Faster multiplication over F2[X] sing AVX512
   instruction set and VPCLMULQDQ instruction
SO JOURNAL OF CRYPTOGRAPHIC ENGINEERING
AB Code-based cryptography is one of the main propositions for the post-quantum cryptographic context, and several protocols of this kind have been submitted on the NIST platform. Among them, BIKE and HQC are part of the five alternate candidates selected in the third round of the NIST standardization process in the KEM category. These two schemes make use of multiplication of large polynomials over binary rings, and due to the polynomial size (from 10,000 to 60,000 bits), this operation is one of the costliest during key generation, encapsulation, or decapsulation mechanisms. In BIKE-2, there is also a polynomial inversion which is time-consuming and this problem has been addressed in Drucker (Fast polynomial inversion for post quantum QC-MDPC cryptography, 2020). In this work, we revisit the different existing constant-time algorithms for arbitrary polynomial multiplication. We explore the different Karatsuba and Toom-Cook constructions in order to determine the best combinations for each polynomial degree range, in the context of AVX2 and AVX512 instruction sets. This leads to different kernels and constructions in each case. In particular, in the context of AVX512, we use the VPCLMULQDQ instruction, which is a vectorized binary polynomial multiplication instruction. This instruction deals with up to four polynomial (of degree up to 63) multiplications, that is four operand pairs of 64-bit words with 128-bit word storing each result, the four results being stored in one single 512-bit word. This allows to divide by roughly 3 the retired instruction number of the operation in comparison with the AVX2 instruction set implementations, while the speedup is up to 39% in terms of processor clock cycles. These results are different than the ones estimated in Drucker (Fast multiplication of binary polynomials with the forthcoming vectorized vpclmulqdq instruction, 2018). To illustrate the benefit of the new VPCLMULQDQ instruction, we used the HQC code to evaluate our approaches. When implemented in the HQC protocol, for the security levels 128, 192, and 256, our approaches provide up to 12% speedup, for key pair generation.

TI Tutorial: Hong-Ou-Mandel interference with structured photons
SO NANOPHOTONICS
AB The Hong-Ou-Mandel (HOM) effect, an effective two-photon interference phenomenon, is a cornerstone of quantum optics and a key tool for linear optical quantum information processing. While the HOM effect has been extensively studied both theoretically and experimentally for various photonic quantum states, particularly in the spectral domain, detailed overviews of its behaviour for structured photons - those with complex spatial profiles - under arbitrary spatial mode measurement schemes are still lacking. This tutorial aims to fill this gap by providing a comprehensive theoretical analysis of the HOM effect for structured photons, including an arbitrary mode projection on quantum interference outcomes. The tutorial also provides analytical, closed-form expressions of the HOM visibility under different measurement conditions.

TI Computation of Magnetic Exchange Couplings in Photoexcited Systems Based
   on KS-DFT
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY LETTERS
AB Many efforts have been made in the study of optically excited spin-coupled molecules due to their appealing features for quantum information sciences. However, the characterization of the magnetic exchange couplings occurring from the photoexcitation is challenging experimentally. In this context, theoretical determinations play a critical role and must provide evaluations with rigorous and cost-effective strategies. This work presents a new approach to compute magnetic exchange couplings in photoexcited systems based on the recently generalized decomposition/recomposition method (David et al., Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys. 2024, 6, 8952-8964). This corresponds to the first application of KS-DFT in this context and offers both a completely general method and a powerful rationalization tool. This strategy is applied to mono- and biradical-based molecules recently synthesized by Kirk and co-workers.

TI Construction of Asymmetric Orthogonal Arrays With High Strength
SO STAT
AB Orthogonal arrays (OAs) are a key research focus in combinatorial design theory and experimental design theory. They play a very important role in an increasing number of interdisciplinary fields, such as computer science, cryptography, multipartite quantum states and quantum information. And the open problems in many fields are closely related to the construction of orthogonal arrays with high strength and large size. At present, some open problems have been solved by using orthogonal arrays. There is an urgent need for developing such orthogonal arrays. This article introduces a general method for obtaining asymmetric orthogonal arrays with high strength. The proposed method is straightforward and constructive. The constructed OAs can be utilized to generate more OAs. Some selective OAs are tabulated for practical applications.

TI Phase-controlled photon blockade in optomechanical systems
SO FUNDAMENTAL RESEARCH
AB The manipulation of photons is a key technology for obtaining optical quantum information. In this study, we present a phase-modulated optomechanical system comprising two coupled cavity resonators and illustrate the phase-controlled photon blockade in the system. The coupling phase of the cavities reveals the interference of photons and introduces an unconventional photon-blockade effect. We also study the influence of the energy level fineness on the photon blockade and resonant frequency of the mechanical mode. Numerical simulations demonstrate that photon blockade can occur over a wide range of system parameters. These results have sev-eral implications for understanding the role of the state phase in quantum cavity optomechanics and provide a promising method for the realization of optomechanical quantum devices using photon blockade.

TI Transitions from Abelian composite fermion to non-Abelian parton
   fractional quantum Hall states in the zeroth Landau level of bilayer
   graphene
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB The electron-electron interaction in the Landau levels of bilayer graphene is markedly different from that of conventional semiconductors such as GaAs. We show that in the zeroth Landau level of bilayer graphene, in the orbital which is dominated by the nonrelativistic second Landau level wave function, by tuning the magnetic field, a topological quantum phase transition from an Abelian composite fermion to a non-Abelian parton fractional quantum Hall state can be induced at filling factors 1/2, 2/5, and 3/7. The parton states host exotic anyons that can potentially be utilized to store and process quantum information. Intriguingly, some of these transitions may have been observed in a recent experiment (K. Huang et al., arXiv:2105.07058).

TI Code interoperability extends the scope of quantum simulations
SO NPJ COMPUTATIONAL MATERIALS
AB The functionality of many materials is critically dependent on the integration of dissimilar components and on the interfaces that arise between them. The description of such heterogeneous components requires the development and deployment of first principles methods, coupled to appropriate dynamical descriptions of matter and advanced sampling techniques, in order to capture all the relevant length and time scales of importance to the materials' performance. It is thus essential to build simple, streamlined computational schemes for the prediction and design of multiple properties of broad classes of materials, by developing interoperable codes which can be efficiently coupled to each other to perform complex tasks. We discuss the use of interoperable codes to simulate the structural and spectroscopic characterization of materials, including chemical reactions for catalysis, the description of defects for quantum information science, and heat and charge transport.

TI Programmable electron-induced color router array
SO LIGHT-SCIENCE & APPLICATIONS
AB The development of color routers (CRs) realizes the splitting of dichromatic components, contributing to the modulation of photon momentum that acts as the information carrier for optical information technology on the frequency and spatial domains. However, CRs with optical stimulation lack active control of photon momentum at deep subwavelength scale because of the optical diffraction limit. Here, we experimentally demonstrate an active manipulation of dichromatic photon momentum at a deep subwavelength scale via electron-induced CRs, where the CRs radiation patterns are manipulated by steering the electron impact position within 60 nm in a single nanoantenna unit. Moreover, an encrypted display device based on programmable modulation of the CR array is designed and implemented. This approach with enhanced security, large information capacity, and high-level integration at a deep subwavelength scale may find applications in photonic devices and emerging areas in quantum information technologies.

TI Detecting entanglement harnessing Lindblad structure
SO PHYSICA SCRIPTA
AB The problem of entanglement detection is a long standing problem in quantum information theory. One of the primary procedures of detecting entanglement is to find the suitable positive but non-completely positive maps. Here we try to give a generic prescription to construct a positive map that can be useful for such scenarios. We study a class of positive maps arising from Lindblad structures. We show that two famous positive maps viz. transposition, reduction map and Choi map can be obtained as a special case of a class of positive maps having Lindblad structure. Generalizing the transposition map to a one parameter family we have used it to detect genuine multipartite entanglement. Finally being motivated by the negativity of entanglement, we have defined a similar measure for genuine multipartite entanglement.

TI Heating rate measurement and characterization of a prototype
   surface-electrode trap for optical frequency metrology
SO APPLIED PHYSICS B-LASERS AND OPTICS
AB We present the characterization of a prototype surface-electrode trap as a first step towards the realization of a compact, single-ion optical clock based on Yb+. The use of a SE trap will be a key factor to benefit from clean-room fabrication techniques and technological advances made in the field of quantum information processing. We successfully demonstrated trapping at a 500 mu m electrodes distance and characterized our trap in terms of lifetime and heating rate. This is to our knowledge the highest distance achieved for heating rates measurements in SE traps. This simple 5-wire design realized with simple materials yields a heating rate of 8 x 10(3) phonons/s. We provide an analysis of the performances of this prototype trap for optical frequency metrology.

TI Phase control of magnomechanically induced transparency in a closed-loop
   three-cavity array
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB In this paper, we propose a scheme to generate the phase control of magnomechanically induced transparency (MMIT) in a three-cavity system, into one cavity of which a yttrium iron garnet (YIG) sphere is placed. When two microwave cascade cavities are extended to a coupled three-cavity array, the single window MMIT is changed into a multi-window MMIT structure due to the existence of multiple quantum interference channels. Interestingly, when the three cavities are linked end-to-end forming a closed-loop structure, the phase control of MMIT is achievable, providing an additional degree to control MMIT. In addition, the phase-dependent slow light effects are also discussed briefly. The present system may find potential applications in solid-state quantum information processing.

TI Holographic boundary conformal field theory within Horndeski gravity
SO JOURNAL OF HIGH ENERGY PHYSICS
AB We investigate entanglement islands and the Page curve in the framework of Horndeski gravity on a Karch-Randall braneworld background. In particular, treating the holographic boundary conformal field theory analytically we find that the Horndeski parameters significantly alter the behavior of the Page curve compared to standard general relativity, a feature caused by the nontrivial geometry induced by the Horndeski scalar field. Interestingly enough, the geometry far from the AdS limit plays a more significant role compared to previous studies. This suggests that Horndeski gravity introduces important modifications to the distribution of quantum information in the holographic model. Finally, we claim that holographic consistency can be used reversely to impose constraints on Horndeski gravity itself, providing a new tool for probing the validity of modified gravity theories.

TI Observation of mechanical bound states in the continuum in an
   optomechanical microresonator
SO LIGHT-SCIENCE & APPLICATIONS
AB Bound states in the continuum (BICs) are a type of waves that are perfectly confined in the continuous spectrum of radiating waves without interaction with them. Here, we fabricated, with CMOS-compatible processes on a silicon chip, a wheel-shaped optomechanical microresonator, in which we experimentally observed the BIC in the micromechanical domain. The BIC results from destructive interference between two dissipative mechanical modes of the microresonator under broken azimuthal symmetry. Such BICs can be obtained from devices with large and robust supporting structures with variable sizes, which substantially reduces fabrication difficulty and allows for versatile application environments. Our results open a new way of phonon trapping in micromechanical structures with dissipation channels, and produce long phonon lifetimes that are desired in many mechanical applications such as mechanical oscillators, sensors, and quantum information processors.

TI Mechanical Squeezing via Pump Modulation in a Double-Cavity
   Optomechanical System With Optical Parametric Amplifier
SO ANNALEN DER PHYSIK
AB A novel and efficient method is proposed for generating mechanical squeezing in a double-cavity optomechanical system by introducing an optical parametric amplifier (OPA) with pump modulation (PM). The combined effects of periodic amplitude modulation of the driving laser and the OPA enable mechanical squeezing in both the resolved-sideband and unresolved-sideband regimes, with significantly enhanced squeezing observed in the resolved-sideband regime. The individual contributions of the OPA and PM to mechanical squeezing is systematically investigated, with results indicating that PM plays a more dominant role. Additionally, the proposed scheme demonstrates excellent robustness against environmental thermal noise. These findings highlight the potential of this approach for advancing quantum precision measurements and exploring macroscopic quantum phenomena.

TI Dual perfect vectorial vortex beam generation with a single

AB Perfect optical vortex beams (POVBs) carrying orbital angular momentum (OAM) possess annular intensity profiles that are independent of the topological charge. Unlike POVBs, perfect vectorial vortex beams (PVVBs) not only carry orbital angular momentum but also exhibit spin angular momentum (SAM). By incorporating a Dammann vortex grating (DVG) on an all-dielectric metasurface, we demonstrate an approach to create a pair of PVVBs on a hybrid -order Poincar & eacute; sphere. Benefiting flexible phase modulation, by engineering the DVG and changing the input-beam state we are able to freely tailor the topological OAM and polarization eigenstates of the output PVVBs. This work demonstrates a versatile flat-optics platform for high-quality PVVB generation and may pave the way for applications in optical communication and quantum information processing.

TI Entanglement wedge minimum cross-section for holographic aether gravity
SO JOURNAL OF HIGH ENERGY PHYSICS
AB We study the entanglement wedge cross-section (EWCS) in holographic Aether gravity theory, a gravity theory with Lorentz symmetry violation while keeping the general covariance intact. We find that only a limited parameter space is allowed to obtain a black brane with positive Hawking temperature. Subject to these allowed parameter regions, we find that the EWCS could exhibit non-monotonic behaviors with system parameters. Meanwhile, the holographic entanglement entropy (HEE), and the corresponding mutual information (MI), can only exhibit monotonic behaviors. These phenomena suggest that the EWCS could capture much more rich content of the entanglement than that of the HEE and the MI. The role of the Lorentz violation in determining the behaviors of quantum information-related quantities is also analyzed.

SO COMPUTER PHYSICS COMMUNICATIONS
AB Simulating quantum states on a classical computer is hard, typically requiring prohibitive resources in terms of memory and computational power. Efficient simulation, however, can be achieved for certain classes of quantum states, in particular the so-called Gaussian quantum states of continuous variable systems. In this work we introduce QuGIT -a python numerical toolbox based on symplectic methods specialized in efficiently simulating multimode Gaussian states and operations. QuGIT is exact, requiring no truncation of Hilbert space, and provides a wide range of Gaussian operations on arbitrary Gaussian states, including unitaries, partial traces, tensor products, general-dyne measurements, conditional and unconditional dynamics. To illustrate the toolbox, several examples of usage relevant to quantum optics and optomechanics are described. (C) 2022 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Standing-wave atom tweezer

By independently tuning the laser intensities of the two beams, we demonstrate the controlled loading of multiple atoms into the SWAT. We systematically investigate the influence of the standing-wave potential modulation depth on single-atom loading dynamics and quantitatively estimate the number of atoms in the SWAT by calculating the fluorescence of trapped atoms. Our results show that the SWAT can trap a chain of more than 20 atoms with significantly suppressed atom collisions, exhibiting a lifetime exceeding 1 second. Our work presents a versatile platform for investigating atom dynamics in 1D optical lattices, enabling the study of collective atom-photon interactions and many-body physics in a highly controllable system.

TI Infinite distances in multicritical CFTs and higher-spin holography
SO JOURNAL OF HIGH ENERGY PHYSICS
AB We investigate the swampland distance conjecture in higher-spin gravity. To this end, we study multicritical generalizations of large-N vector models, bosonic and fermionic, and we compute the quantum information distance along selected renormalization-group trajectories toward the higher-spin limit. In contrast to the expected exponential decay of higher-spin masses or anomalous dimensions, we find that infinite-distance limits in these models lead to a power-like decay. This suggests that stringy exponential decays are characteristic of matrix-like gauge theories, rather than vector models. We corroborate this notion studying the information distance along coupling variations in Chern-Simons-matter CFTs, where matrix-like degrees of freedom dominate over vector-like ones.

TI Quantumness and entropic uncertainty in curved space-time
SO EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL C
AB We explore the tripartite entropic uncertainty and genuine tripartite quantumness of Dirac fields in the background of the Garfinkle-Horowitz-Strominger (GHS) dilation space-time. It is interesting to note that Hawking radiation leads to the decay of quantum nonlocality in the physically accessible region while preserving its total coherence. More importantly, it demonstrates an intrinsic trade-off relationship between the coherences of physically accessible and inaccessible regions. Moreover, we examine the effect of Hawking radiation on entropy-based measured uncertainty and find that stronger Hawking radiation causes the uncertainty in physically accessible regions to increase while decreasing the uncertainty in physically inaccessible regions. Therefore, our investigations may be beneficial to a better understanding of the system's quantumness in a curved space-time. Combining relativity theory with quantum information science offers new avenues for comprehending the information paradoxes involving black holes.

TI Effective information bounds in modified quantum mechanics
SO EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL C
AB A common feature of collapse models and an expected signature of the quantization of gravity at energies well below the Planck scale is the deviation from ordinary quantum-mechanical behavior. Here, we analyze the general consequences of such modifications from the point of view of quantum information theory and we anticipate applications to different quantum systems. We show that quantum systems undergo corrections to the quantum speed limit which, in turn, imply the modification of the Heisenberg limit for parameter estimation. Our results hold for a wide class of scenarios beyond ordinary quantum mechanics. For some nonlocal models inspired by quantum gravity, the bounds are found to oscillate in time, an effect that could be tested in future high-precision quantum experiments.

TI Laser2: A two-domain photon-phonon laser
SO SCIENCE ADVANCES
AB The laser is one of the greatest inventions in history. Because of its ubiquitous applications and profound societal impact, the concept of the laser has been extended to other physical domains including phonon lasers and atom lasers. Quite often, a laser in one physical domain is pumped by energy in another. However, all lasers demonstrated so far have only lased in one physical domain. We have experimentally demonstrated simultaneous photon and phonon lasing in a two-mode silica fiber ring cavity via forward intermodal stimulated Brillouin scattering (SBS) mediated by long-lived flexural acoustic waves. This two-domain laser may find potential applications in optical/acoustic tweezers, optomechanical sensing, microwave generation, and quantum information processing. Furthermore, we believe that this demonstration will usher in other multidomain lasers and related applications.

TI Tensor Network Algorithms: A Route Map
SO ANNUAL REVIEW OF CONDENSED MATTER PHYSICS
AB Tensor networks provide extremely powerful tools for the study of complex classical and quantum many-body problems. Over the past two decades, the increment in the number of techniques and applications has been relentless, and especially the last ten years have seen an explosion of new ideas and results that may be overwhelming for the newcomer. This short review introduces the basic ideas, the best established methods, and some of the most significant algorithmic developments that are expanding the boundaries of the tensor network potential. The goal of this review is to help the reader not only appreciate the many possibilities offered by tensor networks but also find their way through state-of-the-art codes, their applicability, and some avenues of ongoing progress.

TI Entanglement and complexity of purification in (1+1)-dimensional free
   conformal field theories
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Finding pure states in an enlarged Hilbert space that encode the mixed state of a quantum field theory as a partial trace is necessarily a challenging task. Nevertheless, such purifications play the key role in characterizing quantum information-theoretic properties of mixed states via entanglement and complexity of purifications. In this article, we analyze these quantities for two intervals in the vacuum of free bosonic and Ising conformal field theories using the most general Gaussian purifications. We provide a comprehensive comparison with existing results and identify universal properties. We further discuss important subtleties in our setup: the massless limit of the free bosonic theory and the corresponding behavior of the mutual information, as well as the Hilbert space structure under the Jordan-Wigner mapping in the spin chain model of the Ising conformal field theory.

TI Contextual quantum metrology
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB We demonstrate that the contextuality of measurement selection can enhance the precision of quantum metrology with a simple linear optical experiment. Contextuality is a nonclassical property known as a resource for various quantum information processing tasks. Recent studies show that contextuality by anomalous weak values can be utilized to enhance metrological precision, unraveling the role of contextuality in quantum metrology. Our contextual quantum metrology (coQM) scheme can elevate the precision of the optical polarimetry as much as 6 times the precision limit given by the Quantum Fisher Information. We achieve the contextuality-enabled enhancement with two mutually complementary measurements, whereas, in the conventional method, some optimal measurements to achieve the precision limit are either theoretically challenging to find or experimentally infeasible to realize. These results highlight that the contextuality of measurement selection is applicable in practice for quantum metrology.

TI Experimental Realization of Self-Contained Quantum Refrigeration
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB A fundamental challenge in quantum thermodynamics is the exploration of inherent dimensional constraints in thermodynamic machines. In the context of two-level systems, the most compact refrigerator necessitates the involvement of three entities, operating under self-contained conditions that preclude the use of external work sources. Here, we build such a smallest refrigerator using a nuclear spin system, where three distinct two-level carbon-13 nuclei in the same molecule are involved to facilitate the refrigeration process. The self-contained feature enables it to operate without relying on net external work, and the unique mechanism sets this refrigerator apart from its classical counterparts. We evaluate its performance under varying conditions and systematically scrutinize the cooling constraints across a spectrum of scenarios, which sheds light on the interplay between quantum information and thermodynamics.

TI Bounds on positive operator-valued measure based coherence of
   superposition
SO CHINESE PHYSICS B
AB Quantum coherence is a fundamental feature of quantum physics and plays a significant role in quantum information processing. By generalizing the resource theory of coherence from von Neumann measurements to positive operator-valued measures (POVMs), POVM-based coherence measures have been proposed with respect to the relative entropy of coherence, the l (1) norm of coherence, the robustness of coherence and the Tsallis relative entropy of coherence. We derive analytically the lower and upper bounds on these POVM-based coherence of an arbitrary given superposed pure state in terms of the POVM-based coherence of the states in superposition. Our results can be used to estimate range of quantum coherence of superposed states. Detailed examples are presented to verify our analytical bounds.

TI Intertwiner entanglement excitation and holonomy operator
SO CLASSICAL AND QUANTUM GRAVITY
AB In the loop quantum gravity framework, spin network states carry entanglement between quantum excitations of the geometry at different space points. This intertwiner entanglement is gauge-invariant and comes from quantum superposition of spins and intertwiners. Bipartite entanglement can be interpreted as a witness of distance, while multipartite entanglement reflects the curvature of the quantum geometry. The present work investigates how the bipartite and multipartite intertwiner entanglement changes under the action of the holonomy operator, which is the basic building block of loop quantum gravity's dynamics. We reveal the relation between entanglement excitation and the dispersion of the holonomy operator. This leads to a new interesting connection between bulk geometry and boundary observables via the dynamics of entanglement.

SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Measuring the spectral properties of an optical frequency comb is among the most fundamental tasks of precision metrology. In contrast to general single-parameter measurement schemes, we demonstrate here single shot multi-parameter estimation of an optical frequency comb at and beyond the standard quantum limit. The mean energy and the central frequency as well as the spectral bandwidth of ultrafast pulses are simultaneously determined with a multi-pixel spectrally resolved (MPSR) apparatus, without changing the photonics architecture. Moreover, using a quantum frequency comb that intrinsically consists of multiple squeezed states in a family of Hermite-Gaussian spectral/temporal modes, the signal-to-noise ratios of the multiple spectral parameters estimation can surpass the standard quantum limit. Combining our multi-pixel detection scheme and the multimode entangled resource could find applications in ultrafast quantum metrology and multimode quantum information processing.

TI Stimulated Raman Adiabatic Passage in Optomechanics
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB In multimode optomechanical systems, the mechanical modes can be coupled via the radiation pressure of the common optical mode, but the fidelity of the state transfer is limited by the optical cavity decay. Here we demonstrate stimulated Raman adiabatic passage (STIRAP) in optomechanics, where the optical mode is not populated during the coherent state transfer between the mechanical modes avoiding this decay channel. We show a state transfer of a coherent mechanical excitation between vibrational modes of a membrane in a high-finesse optical cavity with a transfer efficiency of 86%. Combined with exceptionally high mechanical quality factors, STIRAP between mechanical modes can enable generation, storage, and manipulation of long-lived mechanical quantum states, which is important for quantum information science and for the investigation of macroscopic quantum superpositions.

TI Achieving large uniform tensile elasticity in microfabricated diamond
SO SCIENCE
AB Diamond is not only the hardest material in nature, but is also an extreme electronic material with an ultrawide bandgap, exceptional carrier mobilities, and thermal conductivity. Straining diamond can push such extreme figures of merit for device applications. We microfabricated single-crystalline diamond bridge structures with similar to 1 micrometer length by similar to 100 nanometer width and achieved sample-wide uniform elastic strains under uniaxial tensile loading along the [100], [101], and [111] directions at room temperature. We also demonstrated deep elastic straining of diamond microbridge arrays. The ultralarge, highly controllable elastic strains can fundamentally change the bulk band structures of diamond, including a substantial calculated bandgap reduction as much as similar to 2 electron volts. Our demonstration highlights the immense application potential of deep elastic strain engineering for photonics, electronics, and quantum information technologies.

SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB In this work, we develop a nonperturbative theory to identify a light pseudo-Goldstone mode with a small mass, as well as a type of Goldstone mode with a tiny slope (termed the slow-Goldstone mode), which may not be obtained via traditional perturbative methods. We demonstrate our formalism in the context of superfluids formed by Rashba spin-orbit coupled spinor bosons in a square lattice weakly interacting with a spin-anisotropic interaction. The experimental detections of these two modes, especially their roles leading to the quantum information scramblings at a finite temperature are discussed. The slow-Goldstone mode is compared with the slow light and the soft mode in the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev models. This nonperturbative formalism can be widely applied to study other emergent particles in various quantum matter.

SO OPTICA QUANTUM
AB Developing a quantum light source that carries more than one bit per photon is pivotal for expanding quantum information applications. Characterizing a high-dimensional multiple-degree-of-freedom source at the single-photon level is challenging due to the large parameter space as well as limited emission rates and detection efficiencies. Here, we characterize photon pairs generated in optical fiber in the transverse-mode and frequency degrees of freedom by applying stimulated emission in both degrees of freedom while detecting in one of them at a time. This method may be useful in the quantum state estimation and optimization of various photon-pair source platforms in which complicated correlations across multiple degrees of freedom may be present.

SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS B-ATOMIC MOLECULAR AND OPTICAL PHYSICS
AB We propose a method to generate the frequency entanglement, allowing a continuous generation of entangled two-photon states in a hybrid degree of freedom by post-manipulation. Our method is based on type-II spontaneous parametric down-conversion in a nonlinear crystal and the rotation Doppler effect by rotating the q-plates, without preset discrete frequency entanglement. This allows the arbitrary modification of frequency entangled photons in a wide frequency range at room temperature, offering enhanced flexibility for quantum information tasks and quantum metrology. We also analyze the entanglement state by a combined calculation for the joint spectrum and Hong-Ou-Mandel interference of the two photons, which can be used to reconstruct a restricted density matrix in the frequency space.

However, the calibration and characterization of interconnected quantum dot arrays have proven to be challenging tasks. One method to characterize the configuration of such an array involves using the Hubbard model. In this paper, we present an efficient characterization algorithm that efficiently extracts the Hubbard model parameters, including tunnel coupling and capacitive coupling energy, from experimental stability diagrams. Leveraging the dual-annealing optimizer, we determine the set of Hubbard parameters that best characterize the experimental data. We compare our method with an alternate, well-established measure of tunnel coupling and find good agreement within the investigated regime. Our extracted tunnel couplings range from 69 to 517 mu eV, and we discuss the limiting factors of our method.

TI Generation of Higher-Order Hermite-Gaussian Modes via Cascaded
   Phase-Only Spatial Light Modulators
SO MATHEMATICS
AB The spatial distribution of higher-order Hermite-Gaussian (HG) modes is more complicated than the fundamental mode, and the characteristics of different modes and their orthogonal characteristics have essential applications in the fields of measurement, imaging, and large-capacity communications. The main issue in future applications is how to efficiently generate higher-order HG modes. The spatial light modulator has high spatial resolution and excellent maneuverability, so it is a simple and effective way to generate higher-order HG modes. Here, the efficient generation of higher-order HG modes via cascaded spatial light modulators was experimentally investigated. For the HG90 mode, the conversion efficiency is 61%. The method with high conversion efficiency has promising application potentials in biophotonics, laser physics, and quantum information.

TI Stochastic inflation and entropy bound in de Sitter spacetime
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
AB We investigate the entropy dynamics of de Sitter spacetime during the inflationary phase. The cosmological horizon in de Sitter spacetime, which limits the causally accessible region for an observer, exhibits thermal properties similar to a black hole event horizon. According to holographic principles, the entropy within a causally connected region is bounded by its surface area. However, this entropy bound is violated during the eternal phase of inflation. To address these violations from a quantum information perspective, we adopt a stochastic approach to cosmic inflation. Specifically, we analyze the Shannon entropy of the inflaton field's probability distribution, which mirrors the behavior of the entanglement entropy of a Hubble-sized region in stochastic inflation. Using the volume-weighted probability distribution for the inflaton field, we demonstrate a significant entropy behavior in de Sitter spacetime.

TI Phase estimation of a Mach-Zehnder interferometer via the Laguerre
   excitation squeezed state
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Quantum metrology has an important role in the fields of quantum optics and quantum information processing. Here we introduce a kind of non-Gaussian state, Laguerre excitation squeezed state as inputs of traditional Mach-Zehnder interferometer to examine phase estimation in realistic case. We consider the effects of both internal and external losses on phase estimation by using quantum Fisher information and parity detection. It is shown that the external loss presents a bigger effect than the internal one. The phase sensitivity and the quantum Fisher information can be improved by increasing the photon number and even surpass the ideal phase sensitivity by two-mode squeezed vacuum in a certain region of phase shift for realistic case. Our results can find significant practical applications in quantum metrology.

TI Classical-to-quantum transition in multimode nonlinear systems with
   strong photon-photon coupling
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB With advanced micro- and nanophotonic structures, the vacuum photon-photon coupling rate is anticipated to approach the intrinsic loss rate and lead to unconventional quantum effects. Here, we investigate the classicalto-quantum transition of such photonic nonlinear systems using the quantum cluster-expansion method, which addresses the computational challenge in tracking large photon number states of the fundamental and harmonic optical fields involved in the second-harmonic generation process. Compared to the mean-field approximation used in the weak-coupling limit, the quantum cluster-expansion method solves multimode dynamics efficiently and reveals the quantum behaviors of optical parametric oscillations around the threshold. This paper presents a universal tool to study quantum dynamics of multimode systems and explore the nonlinear photonic devices for continuous-variable quantum information processing.

TI The decompositions of Werner and isotropic states
SO QUANTUM INFORMATION PROCESSING
AB The decompositions of separable Werner states and isotropic states are well-known tough issues in quantum information theory. In this work, we investigate them in the Bloch vector representation, exploring the symmetric informationally complete positive operator-valued measure (SIC-POVM) in the Hilbert space. In terms of regular simplexes, we successfully get the decomposition for arbitrary Werner state in C-N circle times C-N, and the explicit separable decompositions are constructed based on the SIC-POVM. Meanwhile, the decomposition of isotropic states is found related to the decomposition of Werner states via partial transposition. It is interesting to note that when dimension N approaches to infinity, the Werner states are either separable or non-steerably entangled, and most of the isotropic states tend to be steerable.

TI Angular topological superfluid and topological vortex in an ultracold
   Fermi gas
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB We show that pairing in an ultracold Fermi gas under spin-orbital-angular-momentum coupling (SOAMC) can acquire topological characters encoded in the quantized angular degrees of freedom. The resulting topological superfluid is the angular analog of its counterpart in a one-dimensional Fermi gas with spin-orbit coupling, but characterized by a Zak phase defined in the angular-momentum space. Upon tuning the SOAMC parameters, a topological phase transition occurs, which is accompanied by the closing of the quasiparticle excitation gap. Remarkably, a topological vortex state can also be stabilized by deforming the Fermi surface, which is topologically nontrivial in both the coordinate and angular-momentum space, offering interesting potentials for applications in quantum information and quantum control. We discuss how the topological phase transition and the exotic vortex state can be detected experimentally.

TI Non-Gaussian nature and entanglement of spontaneous parametric
   nondegenerate triple-photon generation
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We theoretically demonstrate through numerical methods that the triple-photon state generated by threephoton spontaneous parametric down-conversion is a non-Gaussian Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger state, showing super-Gaussian statistics. Interestingly, the degree of entanglement between the modes of the triple-photon state is stronger than that corresponding to the two-mode squeezed vacuum state produced by a quadratic Hamiltonian with the same parameters. Furthermore, we propose a model to prepare two-mode sub-Gaussian entangled states with a tunable negative Wigner function based on quadrature projection measurements. We find that these Gaussian projection measurements with outcomes X >= 1 not only improve the entanglement of the residual two modes but also introduce a Gaussian component, resulting in the coexistence of Gaussian and non-Gaussian entanglement.

TI Bound on the distance between controlled quantum state and target state
   under decoherence
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS COMMUNICATIONS
AB To implement quantum information technologies, carefully designed control for preparing a desired state plays a key role. However, in realistic situation, the actual performance of those methodologies is severely limited by decoherence. Therefore, it is important to evaluate how close we can steer the controlled state to a desired target state under decoherence. In this paper, we provide an upper bound of the distance between the two controlled quantum systems in the presence and absence of decoherence. The bound quantifies the degree of achievement of the control for a given target state under decoherence, and can be straightforwardly calculated without solving any equation. Moreover, the upper bound is applied to derive a theoretical limit of the probability for obtaining the target state under decoherence.

TI Geometric phase with full-wedge and half-wedge rotation in nonlinear
   frequency conversion
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB When the quasi-phase matching (QPM) parameters of the.(2) nonlinear crystal rotate along a closed path, geometric phase will be generated in the signal and idler waves that participate in the nonlinear frequency conversion. In this paper, we study two rotation schemes, full-wedge rotation and half-wedge rotation, of the QPM parameters in the process of fully nonlinear three-wave mixing. These two schemes can effectively suppress the uncertainty in creating the geometric phase in the nonlinear frequency conversion process when the intensity of the pump is depleted. The finding of this paper provides an avenue toward constant control of the geometric phase in nonlinear optics applications and quantum information processing.

TI Quantifying quantum coherence and the deviation from the total
   probability formula
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB We propose a novel approach to quantify quantum coherence which, contrary to the previous ones, does not rely on resource theory but rather on ontological considerations. In this framework, coherence is understood as the ability of a quantum system's statistics to deviate from the total probability formula. After motivating the importance of the total probability formula in quantum foundations, we propose a new set of axioms that a measure of coherence should satisfy, and show that it defines a class of measures different from the main previous proposal. Finally, we prove a general result about the dependence of the l(2)-coherence norm on the basis of interest, and show that it is well approximated by the square root of the purity in most bases.

TI Chaos generation of superconducting quantum bits coupled with LC
   resonant circuits
SO PHYSICA SCRIPTA
AB The dynamics of chaos have been widely used in nonlinear science, such as neural networks, extreme event statistics, and the biophysics of chaos self-organization. Superconducting qubits are artificial atoms based on the Josephson junction structure of nonlinear superconducting devices, offering high design flexibility and ease of coupling and control. In this paper, the generation of chaos through the coupling between superconducting qubits and LC resonant circuits is investigated. By varying the ratio of Josephson energy to charge energy, the coupling coefficient, and the energy of the external driving field, the generation and control of chaos within the system are numerically analyzed. This study provides theoretical support for parameter selection ensuring the confidentiality and fidelity of quantum information transmission based on the chaotic dynamics of superconducting qubits.

TI Maximum Geometric Quantum Entropy
SO ENTROPY
AB Any given density matrix can be represented as an infinite number of ensembles of pure states. This leads to the natural question of how to uniquely select one out of the many, apparently equally-suitable, possibilities. Following Jaynes' information-theoretic perspective, this can be framed as an inference problem. We propose the Maximum Geometric Quantum Entropy Principle to exploit the notions of Quantum Information Dimension and Geometric Quantum Entropy. These allow us to quantify the entropy of fully arbitrary ensembles and select the one that maximizes it. After formulating the principle mathematically, we give the analytical solution to the maximization problem in a number of cases and discuss the physical mechanism behind the emergence of such maximum entropy ensembles.

TI Steady state in strong system-bath coupling regime: Reaction coordinate
   versus perturbative expansion
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW E
AB Motivated by the growing importance of strong system-bath coupling in several branches of quantum information and related technological applications, we analyze and compare two strategies currently used to obtain (approximately) steady states in strong-coupling regime. The first strategy is based on perturbative expansions while the second one uses reaction coordinate mapping. Focusing on the widely used spin-boson model, we show that the predictions of these two strategies coincide in many situations. This confirms and strengthens the relevance of both techniques. Beyond that, it is also crucial to know precisely their respective range of validity. In that perspective, thanks to their different limitations, we use one to benchmark the other. We introduce and successfully test some very simple validity criteria for both strategies, bringing some answers to the question of the validity range.

TI Radical Spin Polarization and Magnetosensitivity from Reversible Energy
   Transfer
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY LETTERS
AB Molecular spins provide potential building units for future quantum information science and spintronic technologies. In particular, doublet (S = (1)/(2)) and triplet (S = 1) molecular spin states have the potential for excellent optical and spin properties for these applications if useful photon-spin mechanisms at room temperature can be devised. Here we explore the potential of exploiting reversible energy transfer between triplet and doublet states to establish magnetosensitive luminescence and spin polarization. We investigate the dependence of the photon-spin mechanism on the magnitude and sign of the exchange interaction between the doublet and triplet spin components in amorphous and crystalline model systems. The design of a magnetic field inclination sensor is proposed from understanding the required "structure" (spin interactions) to "function" (magnetosensitivity).

TI Quadrature protection of squeezed states in a one dimensional photonic
   topological insulator
SO QUANTUM
AB What is the role of topology in the propagation of quantum light in photonic lattices? We address this question by studying the propagation of squeezed states in a topological one-dimensional waveguide array, benchmarking our results with those for a topologically trivial localized state, and studying their robustness against disorder. Specifically, we study photon statistics, one-mode and two-mode squeezing, and entanglement generation when the localized state is excited with squeezed light. These quantum properties inherit the shape of the localized state but, more interestingly, and unlike in the topologically trivial case, we find that propagation of squeezed light in a topologically protected state robustly preserves the phase of the squeezed quadrature as the system evolves. We show how this latter topological advantage can be harnessed for quantum information protocols.

TI Gaussian state-based quantum illumination with simple photodetection
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Proofs of the quantum advantage available in imaging or detecting objects under quantum illumination can rely on optimal measurements without specifying what they are. We use the continuous-variable Gaussian quantum information formalism to show that quantum illumination is better for object detection compared with coherent states of the same mean photon number, even for simple direct photodetection. The advantage persists if signal energy and object reflectivity are low and background thermal noise is high. The advantage is even greater if we match signal beam detection probabilities rather than mean photon number. We perform all calculations with thermal states, even for non-Gaussian conditioned states with negative Wigner functions. We simulate repeated detection using a Monte-Carlo process that clearly shows the advantages obtainable.

TI Quantum autoencoders using mixed reference states
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB One of the fundamental tasks in quantum information theory is quantum data compression, which can be realized via quantum autoencoders that first compress quantum states to low-dimensional ones and then recover to the original ones with a reference state. When taking a pure reference state, there exists an upper bound for the encoding fidelity, which limits the compression of states with high entropy. To overcome the entropy inconsistency, we allow the reference state to be a mixed state and propose a cost function that combines the encoding fidelity and the quantum mutual information. We consider the reference states to be a mixture of maximally mixed states and pure states and propose three strategies for setting the ratio of mixedness. Numerical simulations of different states and experimental implementations on IBM quantum computers illustrate the effectiveness of our approach.

TI Acceleration and deceleration of quantum dynamics based on
   inter-trajectory travel with fast-forward scaling theory
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Quantum information processing requires fast manipulations of quantum systems in order to overcome dissipative effects. We propose a method to accelerate quantum dynamics and obtain a target state in a shorter time relative to unmodified dynamics, and apply the theory to a system consisting of two linearly coupled qubits. We extend the technique to accelerate quantum adiabatic evolution in order to rapidly generate a desired target state, thereby realizing a shortcut to adiabaticity. Further, we address experimental limitations to the rate of change of control parameters for quantum devices which often limit one's ability to generate a desired target state with high fidelity. We show that an initial state following decelerated dynamics can reach a target state while varying control parameters more slowly, enabling more experimentally feasible driving schemes.

TI Quantum Zeno effect and quantum nondemolition spin measurement in a
   quantum dot-micropillar cavity in the strong coupling regime
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB We theoretically describe the quantum Zeno effect in a spin-photon interface represented by a charged quantum dot in a micropillar cavity in the strong coupling regime. This simplest model allows for various generalizations for the different systems. We derive a simple expression for the spin measurement rate, which allows one to tune the electron spin precession frequency in an external magnetic field and spin relaxation time. We calculate the spin noise bispectrum, which reveals the qualitative change of the spin dynamics with an increase of the measurement strength and proves the quantum nature of the spin noise. We also calculate the quantum information gain rate and find the conditions when it equals the spin dephasing rate, i.e., reaches the quantum limit.

TI Direct measurement of nonlocal quantum states without approximation
SO CHINESE PHYSICS B
AB Efficient acquiring information from a quantum state is important for research in fundamental quantum physics and quantum information applications. Instead of using standard quantum state tomography method with reconstruction algorithm, weak values were proposed to directly measure density matrix elements of quantum state. Recently, similar to the concept of weak value, modular values were introduced to extend the direct measurement scheme to nonlocal quantum wavefunction. However, this method still involves approximations, which leads to inherent low precision. Here, we propose a new scheme which enables direct measurement for ideal value of the nonlocal density matrix element without taking approximations. Our scheme allows more accurate characterization of nonlocal quantum states, and therefore has greater advantages in practical measurement scenarios.

TI Engineering quantum dots for improved single photon emission statistics
SO JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS
AB High fidelity single photon sources are required for the implementation of quantum information processing and communications protocols. Although colloidal quantum dots (CQDs) are single photon sources, their efficacy is limited by their tendency to show finite multiphoton emission at higher excitation powers. Here, we show that wave function engineering of CQDs enables the realization of emitters with significantly improved single photon emission performance. We study the ZnS/CdSe/CdS system. It is shown that this system offers significantly improved probabilities of single photon emission. While conventional CQDs such as CdSe/CdS exhibit a g(2)(0) > 0.5 +/- 0.02 at < N > = 2.17, ZnS/CdSe/CdS show a greatly improved g(2)(0) approximate to 0.04 +/- 0.01. Improved single photon emission performance encourages the use of colloidal materials as quantum light sources in emerging quantum devices.

TI Classical analogs of generalized purities, entropies, and logarithmic
   negativity
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB It has recently been proposed classical analogs of the purity, linear quantum entropy, and von Neumann entropy for classical integrable systems, when the corresponding quantum system is in a Gaussian state. We generalized these results by providing classical analogs of the generalized purities, Bastiaans-Tsallis entropies, Renyi entropies, and logarithmic negativity for classical integrable systems. These classical analogs are entirely characterized by the classical covariance matrix. We compute these classical analogs exactly in the cases of linearly coupled harmonic oscillators, a generalized harmonic oscillator chain, and a one-dimensional circular lattice of oscillators. In all of these systems, the classical analogs reproduce the results of their quantum counterparts whenever the system is in a Gaussian state. In this context, our results show that quantum information of Gaussian states can be reproduced by classical information.

TI Active learning for the optimal design of multinomial classification in
   physics
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Optimal design for model training is a critical topic in machine learning. Active learning aims at obtaining improved models by querying samples with maximum uncertainty according to the estimation model for artificially labeling; this has the additional advantage of achieving successful performances with a reduced number of labeled samples. We analyze its capability as an assistant for the design of experiments, extracting maximum information for learning with the minimal cost in fidelity loss, or reducing total operation costs of labeling in the laboratory. We present two typical applications as quantum information retrieval in qutrits and phase boundary prediction in many-body physics. For an equivalent multinomial classification problem, we achieve the correct rate of 99% with less than 2% of samples labeled. We reckon that active-learning-inspired physics experiments will remarkably save budget without loss of accuracy.

TI Bound and subradiant multiatom excitations in an atomic array with
   nonreciprocal couplings
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Collective decays of multiply excited atoms become subradiant and bound in space when they are strongly coupled to the guided modes in an atom-waveguide interface. In this interface, we analyze their average density-density and modified third-order correlations via Kubo cumulant expansions, which can arise, and finite correlations can be sustained for long time. The shape-preserving dimers and trimers of atomic excitations emerge in the most subradiant coupling regime of light-induced dipole-dipole interactions. This leads to a potential application of quantum information processing and quantum storage in the encoded nonreciprocal spin diffusion, where its diffusion speed depends on the initial coherence between the excited atoms and is robust to their relative phase fluctuations. The state-dependent photon routing can be viable as well in this interface.

   crystals
SO JOURNAL OF LUMINESCENCE
AB We report the optical study of europium nitrate hexahydrate crystals Eu(NO3)3. 6H2O and their deuterated version Eu(NO3)3. 6D2O conducted at 50 mK. The crystals show sub-GHz inhomogeneous linewidths for the 7F0 <-> 5 D0 transition and optical coherence times up to 136 mu s for the non-deuterated crystal and 750 mu s for the deuterated one. In addition, using the spectral hole burning technique, the hyperfine splittings in the absence of an external field have been estimated for the ground and optical levels. These results suggest that rare-earth nitrate crystals could represent a promising class of materials for quantum information applications as well as for fundamental physics experiments requiring narrow optical transitions and good coherence properties.

TI Vortex radiation from a single emitter in a chiral plasmonic nanocavity
SO NANOPHOTONICS
AB Manipulating single emitter radiation is essential for quantum information science. Significant progress has been made in enhancing the radiation efficiency and directivity by coupling quantum emitters with microcavities and plasmonic antennas. However, there has been a great challenge to generate complex radiation patterns such as vortex beam from a single emitter. Here, we report a chiral plasmonic nanocavity, which provides a strong local chiral vacuum field at an exceptional point. We show that a single linear dipole emitter embedded in the nanocavity will radiate to vortex beam via anomalous spontaneous emission with a Purcell enhancement factor up to similar to 1000. Our scheme provides a new field manipulation method for chiral quantum optics and vortex lasers at the nanoscale.

TI Signatures of causality and determinism in a quantum theory of events
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB By representing an event as the joint state of a detector-timer couple that interacts with a system, we recover the familiar tensor product structure, used to describe spatially separated systems, in the context of timelike events. Furthermore, with this approach, we extend the superposition principle to the moment of occurrence of events. We then outline quantum signatures of causality that manifest through coherence in the detector state and correlation functions of time operators. Finally, we expand the scope of quantum information theoretic measures of state discrimination and information content, commonly used to characterize spatially separated systems, to events in spacetime. For causally connected events, we illustrate a deterministic relationship between events (akin to spatially entangled physical systems) where observing a previous event (one subsystem) enables us to delineate a later event (the other subsystem).

TI Replacing the Notion of Spacetime Distance by the Notion of Correlation
SO FRONTIERS IN PHYSICS
AB Spacetime is conventionally viewed as a stage on which actors, in the form of massive and massless matter, move. In this study, we explore what may lie beyond this picture. The starting point is the observation that quantum field fluctuations are the more strongly correlated the shorter their spacetime distance. The notion of spacetime distance can, therefore, be replaced by the notion of correlation strength. This suggests a new picture in which the abstract 2-point and multi-point correlations are the primary structure, a picture which is essentially information-theoretic. In the low energy regime, the secondary notions of spacetime and of matter would then emerge as approximate representations of the abstract correlators, namely, in the form of Feynman rules on curved spacetime.

AB Chaos plays a pivotal role in neural networks, extreme-event statistics, and quantum information scrambling. As a nonlinear system, an LC circuit offers high design flexibility and ease of coupling and control. Here we consider a hybrid optoelectromechanical system integrating an LC circuit, optical cavity, and mechanical resonators to engineer controllable photon chaos. We demonstrate deterministic control over chaotic photon dynamics through semiclassical simulations. By tuning key parameters, such as the LC-mode frequency, driving amplitude and optoelectromechanical coupling rates, we achieve precise regulation of chaotic lifetime and intensity. These findings prompt the development of large-scale integrated chaotic photon sources and provide a robust framework for secure communications.

The study of functional equations with a sufficient number of variables can be helpful in solving real-world problems such as artificial intelligence. In this paper, we build on previous research on functional equations with four variables to study functional equations with as many variables as desired. We introduce new bounds for the stability of mappings satisfying generalized bi-additive conditions and demonstrate the uniqueness of approximating bi-isomorphisms. The results contribute to the deeper understanding of ternary algebraic structures and related functional equations, relevant to both pure mathematics and quantum information science.

SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB The resonant excitation of electronic transitions with coherent laser sources creates quantum coherent superpositions of the involved electronic states. Most time-resolved studies have focused on gases or isolated subsystems embedded in insulating solids, aiming for applications in quantum information. Here, we focus on the coherent control of orbital wavefunctions in the correlated quantum material Tb2Ti2O7, which forms an interacting spin liquid ground state. We show that resonant excitation with a strong THz pulse creates a coherent superposition of the lowest energy Tb 4f states. The coherence manifests itself as a macroscopic oscillating magnetic dipole, which is detected by ultrafast resonant x-ray diffraction. We envision the coherent control of orbital wavefunctions demonstrated here to become a new tool for the ultrafast manipulation and investigation of quantum materials.

TI Polytope compatibility-From quantum measurements to magic squares
SO JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL PHYSICS
AB Several central problems in quantum information theory (such as measurement compatibility and quantum steering) can be rephrased as membership in the minimal matrix convex set corresponding to special polytopes (such as the hypercube or its dual). In this article, we generalize this idea and introduce the notion of polytope compatibility, by considering arbitrary polytopes. We find that semiclassical magic squares correspond to Birkhoff polytope compatibility. In general, we prove that polytope compatibility is in one-to-one correspondence with measurement compatibility, when the measurements have some elements in common and the post-processing of the joint measurement is restricted. Finally, we consider how much tuples of operators with appropriate joint numerical range have to be scaled in the worst case in order to become polytope compatible and give both analytical sufficient conditions and numerical ones based on linear programming.

   Propagation and precursors

   AMERICA
AB The propagation of spin waves in magnetically ordered systems has emerged as a potential means to shuttle quantum information over large distances. Conventionally, the arrival time of a spin wavepacket at a distance, d , is assumed to be determined by its group velocity, v g . Here, we report time -resolved optical measurements of wavepacket propagation in the Kagome ferromagnet Fe 3 Sn 2 that demonstrate the arrival of spin information at times significantly less than d/v g . We show that this spin wave "precursor" originates from the interaction of light with the unusual spectrum of magnetostatic modes in Fe 3 Sn 2 . Related effects may have far-reaching consequences toward realizing long-range, ultrafast spin wave transport in both ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic systems.

TI Nonequilibrium Dark Space Phase Transition
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB We introduce the concept of dark space phase transition, which may occur in open many-body quantum systems where irreversible decay, interactions, and quantum interference compete. Our study is based on a quantum many-body model that is inspired by classical nonequilibrium processes which feature phase transitions into an absorbing state, such as epidemic spreading. The possibility for different dynamical paths to interfere quantum mechanically results in collective dynamical behavior without classical counterpart. We identify two competing dark states, a trivial one corresponding to a classical absorbing state and an emergent one which is quantum coherent. We establish a nonequilibrium phase transition within this dark space that features a phenomenology which cannot be encountered in classical systems. Such emergent two-dimensional dark space may find technological applications, e.g., for the collective encoding of a quantum information.

TI Optical detection of paramagnetic defects in diamond grown by chemical
   vapor deposition
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB The electronic spins of the nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in chemical-vapor-deposition (CVD) grown diamonds form ideal probes of magnetic fields and temperature, as well as promising qubits for quantum information processing. Studying and controlling the magnetic environment of NV centers in such high-purity crystals is thus essential for these applications. We demonstrate optical detection of paramagnetic species, such as hydrogen-related complexes, in a CVD-grown diamond. The resonant transfer of the NV centers' polarized electronic spins to the electronic spins of these species generates conspicuous features in the NV photoluminescence when employing magnetic field scans along the [100] crystal direction. Our results offer prospects for more detailed studies of CVD-grown processes as well as for coherent control of the spin of novel classes of hyperpolarized paramagnetic species.

TI A path integral formulation for particle detectors: the Unruh-DeWitt
   model as a line defect
SO JOURNAL OF HIGH ENERGY PHYSICS
AB Particle detectors are an ubiquitous tool for probing quantum fields in the context of relativistic quantum information (RQI). We formulate the Unruh-DeWitt (UDW) particle detector model in terms of the path integral formalism. The formulation is able to recover the results of the model in general globally hyperbolic spacetimes and for arbitrary detector trajectories. Integrating out the detector's degrees of freedom yields a line defect that allows one to express the transition probability in terms of Feynman diagrams. Inspired by the light-matter interaction, we propose a gauge invariant detector model whose associated line defect is related to the derivative of a Wilson line. This is another instance where nonlocal operators in gauge theories can be interpreted as physical probes for quantum fields.

TI Entanglement-Enhanced Quantum Ranging in Near-Earth Spacetime
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB A quantum ranging protocol to determine the distance between an observer and a target in the near-Earth curved spacetime is proposed. Unlike quantum illumination, the quantum ranging scheme utilizes multiple quantum hypothesis testing to simultaneously determine the presence and location of the target. The interest is in how the Earth's spacetime curvature influences photon propagation as well as the performance of the quantum ranging. It is found that the maximum potential advantage of the quantum ranging strategy in the curved spacetime outperforms its flat spacetime counterpart. It is shown that the number of transmitted modes can enhance the maximum potential advantage of the quantum ranging tasks. In contrast, the maximum potential advantage of quantum ranging cannot be significantly increased by dividing the range into multiple slices in the curved spacetime.

TI Programmable time-multiplexed squeezed light source
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB One of the leading approaches to large-scale quantum information processing (QIP) is the continuous-variable (CV) scheme based on time multiplexing (TM). As a fundamental building block for this approach, quantum light sources to sequentially produce time-multiplexed squeezed-light pulses are required; however, conventional CV TM experiments have used fixed light sources that can only output the squeezed pulses with the same squeezing levels and phases. We here demonstrate a programmable time-multiplexed squeezed light source that can generate sequential squeezed pulses with various squeezing levels and phases at a time interval below 100 ns. The generation pattern can be arbitrarily chosen by software without changing its hardware configuration. This is enabled by using a waveguide optical parametric amplifier and modulating its continuous pump light. Our light source will implement various large-scale CV QIP tasks.

TI Experimental certification of nonprojective quantum measurements under a
   minimum overlap assumption
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Certifying quantum measurements is increasingly important for foundational insights in quantum information science. Here, we report an experimental certification of unknown quantum measurements in a semi-device-independent setting. For the first time, we experimentally demonstrate that genuine three-outcome positive operator-valued measures (POVMs) can be certified under the assumption of a limited overlap between the prepared quantum states. The generalized quantum measurements are realized through discrete-time quantum walk and our experimental results clearly show that three-outcome POVMs can be certified even in the presence of noise. Finally, we experimentally investigate that optimal POVMs for performing unambiguous state discrimination can be self-tested. Our work opens new avenues for robust certification of quantum systems in the prepare-and-measure scenario.(c) 2022 Optica Publishing Group under the terms of the Optica Open Access Publishing Agreement

TI Dark exciton preparation in a quantum dot by a longitudinal light field
   tuned to higher exciton states
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Several important proposals to use semiconductor quantum dots in quantum information technology rely on the control of the dark exciton ground states, such as dark exciton based qubits with a microsecond lifetime. In this paper, we present an efficient way to occupy the dark exciton ground state by a single short laser pulse. The scheme is based on an optical excitation with a longitudinal field component featured by, e.g., radially polarized beams or certain Laguerre-Gauss or Bessel beams. Utilizing this component, we show within a configuration interaction approach that high-energy exciton states composed of light-hole excitons and higher dark heavy-hole excitons can be addressed. When the higher exciton relaxes, a dark exciton in its ground state is created.

TI Steady-state Peierls transition in nanotube quantum simulator
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Quantum dots placed along a vibrating nanotube provide a quantum simulation platform that can directly address the electron-phonon interaction. This offers promising prospects for the search of new quantum materials and the study of strong correlation effects. As this platform is naturally operated by coupling the dots to an electronic reservoir, state preparation is straightforwardly achieved by driving into the steady state. Here we show that for intermediate electron-phonon coupling strength, the system with spin-polarized quantum dots undergoes a Peierls transition into an insulating regime which exhibits charge-density wave order in the steady state as a consequence of the competition between electronic Coulomb repulsive interactions and phonon-induced attractive interactions. The transport phenomena can be directly observed as fingerprints of electronic correlations. We also present powerful methods to numerically capture the physics of such an open electron-phonon system at large numbers of phonons. Our work paves the way to study and detect correlated electron-phonon physics in the nanotube quantum simulator with current experimentally accessible techniques.

TI A Multicenter Analysis of Nucleic Acid Quantification Using Aqueous
   Humor Liquid Biopsy in Retinoblastoma Implications for Clinical Testing
SO OPHTHALMOLOGY SCIENCE
AB Purpose: Retinoblastoma (RB) is most often diagnosed with clinical features and not diagnosed with tumor biopsy. This study describes tumor-derived analyte concentrations from aqueous humor (AH) liquid biopsy and its use in clinical assays. Participants: Sixty-two RB eyes from 55 children and 14 control eyes from 12 children from 4 medical centers. Methods: This study included 128 RB AH samples including: diagnostic (DX) samples, samples from eyes undergoing treatment (TX), samples after completing treatment (END), and during bevacizumab injection for radiation therapy after completing RB treatment (BEV). Fourteen-control AH were analyzed for unprocessed analytes (double-stranded DNA [dsDNA], single-stranded DNA [ssDNA], micro-RNA [miRNA], RNA, and protein) with Qubit fluorescence assays. Double-stranded DNA from 2 RB AH samples underwent low-pass whole-genome sequencing to detect somatic copy number alterations. Logistic regression was used to predict disease burden given analyte concentrations. Main Outcome Measures: Unprocessed analyte (dsDNA, ssDNA, miRNA, RNA and protein) concentrations. Results: Results revealed dsDNA, ssDNA, miRNA, and proteins, but not RNA, were quantifiable in most samples (up to 98%) with Qubit fluorescence assays. Median dsDNA concentration was significantly higher in DX (3.08 ng/ml) compared to TX (0.18 ng/ml; P < 0.0001) at an order of 17 times greater and 20 times greater than END samples (0.15 ng/ml; P 1/4 0.001). Using logistic regression, nucleic acid concentrations were useful in predicting higher versus lower RB disease burden. Retinoblastoma somatic copy number alterations were identified in a TX, but not in a BEV sample, indicating the correlation with RB activity. Conclusions: Aqueous humor liquid biopsy in RB is a high-yield source of dsDNA, ssDNA, miRNA, and protein. Diagnostic samples are most useful for RB 1 gene mutational analyses. Genomic analysis may be more informative of tumor activity status than quantification alone and can be performed even with smaller analyte concentrations obtained from TX samples.

TI A scanning resonator for probing quantum coherent devices
SO REVIEW OF SCIENTIFIC INSTRUMENTS
AB Superconducting resonators with high quality factors are extremely sensitive detectors of the complex impedance of materials and devices coupled to them. This capability has been used to measure losses in multiple different materials and, in the case of circuit quantum electrodynamics (circuit QED), has been used to measure the coherent evolution of multiple different types of qubits. Here, we report on the implementation of a scanning resonator for probing quantum coherent devices. Our scanning setup enables tunable coherent coupling to systems of interest without the need for fabricating on-chip superconducting resonators. We measure the internal quality factor of our resonator sensor in the single-photon regime to be >10(4) and demonstrate capacitive imaging using our sensor with zeptoFarad sensitivity and micron spatial resolution at milliKelvin temperatures. We then use our setup to characterize the energy spectrum and coherence times of multiple transmon qubits with no on-chip readout circuitry. Our experiments introduce a new tool for using circuit QED to measure existing and proposed qubit platforms.

TI Autonomous Stabilization of Floquet States Using Static Dissipation
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW X
AB Floquet engineering, in which the properties of a quantum system are modified through the application of strong periodic drives, is an indispensable tool in atomic and condensed matter systems. However, it is inevitably limited by intrinsic heating processes. We describe a simple autonomous scheme, which exploits a static coupling between the driven system and a lossy auxiliary, to cool large classes of Floquet systems into desired states. We present experimental and theoretical evidence for the stabilization of a chosen quasienergy state in a strongly modulated transmon qubit coupled to an auxiliary microwave cavity with fixed frequency and photon loss. The scheme naturally extends to Floquet systems with multiple degrees of freedom. As an example, we demonstrate the stabilization of topological photon pumping in a driven cavity-QED system numerically. The coupling to the auxiliary cavity increases the average photon current and the fidelity of nonclassical states, such as high-photon-number Fock states, that can be prepared in the system cavity.

TI Universal early-time growth in quantum circuit complexity
SO JOURNAL OF HIGH ENERGY PHYSICS
AB We show that quantum circuit complexity for the unitary time evolution operator of any time-independent Hamiltonian is bounded by linear growth at early times, independent of any choices of the fundamental gates or cost metric. Deviations from linear early-time growth arise from the commutation algebra of the gates and are manifestly negative for any circuit, decreasing the linear growth rate and leading to a bound on the growth rate of complexity of a circuit at early times. We illustrate this general result by applying it to qubit and harmonic oscillator systems, including the coupled and anharmonic oscillator. By discretizing free and interacting scalar field theories on a lattice, we are also able to extract the early-time behavior and dependence on the lattice spacing of complexity of these field theories in the continuum limit, demonstrating how this approach applies to systems that have been previously difficult to study using existing techniques for quantum circuit complexity.

TI The universe from a single particle. Part II
SO JOURNAL OF HIGH ENERGY PHYSICS
AB We continue to explore, in the context of a toy model, the hypothesis that the interacting universe we see around us could result from single particle (undergraduate) quantum mechanics via a novel spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) acting at the level of probability distributions on Hamiltonians (rather than on states as is familiar from both Ginzburg-Landau superconductivity and the Higgs mechanism). In an earlier paper [1] we saw qubit structure emerge spontaneously on C-4 and C-8, and in this work we see C-6 spontaneously decomposing as C-2 circle times C-3 and very curiously C-5 (and C-7) splitting off one (one or three) directions and then factoring. This evidence provides additional support for the broad hypothesis: Nature will seek out tensor decompositions where none are present. We consider how this finding may form a basis for the origins of interaction and ask if it can be related to established foundational discussions such as string theory.

TI Spectral compression of single-photon wave packets by sum-frequency
   conversion in slow-light waveguides
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB A slow-light scheme is proposed for simultaneous frequency conversion and spectral compression of a weak optical pulse, which may be in any quantum state including a single-photon state. Such a process plays crucial roles in schemes for constructing quantum networks. Assuming that appropriate slow-light waveguides can be fabricated, theoretical modeling shows that a 3-ps signal pulse can be converted by sum-frequency generation (SFG) into a pulse with duration in the ns regime with a corresponding spectral compression factor of the order of 1000 and a useful intrinsic efficiency up to 83%. With this design, deleterious spatial-temporal oscillations are suppressed because the continual delay of the SFG field suppresses back-conversion from SFG to the signal field. Independent of the input pulse shape (if it is short enough), the converted pulse will have a near-exponential rising shape, which is suitable for temporal-mode matching into an optical cavity.

TI A Study on the Optimal Flexible Job-Shop Scheduling with
   Sequence-Dependent Setup Time Based on a Hybrid Algorithm of Improved
   Quantum Cat Swarm Optimization
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB Multi-item and small-lot-size production modes lead to frequent setup, which involves significant setup times and has a substantial impact on productivity. In this study, we investigated the optimal flexible job-shop scheduling problem with a sequence-dependent setup time. We built a mathematical model with the optimal objective of minimization of the maximum completion time (makespan). Considering the process sequence, which is influenced by setup time, processing time, and machine load limitations, first, processing machinery is chosen based on machine load and processing time, and then processing tasks are scheduled based on setup time and processing time. An improved quantum cat swarm optimization (QCSO) algorithm is proposed to solve the problem, a quantum coding method is introduced, the quantum bit (Q-bit) and cat swarm algorithm (CSO) are combined, and the cats are iteratively updated by quantum rotation angle position; then, the dynamic mixture ratio (MR) value is selected according to the number of algorithm iterations. The use of this method expands our understanding of space and increases operation efficiency and speed. Finally, the improved QCSO algorithm and parallel genetic algorithm (PGA) are compared through simulation experiments. The results show that the improved QCSO algorithm has better results, and the robustness of the algorithm is improved.

TI Low-loss lumped-element inductors made from granular aluminum
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB Lumped-element inductors are an integral component in the circuit QED toolbox. However, it is challenging to build inductors that are simultaneously compact, linear, and low-loss with standard approaches that either rely on the geometric inductance of superconducting thin films or on the kinetic inductance of Josephson-junction arrays. In this work, we overcome this challenge by utilizing the high kinetic inductance offered by superconducting granular aluminum (grAl). We demonstrate lumped-element inductors with a few nH of inductance that are up to 100 times shorter than inductors built from pure aluminum (Al). To characterize the properties of these linear inductors, we first report on the performance of lumped-element resonators built entirely out of grAl with sheet inductances varying from 30-320 pH/sq and self-Kerr nonlinearities of 0.2-20 Hz/photon. Further, we demonstrate ex situ integration of these grAl inductors into hybrid resonators with Al or tantalum (Ta) capacitor electrodes without increasing total internal losses. Interestingly, the measured internal quality factors systematically decrease with increasing room-temperature resistivity of the grAl film for all devices, indicating a trade-off between compactness and internal loss. For our lowest resistivity grAl films, we measure quality factors reaching 3.5 x 106 for the all-grAl devices and 4.5 x 106 for the hybrid grAl/Ta devices, similar to state-of-the-art quantum circuits. Our loss analysis suggests that the surface-loss factor of grAl is similar to that of pure Al for our lowest resistivity films, while the increasing losses with resistivity could be explained by increasing inductor loss in the grAl film.

TI Quantum advantage from energy measurements of many-body quantum systems
SO QUANTUM
AB The problem of sampling outputs of quantum circuits has been proposed as a candidate for demonstrating a quantum computational advantage (sometimes referred to as quantum "supremacy"). In this work, we investigate whether quantum advantage demonstrations can be achieved for more physically-motivated sampling problems, related to measurements of physical observables. We focus on the problem of sampling the outcomes of an energy measurement, performed on a simple-to-prepare product quantum state - a problem we refer to as energy sampling. For different regimes of measurement resolution and measurement errors, we provide complexity theoretic arguments showing that the existence of efficient classical algorithms for energy sampling is unlikely. In particular, we describe a family of Hamiltonians with nearest-neighbour interactions on a 2D lattice that can be efficiently measured with high resolution using a quantum circuit of commuting gates (IQP circuit), whereas an efficient classical simulation of this process should be impossible. In this high resolution regime, which can only be achieved for Hamiltonians that can be exponentially fast-forwarded, it is possible to use current theoretical tools tying quantum advantage statements to a polynomial-hierarchy collapse whereas for lower resolution measurements such arguments fail. Nevertheless, we show that efficient classical algorithms for low-resolution energy sampling can still be ruled out if we assume that quantum computers are strictly more powerful than classical ones. We believe our work brings a new perspective to the problem of demonstrating quantum advantage and leads to interesting new questions in Hamiltonian complexity.

TI A topic-aware classifier based on a hybrid quantum-classical model
SO NEURAL COMPUTING & APPLICATIONS
AB In the era of Large Language Models, there is still potential for improvement in current Natural Language Processing (NLP) methods in terms of verifiability and consistency. NLP classical approaches are computationally expensive due to their high-power consumption, computing power, and storage requirements. Another computationally efficient approach to NLP is categorical quantum mechanics, which combines grammatical structure and individual word meaning to deduce the sentence meaning. As both quantum theory and natural language use vector space to describe states which are more efficient on quantum hardware, QNLP models can achieve up to quadratic speedup over classical direct calculation methods. In recent years, there is significant progress in utilizing quantum features such as superposition and entanglement to represent linguistic meaning on quantum hardware. Earlier research work has already demonstrated QNLP's potential quantum advantage in terms of speeding up search, enhancing classification tasks' accuracy and providing an exponentially large quantum state space in which complex linguistic structures can be efficiently embedded. In this work, a QNLP model is used to determine if two sentences are related to the same topic or not. By comparing our QNLP model to a classical tensor network-based one, our model improved training accuracy by up to 45% and validation accuracy by 35%, respectively. The QNLP model convergence is also studied when varying: first, the problem size, second, parametrized quantum circuits used for model's training, and last, the backend quantum simulator noise model. The experimental results show that strongly entangled ansatz designs result in fastest model convergence.

TI Programming Optical-Lattice Fermi-Hubbard Quantum Simulators
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Fermionic atoms in optical lattices provide a native implementation of Fermi-Hubbard (FH) models that can be used as analog quantum simulators of many-body fermionic systems. Recent experimental advances include the time-dependent local control of chemical potentials and tunnelings, and thus enable us to operate this platform digitally as a programmable quantum simulator. Here, we explore these opportunities and develop ground-state preparation algorithms for different fermionic models, based on the ability to implement both single-particle and many-body high-fidelity fermionic gates, as provided by the native FH Hamiltonian. In particular, we first design variational precompiled quantum circuits to prepare the ground state of the natively implemented FH model, with significant speedups relative to competing adiabatic protocols. Besides, the versatility of this variational approach enables us to target extended FH models, i.e., including terms that are not natively realized on the platform. As an illustration, we include next-nearest-neighbor tunnelings at finite dopings, relevant in the context of d-wave superconductivity. Furthermore, we discuss how to approximate the imaginary-time evolution using variational fermionic circuits, both as an alternative state-preparation strategy and as a subroutine for the quantum Lanczos algorithm to further improve the energy estimation. We benchmark our protocols for ladder geometries, though they can be readily applied to two-dimensional experimental setups to address regimes beyond the capabilities of current classical methods. These results pave the way for more efficient and comprehensive explorations of relevant many-body phases with existing programmable fermionic quantum simulators.

TI Laser activation of single group-IV colour centres in diamond
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Spin-photon interfaces based on group-IV colour centres in diamond offer a promising platform for quantum networks. A key challenge in the field is realising precise single-defect positioning and activation, which is crucial for scalable device fabrication. Here we address this problem by demonstrating a two-step fabrication method for tin vacancy (SnV-) centres that uses site-controlled ion implantation followed by local femtosecond laser annealing with in-situ spectral monitoring. The ion implantation is performed with sub-50 nm resolution and a dosage that is controlled from hundreds of ions down to single ions per site, limited by Poissonian statistics. Using this approach, we successfully demonstrate site-selective creation and modification of single SnV- centres. Our in-situ spectral monitoring opens a window onto materials tuning at the single defect level, and provides new insight into defect structures and dynamics during the annealing process. While demonstrated for SnV- centres, this versatile approach can be readily generalised to other implanted colour centres in diamond and wide-bandgap materials.

TI Translation symmetry restoration under random unitary dynamics
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB The finite parts of a large, locally interacting many-body system prepared out of equilibrium eventually equilibrate. Characterizing the underlying mechanisms of this process and its timescales, however, is particularly hard as it requires one to decouple universal features from observable-specific ones. Recently, additional insight was gained by studying how certain symmetries of the dynamics that are broken by the initial state are restored at the level of the reduced state of a given subsystem. This provides a high-level, observable-independent probe. Until now, this idea has been applied to the restoration of internal symmetries, e.g., U(1) symmetries related to charge conservation. Here we show that the same logic can be applied to the restoration of space-time symmetries, and hence can be used to characterize the relaxation of fully generic systems. We illustrate this idea by considering the paradigmatic example of "generic" many-body dynamics, i.e., a local random unitary circuit, where our method leads to exact results. We show that the restoration of translation symmetry in these systems only happens on timescales that are proportional to the subsystem's volume. In fact, for large enough subsystems, the time of symmetry restoration becomes initial-state independent (as long as the latter breaks the symmetry at time zero) and coincides with the thermalization time. For intermediate subsystems, however, one can observe the "quantum Mpemba effect," where the state of the system restores a symmetry faster if it is initially more asymmetric. We provide an exact characterization of this effect in a nonintegrable system.

TI Extended-range percolation in complex networks
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW E
AB Classical percolation theory underlies many processes of information transfer along the links of a network. In these standard situations, the requirement for two nodes to be able to communicate is the presence of at least one uninterrupted path of nodes between them. In a variety of more recent data transmission protocols, such as the communication of noisy data via error-correcting repeaters, both in classical and quantum networks, the requirement of an uninterrupted path is too strict: two nodes may be able to communicate even if all paths between them have interruptions or gaps consisting of nodes that may corrupt the message. In such a case a different approach is needed. We develop the theoretical framework for extended-range percolation in networks, describing the fundamental connectivity properties relevant to such models of information transfer. We obtain exact results, for any range R, for infinite random uncorrelated networks and we provide a message-passing formulation that works well in sparse real-world networks. The interplay of the extended range and heterogeneity leads to novel critical behavior in scale-free networks.

TI Microcavity phonoritons - a coherent optical-to-microwave interface
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Optomechanical systems provide a pathway for the bidirectional optical-to-microwave interconversion in (quantum) networks. These systems can be implemented using hybrid platforms, which efficiently couple optical photons and microwaves via intermediate agents, e.g. phonons. Semiconductor exciton-polariton microcavities operating in the strong light-matter coupling regime offer enhanced coupling of near-infrared photons to GHz phonons via excitons. Furthermore, a new coherent phonon-exciton-photon quasiparticle termed phonoriton, has been theoretically predicted to emerge in microcavities, but so far has eluded observation. Here, we experimentally demonstrate phonoritons, when two exciton-polariton condensates confined in a & mu;m-sized trap within a phonon-photon microcavity are strongly coupled to a confined phonon which is resonant with the energy separation between the condensates. We realize control of phonoritons by piezoelectrically generated phonons and resonant photons. Our findings are corroborated by quantitative models. Thus, we establish zero-dimensional phonoritons as a coherent microwave-to-optical interface.
   Photonic, electronic and lattice resonances in patterned semiconductor microcavities are tailored to demonstrate coherent bidirectional microwave-to-optical conversion via phonon-exciton-photon quasi-particles in the strong-coupling regime.

TI Gaussian states in quantum field theory: Exact representations of
   relative phase in superpositions of Gaussian states
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
AB Gaussian quantum mechanics is a powerful tool regularly used in quantum optics to model linear and quadratic Hamiltonians efficiently. Recent interest in qubit-continuous-variable (CV) hybrid models has revealed a simple, yet important gap in our knowledge, namely, how to fully manipulate superpositions of Gaussian states. In this paper, we show how to faithfully represent a quadratic Gaussian state in the Fock basis. Specifically, we evaluate the phase necessary to equate the unitary representation of a zero-mean Gaussian state with its Fock representation. This allows for the coherent manipulation of superpositions of Gaussian states, especially the evaluation of expectation values from these superposed states. We then use this method to model a simple quantum field theory communication protocol using quadratic detectors in a regime that has previously been impossible to solve. The result presented in this paper is expected to become increasingly relevant with hybrid-CV systems, especially in the strong-coupling regime.

TI Lower bounds on entanglement entropy without twin copy
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB We discuss the possibility of estimating experimentally the von Neumann entanglement entropy SvN A of a symmetric bipartite quantum system AB by using the basic measurement counts (bitstrings) for a single copy of a prepared state. Using exact diagonalization and analog simulations performed with the publicly available QuEra facilities for chains and ladders of Rydberg atoms, we calculate the Shannon entropy SXAB associated with the bitstrings of adiabatically prepared ground states and the reduced entropies SAX and SBX obtained from the marginal probabilities in A and B. We then calculate the classical mutual information IXAB = SAX + SBX - SXAB, which is a lower bound on SAvN. We show that for a broad range of lattice spacing and detuning, IXAB is typically 20% below SvN A in regions where SAvN is large and a less close bound in regions where SAvN is low. We argue that this use of the easily available bitstrings provides a robust and efficient way to explore empirically the phase diagram of qubit-based quantum simulators and identify critical regions.

TI Strong charge-photon coupling in planar germanium enabled by granular
   aluminium superinductors
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB High kinetic inductance superconductors are gaining increasing interest for the realisation of qubits, amplifiers and detectors. Moreover, thanks to their high impedance, quantum buses made of such materials enable large zero-point fluctuations of the voltage, boosting the coupling rates to spin and charge qubits. However, fully exploiting the potential of disordered or granular superconductors is challenging, as their inductance and, therefore, impedance at high values are difficult to control. Here, we report a reproducible fabrication of granular aluminium resonators by developing a wireless ohmmeter, which allows in situ measurements during film deposition and, therefore, control of the kinetic inductance of granular aluminium films. Reproducible fabrication of circuits with impedances (inductances) exceeding 13 k Omega (1 nH per square) is now possible. By integrating a 7.9 k Omega resonator with a germanium double quantum dot, we demonstrate strong charge-photon coupling with a rate of gc/2 pi = 566 +/- 2 MHz. This broadly applicable method opens the path for novel qubits and high-fidelity, long-distance two-qubit gates.

TI Quantum neural networks based Lyapunov stability and adaptive learning
   rates for identification of nonlinear systems
SO AIN SHAMS ENGINEERING JOURNAL
AB This paper presents an identification model based on quantum neural network for engineering systems. Quantum neural network (QNN) is a superior strategy to improve the computational efficiency for conventional neural network structures due to their unprecedented computation capabilities. The structure of identification model consists of multi-layer QNN in which qubit neurons are used for data processing. The identification model stability is ensured by introducing a learning algorithm based on Lyapunov theorem for online tuning of the QNN. Furthermore, the convergence and stability of the identification structure are accelerated with developing adaptive learning rates based on Lyapunov theory. The effectiveness of the developed identification model is confirmed with introducing it for two engineering processes and comparing its modeling results with other structures. Simulation results reflect the high superior performance of the developed model compared with other approaches.

SO COMMUNICATIONS PHYSICS
AB Hybrid quantum-classical embedding methods for correlated materials simulations provide a path towards potential quantum advantage. However, the required quantum resources arising from the multi-band nature of d and f electron materials remain largely unexplored. Here we compare the performance of different variational quantum eigensolvers in ground state preparation for interacting multi-orbital embedding impurity models, which is the computationally most demanding step in quantum embedding theories. Focusing on adaptive algorithms and models with 8 spin-orbitals, we show that state preparation with fidelities better than 99.9% can be achieved using about 2(14) shots per measurement circuit. When including gate noise, we observe that parameter optimizations can still be performed if the two-qubit gate error lies below 10(-3), which is slightly smaller than current hardware levels. Finally, we measure the ground state energy on IBM and Quantinuum hardware using a converged adaptive ansatz and obtain a relative error of 0.7%.

TI Projection-operator-based Newton method for the trajectory optimization
   of closed quantum systems
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Quantum optimal control is an important technology that enables fast state preparation and gate design. In the absence of an analytic solution, most quantum optimal control methods rely on an iterative scheme to update the solution estimate. At present, the convergence rate of existing solvers is, at most, superlinear. This paper develops a general-purpose solver for quantum optimal control based on the projection operator Newton method for trajectory optimization, or PRONTO. Specifically, the proposed approach uses a projection operator to incorporate the Schrodinger equation directly into the cost function, which is then minimized using Newton's descent method. At each iteration, the descent direction is obtained by computing the analytic solution to a linear-quadratic trajectory-optimization problem. The resulting method guarantees monotonic convergence at every iteration and quadratic convergence in the proximity of the solution. The potential of PRONTO is showcased by solving the optimal state-to-state mapping problem for a qubit and providing comparisons to a state-of-the-art quantum optimal control method.

TI Entanglement-enhanced sensing using a chain of qubits with always-on
   nearest-neighbor interactions
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Quantum metrology is the use of genuinely quantum properties such as entanglement as a resource to outperform classical sensing strategies. Typically, entanglement is created by implementing gate operations or inducing many-body interactions. However, existing sensing schemes with these approaches require accurate control of the probe system such as switching on and off the interaction among qubits, which can be challenging for practical applications. Here, we propose an entanglement-enhanced sensing scheme with an always-on nearest-neighbor interaction between qubits. We adopt the transverse field Ising chain as the probe system, making use of the so-called quantum domino dynamics for the generation of the entangled states. In addition to the advantage that our scheme can be implemented without controlling the interactions, it only requires initialization of the system, projective measurements on a single qubit, and control of the uniform magnetic fields. We can achieve an improved sensitivity beyond the standard quantum limit even under the effect of realistic decoherence.

TI Z2 phases and Majorana spectroscopy in paired Bose-Hubbard
   chains
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We investigate the Bose-Hubbard chain in the presence of nearest-neighbor pairing. The pairing term gives rise to an unusual gapped Z(2) Ising phase that has number fluctuation but no off-diagonal long range order. This phase has a strongly correlated many-body doubly degenerate ground state which is effectively a gap-protected macroscopic qubit. In the strongly interacting limit, the system can be mapped onto an anisotropic transverse spin chain, which in turn can be mapped to the better-known fermionic sister of the paired Bose-Hubbard chain: the Kitaev chain which hosts zero-energy Majorana bound states. While corresponding phases in the fermionic and bosonic systems have starkly different wave functions, they share identical energy spectra. We describe a possible cold-atom realization of the paired Bose-Hubbard model in a biased zigzag optical lattice with reservoir-induced pairing, opening a possible route towards experimental Kitaev chain spectroscopy.

TI Optical and spin coherence of Er spin qubits in epitaxial cerium dioxide
   on silicon
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Robust spin-photon interfaces with optical transitions in the telecommunication band are essential for quantum networking technologies. Erbium (Er) ions are the ideal candidate with environmentally protected transitions in telecom-C band. Finding the right technologically compatible host material to enable long-lived spins remains a major hurdle. We introduce a new platform based on Er ions in cerium dioxide (CeO2) as a nearly-zero nuclear spin environment (0.04%) epitaxially grown on silicon, offering silicon compatibility for opto-electrical devices. Our studies focus on Er3+ ions and show a narrow homogeneous linewidth of 440 kHz with an optical coherence time of 0.72 mu s at 3.6 K. The reduced nuclear spin noise enables a slow spin-lattice relaxation with a spin relaxation time up to 2.5 ms and an electron spin coherence time of 0.66 mu s (in the isolated ion limit) at 3.6 K. These findings highlight the potential of Er3+:CeO2 platform for quantum networks applications.

TI Unconventional Light-Matter Interactions Between Giant Atoms and
   Structured Baths with Next-Nearest-Neighbor Couplings
SO ANNALEN DER PHYSIK
AB In this paper, the unconventional light-matter interactions between giant atoms and structured baths (i.e., lattices) are studied with either Hermitian or non-Hermitian next-nearest-neighbor coupling terms. Essentially different dynamics of the atoms and the propagating field in the Hermitian and non-Hermitian cases is revealed, which can be further engineered by tuning parameters such as the atomic transition frequency and the (synthetic) magnetic field associated to the coupling terms. The next-nearest-neighbor couplings play an important role in controlling the emission direction and the field distribution in the lattice, thus providing opportunities for tailoring exotic dipole-dipole interactions. The results in this paper have potential applications in, e.g., engineering unconventional quantum networks and simulating quantum many-body systems.
   This paper studies the influence of different types of next-nearest-neighbor couplings on the dispersion relation of the lattice model and the dynamics of the corresponding giant-atom system. By tailoring the next-nearest-neighbor coupling terms, the lattice can be either Hermitian or non-Hermitian, which enable essentially different dynamics. image

TI Taming Brillouin Optomechanics Using Supermode Microresonators
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW X
AB Electrostrictive Brillouin scattering provides a ubiquitous mechanism to optically excite high-frequency (>10 GHz), bulk acoustic phonons that are robust to surface-induced losses. Resonantly enhancing such photon-phonon interactions in high-Q microresonators has spawned diverse applications spanning microwave to optical domains. However, tuning both the pump and scattered waves into resonance usually comes with the cost of photon confinement or modal overlap, leading to limited optomechanical coupling. Here, we introduce Bragg scattering to realize strong bulk optomechanical coupling in the same spatial modes of a micron-sized supermode microresonator. A single-photon optomechanical coupling rate up to 12.5 kHz is demonstrated, showing more than 10 times improvement than other devices. Lowthreshold phonon lasing and optomechanical strong coupling are also observed for the 10.2-GHz mechanical mode. Our work establishes a compact and efficient paradigm to optically control bulk acoustic phonons, paving the way toward optomechanical coupling at the single-photon level and providing a powerful engine for large-scale integration of quantum networks in which quantum states are massively transferred and stored.

TI Matter-wave lensing of ultracold atomic gases by interaction quenching
   via two-photon scattering
SO EPJ QUANTUM TECHNOLOGY
AB Precision quantum sensors using cold atom interferometers with long interrogation times are often limited by the ballistic expansion of atomic samples after release from traps, manifesting by means of laser beam wavefront uncertainties. In this study we utilize near-resonant light interacting with an ultracold atomic sample for collective-mode excitation of a 87Rb Bose Einstein condensate (BEC) in a magnetic trap. The collective motion is initiated after abruptly modifying the atom-atom interaction energy by reduction of the BEC atom number density via photon scattering using the two-photon transition from 5S1/2\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$5S_{1/2}$\end{document} to 5D5/2\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$5D_{5/2}$\end{document}.

TI Electrical manipulation of the spins in phosphorene double quantum dots
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB We investigate electric dipole spin resonance (EDSR) induced by an oscillating electric field within a system of double quantum dots formed electrostatically in monolayer phosphorene. Apart from the observed anisotropy of effective masses, phosphorene has been predicted to exhibit anisotropic spin-orbit coupling. Here, we examine a system consisting of two electrons confined in double quantum dots. A single-band effective Hamiltonian together with the configuration interaction theory is implemented to simulate the time evolution of the ground state. We examine spin flips resulting from singlet-triplet transitions driven by external AC electric fields, both near and away from the Pauli blockade regime, revealing fast sub-nanosecond transition times. Furthermore, we analyze the impact of anisotropy by comparing dots arranged along a different crystal axis. The sub-harmonic multi-photon transitions and Landau-Zener-St & uuml;ckelberg-Majorana transitions are discussed. We show modulation of spin-like and charge-like characteristics of the qubit through potential detuning.

TI Hybrid Entropy-Based Metrics for k-Hop Environment Analysis in Complex
   Networks
SO MATHEMATICS
AB Two hybrid, entropy-guided node metrics are proposed for the k-hop environment: Entropy-Weighted Redundancy (EWR) and Normalized Entropy Density (NED). The central idea is to couple local Shannon entropy with neighborhood density/redundancy so that structural heterogeneity around a vertex is captured even when classical indices (e.g., degree or clustering) are similar. The metrics are formally defined and shown to be bounded, isomorphism-invariant, and stable under small edge edits. Their behavior is assessed on representative topologies (Erd & odblac;s-R & eacute;nyi, Barab & aacute;si-Albert, Watts-Strogatz, random geometric graphs, and the Zephyr quantum architecture). Across these settings, EWR and NED display predominantly negative correlation with degree and provide information largely orthogonal to standard centralities; vertices with identical degree can differ by factors of two to three in the proposed scores, revealing bridges and heterogeneous regions. These properties indicate utility for vulnerability assessment, topology-aware optimization, and layout heuristics in engineered and quantum networks.

TI Chip-integrated quantum signature network over 200 km
SO LIGHT-SCIENCE & APPLICATIONS
AB The development of quantum networks is paramount towards practical and secure communications. Quantum digital signatures (QDS) offer an information-theoretically secure solution for ensuring data integrity, authenticity, and non-repudiation, rapidly growing from proof-of-concept to robust demonstrations. However, previous QDS systems relied on expensive and bulky optical equipment, limiting large-scale deployment and reconfigurable networking construction. Here, we introduce and verify a chip-based QDS network, placing the complicated and expensive measurement devices in the central relay while each user needs only a low-cost transmitter. We demonstrate the network with a three-node setup using an integrated encoder chip and decoder chip. By developing a 1-decoy-state one-time universal hashing-QDS protocol, we achieve a maximum signature rate of 0.0414 times per second for a 1 Mbit messages over fiber distances up to 200 km, surpassing all current state-of-the-art QDS experiments. This study validates the feasibility of chip-based QDS, paving the way for large-scale deployment and integration with existing fiber infrastructure.

AB Parameterized Quantum Circuits (PQC) are promising towards quantum advantage on near-term quantum hardware. However, due to the large quantum noises (errors), the performance of PQC models has a severe degradation on real quantum devices. Take Quantum Neural Network (QNN) as an example, the accuracy gap between noise-free simulation and noisy results on IBMQ-Yorktown for MNIST-4 classification is over 60%. Existing noise mitigation methods are general ones without leveraging unique characteristics of PQC; on the other hand, existing PQC work does not consider noise effect. To this end, we present QuantumNAT, a PQC-specific framework to perform noise-aware optimizations in both training and inference stages to improve robustness. We experimentally observe that the effect of quantum noise to PQC measurement outcome is a linear map from noise-free outcome with a scaling and a shift factor. Motivated by that, we propose post-measurement normalization to mitigate the feature distribution differences between noise-free and noisy scenarios. Furthermore, to improve the robustness against noise, we propose noise injection to the training process by inserting quantum error gates to PQC according to realistic noise models of quantum hardware. Finally, post-measurement quantization is introduced to quantize the measurement outcomes to discrete values, achieving the denoising effect. Extensive experiments on 8 classification tasks using 6 quantum devices demonstrate that QuantumNAT improves accuracy by up to 43%, and achieves over 94% 2-class, 80% 4-class, and 34% 10-class classification accuracy measured on real quantum computers. The code for construction and noise-aware training of PQC is available in the TorchQuantum library.

TI Topology-Enhanced Nonreciprocal Scattering and Photon Absorption in a
   Waveguide
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB Topological matter and topological optics have been studied in many systems, with promising applications in materials science and photonics technology. These advances motivate the study of the interaction between topological matter and light, as well as topological protection in light-matter interactions. In this work, we study a waveguide-interfaced topological atom array. The light-matter interaction is nontrivially modified by topology, yielding optical phenomena. We find topology-enhanced photon absorption from the waveguide for a large Purcell factor, i.e., F/ F0 > 1, where F and F0 are the atomic decays to the waveguide and environment, respectively. To understand this unconventional photon absorption, we propose a multichannel scattering approach and study the interaction spectra for edge- and bulk-state channels. We find that, by breaking inversion and time-reversal symmetries, optical anisotropy is enabled for the reflection process, but the transmission is isotropic. Through a perturbation analysis of the edge-state channel, we show that the anisotropy in the reflection process originates from the waveguide-mediated non-Hermitian interaction. However, the inversion symmetry in the non-Hermitian interaction makes the transmission isotropic. At a topology-protected atomic spacing, the subradiant edge state exhibits huge anisotropy. Because of the interplay between edge- and bulk-state channels, a large topological bandgap enhances nonreciprocal reflection of photons in the waveguide for weakly broken time-reversal symmetry, i.e., F0/ F << 1, producing complete photon absorption. We show that our proposal can be implemented in superconducting quantum circuits. The topology-enhanced photon absorption is useful for quantum detection. This work shows the potential to manipulate light with topological quantum matter.

TI Population and Energy Transfer Dynamics in an Open Excitonic Quantum
   Battery
SO MOLECULES
AB In a previous study, we proposed an open quantum network model of a quantum battery (QB) that possesses dark states owing to its structural exchange symmetries. While in a dark state, the QB is capable of storing an exciton without any environment-induced population losses. However, when the structural exchange symmetry is broken, the QB begins to discharge the exciton towards its exit site. In this article, we start by demonstrating that this QB is not only loss-free with respect to exciton population during the storage phase, but also with respect to the QB energy. We then explore the exciton population and energy transfer dynamics of the QB during the discharge phase over a wide range of site energies, bath temperatures, and bath reorganization energies. Our results shed light on how to optimize the QB's population and energy transfer dynamics for different purposes.

TI Near power-law temperature dependence of the superfluid stiffness in
   strongly disordered superconductors
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB In BCS superconductors, the superfluid stiffness is virtually constant at low temperature and only slightly affected by the exponentially low density of thermal quasiparticles. Here, we present an experimental and theoretical study on the temperature dependence of superfluid stiffness Theta(T) in a strongly disordered pseudogaped superconductor, amorphous InOx, which exhibits non-BCS behavior. Experimentally, we report an unusual power-law suppression of the superfluid stiffness delta Theta(T) proportional to T-b at T << T-c, with b similar to 1.6, which we measured via the frequency shift of microwave resonators. Theoretically, by combining analytical and numerical methods to a model of a disordered superconductor with pseudogap and spatial inhomogeneities of the superconducting order parameter, we found a qualitatively similar low-temperature power-law behavior with exponent b similar to 1.6-3 being disorder-dependent. This power-law suppression of the superfluid density occurs mainly due to the broad distribution of the superconducting order parameter that is known to exist in such superconductors [B. Sacepe et al., Nat. Phys. 7, 239 (2011)], even moderately far from the superconductor-insulator transition. The presence of the power-law dependence delta Theta(T) proportional to T-b at low T << T-c demonstrates the existence of low-energy collective excitations; in turn, it implies the presence of a new channel of dissipation in inhomogeneous superconductors caused by subgap excitations that are not quasiparticles. Our findings have implications for the use of strongly disordered superconductors as superinductance in quantum circuits.

TI Observation of ν=5/2 Fractional Quantum Hall Effect in Trilayer
   Graphene Proximitized by V-Doped WSe2
SO ADVANCED MATERIALS
AB Graphene has long been a test bed for observing strongly correlated phenomena owing to its 2D nature and ability to host high carrier mobility. However, the lack of intrinsic magnetism and weak spin-orbit coupling limits its ability to host strong electronic correlations. Here, observation of strongly correlated phenomena in trilayer graphene (TLG) proximitized by a ferromagnetic V-doped WSe2 (V-WSe2) overlayer is reported. These include the emergence of an odd- and even-denominator fractional quantum Hall state at nu = 5/2 and reentrant integer quantum Hall effect in the hole regime of the TLG, driven by proximate magnetism from the V-WSe2. A remarkably large activation energy gap (Delta 5/2 = 48 +/- 5 K) for the 5/2 fractional state is observed, which is essential for probing its non-Abelian nature. Furthermore, the large Delta 5/2 significantly enhances its feasibility for topological quantum computation by exponentially suppressing the error rates. Additionally, the formation of three additional Dirac cones, termed Dirac "gullies," is observed, which manifest as threefold-degenerate Landau levels in magnetotransport measurements. These findings not only advance the role of magnetism in graphene-based heterostructures but also open pathways toward studying non-Abelian quasiparticles for their exotic fundamental and technological implications.

TI Time-walk and jitter correction in SNSPDs at high count rates
SO APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS
AB Superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors (SNSPDs) are a leading detector type for time correlated single photon counting, especially in the near-infrared. When operated at high count rates, SNSPDs exhibit increased timing jitter caused by internal device properties and features of the RF amplification chain. Variations in RF pulse height and shape lead to variations in the latency of timing measurements. To compensate for this, we demonstrate a calibration method that correlates delays in detection events with the time elapsed between pulses. The increase in jitter at high rates can be largely canceled in software by applying corrections derived from the calibration process. We demonstrate our method with a single-pixel tungsten silicide SNSPD and show it decreases high count rate jitter. The technique is especially effective at removing a long tail that appears in the instrument response function at high count rates. At a count rate of 11.4 MCounts/s, we reduce the full width at 1% maximum level (FW1%M) by 45%. The method, therefore, enables certain quantum communication protocols that are rate-limited by the FW1%M metric to operate almost twice as fast.

TI Quantum-Inspired Distributed Memetic Algorithm
SO COMPLEX SYSTEM MODELING AND SIMULATION
AB This paper proposed a novel distributed memetic evolutionary model, where four modules distributed exploration, intensified exploitation, knowledge transfer, and evolutionary restart are coevolved to maximize their strengths and achieve superior global optimality. Distributed exploration evolves three independent populations by heterogenous operators. Intensified exploitation evolves an external elite archive in parallel with exploration to balance global and local searches. Knowledge transfer is based on a point-ring communication topology to share successful experiences among distinct search agents. Evolutionary restart adopts an adaptive perturbation strategy to control search diversity reasonably. Quantum computation is a newly emerging technique, which has powerful computing power and parallelized ability. Therefore, this paper further fuses quantum mechanisms into the proposed evolutionary model to build a new evolutionary algorithm, referred to as quantum-inspired distributed memetic algorithm (QDMA). In QDMA, individuals are represented by the quantum characteristics and evolved by the quantum-inspired evolutionary optimizers in the quantum hyperspace. The QDMA integrates the superiorities of distributed, memetic, and quantum evolution. Computational experiments are carried out to evaluate the superior performance of QDMA. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of special designs and show that QDMA has greater superiority compared to the compared state-of-the-art algorithms based on Wilcoxon's rank-sum test. The superiority is attributed not only to good cooperative coevolution of distributed memetic evolutionary model, but also to superior designs of each special component.

TI Determining the mechanical properties of AlN films using micromechanical
   membranes
SO APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS
AB The mechanical properties of thin films can vary significantly due to variations in the deposition process. Monitoring these properties is essential when, e.g., engineering micro-mechanical devices. Established methods such as wafer bending and bulge testing provide only average values for the entire wafer or impose constraints on the sample fabrication process. Therefore, a method to efficiently characterize mechanical properties locally with simple sample fabrication is desirable. In this study, we determine the stress in direct-current magnetron-sputtered aluminum nitride films on prefabricated silicon nitride membranes by measuring the fundamental eigenfrequencies of the membranes and combining it with mechanical band structure simulations. We find that the stress, which is directly related to the strain, transitions from compressive to tensile as a function of the film thickness. Our simple and robust method allows in situ measurements that are compatible with existing nanofabrication techniques of, e.g., hybrid photonic circuits and can probe the stress locally over the chip.

TI Entanglement meter: estimation of entanglement with single copy in
   interferometer
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB Efficient certification and quantification of high dimensional entanglement of composite systems are challenging both theoretically as well as experimentally. Here, we demonstrate how to measure the linear entropy, negativity and the Schmidt number of bipartite systems from the visibility of Mach-Zehnder interferometer using single copies of the quantum state. Our result shows that for any two qubit pure bipartite state, the interference visibility is a direct measure of entanglement. We also propose how to measure the mutual predictability experimentally from the intensity patterns of the interferometric set-up without having to resort to local measurements of mutually unbiased bases. Furthermore, we show that the entanglement witness operator can be measured in a interference setup and the phase shift is sensitive to the separable or entangled nature of the state. Our proposal bring out the power of Interferometric set-up in entanglement detection of pure and several mixed states which paves the way towards design of entanglement meter.

TI Identifying optimal magnetic field configurations for decoherence
   mitigation of boron vacancies in hexagonal boron nitride
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB The negatively charged boron vacancy center in two-dimensional (2D) hexagonal boron nitride has emerged as a promising quantum sensor. However, its sensitivity is constrained due to ubiquitous nuclear spins in the environment. The nuclear spins, hyperfine coupled with the central electron spin, effectively behave as magnetic field fluctuators, leading to rapid decoherence. Here, we explore the effectiveness of static magnetic field strength and orientation in realizing peculiar subspaces that can lead to enhanced spin coherence. Specifically, using detailed numerical simulations of the spin Hamiltonian, we identify specific field configurations that minimize energy gradients and, consequently, are expected to facilitate decoherence suppression. We also develop an approximate analytical model based on the perturbation theory that accurately predicts these low-gradient subspaces for magnetic fields aligned with the electron spin quantization axis, applicable not only to boron vacancies but to any spin-1 electronic system coupled to nearby nuclear spins. Furthermore, to stimulate experimental validation, we estimate coherence lifetimes as a function of various bias field configurations and demonstrate that significant decoherence suppression can indeed be achieved in certain regions. These findings and the developed methodology offer valuable insights for mitigating decoherence in a low-field regime.

TI Contextuality in composite systems: the role of entanglement in the
   Kochen-Specker theorem
SO QUANTUM
AB The Kochen-Specker (KS) theorem reveals the nonclassicality of single quantum systems. In contrast, Bell's theorem and entanglement concern the nonclassicality of composite quantum systems. Accordingly, unlike incom-patibility, entanglement and Bell non -locality are not necessary to demon-strate KS-contextuality. However, here we find that for multiqubit systems, en-tanglement and non-locality are both es-sential to proofs of the Kochen-Specker theorem. Firstly, we show that unen-tangled measurements (a strict super-set of local measurements) can never yield a logical (state-independent) proof of the KS theorem for multiqubit systems. In particular, unentan-gled but nonlocal measurements- whose eigenstates exhibit "nonlocal-ity without entanglement"-are insuf-ficient for such proofs. This also im-plies that proving Gleason's theorem on a multiqubit system necessarily re-quires entangled projections, as shown by Wallach [Contemp Math, 305: 291-298 (2002)]. Secondly, we show that a multiqubit state admits a statistical (state-dependent) proof of the KS the-orem if and only if it can violate a Bell inequality with projective measure-ments. We also establish the relation-ship between entanglement and the the-orems of Kochen-Specker and Gleason more generally in multiqudit systems by constructing new examples of KS sets. Finally, we discuss how our results shed new light on the role of multiqubit contextuality as a resource within the paradigm of quantum computation with state injection.

TI Sensitivity of ultralight axion dark matter search with optical quantum
   sensors
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
AB An optical quantum sensor (OQS) based on lasers and alkali-metal atoms is a sensitive ambienttemperature magnetometer that can be used in axion dark matter search with an inductor-capacitor (LC) circuit at kHz and MHz frequencies. We have previously investigated the sensitivity of an LC circuit-OQS axion detector to ultralight axion dark matter that could be achieved using a fT-noise OQS constructed in our lab. In this paper, we investigate the sensitivity that could be potentially reached by an OQS performing close to the fundamental quantum noise levels of 10 aT= root Hzp. To take advantage of the quantum-limited OQS, the LC circuit has to be made of a superconductor and cooled to low temperature of a few K. After considering the intrinsic noise of the advanced axion detector and characterizing possible background noises, we estimate that such an experiment could probe benchmark QCD axion models in an unexplored mass range near 10 neV. Reaching such a high sensitivity is a difficult task, so we have conducted some preliminary experiments with a large-bore magnet and a prototype axion detector consisting of a roomtemperature LC circuit and a commercial OQS unit. This paper describes the prototype experiment and its projected sensitivity to axions in detail.

TI Imaging non-collinear antiferromagnetic textures via single spin
   relaxometry
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Antiferromagnetic materials are promising platforms for next-generation spintronics owing to their fast dynamics and high robustness against parasitic magnetic fields. However, nanoscale imaging of the magnetic order in such materials with zero net magnetization remains a major experimental challenge. Here we show that non-collinear antiferromagnetic spin textures can be imaged by probing the magnetic noise they locally produce via thermal populations of magnons. To this end, we perform nanoscale, all-optical relaxometry with a scanning quantum sensor based on a single nitrogen-vacancy (NV) defect in diamond. Magnetic noise is detected through an increase of the spin relaxation rate of the NV defect, which results in an overall reduction of its photoluminescence signal under continuous laser illumination. As a proof-of-concept, the efficiency of the method is demonstrated by imaging various spin textures in synthetic antiferromagnets, including domain walls, spin spirals and antiferromagnetic skyrmions. This imaging procedure could be extended to a large class of intrinsic antiferromagnets and opens up new opportunities for studying the physics of localized spin wave modes for magnonics. In this manuscript, Finco et al demonstrate the use of a quantum magnetometer based on a single NV centre for all-optical imaging of antiferromagnetic (AFM) spin textures. By exploiting variations of the NV spin relaxation rate, they succeed in imaging AFM domain walls and skyrmions.

TI Optimal Protocols for Quantum Metrology with Noisy Measurements
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Measurement noise is a major source of noise in quantum metrology. Here, we explore preprocessing protocols that apply quantum controls to the quantum sensor state prior to the final noisy measurement (but after the unknown parameter has been imparted), aiming to maximize the estimation precision. We define the quantum preprocessing-optimized Fisher information, which determines the ultimate precision limit for quantum sensors under measurement noise, and conduct a thorough investigation into optimal preprocessing protocols. First, we formulate the preprocessing optimization problem as a biconvex optimization using the error observable formalism, based on which we prove that unitary controls are optimal for pure states and derive analytical solutions of the optimal controls in several practically relevant cases. Then we prove that for classically mixed states (whose eigenvalues encode the unknown parameter) under commuting-operator measurements, coarse-graining controls are optimal, while unitary controls are suboptimal in certain cases. Finally, we demonstrate that in multiprobe systems where noisy measurements act independently on each probe, the noiseless precision limit can be asymptotically recovered using global controls for a wide range of quantum states and measurements. Applications to noisy Ramsey interferometry and thermometry are presented, as well as explicit circuit constructions of optimal controls.

TI Design of an ultra-sensitive and miniaturized diamond NV magnetometer
   based on a nanocavity structure
SO JAPANESE JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS
AB The ensemble of nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond allows for the potential realization of the sensitive magnetometers by leveraging their excellent spin properties. However, the NV-based magnetometers are limited by their experimental magnetic field sensitivity owing to its inefficient photon collection. Moreover, they are a disadvantage to the reduced spatial resolution and excessive excitation power. To overcome these issues, we propose a ultra-sensitive diamond magnetometer based on nanocavities. The device structure can attain a high collective efficiency and enhance the photon emission intensity of the NV ensemble. This device can allow the efficient photon collection even when considering the positional distribution of the NV centers. Our theoretical analysis indicates that the minimum expected sensitivity is 60 fT/root Hz. The proposed design can achieve a volume-normalized sensitivity of 0.92 aT/root Hz cm(-3) along with the required power of 7 mu W, both of which are superior to those of bulk diamond. The proposed approach offers a promising route towards highly sensitive and energy-efficient magnetometers. (c) 2022 The Author(s).

The proposed system offers a reproducible approach to alignment, potentially improving the performance and stability of advanced optical systems relying on EOMs.Abstract Electro-optic modulators (EOMs) are critical components in advanced optical systems, including quantum communications and high-resolution imaging, where precise alignment is essential for optimal performance. However, conventional methods struggle to simultaneously achieve accurate optical axis, transmission axis, and azimuthal alignment of EOM components. This study proposes a high-precision alignment method that synergistically combines Twyman-Green and conoscopic interferometry. The Twyman-Green system first ensures precise optical axis alignment of the electro-optic crystal by minimizing tilt errors. Subsequently, under zero applied voltage, conoscopic interferometry is used to align the transmission axes of the polarizer and analyzer by verifying that the centroids of the interference features orient at 45 degrees and 135 degrees. Finally, under half-wave voltage, azimuthal alignment of the electro-optic crystal is achieved by ensuring the same centroid orientation. Experimental validation using a Z-cut LiNbO3 modulator demonstrates exceptional alignment accuracy, with root mean square errors below 0.2862 mrad for transmission axis alignment and 0.3229 mrad for azimuthal alignment. The proposed method offers a robust solution for high-precision EOM alignment in demanding applications.

SO BIOPHYSICA
AB Medical physicists are transforming physiological measurements and electrophysiological applications by addressing challenges like motion artifacts and regulatory compliance through advanced signal processing, artificial intelligence (AI), and statistical rigor. Their innovations in wearable electrophysiology achieve 8-12 dB signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) improvements in EEG, 60% motion artifact reduction, and 94.2% accurate AI-driven arrhythmia detection at 12 mu W power. In precision neurology, machine learning (ML) with evoked potentials (EPs) predicts spinal cord injury (SCI) recovery and multiple sclerosis (MS) progression with 79.2% accuracy based on retrospective data from 560 SCI/MS patients. By integrating multimodal data (EPs, MRI), developing quantum sensors, and employing federated learning, these can enhance diagnostic precision and prognostic accuracy. Clinical applications span epilepsy, stroke, cardiac monitoring, and chronic pain management, reducing diagnostic errors by 28% and optimizing treatments like deep brain stimulation (DBS). In this paper, we review the current state of wearable devices and provide some insight into possible future directions. Embedding medical physicists into standardization efforts is critical to overcoming barriers like quantum sensor power consumption, advancing personalized, evidence-based healthcare.

TI Phonation differentiation by non-contact laryngeal magnetomyography
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Phonation is important for our daily communication and requires the activation of internal and external laryngeal muscles, which can be recorded by electromyography (EMG) using surface or needle electrodes. Here we present a new noncontact method, laryngeal magnetomyography. As a proof-of-concept, we investigated the feasibility of differentiating various vocalization conditions using laryngeal MMG in two healthy subjects using optically pumped magnetometers (OPM). We recorded magnetic muscle activity of the larynx and neighboring cervical muscles using a 3 x 5 array of OPMs. Subjects vocalized an /a/ in three different conditions: loud high pitch, loud low pitch, and soft high pitch, in 90 s blocks. After removing cardiac artifacts, MMG signals were in the range of 1.5 pT with significant amplitude differences between conditions. In both subjects, Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) was able to significantly classify vocalization conditions based on the spatial pattern of MMG activities. In sum, we show that laryngeal MMG allows contactless differentiation of phonations based on myomagnetic signals. Our results set the stage for future studies to explore this method for clinical diagnostics and therapy. Functional, contactless muscle recordings during vocalization enable new applications for miniaturized quantum sensors, e.g. in linguistic studies and speech rehabilitation.

TI Time-resolved sensing of electromagnetic fields with single-electron
   interferometry
SO NATURE NANOTECHNOLOGY
AB Characterizing quantum states of the electromagnetic field at microwave frequencies requires fast and sensitive detectors that can simultaneously probe the field's time-dependent amplitude and its quantum fluctuations. So far, this has been achieved by using either homodyne detection or fast digitizers. Both methods rely on the extraction of microwave radiation through an amplification chain towards the detector placed at room temperature, thereby limiting the time resolution to the similar to 10-GHz bandwidth of the measurement chain. Additionally, the coupling of high-impedance samples to the 50-Omega measurement chain is very weak, setting strong limitations on the detection sensitivity. In this work, we demonstrate an on-chip quantum sensor that exploits the phase of a single-electron wavefunction, measured in an electronic Fabry-Perot interferometer, to detect the amplitude of a classical time-dependent electric field. The interferometer is implemented in a GaAs/AlGaAs quantum Hall conductor. The time resolution, limited by the temporal width of the electronic wavepacket, is similar to 35 ps. The interferometry technique provides a voltage resolution of similar to 50 mu V, corresponding to a few microwave photons. Importantly, our detector measures both phase and contrast of the interference pattern. The latter opens the way to the detection of non-classical electromagnetic fields, such as squeezed or Fock states.

TI CAN ACCURACY ISSUES OF LOW-COST SENSOR MEASUREMENTS BE OVERCOME WITH
   DATA ASSIMILATION?
SO ENGENHARIA AGRICOLA
AB The use of mechanistic plant growth models relies on the availability of high-quality inputs to reduce uncertainty in estimates. Measurements of photosynthetically active radiation inside a protected environment are either more expensive to obtain or dependent on assumptions regarding external measurements. This study aimed to reduce the influence of uncertainty in the measurements of low-cost lux meters by using a data assimilation strategy. We first determined, by simulation, the impact of different sensors on the estimates. We then used the Ensemble Kalman Filter to assimilate artificial observations of tomato growth in the Reduced-State Tomgro model, in simulations for which the solar radiation inputs were obtained from a low-cost lux meter. We compared the assimilated estimates to the simulations that used solar radiation obtained with a scientific-grade quantum sensor. For periods of larger radiation intensity, in which the differences in measurements from both instruments are larger, assimilation of observations with low errors lead to estimates that are closer to the ones obtained by scientific grade sensors. These results suggest that low-cost sensors could be used to obtain inputs for growth models in protected environments, provided there are also imperfect observations of the state.

TI Label-Free Phase Change Detection of Lipid Bilayers Using Nanoscale
   Diamond Magnetometry
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB The nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond is a quantum sensor with exceptional quality for highly sensitive nanoscale analysis of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra and thermometry. In this study, nanoscale phase change detection of lipid bilayers is investigated utilizing ensemble-averaged nuclear spin detection from small volume approximate to(6 nm)(3), which is determined by the depth of the NV center. Analysis of nanoscale NMR signal confirms thickness of lipid bilayer to be 6.2 nm +/- 3.4 nm with proton density of 65 protons per nm(3) on top of diamond sample. The result of the correlation spectroscopy from nanoscale volume is compared with the 2D molecular diffusion model constructed by Monte Carlo simulation combined with results from molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. There is a change in diffusion constant from 1.5 +/- 0.25 nm(2) mu s(-1) to 3.0 +/- 0.5 nm(2) mu s(-1) when the temperature changes from 26.5 to 36.0 degrees C. The results demonstrate that the multi-parameter detection of changes in translational diffusion and temperature is possible in label-free measurements using nanoscale diamond magnetometry. The method paves the way for label-free imaging of cell membranes for understanding their phase composition and dynamics.

TI Original hydrazine carbothioamide Schiff base derivative as a suitable
   mitigator for corrosion of carbon steel and hydrogen production in
   acidic aqueous media
SO JOURNAL OF ELECTROCHEMICAL SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING
AB The inhibitive effect of E-2-(1-methylpyrrolidin-2-ylidene) hydrazine carbo-thioamide Schiff base (MPHCA) towards the corrosion of carbon steel in hydrochloric acid media was examined using various chemical and electrochemical techniques. The rate of metal destruction in the HCl solution is reduced in the presence of the MPHCA. The inhibition efficiency is increased with more additions of MPHCA to reach 97.68 % at 5.0 mM concentration, at 25 degrees C. The inhibition process is controlled by the adsorption of inhibitive molecules on the carbon steel surface, obeying the Langmuir model. The computed Delta Goads values with the negative sign confirm the spontaneous nature of the adsorption process. Such values varied between-34.45 and-36.77 kJ mol-1, supporting the mixed chemo and physisorption mechanisms. The lowering in Kads values with the increase in temperature could confirm the escape of a few adsorbed MPHCA molecules from the metallic surface into the examined solution. The theoretical studies by the DFT method and conductor-like polarizable continuum determined the inhibitor's optimized geometries, providing insights into their molecular structure and potential properties. Monte Carlo and molecular dynamics simulations assessed the inhibitors' adsorption energy and comprehensive adsorption characteristics. MPHCA showed the highest adsorption energy, suggesting superior corrosion inhibition characteristics.

TI Magneto-optics of layered two-dimensional semiconductors and
   heterostructures: Progress and prospects
SO JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS
AB Beginning with the "conventional" two-dimensional (2D) quantum wells based on III-V and II-VI semiconductors in the 1970s, to the recent atomically thin sheets of van der Waals materials such as 2D semiconducting transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) and 2D magnets, the research in 2D materials is continuously evolving and providing new challenges. Magneto-optical spectroscopy has played a significant role in this area of research, both from fundamental physics and technological perspectives. A major challenge in 2D semiconductors such as TMDCs is to understand their spin-valley-resolved physics and their implications in quantum computation and information research. Since the discovery of valley Zeeman effects, deep insights into the spin-valley physics of TMDCs and their heterostructures have emerged through magneto-optical spectroscopy. In this Perspective, we highlight the role of magneto-optics in many milestones such as the discovery of interlayer excitons, phase control between coherently excited valleys, determination of exciton-reduced masses, Bohr radii and binding energies, physics of the optically bright and dark excitons, trions, and other many-body species such as biexcitons and their phonon replicas in TMDC monolayers. The discussion accompanies open questions, challenges, and future prospects in the field including comments on the magneto-optics of van der Waals heterostructures involving TMDCs and 2D magnets.

TI Energy additivity as a requirement for universal quantum thermodynamical
   frameworks
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB The quest to develop a general framework for thermodynamics, suitable for the regime of strong coupling and correlations between subsystems of an autonomous quantum "universe," has entailed diverging definitions for basic quantities, including internal energy. While most approaches focus solely on the system of interest, we propose that a universal notion of internal energy should also account for the environment in order to keep consistency with the closed-system energy of the universe. We introduce an abstract framework to describe all effective Hamiltonian-based approaches and address a rigorous definition of energy additivity in this context, in both a weak and a strong form, discussing the underlying subtleties. As an illustration, we study a particular two-qubit universe model, obtaining the exact master equations for both parties and calculating their effective Hamiltonians and internal energies as given by the recently devised minimal dissipation approach. In this case, we show that internal energies are neither additive nor conservative, which leads to unphysical features.

TI Absolutely entangled sets of pure states for bipartitions and
   multipartitions
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB A set of quantum states is said to be absolutely entangled when at least one state in the set remains entangled for any definition of subsystems, i.e., for any choice of the global reference frame. In this work we investigate the properties of absolutely entangled sets (AESs) of pure quantum states. For the case of a two-qubit system, we present a sufficient condition to detect an AES, and use it to construct families of N states such that N - 3 (the maximal possible number) remain entangled for any definition of subsystems. For a general bipartition d = d(1)d(2), we prove that sets of N > (sic)(d(1) + 1)(d(2) + 1)/2(sic) states are AESs with Haar measure 1. Then, we define AESs for multipartitions. We derive a general lower bound on the number of states in an AES for a given multipartition, and also construct explicit examples. In particular, we exhibit an AES with respect to any possible multipartitioning of the total system.

TI Radiative loss of coherence in free electrons: a long-range quantum
   phenomenon
SO LIGHT-SCIENCE & APPLICATIONS
AB Quantum physics rules the dynamics of small objects as they interact over microscopic length scales. Nevertheless, quantum correlations involving macroscopic distances can be observed between entangled photons as well as in atomic gases and matter waves at low temperatures. The long-range nature of the electromagnetic coupling between charged particles and extended objects could also trigger quantum phenomena over large distances. Here, we reveal a manifestation of quantum mechanics that involves macroscopic distances and results in a nearly complete depletion of coherence associated with which-way free-electron interference produced by electron-radiation coupling in the presence of distant extended objects. This is a ubiquitous effect that we illustrate through a rigorous theoretical analysis of a two-path electron beam interacting with a semi-infinite metallic plate and find the inter-path coherence to vanish proportionally to the path separation at zero temperature and exponentially at finite temperature. The investigated regime of large distances originates in the coupling of the electron to radiative modes assisted by diffraction at material structures but without any involvement of material excitations. Besides the fundamental interest of this macroscopic quantum phenomenon, our results suggest an approach to measuring the vacuum temperature and nondestructively sensing the presence of distant objects.
   Free-electron decoherence produced by electron coupling to radiation constitutes a quantum-physics macroscopic phenomenon that enables nondestructive sensing of distant objects

TI Two-dimensional topological superconductivity candidate in a van der
   Waals layered material
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB Two-dimensional (2D) topological superconductors are highly desired because they not only offer opportunities for exploring novel exotic quantum physics but also possess potential applications in quantum computation. However, there are few reports about 2D superconductors, let alone topological superconductors. Here, we find a 2D monolayer W2N3, which can be exfoliated from its real van der Waals bulk material with much lower exfoliation energy than MoS2, to be a topological metal with exotic topological states at different energy levels. Owing to the Van Hove singularities, the density of states near the Fermi level are high, making the monolayer a compensate metal. Moreover, the monolayer W2N3 is unveiled to be a superconductor with the superconducting transition temperature T-C similar to 22 K and a superconducting gap of about 5 meV based on the anisotropic Migdal-Eliashberg formalism, arising from the strong electron-phonon coupling around the Gamma point, and the 2D superconductor is phonon mediated and fits the BCS mechanism with an Ising-type pairing. Because of the strong electron and lattice coupling, the monolayer displays a non-Fermi liquid behavior in its normal states at temperatures lower than 80 K, where the specific heat exhibits T-3 behavior and the Wiedemann-Franz law is dramatically violated. Our findings not only provide a platform to study the emergent phenomena in 2D topological superconductors, but also open a door to discover more 2D high-temperature topological superconductors in van der Waals materials.

TI Ensemble Negatively-Charged Nitrogen-Vacancy Centers in Type-Ib Diamond
   Created by High Fluence Electron Beam Irradiation
SO QUANTUM BEAM SCIENCE
AB Electron beam irradiation into type-Ib diamond is known as a good method for the creation of high concentration negatively-charged nitrogen-vacancy (NV-) centers by which highly sensitive quantum sensors can be fabricated. In order to understand the creation mechanism of NV- centers, we study the behavior of substitutional isolated nitrogen (P1 centers) and NV- centers in type-Ib diamond, with an initial P1 concentration of 40-80 ppm by electron beam irradiation up to 8.0 x 10(18) electrons/cm(2). P1 concentration and NV- concentration were measured using electron spin resonance and photoluminescence measurements. P1 center count decreases with increasing irradiation fluence up to 8.0 x 10(18) electrons/cm(2). The rate of decrease in P1 is slightly lower at irradiation fluence above 4.0 x 10(18) electrons/cm(2) especially for samples of low initial P1 concentration. Comparing concentration of P1 centers with that of NV- centers, it suggests that a part of P1 centers plays a role in the formation of other defects. The usefulness of electron beam irradiation to type-Ib diamonds was confirmed by the resultant conversion efficiency from P1 to NV- center around 12-19%.

SO FRACTALS-COMPLEX GEOMETRY PATTERNS AND SCALING IN NATURE AND SOCIETY
AB In this paper, we investigated the influence of temperature and momentum-dependent coherence-chaos radiations on particle excretion from a fluid with quantum supremacy. The dynamics interpretation of a system can become exceedingly complex and femtoscopy is an efficient quantum tool that captures and explores the complicated dynamical properties. This research presents a comprehensive and brief analysis of fluid in the context of quantum interference for partially chaotic systems, as well as novel findings for chaos synchronization of identical bosons in the extending source are evaluated. The eminence of coherence on chaotic production has been demonstrated using correlation plots in the existence of the quantum influence. The temperature profile is described with the mitigation of graphs created for various flow peculiarities, and the density equations are derived through feasible interferences transformation approaches. Results exhibit the quantitative data of chaotic and droplets exhibiting coherence features and illustrate a premise that depicts motivated conversions between cold and hot bosonic particles crossover during the expanding of emitted sources. The emergent phase can contain a partially thermalized distribution of particles which is elucidated by the swiftness of the hadronic transition and this phase reveals marvelous entirely quantum correlations according to our findings. In particular, we formulate the normalized interception for the hybrid system using particular methods to probe the source configurations.

TI Correlation between thickness dependent nanoscale structural chemistry
   and superconducting properties of ultrathin epitaxial NbN films
SO MATERIALS CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
AB NbN-based superconductors have attracted interest for superconducting circuits, quantum computation and high frequency devices. The superconducting properties of NbN films are predominately reliant on the microstructure, therefore, an atomic-level understanding of the structure-chemistry is required to achieve high quality epitaxial NbN films. Here, the thickness-dependent superconducting properties of NbN films (5, 10, and 50 nm) within NbN/AlN/Al2O3 heterostructures are investigated. NbN and AlN were epitaxially grown by an industrial scale physical vapor deposition technique. The role of nanoscale chemistry on the ultrathin NbN superconducting film is investigated at the atomic level for the first time via atom probe tomography, providing three-dimensional atomic distribution, chemical homogeneity, effect of impurities, specially, in secondary phase formations and interfacial abruptness. The NbN film with 5 nm of thickness demonstrates a superconducting transition temperature of 11.2 K as compared to 50 nm NbN films with a transition temperature of 15.3 K. These thickness dependent variation of superconducting properties are associated with the chemical inhomogeneity in terms of in-plane N:Nb distribution, secondary phase formations and NbN/AlN interfacial abruptness as a function of the NbN films thicknesses. The analysis depicts the interplay between the surface/interface and the superconducting properties of ultrathin NbN films. These results provide insights on material design and growth that will enable the development of optimized superconducting NbN films for quantum devices.

TI Rare-Earth Chalcohalides: A Family of van der Waals Layered Kitaev Spin
   Liquid Candidates
SO CHINESE PHYSICS LETTERS
AB The Kitaev spin liquid (KSL) system has attracted tremendous attention in recent years because of its fundamental significance in condensed matter physics and promising applications in fault-tolerant topological quantum computation. Material realization of such a system remains a major challenge in the field due to the unusual configuration of anisotropic spin interactions, though great effort has been made before. Here we reveal that rare-earth chalcohalides REChX (RE = rare earth; Ch = O, S, Se, Te; X = F, Cl, Br, I) can serve as a family of KSL candidates. Most family members have the typical SmSI-type structure with a high symmetry of R (3) over barm, and rare-earth magnetic ions form an undistorted honeycomb lattice. The strong spin-orbit coupling of 4f electrons intrinsically offers anisotropic spin interactions as required by the Kitaev model. We have grown the crystals of YbOCl and synthesized the polycrystals of SmSI, ErOF, HoOF and DyOF, and made careful structural characterizations. We carry out magnetic and heat capacity measurements down to 1.8K and find no obvious magnetic transition in all the samples but DyOF. The van der Waals interlayer coupling highlights the true two-dimensionality of the family which is vital for the exact realization of Abelian/non-Abelian anyons, and the graphene-like feature will be a prominent advantage for developing miniaturized devices. The family is expected to act as an inspiring material platform for the exploration of KSL physics.

TI Open and Closed Loop Approaches for Energy Efficient Quantum Optimal
   Control
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB This research investigates the possibility of using quantum optimal control techniques to co-optimize the energetic cost and the process fidelity of a quantum unitary gate. The energetic cost is theoretically defined, and thereby, the gradient of the energetic cost for pulse engineering is derived. The Pareto optimality is empirically demonstrated in the trade-off between process fidelity and energetic cost. Thereafter, two novel numerical quantum optimal control approaches are proposed: i) energy-optimized gradient ascent pulse engineering (EO-GRAPE) as an open-loop gradient-based method, and ii) energy-optimized deep reinforcement learning for pulse engineering (EO-DRLPE) as a closed-loop method. The performance of both methods is probed in the presence of increasing noise. It is found that the EO-GRAPE method performs better than the EO-DRLPE methods with and without a warm start for most experimental settings. Additionally, for one qubit unitary gate, the correlation between the Bloch sphere path length and the energetic cost is illustrated.

TI Entangled quantum Stirling heat engine based on two particles Heisenberg
   model with Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction
SO FRONTIERS IN PHYSICS
AB Quantum heat engines have attracted significant attention in recent years due to their potential to surpass classical thermodynamic limits by leveraging quantum effects such as entanglement and coherence. In this study, we analyze a quantum Stirling heat engine characterized by a working substance composed of a two-particle Heisenberg model with Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) interaction under an external magnetic field. We investigate the impact of the antisymmetric interaction on the engine's efficiency across varying coupling parameters. Our findings demonstrate that the utilization of a two-qubit Heisenberg model in an entangled quantum Stirling heat engine can significantly enhance efficiency and performance. By optimizing the antisymmetric exchange parameters, we achieve substantial enhancements in engine efficiency, with results demonstrating that the efficiency attains remarkably high values compared to other cycles utilizing the same working substance. These enhancements are primarily influenced by the DM interaction and the entangled states of the working substance, leading to superior performance.

TI Quantum dimer models with Rydberg gadgets
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB The Rydberg blockade mechanism is an important ingredient in quantum simulators based on neutral atom arrays. It enables the emergence of a rich variety of quantum phases of matter, such as topological spin liquids. The typically isotropic nature of the blockade effect, however, restricts the range of natively accessible models and quantum states. In this work, we propose a method to systematically overcome this limitation, by developing gadgets, i.e., specific arrangements of atoms, that transform the underlying Rydberg blockade into more general constraints. We apply this technique to realize dimer models on square and triangular geometries. In these setups, we study the role of the quantum fluctuations induced by a coherent drive of the atoms and find signatures of U (1) and Z2 quantum spin liquid states in the respective ground states. Finally, we show that these states can be dynamically prepared with high fidelity, paving the way for the quantum simulation of a broader class of constrained models and topological matter in experiments with Rydberg atom arrays.

TI Measurement-induced phase transitions by matrix product states scaling
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB We study the time evolution of long quantum spin chains subjected to continuous monitoring projected on matrix product states (MPS) with fixed bond dimension, by means of the Time-Dependent Variational Principle (TDVP) algorithm. The latter gives an effective unitary evolution which approximates the real quantum evolution up to the projection error. We show that such error displays, at large times, a phase transition in the monitoring strength, which can be well detected by scaling analysis with relatively low values of bond dimensions. Moreover, in the presence of U (1) global spin charge, we show the existence of a charge-sharpening transition well separated from the entanglement transition which we detect by studying the charge fluctuations of a local subpart of the system at large times. Our work shows that quantum monitored dynamics projected on MPS manifolds contains relevant information on measurement-induced phase transitions and provides a new method to identify measured-induced phase transitions in systems of arbitrary dimensions and sizes.

TI Modelling assisted tunneling on the Bloch sphere using the Quantum
   Composer
SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB The Bloch sphere representation is a geometric model for all possible quantum states of a two-level system that can be used to describe the time dynamics of a qubit. As explicit application, we consider the time dynamics of a particle in a double-well potential. In particular, we adopt a recent method for off-resonant excitations, the so-called SUPER principle (Swing Up of the quantum emitter population) driven by periodic electromagnetic fields, to the context of quantum tunnelling. We show that the tunnelling probability can be enhanced significantly when an appropriate oscillation of the potential height is introduced. Driven by a collaborative approach we call educator-developer dialogue, an updated version of the software Quantum Composer is presented. For educational purposes, we map the two lowest energy states of the 1D-Schrodinger equation to the Bloch sphere representation, leading to a rather clear and intuitive physical picture for the pertinent time dynamics.

TI Exploring the relationship between the faithfulness and entanglement of
   two qubits
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB A conceptually simple and experimentally prevalent class of entanglement witnesses, known as fidelity witnesses, detects entanglement via a state's fidelity with a pure reference state. While existence proofs guarantee that a suitable witness can be constructed for every entangled state, such assurances do not apply to fidelity witnesses. Recent results have found that entangled states that cannot be detected by a fidelity witness, known as unfaithful states, are exceedingly common among bipartite states. In this paper, we show that even among two-qubit states, which are the simplest of all entangled states, unfaithful states can be created through a suitable application of decoherence and filtering to a Bell state. We also show that the faithfulness is not monotonic to entanglement, as measured by the concurrence. Finally, we experimentally verify our predictions using polarization-entangled photons, and specifically we demonstrate a situation in which an unfaithful state is brought to faithfulness at the expense of further reducing the entanglement of the state.

TI Tunable quantum light by modulated free electrons
SO NANOPHOTONICS
AB Nonclassical states of light are fundamental in various applications, spanning quantum computation to enhanced sensing. Fast free electrons, which emit light into photonic structures through the mechanism of spontaneous emission, represent a promising platform for generating diverse types of states. Indeed, the intrinsic connection between the input electron wave function and the output light field suggests that electron-shaping schemes, based on light-induced scattering, facilitate their synthesis. In this article, we present a theoretical framework capable of predicting the final optical density matrix emitted by a generic N-electron state that can also account for post-sample energy filtering. By using such a framework, we study the modulation-dependent fluctuations of the N-electron emission and identify regions of superradiant scaling characterized by Poissonian and super-Poissonian statistics. In this context, we predict that high-N modulated electron pulses can yield a tenfold shot-noise suppression in the estimation of the electron-light coupling when the output radiation intensity is analyzed. In the single-electron case, we show how coherent states with nearly 90 % purity can be formed by pre-filtering a portion of the spectrum after modulation, and how non-Gaussian states are generated after a precise energy measurement. Furthermore, we present a strategy combining a single-stage electron modulation and post-filtering to harness tailored light states, such as squeezed vacuum, cat, and triangular cat states, with fidelities close to 100 %.

TI Resonance from antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations for superconductivity
   in UTe2
SO NATURE
AB Superconductivity originates from the formation of bound (Cooper) pairs of electrons that can move through the lattice without resistance below the superconducting transition temperature T-c (ref. (1)). Electron Cooper pairs in most superconductors form anti-parallel spin singlets with total spin S = 0 (ref. (2)), although they can also form parallel spin-triplet Cooper pairs with S = 1 and an odd parity wavefunction(3). Spin-triplet pairing is important because it can host topological states and Majorana fermions relevant for quantum computation(4,5). Because spin-triplet pairing is usually mediated by ferromagnetic (FM) spin fluctuations(3), uranium-based materials near an FM instability are considered to be ideal candidates for realizing spin-triplet superconductivity(6). Indeed, UTe2, which has a T-c approximate to 1.6 K (refs.(7,8)), has been identified as a candidate for a chiral spin-triplet topological superconductor near an FM instability(7-14), although it also has antiferromagnetic (AF) spin fluctuations(15,16). Here we use inelastic neutron scattering (INS) to show that superconductivity in UTe2 is coupled to a sharp magnetic excitation, termed resonance(17-23), at the Brillouin zone boundary near AF order. Because the resonance has only been found in spin-singlet unconventional superconductors near an AF instability(17-23), its observation in UTe2 suggests that AF spin fluctuations may also induce spin-triplet pairing(24) or that electron pairing in UTe2 has a spin-singlet component.

TI Quantum Applications of an Atomic Ensemble Inside a Laser Cavity
SO PHOTONICS
AB Many quantum device signals are proportional to the number of the participating atoms that take part in the detection devices. Among these are optical magnetometers, atomic clocks, quantum communications and atom interferometers. One way to enhance the signal-to-noise ratio is to introduce atom entanglement that increases the signal in a super-radiant-like effect. A coherent em field inside a laser cavity is suggested to achieve atoms' correlation/entanglement. This may also play an important role in the basic quantum arena of many-body physics. An initial novel experiment to test the realization of atoms' correlation is described here. A Cs optical magnetometer is used as a tool to test the operation of a cell-in-cavity laser and its characteristics. A vapor cell is inserted into an elongated external cavity of the pump laser in Littrow configuration. Higher atom polarization and reduced laser linewidth are obtained leading to better magnetometer sensitivity and signal-to-noise ratio. The Larmor frequency changes of the Free Induction Decay of optically pumped Cs atomic polarization in the ambient earth magnetic field at room temperature is measured. Temporal changes in the magnetic field of less than 10 pT/root Hz are measured. The first-order dependence of the magnetic field on temperature and temperature gradients is eliminated, important in many practical applications. Single and gradiometric magnetometer configurations are presented.

TI A novel approach to analyze pion femtoscopy for particle emitting
   sources with Bose-Einstein condensation
SO RESULTS IN PHYSICS
AB Quantum correlations at higher-order were measured in lead-lead collisions at the world largest collider, and a substantial suppression was reported while measuring the three and four pions interferences. The fraction of coherence owing to pion generation in collisions of heavy ions at extreme energies can be investigated along with this suppression. We show and examine pions excretion from a dispersion grouping of droplets using Bose-Einstein condensation which influences the multi-pion correlations to study the structure of the sources as well as the peculiarities of the coherence fraction in collisions at higher energy. We surmised that pions appear to be the preeminent contender for coherence fractions in the following sequence and the correlation functions resulted in the creation of a composite phase of partons-hadronic matter. The main contribution of this research is that we explore the sequences of three and four particles correlations as well as the genuine correlations carried out to probe the fraction of pions condensation during the collisions of heavy nuclei employing a granular structured source. We perceived the considerable difference in the normalized correlations functions between two sources at various droplets number and coherence fractions with this unique technique. We also compared our model results to the scientific results and obtained the coherent fraction which is consistent with the experimental data.

TI Electric-Field-Tunable Spin-Orbit Gap in a Bilayer
   Graphene/WSe2 Quantum Dot
SO NANO LETTERS
AB We report on the investigation of proximity-induced spin-orbit coupling (SOC) in a heterostructure of bilayer graphene (BLG) and tungsten diselenide (WSe2). A BLG quantum dot (QD) in the few-particle regime acts as a sensitive probe for induced SOC. Finite bias and magnetotransport spectroscopy measurements reveal a significantly enhanced SOC that decreases with the applied displacement field, distinguishing it from pristine BLG. Furthermore, our measurements demonstrate a reduced valley g factor at larger displacement fields, consistent with weaker lateral confinement of the QD. Our findings show evidence of the influence of WSe2 across BLG layers, driven by reduced real-space confinement and increased layer localization of the QD states on the BLG layer distant to the WSe2 at higher displacement fields. This study demonstrates the electrostatic tunability of the spin-orbit gap in BLG/WSe2 heterostructures, which is especially relevant for the field of spintronics and future spin qubit control in BLG QDs.

TI Controlled bidirectional quantum secure direct communication with
   hyperentangled Bell states
SO PHYSICA SCRIPTA
AB This paper presents a groundbreaking protocol for controlled bidirectional quantum secure direct communication based on hyperentangled Bell states, involving two longitudinal momentum and polarization degrees of freedom. In this protocol, the controller Charlie governs bidirectional communication between two legitimate participants. Participants encode their secret messages using 64 unitary operations. However, without Charlie's permission, specifically without publishing the final measurement results, participants cannot exchange secret messages. Security analysis are conducted to prevent eavesdropper Eve from obtaining users' secret messages through illegitimate means. Compared with previously proposed controlled bidirectional quantum secure direct communication, the proposed protocol significantly improves transmission efficiency because each pair of photons can transmit 12 bits of classical information. The protocol achieves a remarkable qubit efficiency, reaching up to 85.7%. However, when we don't take into account the number of qubits consumed by the decoy particles, we can theoretically achieve an efficiency of 200%.

TI The Quantum Zeno Capacity and Dynamic Evolution Mode of a Quantum System
SO ENTROPY
AB The quantum Zeno effect (QZE) is widely employed in quantum engineering due to the issue of frequent measurements freezing a quantum system. In this study, the quantum Zeno factor is introduced to characterize the quantum Zeno capacity of a quantum system. The quantum Zeno factor reveals that the quantum Zeno effect is dependent on the evolution mode of quantum states, which is semi-irrelevant to conventional energy uncertainty and extends the QZE domain. The Zeno factor provides a new consideration to qualify the (anti-)Zeno capacity of a quantum system for its applications: a large quantum Zeno factor value indicates that a quantum system is of a QZE quality. The numerical results of the quantum Zeno capacity are shown using two typical examples: tailing the dynamic evolution modes using the quantum Zeno factor in a three-level system, and quantifying the message exchange between qubits in a coupled qubit system using a quantum Zeno factor.

TI Cyclically Operated Microwave Single-Photon Counter with Sensitivity of
   10-22 W/√Hz
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB Single -photon detection played an important role in the development of quantum optics. Its implementation in the microwave domain is challenging because the photon energy is five orders of magnitude smaller. In recent years, significant progress has been made in developing single microwave photon detectors (SMPDs) based on superconducting quantum bits or bolometers. In this paper we present a practical SMPD based on the irreversible transfer of an incoming photon to the excited state of a transmon qubit by a four -wave mixing process. This device achieves a detection efficiency eta = 0.43 and an operational dark count rate alpha = 85 s-1, mainly due to the out -of -equilibrium microwave photons in the input line. The corresponding power sensitivity is S = 10-22 W/root Hz, one order of magnitude lower than the state of the art. The detector operates continuously over hour time -scales with a duty cycle eta D = 0.84, and offers frequency tunability of at least 50 MHz around 7 GHz.

TI Parametrically amplified nonreciprocal magnon laser in a hybrid cavity
   optomagnonical system
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB We propose a scheme to achieve a tunable nonreciprocal magnon laser with parametric amplification in a hybrid cavity optomagnonical system, which consists a yttrium iron garnet (YIG) sphere and a spinning resonator. We demonstrate the control of magnon laser can be enhanced via parametric amplification, which make easier and more convenient to control the magnon laser. Moreover, we analyze and evaluate the effects of pump light input direction and amplification amplitude on the magnon gain and laser threshold power. The results indicate that we can obtian a higher magnon gain and a broader range of threshold power of the magnon laser. In our scheme both the nonreciprocity and magnon gain of the magnon laser can be increased significantly. Our proposal provides a way to obtain a novel nonreciprocal magnon laser and offers new possibilities for both nonreciprocal optics and spin -electronics applications.

AB We want to understand how relaxation process from an initial non-generic state proceeds towards a long-time typical state reached under unitary quantum evolution. One would expect that after some initial correlation time relaxation will be a simple exponential decay with constant decay rate. We show that this is not necessarily the case. Studying various Floquet systems with fixed two-qubit gates, and focusing on purity and out-of-time-ordered correlation functions, we find that in many situations relaxation proceeds in two phases of exponential decay having different relaxation rates. Namely, in the thermodynamic limit the relaxation rate exhibits a change at a critical time proportional to system's size. The initial thermodynamically relevant rate can be slower or faster than the asymptotic one, demonstrating that the recently discovered phantom relaxation, in which the decay is slower than predicted by a nonzero transfer matrix gap, is not limited to only random circuits.

TI Coherent Control of Collective Spontaneous Emission through
   Self-Interference
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB As one of the central topics in quantum optics, collective spontaneous emission such as superradiance has been realized in a variety of systems. This Letter proposes an innovative scheme to coherently control collective emission rates via a self-interference mechanism in a nonlinear waveguide setting. The self-interference is made possible by photon backward scattering incurred by quantum scatterers in a waveguide working as quantum switches. Whether the interference is constructive or destructive is found to depend strongly on the distance between the scatterers and the emitters. The interference between two propagation pathways of the same photon leads to controllable superradiance and subradiance, with their collective decay rates much enhanced or suppressed (also leading to hyperradiance or population trapping). Furthermore, the self-interference mechanism is manifested by an abrupt change in the emission rates in real time. An experimental setup based on superconducting transmission line resonators and transmon qubits is further proposed to realize controllable collective emission rates.

TI Quantum phase transition of light in the dissipative Rabi-Hubbard
   lattice: A dressed-master-equation perspective
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB In this work, we investigate the quantum phase transition of light in the dissipative Rabi-Hubbard lattice under the framework of the mean-field theory and quantum dressed master equation. The order parameter of photons in strong qubit-photon coupling regime is derived analytically both at zero and low temperatures. Interestingly, we can locate the localization and delocalization phase transition very well in a wide parameter region. In particular for the zero-temperature limit, the critical tunneling strength approaches zero generally in the deep-strong qubitphoton coupling regime, regardless of the quantum dissipation. This is contrary to the previous results with the finite minimal critical tunneling strength based on the standard Lindblad master equation. Moreover, a significant improvement of the critical tunneling is also observed at finite temperature, compared with the counterpart under the Lindblad description. We hope these results may deepen the understanding of the phase transition of photons in the Rabi-Hubbard model.

TI The quantum Zeno and anti-Zeno effects with driving fields in the weak
   and strong coupling regimes
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Repeated measurements in quantum mechanics can freeze (the quantum Zeno effect) or enhance (the quantum anti-Zeno effect) the time-evolution of a quantum system. In this paper, we present a general treatment of the quantum Zeno and anti-Zeno effects for arbitrary driven open quantum systems, assuming only that the system-environment coupling is weak. In particular, we obtain a general expression for the effective decay rate of a two-level system subjected to arbitrary driving fields as well as periodic measurements. We demonstrate that the driving fields change the decay rate, and hence the quantum Zeno and anti-Zeno behavior, both qualitatively and quantitatively. We also extend our results to systems consisting of more than one two-level system, as well as a two-level system strongly coupled to an environment of harmonic oscillators, to further illustrate the non-trivial effect of the driving fields on the quantum Zeno and anti-Zeno effects.

TI Simulating an exact one-dimensional transverse Ising model in an optical
   lattice
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB A spinless Bose-Hubbard model in a one-dimensional (1D) double-chain tilted lattice is numerically studied at unit filling per cell. When each atom is localized in a two-site cell, the low-energy effective model gives rise to an exact textbook model of the 1D transverse Ising model via superexchange interaction. To validate the effective transverse Ising model, we calculate the energy spectrum and the nearest-neighbor correlation functions of the states in a subspace of the Bose-Hubbard model which is equivalent to the Hilbert space of a spin-1/2 magnetic model. The results show good consistency with the effective transverse Ising model, and we show that it is possible to simulate the dynamical quantum phase transition of the 1D transverse Ising model exactly with such a double-chain Bose-Hubbard model. Our results may provide some inspirations for realizing and exploring an exact 1D transverse Ising model in ultracold neutral atom systems.

TI Dark matter search with a resonantly-coupled hybrid spin system
SO REPORTS ON PROGRESS IN PHYSICS
AB Recent advances in tabletop quantum sensor technology have enabled searches for nongravitational interactions of dark matter (DM). Traditional axion DM experiments rely on sharp resonance, resulting in extensive scanning time to cover a wide mass range. In this work, we present a broadband approach in an alkali- 21 Ne spin system. We identify two distinct hybrid spin-coupled regimes: a self-compensation regime at low frequencies and a hybrid spin resonance regime at higher frequencies. By utilizing these two distinct regimes, we significantly enhance the bandwidth of 21 Ne nuclear spin compared to conventional nuclear magnetic resonance, while maintaining competitive sensitivity. We present a comprehensive broadband search for axion-like DM, covering 5 orders of magnitude of Compton frequencies range within [10-2,103] Hz. We set new constraints on the axion DM interactions with neutrons and protons, accounting for the effects of DM stochasticity. For the axion-neutron coupling, our results reach a low value of |gann|<= 3x10-10 in the frequency range [2x10-2,4] Hz surpassing astrophysical limits and providing the strongest laboratory constraints in the [10,100] Hz range. For the axion-proton coupling, we offer the best terrestrial constraints for the frequency ranges [2x10-2,5] Hz and [16,7x102] Hz.

TI Parametrization and optimizability of pulse-level variational quantum
   eigensolvers
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB In conventional variational quantum eigensolvers (VQEs), trial states are prepared by applying series of parametrized gates to a reference state, with the gate parameters being varied to minimize the energy of the target system. Recognizing that the gates are intermediates, which are ultimately compiled into a set of control pulses to be applied to each qubit in the lab, the recently proposed ctrl-VQE algorithm takes the amplitudes, frequencies, and phases of the pulse as the variational parameters used to minimize the molecular energy. In this work, we explore how all 3 degrees of freedom interrelate with one another. To this end, we consider several distinct strategies to parametrize the control pulses, assessing each one through numerical simulations of a transmonlike device. For each parametrization, we contrast the pulse duration required to prepare a good ansatz, and the difficulty to optimize that ansatz from a well-defined initial state. We deduce several guiding heuristics to implement practical ctrl-VQE in hardware, which we anticipate will generalize for generic device architectures.

TI Geometric discord of tripartite quantum systems
SO CHINESE PHYSICS B
AB We study the quantification of geometric discord for tripartite quantum systems. Firstly, we obtain the analytic formula of geometric discord for tripartite pure states. It is already known that the geometric discord of pure states reduces to the geometric entanglement in bipartite systems, the results presented here show that this property is no longer true in tripartite systems. Furthermore, we provide an operational meaning for tripartite geometric discord by linking it to quantum state discrimination, that is, we prove that the geometric discord of tripartite states is equal to the minimum error probability to discriminate a set of quantum states with von Neumann measurement. Lastly, we calculate the geometric discord of three-qubit Bell diagonal states and then investigate the dynamic behavior of tripartite geometric discord under local decoherence. It is interesting that the frozen phenomenon exists for geometric discord in this scenario.

TI Spin-momentum locking and quantum anomalous Hall effect in d plus
   id-density wave ordered pseudo gap phase of Bi2212
SO CHINESE JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB We model Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+delta (Bi2212) bilayer system by a time reversal symmetry (TRS) and inversion symmetry (IS) broken Bloch Hamiltonian H. The pseudo-gap phase of the bilayer is assumed to be chiral d-density wave ordered. One of the focal points of the paper is the theoretical study of the spin-momentum locking (SML), due to the presence of a strong spin-orbit coupling in Bi2212, reported earlier in this phase in a spin-and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopic measurement. The non-trivial spin texture in k-space, which is an outcome of the broken IS for the bilayer system, is found tuneable by electric field (and also by intercalation). We also show that this system exhibits anomalous quantum Hall effect due to the broken TRS and the presence of a strong spin-orbit coupling.

TI Which bath Hamiltonians matter for thermal operations?
SO JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL PHYSICS
AB In this article, we explore the set of thermal operations from a mathematical and topological point of view. First, we introduce the concept of Hamiltonians with a resonant spectrum with respect to some reference Hamiltonian, followed by proving that when defining thermal operations, it suffices to only consider bath Hamiltonians, which satisfy this resonance property. Next, we investigate the continuity of the set of thermal operations in certain parameters, such as energies of the system and temperature of the bath. We will see that the set of thermal operations changes discontinuously with respect to the Hausdorff metric at any Hamiltonian, which has the so-called degenerate Bohr spectrum, regardless of the temperature. Finally, we find a semigroup representation of (enhanced) thermal operations in two dimensions by characterizing any such operation via three real parameters, thus allowing for a visualization of this set. Using this, in the qubit case, we show commutativity of (enhanced) thermal operations and convexity of thermal operations without the closure. The latter is done by specifying the elements of this set exactly.

TI Work extraction from coherently activated maps via quantum switch
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We characterize the impact that the application of two maps in a quantum-controlled order has on the process of work extraction via unitary cycles and its optimization. The control is based on the quantum switch model that applies maps in an order not necessarily compatible with the underlying causal structure and, in principle, can be implemented experimentally. First, we show that the activation of quantum maps through the quantum switch model always entails a non-negative gain in ergotropy compared to their consecutive application. We also establish a condition that the maps should fulfill in order to achieve a nonzero ergotropic gain. We then perform a thorough analysis of maps applied to a two-level system and provide general conditions for achieving a positive gain on the incoherent part of ergotropy. Our results are illustrated with several examples and applied to qubit and d-dimensional quantum systems. In particular, we demonstrate that a nonzero work can be extracted from a system thermalized by two coherently controlled reservoirs.

TI Quantum consensus dynamics by entangling Maxwell demon
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB We introduce a Maxwell demon which generates many-body entanglement robustly against bit-flip noises, allowing us to obtain quantum advantage. Adopting the protocol of the voter model used for opinion dynamics approaching consensus, the demon randomly selects a qubit pair and performs a quantum feedback control, in continuous repetitions. We derive upper bounds for the entropy reduction and the work extraction rates by the demon's operation. These bounds are determined by a competition between the quantum-classical mutual information acquired by the demon and the absolute irreversibility of the feedback control. Our finding of the upper bounds corresponds to a reformulation of the second law of thermodynamics under a class of Maxwell demon which generates many-body entanglement in a working substance. This suggests that a general condition for the operation of a successful entangling demon, one for which many-body entanglement stabilization and work extraction are possible, is that the information gain is larger than the absolute irreversibility.

AB This paper reports the experimental characterization and modelling of a stand-alone StrongARM comparator at both room temperature (RT) and cryogenic temperature (4.2 K). The observed 6-dB improvement in the comparator input noise at 4.2 K is attributed to the reduction of the thermal noise and to the suppressed shot noise in the MOS transistors becoming dominant at cryogenic temperature. The proposed model is employed in the design of a loop-unrolled 2 x time-interleaved 1-GSa/s 7b SAR ADC for spin-qubit readout. As predicted by the comparator model, the ADC is noise-limited at RT to a SNDR of 38.2 dB at Nyquist input, while this improves to 41.1 dB at 4.2 K, now limited by distortion, thus resulting in the state-of-the-art FoMw for cryo-CMOS ADC of 20.9 fJ/conv-step.

TI Weighted Bures length uncovers quantum state sensitivity
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW E
AB The unitarity of quantum evolutions implies that an overlap between two initial states does not change in time. This property is commonly believed to explain the apparent lack of state sensitivity in quantum theory, a feature that is prevailing in classical chaotic systems. However, classical state sensitivity is based on a distance between two trajectories in phase space which is a completely different mathematical concept than an overlap between two vectors in Hilbert space. It is possible that state sensitivity in quantum theory can be detected with the help of some special metric. Here we show that the recently introduced Weighted Bures length achieves this task. We numerically investigate a unitary cellular automaton of N interacting qubits and analyze how a single-qubit perturbation affects the evolution of WBL between the unperturbed and perturbed states. We observe a linear growth of WBL if the qubits are arranged into a cyclic graph and an exponential growth if they are arranged into a random bipartite graph.

TI Quantum Nondemolition Dispersive Readout of a Superconducting Artificial
   Atom Using Large Photon Numbers
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB Reading out the state of superconducting artificial atoms typically relies on dispersive coupling to a readout resonator. For a given system noise temperature, increasing the circulating photon number n & macr; in the resonator enables a shorter measurement time and is therefore expected to reduce readout errors caused by spontaneous atom transitions. However, increasing n & macr; is generally observed to also monotonously increase these transition rates. Here we present a fluxonium artificial atom in which, despite the fact that the measured transition rates show nonmonotonous fluctuations within a factor of 6, for photon numbers up to n & macr; asymptotic to 200, the signal-to-noise ratio continuously improves with increasing n & macr;. Even without the use of a parametric amplifier, at n & macr; = 74, we achieve fidelities of 99% and 93% for feedback-assisted ground and excited state preparations, respectively. At higher n & macr;, leakage outside the qubit computational space can no longer be neglected and it limits the fidelity of quantum state preparation.

TI Optical Phenomena in Molecule-Based Magnetic Materials
SO CHEMICAL REVIEWS
AB Since the last century, we have witnessed the development of molecular magnetism which deals with magnetic materials based on molecular species, i.e., organic radicals and metal complexes. Among them, the broadest attention was devoted to molecule-based ferro-/ferrimagnets, spin transition materials, including those exploring electron transfer, molecular nanomagnets, such as single-molecule magnets (SMMs), molecular qubits, and stimuli-responsive magnetic materials. Their physical properties open the application horizons in sensors, data storage, spintronics, and quantum computation. It was found that various optical phenomena, such as thermochromism, photoswitching of magnetic and optical characteristics, luminescence, nonlinear optical and chiroptical effects, as well as optical responsivity to external stimuli, can be implemented into molecule-based magnetic materials. Moreover, the fruitful interactions of these optical effects with magnetism in molecule-based materials can provide new physical cross-effects and multifunctionality, enriching the applications in optical, electronic, and magnetic devices. This Review aims to show the scope of optical phenomena generated in molecule-based magnetic materials, including the recent advances in such areas as high-temperature photomagnetism, optical thermometry utilizing SMMs, optical addressability of molecular qubits, magneto-chiral dichroism, and opto-magneto-electric multifunctionality. These findings are discussed in the context of the types of optical phenomena accessible for various classes of molecule-based magnetic materials.

TI Functional tensor network solving many-body Schrodinger equation
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB Solving the many-body Schrodinger equation in continuous spaces with the presence of strong correlations is an extremely important and challenging issue in quantum physics. In this work, we propose the functional tensor network (FTN) approach to solve the many-body Schrodinger equation. Provided the orthonormal functional bases, we represent the coefficients of the many-body wave function as a tensor network. The observables, such as energy, can be calculated simply by tensor contractions. Simulating the ground state becomes solving a minimization problem defined by the tensor network. An efficient gradient-decent algorithm based on automatically differentiable tensors is proposed. We here take the matrix product state (MPS), whose complexity scales only linearly with the system size, as an example. We apply our approach to solve the ground state of coupled harmonic oscillators and achieve high accuracy by comparing our results with the exact solutions. Reliable results are also given in the presence of three-body interactions, where the system cannot be decoupled from isolated oscillators. Our approach is simple and, with well-controlled error, essentially different from highly nonlinear neural-network solvers. Our work extends the applications of the tensor network from quantum lattice models to systems in continuous space. The FTN can be used as a general solver of the differential equations with many variables. The MPS exemplified here can be generalized to, e.g., fermionic tensor networks to solve the electronic Schrodinger equation.

TI Shared purity and concurrence of a mixture of ground and low-lying
   excited states as indicators of quantum phase transitions
SO PHYSICA SCRIPTA
AB We investigate the efficacy of shared purity, a measure of quantum correlation that is independent of the separability-entanglement paradigm, as a quantum phase transition indicator in comparison with concurrence, a bipartite entanglement measure. The order parameters are investigated for thermal states and pseudo-thermal states, of the systems considered. In the case of the one-dimensional J 1 - J 2 Heisenberg quantum spin model and the one-dimensional transverse-field quantum Ising model, shared purity turns out to be as effective as concurrence in indicating quantum phase transitions. In the two-dimensional J 1 - J 2 Heisenberg quantum spin model, shared purity indicates the two quantum phase transitions present in the model, while concurrence detects only one of them. Moreover, we find diverging finite-size scaling exponents for the order parameters near the transitions in odd- and even-sized systems governed by the one-dimensional J 1 - J 2 model, as had previously been reported for quantum spins on odd- and even-legged ladders. It is plausible that the divergence is related to a Mobius strip-like boundary condition required for odd-sized systems, while for even-sized systems, the usual periodic boundary condition is sufficient.

TI Domain formation and structural stabilities in mixed-species Coulomb
   crystals induced by sympathetically cooled highly charged ions
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB There is a growing interest in high-precision spectroscopy and frequency metrology for fundamental studies using sympathetically cooled highly charged ions (HCIs) embedded in Coulomb crystals of laser-cooled ions. In order to understand how their strong repulsion affects the crystal structure and dynamics, we study the thermal motion and rearrangement of small mixed linear and homogeneous crystals by both measurements and simulations. Cocrystallized HCIs form superlattices and divide the crystal into domains, where different reordering rates, melting points, and localized phase transitions are observed due to decoupling of motional modes across boundaries. These results improve our understanding of homogeneous and inhomogeneous ion strings over a wide range of charge-to-mass ratios. This allows us to test our own simulations of the dynamic behavior of ion strings and gives us confidence in their suitability for applications related to quantum simulation as well as computing and the search for new physics.

TI Many-Body Radiative Decay in Strongly Interacting Rydberg Ensembles br
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB When atoms are excited to high-lying Rydberg states they interact strongly with dipolar forces. Theresulting state-dependent level shifts allow us to study many-body systems displaying intriguingnonequilibrium phenomena, such as constrained spin systems, and are at the heart of numeroustechnological applications, e.g., in quantum simulation and computation platforms. Here, we show thatthese interactions also have a significant impact on dissipative effects caused by the inevitable coupling ofRydberg atoms to the surrounding electromagnetic field. We demonstrate that their presence modifies thefrequency of the photons emitted from the Rydberg atoms, making it dependent on the local neighborhoodof the emitting atom. Interactions among Rydberg atoms thus turn spontaneous emission into a many-bodyprocess which manifests, in a thermodynamically consistent Markovian setting, in the emergence ofcollective jump operators in the quantum master equation governing the dynamics. We discuss how thiscollective dissipation-stemming from a mechanism different from the much studied superradiance andsubradiance-accelerates decoherence and affects dissipative phase transitions in Rydberg ensembles

TI Physical limits of natural computation as the biological constraints of
   morphogenesis, evolution, and consciousness: On the 100th anniversary of
   Efim Liberman (1925-2011)
SO BIOSYSTEMS
AB Efim Liberman (1925-2011) introduced in 1972 the idea of natural computation realized internally by living systems. He considered the physical principles employed by living systems as essential constraints that limit the computational process occurring in the course of adaptation, morphogenesis, and neural activity. The most general limits determined by the physical fundamental constants are universal for all nature. However, the more specific constraints are intrinsic to each biological system and can be overcome in the course of the evolutionary process. We discuss the roles of biological macromolecules, particularly the cytoskeleton, in shaping the actualization patterns formed in the internal measurement process occurring in living systems. Cytoskeletal rearrangements determine cellular, morphogenetic, and perceptive transformations in living systems and participate in the combinatorial genetic events that lead to evolutionary transformations. The operation of neurons is based on the transmission of signals via the cytoskeleton, where the digital output is generated that can be decoded through a reflexive action of the perceiving agent. It is concluded that the principles of natural computation formulated by Liberman represent the most fundamental feature of living beings and form the basis for the general theory of biological systems, with essential consequences for understanding metabolic closure, morphogenesis, evolution, and consciousness.

TI Anomalous cooling of bosons by dimensional reduction
SO SCIENCE ADVANCES
AB Cold atomic gases provide a remarkable testbed to study the physics of interacting many-body quantum systems. Temperatures are necessarily nonzero, but cooling to the ultralow temperatures needed for quantum simulation purposes or even simply measuring the temperatures directly on the system can prove to be very challenging tasks. Here, we implement thermometry on strongly interacting two- and one-dimensional Bose gases with high sensitivity in the nanokelvin temperature range. Our method is aided by the fact that the decay of the first-order correlation function is very sensitive to the temperature when interactions are strong. We find that there may be a substantial temperature variation when the three-dimensional quantum gas is cut into two-dimensional slices or into one-dimensional tubes. Notably, the temperature for the one-dimensional case can be much lower than the initial temperature. Our findings show that this decrease results from the interplay of dimensional reduction and strong interactions.

TI Ultracold ion-atomexperiments: cooling, chemistry, and quantum effects
SO ADVANCES IN ATOMIC, MOLECULAR, AND OPTICAL PHYSICS, VOL. 71
SE Advances In Atomic Molecular and Optical Physics
AB Experimental setups that study laser-cooled ions immersed in baths of ultracold atoms merge the two exciting and well-established fields of quantum gases and trapped ions. These experiments benefit both from the exquisite read-out and control of the few-body ion systems as well as the many-body aspects, tunable interactions, and ultracold temperatures of the atoms. However, combining the two leads to challenges both in the experimental design and the physics that can be studied. Nevertheless, these systems have provided insights into ion-atom collisions, buffer gas cooling of ions and quantum effects in the ion-atom interaction. This makes them promising candidates for ultracold quantum chemistry studies, creation of cold molecular ions for spectroscopy and precision measurements, and as test beds for quantum simulation of charged impurity physics. In this review we aim to provide an experimental account of recent progress and introduce the experimental setup and techniques that enabled the observation of quantum effects.

TI Coherence, Transport, and Chaos in 1D Bose-Hubbard Model: Disorder vs.
   Stark Potential
SO FORTSCHRITTE DER PHYSIK-PROGRESS OF PHYSICS
AB Quantum coherence and phase transitions are studied in a finite one-dimensional Bose-Hubbard model using exact diagonalization under thermal fluctuations, a Stark potential, and disorder. The condensate fraction, superfluid fraction, visibility, number fluctuations, and the -norm of coherence are computed to characterize the Mott insulator-superfluid transition. Although finite-size effects prevent a sharp transition, ground-state properties reveal signatures of quantum criticality. Thermal fluctuations can enhance coherence via tunneling, a Stark potential promotes localization, and disorder suppresses global superfluidity while preserving local coherence. These results highlight how disorder, tilt, and temperature reshape coherence and offer insights for quantum simulation and strongly correlated phases. For systems up to six sites with unit filling, a spectral analysis is also performed through the metric mean gap ratio (MGR). However, limited statistics due to the small system size and computational constraints prevent a complete characterization of quantum chaos, yielding only approximate signatures.

TI Quantum superpositions of current states in Rydberg-atom networks
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Quantum simulation of many-body quantum systems using Rydberg-atom platforms has become of extreme interest in the last years. The possibility to realize spin Hamiltonians and the accurate control at the single atom level paved the way for the study of quantum phases of matter and dynamics. Here, we propose a quantum optimal control protocol to engineer current states: quantum states characterized by Rydberg excitations propagating in a given spatially closed tweezer networks. Indeed, current states with different winding numbers can be generated on demand. Besides those ones with single winding number, superposition of quantum current states characterized by more winding numbers can be obtained. The single current states are eigenstates of the current operator that therefore can define an observable that remains persistent at any time. In particular, the features of the excitations dynamics reflects the nature of current states, a fact that in principle can be used to characterize the nature of the flow experimentally without the need of accessing high order correlators.

TI Superfluid vortices in four spatial dimensions
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Quantum vortices in superfluids have been an important research area for many decades. Naturally, research on this topic has focused on two-dimensional (2D) and 3D superfluids, in which vortex cores form points and lines, respectively. Very recently, however, there has been growing interest in the quantum simulation of systems with four spatial dimensions; this raises the question of how vortices would behave in a higher-dimensional superfluid. In this paper, we begin to establish the phenomenology of vortices in 4D superfluids under rotation, where the vortex core can form a plane. In 4D, the most generic type of rotation is a "double rotation" with two angles (or frequencies). We show, by solving the Gross-Pitaevskii equation, that the simplest case of equal-frequency double rotation can stabilize a pair of vortex planes intersecting at a point. This opens up a wide number of future research topics, including into realistic experimental models; unequal-frequency double rotations; the stability and potential reconnection dynamics of intersecting vortex surfaces; and the possibility of closed vortex surfaces.

TI Quantum secret sharing protocol through noisy channel with application

SO CONCURRENCY AND COMPUTATION-PRACTICE & EXPERIENCE
AB This study presents a quantum secret sharing (QSS) protocol designed using Grover's search algorithm in a noisy environment. The proposed protocol utilizes Grover's three-particle quantum state. The proposed scheme is divided into secret information sharing and eavesdropping checking. The dealer prepares an encoded state by encoding the classical information as a marked state and shares the states' qubits between three participants. Using the amplitude-damping noise and the phase-damping noise as conventional noisy channels, it can be demonstrated that secret information can be conveyed between participants with some information lost. The security analysis shows the scheme is stringent against malicious participants or eavesdroppers. The simulation analysis is done on the cloud platform IBM-QE thereby showing the practical feasibility of the scheme. Finally, an application of the proposed scheme is demonstrated in visual cryptography using the GNEQR representation of images.

TI Tuning Long-Range Fermion-Mediated Interactions in Cold-Atom Quantum
   Simulators
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Engineering long-range interactions in cold-atom quantum simulators can lead to exotic quantum many -body behavior. Fermionic atoms in ultracold atomic mixtures can act as mediators, giving rise to long-range Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida-type interactions characterized by the dimensionality and density of the fermionic gas. Here, we propose several tuning knobs, accessible in current experimental platforms, that allow one to further control the range and shape of the mediated interactions, extending the existing quantum simulation toolbox. In particular, we include an additional optical lattice for the fermionic mediator, as well as anisotropic traps to change its dimensionality in a continuous manner. This allows us to interpolate between power-law and exponential decays, introducing an effective cutoff for the interaction range, as well as to tune the relative interaction strengths at different distances. Finally, we show how our approach allows one to investigate frustrated regimes that were not previously accessible, where symmetry -protected topological phases as well as chiral spin liquids emerge.

TI Thermally induced entanglement of atomic oscillators
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Laser cooled ions trapped in a linear Paul trap are long-standing ideal candidates for realizing quantum simulation, especially of many-body systems. The properties that contribute to this also provide the opportunity to demonstrate unexpected quantum phenomena in few-body systems. A pair of ions interacting in such traps exchange vibrational quanta through the Coulomb interaction. This linear interaction can be anharmonically modulated by an elementary coupling to the internal two-level structure of one of the ions. Driven by thermal energy in the passively coupled oscillators, which are themselves coupled to the internal ground states of the ions, the nonlinear interaction autonomously and unconditionally generates entanglement between the mechanical modes of the ions. We examine this counter-intuitive thermally induced entanglement for several experimentally feasible model systems and propose parameter regimes where state-of-the-art trapped ion systems can produce such phenomena. In addition, we demonstrate a multiqubit enhancement of such thermally induced entanglements. (C) 2022 Optica Publishing Group under the terms of the Optica Open Access Publishing Agreement

TI Time-crystalline eigenstate order on a quantum processor
SO NATURE
AB Quantum many-body systems display rich phase structure in their low-temperature equilibrium states(1). However, much of nature is not in thermal equilibrium. Remarkably, it was recently predicted that out-of-equilibrium systems can exhibit novel dynamical phases(2-8) that may otherwise be forbidden by equilibrium thermodynamics, a paradigmatic example being the discrete time crystal (DTC)(7,9-15). Concretely, dynamical phases can be defined in periodically driven many-body-localized (MBL) systems via the concept of eigenstate order(7,16,17). In eigenstate-ordered MBL phases, the entire many-body spectrum exhibits quantum correlations and long-range order, with characteristic signatures in late-time dynamics from all initial states. It is, however, challenging to experimentally distinguish such stable phases from transient phenomena, or from regimes in which the dynamics of a few select states can mask typical behaviour. Here we implement tunable controlled-phase (CPHASE) gates on an array of superconducting qubits to experimentally observe an MBL-DTC and demonstrate its characteristic spatiotemporal response for generic initial states(7,9,10). Our work employs a time-reversal protocol to quantify the impact of external decoherence, and leverages quantum typicality to circumvent the exponential cost of densely sampling the eigenspectrum. Furthermore, we locate the phase transition out of the DTC with an experimental finite-size analysis. These results establish a scalable approach to studying non-equilibrium phases of matter on quantum processors.

TI Quantum simulations for strong-field QED
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
AB Quantum field theory in the presence of strong background fields contains interesting problems where quantum computers may someday provide a valuable computational resource. In the noisy intermediate -scale quantum era it is useful to consider simpler benchmark problems in order to develop feasible approaches, identify critical limitations of current hardware, and build new simulation tools. Here we perform quantum simulations of strong -field QED (SFQED) in 3 + 1 dimensions, using real-time nonlinear Breit -Wheeler pair production as a prototypical process. The strong -field QED Hamiltonian is derived and truncated in the FurryVolkov mode expansion, and the interactions relevant for Breit -Wheeler are transformed into a quantum circuit. Quantum simulations of a "null double slit" experiment are found to agree well with classical simulations following the application of various error mitigation strategies, including an asymmetric depolarization algorithm which we develop and adapt to the case of Trotterization with a time -dependent Hamiltonian. We also discuss longer -term goals for the quantum simulation of SFQED.

TI Experimental Realization of the Rabi-Hubbard Model with Trapped Ions
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Quantum simulation provides important tools in studying strongly correlated many-body systems with controllable parameters. As a hybrid of two fundamental models in quantum optics and in condensed matter physics, the Rabi-Hubbard model demonstrates rich physics through the competition between local spin-boson interactions and long-range boson hopping. Here, we report an experimental realization of the Rabi-Hubbard model using up to 16 trapped ions and present a controlled study of its equilibrium properties and quantum dynamics. We observe the ground-state quantum phase transition by slowly quenching the coupling strength, and measure the quantum dynamical evolution in various parameter regimes. With the magnetization and the spin-spin correlation as probes, we verify the prediction of the model Hamiltonian by comparing theoretical results in small system sizes with experimental observations. For larger-size systems of 16 ions and 16 phonon modes, the effective Hilbert space dimension exceeds 257, whose dynamics is intractable for classical supercomputers.

TI Chirality-Induced Spin Selectivity in II-VI and III-V Semiconductor
   Nanocrystals: Mechanism, Manipulation, and Application
SO ADVANCED OPTICAL MATERIALS
AB Chirality-induced spin selectivity (CISS) enables spin-polarized charge transport through chiral media without magnetic fields. While extensively studied in organic and biomolecular systems, CISS in semiconductors remains limited, lacking standardized methodologies and mechanistic understanding. II-VI and III-V semiconductor nanocrystals (NCs), with tunable band gaps, high optical quality, strong spin-orbit coupling (SOC) and diverse morphologies, provide an ideal platform for exploring spin-dependent phenomena. This review highlights fundamental concepts of chirality and its manifestation in nanostructures, distinguishing ligand-induced and intrinsic chirality in NCs. This work critically integrates recent advances on the microscopic link between chirality and spin selectivity, emphasizing mechanisms such as exciton-ligand hybridization, and surface/bulk inversion asymmetries that generate Rashba/Dresselhaus effects, leading to interfacial spin-filtering. This work describes structural control and chiroptical properties of chiral II-VI/III-V NCs, discussing factors like morphology, surface defects, and ligand chemistry, while outlining trade-offs among SOC, optical quality, and device integration. Mechanistic models, including exciton-ligand hybridization and photonic coupling, explain trends in circular dichroism. Strategies for tuning spin injection, transport, and relaxation are outlined, emphasizing SOC, structural anisotropy, and compositional engineering. This work assesses challenges in integrating chiral NCs into practical devices - including stability, scalability, environmental safety - and highlight opportunities in spin-LEDs, quantum computation, biosensing, and memory devices.

TI Error mitigation with stabilized noise in superconducting quantum
   processors
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Pre-fault tolerant quantum computers have already demonstrated the ability to estimate observable values accurately, at a scale beyond brute-force classical computation. This has been enabled by error mitigation techniques that often rely on a representative model of the device noise. However, learning and maintaining these models is complicated by fluctuations in the noise over unpredictable time scales, for instance, arising from resonant interactions between superconducting qubits and defect two-level systems (TLS). Such interactions affect the stability and uniformity of device performance as a whole, but also affect the noise model accuracy, leading to incorrect observable estimation. Here, we experimentally demonstrate that tuning of the qubit-TLS interactions helps reduce noise instabilities and consequently enables more reliable error-mitigation performance. These experiments provide a controlled platform for studying the performance of error mitigation in the presence of quasi-static noise. We anticipate that the capabilities introduced here will be crucial for the exploration of quantum applications on solid-state processors at non-trivial scales.

TI Time-evolving matrix product operator method in a nondiagonal basis set
   based on the derivative of the path-integral expression
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB The time-evolving matrix product operator (TEMPO) method is a powerful tool for simulating open system quantum dynamics. Typically, it is used in problems with diagonal system-bath coupling, where analytical expressions for discretized influence functional are available. In this work, we aim to address issues related to off-diagonal coupling by extending the TEMPO algorithm to accommodate arbitrary basis sets. The proposed approach is based on computing the derivative of the discretized path-integral expression of a generalized influence functional when increasing one time step, which yields an equation of motion valid for a nondiagonal basis set and an arbitrary number of noncommuting baths. The generalized influence functional is then obtained by integrating the resulting differential equation. The applicability of the new method is then tested by simulating one- and two-qubit systems coupled to both Z- and X-type baths.

TI Correlated Spectroscopy of Electric Noise with Color Center Clusters
SO NANO LETTERS
AB Experimental noise often contains information about the interactions of a system with its environment, but establishing a relation between the measured time fluctuations and the underlying physical observables is rarely apparent. Here, we leverage a multidimensional and multisensor analysis of spectral diffusion to investigate the dynamics of trapped carriers near subdiffraction clusters of nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond. We establish statistical correlations in the spectral fluctuations we measure as we recursively probe the cluster optical resonances, which we then exploit to reveal proximal traps. Further, we deterministically induce Stark shifts in the cluster spectrum, ultimately allowing us to pinpoint the relative three-dimensional positions of interacting NVs as well as the location and charge sign of surrounding traps. Our results can be generalized to other color centers and provide opportunities for the characterization of photocarrier dynamics in semiconductors and the manipulation of nanoscale spin-qubit clusters connected via electric fields.

TI Opto-RF transduction in Er 3+:CaWO 4
SO JOURNAL OF LUMINESCENCE
AB We use an erbium doped CaWO 4 crystal as a resonant transducer between the RF and optical domains at 12 GHz and 1532 nm respectively. We employ a RF resonator to enhance the spin coupling but keep a single -pass (non -resonant) optical setup. The overall efficiency is low but we carefully characterize the transduction process and show that the performance can be described by two different metrics that we define and distinguish: the electro-optics and the quantum efficiencies. We reach an electro-optics efficiency of -84 dB for 15.7 dBm RF power. The corresponding quantum efficiency is -142 dB for 0.4 dBm optical power. We develop the Schr & ouml;dinger-Maxwell formalism, well-known to describe light -matter interactions in atomic systems, in order to model the conversion process. We explicitly make the connection with the cavity quantum electrodynamics (cavity QED) approach that are generally used to describe quantum transduction.

TI First-principles study of quantum defect candidates in beryllium oxide
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB Beryllium oxide (BeO) is a promising host for quantum defects because of its ultrawide band gap. We conducted comprehensive first-principles investigations of the native point defects in BeO using density functional theory with a hybrid functional. We found that the beryllium and oxygen vacancies are the most stable defects, whereas other native defects such as interstitials or antisites have high formation energies. We investigate the point defects as candidates for quantum defects by examining spin states and internal optical transitions. The oxygen vacancy (V-O(+)) emerges as a suitable spin qubit or single-photon emitter; we also find its stability can be enhanced by forming a (V-O-Li-Be)(0) complex with a Li acceptor. The O-Be(-) antisite also has desirable optical and spin properties. Overall, because of its desirable properties as a host material, BeO could be an excellent host for quantum defects, with V-O(+), (V-O-Li-Be)(0), and O-Be(-) as prime candidates.

TI Valley Splitting in Silicon from the Interference Pattern of Quantum
   Oscillations
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB We determine the energy splitting of the conduction-band valleys in two-dimensional electrons confined in silicon metal oxide semiconductor Hall-bar transistors. These silicon metal oxide semiconductor Hall bars are made by advanced semiconductor manufacturing on 300 mm silicon wafers and support a two-dimensional electron gas of high quality with a maximum mobility of 17.6 ?? 103 cm2/Vs and minimum percolation density of 3.45 ?? 1010 cm???2. Because of the low disorder, we observe beatings in the Shubnikov???de Haas oscillations that arise from the energy splitting of the two low-lying conduction band valleys. From the analysis of the oscillations beating patterns up to T = 1.7 K, we estimate a maximum valley splitting of ??EVS = 8.2 meV at a density of 6.8 ?? 1012 cm???2. Furthermore, the valley splitting increases with density at a rate consistent with theoretical predictions for a near-ideal semiconductor-oxide interface.

TI Symplectic circuits, entanglement, and stimulated Hawking radiation in
   analogue gravity
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
AB We introduce a convenient set of analytical tools (the Gaussian formalism) and diagrams (symplectic circuits) to analyze multimode scattering events in analogue gravity, such as pair creation `a la Hawking by black hole and white hole analogue event horizons. The diagrams prove to be valuable Ansatze for the scattering dynamics, especially in settings where direct analytic results are not straightforward and one must instead rely on numerical simulations. We use these tools to investigate entanglement generation in single- and multihorizon scenarios, in particular when the Hawking process is stimulated with classical (e.g., thermal noise) and nonclassical (e.g., single-mode squeezed vacuum) input states-demonstrating, for instance, that initial squeezing can enhance the production of entanglement and overcome the deleterious effects that initial thermal fluctuations have on the output entanglement. To make further contact with practical matters, we examine how attenuation degrades quantum correlations between Hawking pairs. The techniques that we employ are generally applicable to analogue gravity setups of (Gaussian) bosonic quantum systems, such as analogue horizons produced in optical analogues and in Bose-Einstein condensates, and should be of great utility in these domains. We show the applicability of these techniques by putting them in action for an optical system containing a pair white-black hole analogue, extending our previous analysis of [Phys. Rev. Lett. 128, 091301 (2022)].

TI Observable-driven speed-ups in quantum simulations
SO COMMUNICATIONS PHYSICS
AB Quantum simulation represents a cornerstone application for quantum computers, offering the potential to solve classically intractable problems in physics, chemistry, and materials science. Despite being one of the most accessible simulation methods, the product formula encounters challenges due to the pessimistic gate count estimation. In this work, we elucidate how observable knowledge can accelerate quantum simulations. By focusing on specific knowledge of observables, we reduce product-formula simulation errors and gate counts in both short-time and arbitrary-time scenarios. For short-time simulations, we deliberately design and tailor product formulas to achieve size-independent errors for local and certain global observables. In arbitrary-time simulations, we reveal that Pauli-summation structured observables generally reduce average errors with a typically quadratic error reduction. Our advanced error analyses, supported by numerical studies, indicate improved gate count estimation. We anticipate that the explored speed-ups can pave the way for efficiently realizing quantum simulations and demonstrating advantages on near-term quantum devices.

TI Z2 topological orders in kagome dipolar systems: Feedback from Rydberg
   quantum simulator
SO SCIPOST PHYSICS
AB The mutual feedback between quantum condensed matter and cold atom physics has been quite fruitful throughout history and continues to inspire ongoing research. Motivated by the recent activities on the quantum simulation of topological orders among the ultracold Rydberg atom arrays, we consider the possibility of searching for topological orders among the dipolar quantum magnets and polar molecules with a kagome lattice geometry. Together with other quantum interactions such as the transverse field, the dipolar interaction endows the kagome system with a similar structure as the BalentsFisher-Girvin model and thus fosters the emergence of the Z2 topological orders. We construct a Z2 lattice gauge theory to access the topological ordered phase and describe the spinon and vison excitations for the Z2 topological orders. We explain the spectroscopic consequences for various quantum phases as well as the experimental detection. We further discuss the rare-earth kagome magnets, ultracold polar molecules, and cluster Mott insulators for the physical realization.

TI Quantum-Limited Generalized Measurement for Tunnel-Coupled Condensates
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB The efficient readout of the relevant information is pivotal for quantum simulation experiments. Often only single observables are accessed by performing standard projective measurements. In this work, we implement an atomic beam splitter by controlled outcoupling that enables a generalized measurement scheme. This gives us simultaneous access to number imbalance and relative phase in a system of two tunnel-coupled 1D Bose gases, which realize a quantum simulator of the sine-Gordon field theory. We demonstrate that the scheme is quantum limited by accessing number squeezing as a sensitive probe for added noise; further, we show that we can track Josephson oscillation dynamics with the generalized measurements. Finally, we show that the scheme allows the extraction of atoms while maintaining the system's coherent dynamics, which opens up the door to accessing multitime correlation functions. Our scheme constitutes a step towards accessing quantum properties of the sine-Gordon field theory and, in the future, studying spatially extended systems under continuous monitoring.

TI Line-graph-lattice crystal structures of stoichiometric materials
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB The origin of many quantum-material phenomena is intimately related to the presence of flat electronic bands. In quantum simulation, such bands have been realized through line-graph lattices, a class of lattices known to exhibit flat bands. Based on that work, we conduct a high-throughput screening for line-graph lattices among the crystalline structures of the Materials Flatband Database and report on new candidates for line-graph materials and lattice models. In particular, we find materials with line-graph-lattice structures beyond the two most commonly known examples, the kagome and pyrochlore lattices. We also identify materials that may exhibit flat topological bands. Finally, we examine the various line-graph lattices detected and highlight those with gapped flat bands and those most frequently represented among this set of materials. With the identification of real stoichiometric materials and theoretical lattice geometries, the results of this work may inform future studies of flat-band many-body physics in both condensed matter experiment and theory.

TI Optimal control in phase space applied to minimal-time transfer of
   thermal atoms in optical traps *
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We present an optimal control procedure for the nonadiabatic transport of ultracold neutral thermal atoms in optical tweezers arranged in a one-dimensional array, with the focus on reaching a minimal transfer time. The particle dynamics is modeled first using a classical approach through the Liouville equation and second through the quantum Wigner equation to include quantum effects. Both methods account for typical experimental noise described as stochastic effects through Fokker-Planck terms. The optimal control process is initialized with a trajectory computed for a single classical particle and determines the phase-space path that minimizes transport time and ensures high transport fidelity to the target trap. This approach provides a fast and efficient method for relocating atoms from an initial configuration to a desired target arrangement, minimizing time and energy costs while ensuring high fidelity. Such an approach may be highly valuable to initialize large atom arrays for quantum simulation or computation experiments.

TI Zeno effect suppression of gauge drift in quantum simulations
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Quantum simulation of lattice gauge theories is a promising tool for the study of many complicated problems including ones with real-time dynamics. For gauge theories, however, there is a major challenge in maintaining gauge invariance during time evolution. Such theories have a full Hilbert space that is larger than the physical space-the set of states which are gauge invariant or equivalently respect the Gauss law. While an exact implementation of Hamiltonian dynamics starting in the physical Hilbert space will keep the system in the physical space, various types of errors will inevitably produce components outside of it. This work proposes a method of suppressing this gauge drift via the Zeno effect. As in the standard picture of the Zeno effect, our method relies on frequent projection onto the physical subspace. Additionally, a technique is discussed to reduce the speed of the gauge drift, which helps to reduce the required frequency of projections. We demonstrate our method on a Z2 gauge theory toy model.

TI A Low-Noise CMOS SPAD Pixel With 12.1 Ps SPTR and 3 Ns Dead Time
SO IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN QUANTUM ELECTRONICS
AB Single-photon avalanche diodes (SPADs) have become the sensor of choice inmany applications whenever high sensitivity, low noise, and sharp timing performance are required, simultaneously. Recently, SPADs designed in CMOS technology, have yielded moderately good performance in these parameters, but never equaling their counterparts fabricated in highly customized, non-standard technologies. The arguments in favor of CMOScompatible SPADs were miniaturization, cost and scalability. In this paper, we present the first CMOS SPAD with performance comparable or better than that of the best custom SPADs, to date. The SPAD-based design, fully integrated in 180 nm CMOS technology, achieves a peak photon detection probability (PDP) of 55% at 480 nm with a very broad spectrum spanning from near ultraviolet (NUV) to near infrared (NIR) and a normalized dark count rate (DCR) of 0.2 cps/mu m(2), both at 6 V of excess bias. Thanks to a dedicated CMOS pixel circuit front-end, an afterpulsing probability of about 0.1% at a dead time of similar to 3 ns were achieved. We designed three SPADs with a diameter of 25, 50, and 100 mu m to study the impact of size on the timing jitter and to create a scaling law for SPADs. For these SPADs, a single-photon time resolution (SPTR) of 12.1 ps, 16 ps, and 27 ps (FWHM) was achieved at 6 V of excess bias, respectively. The SPADs operate in a wide range of temperatures, from -65 degrees C to 40.C, reaching a normalizedDCRof 1.6 mcps/mu m(2) at 6Vof excess bias for the 25 mu m at-65 degrees C. The proposed SPADs are ideal for a wide range of applications, including (quantum) LiDAR, super-resolution microscopy, quantum random number generators, quantum key distribution, fluorescence lifetime imaging, time-resolved Raman spectroscopy, to name a few. All these applications can take advantage of the vastly improved performance of our detectors, while enjoying the opportunities of megapixel resolutions promised by the economy of scale that is offered by CMOS technologies.

TI Impact of propagation losses on photon-pair generation in silicon
SO JOURNAL OF OPTICS
AB We present a semi-classical numerical model to estimate the impact of linear scattering loss and nonlinear absorption losses on the biphoton flux and their quantum correlations generated via spontaneous four-wave mixing in silicon nanowaveguides. The counter-intuitive observed enhancement of pair correlations with increasing loss is attributed to the dominant effect of reduced accidental counts from multiphoton generation, with a corresponding trade-off for the source brightness. Silicon nanowaveguides are shown to be capable of generating highly correlated paired photons with coincidental-to-accidental ratio as high as similar to 3400 and spectral brightness 2.8x104 pairs s-1 GHz-1 mW-1, even in the presence of linear propagation loss of 1 dB cm-1 and nonlinear losses (two-photon absorption and free-carrier absorption), over a length of 1 cm with an input pump power of 10 mW. Loss and the corresponding Langevin noise are modeled using distributed beam splitters along the waveguide length to encapsulate the phenomenological coupling to the background reservoir (vacuum fluctuations). The proposed numerical model is more general compared to previous analytical models, particularly for including dispersion and wavelength-dependent losses, and more accurate for noise estimation in the high-photon-flux regime such as optical parametric amplifiers and squeezed state generation.

TI Bipartite quantum states admitting a causal explanation
SO AVS QUANTUM SCIENCE
AB The statistics of local measurements of joint quantum systems can sometimes be used to distinguish the spatiotemporal structure in which they were measured. We first prove that every bipartite separable density matrix is temporally compatible with direct causal influence for arbitrary finite-dimensional quantum systems and measurements of a tomographically complete class of observables, which includes all Pauli observables in the case of multi-qubit systems. Equivalently, if a bipartite density matrix is not temporally compatible with direct causal influence, then it must be entangled. We also provide an operational meaning for the two temporal evolutions consistent with such correlations in terms of generalized dephasing channels and pretty good measurements. The two temporal evolutions are Bayesian inverses of each other, which is different from them being Petz recovery maps of each other. Finally, we prove necessary and sufficient conditions for an arbitrary bipartite quantum state to be temporally compatible, thereby providing a temporal analogue of the positive partial transpose criterion valid for quantum systems of any dimension.

TI High-fidelity multipartite entanglement creation in non-Hermitian qubits
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS B-ATOMIC MOLECULAR AND OPTICAL PHYSICS
AB Non-Hermitian quantum systems showcase many distinct and intriguing features with no Hermitian counterparts. One of them is the exceptional point which marks the PT (parity and time) symmetry phase transition, where an enhanced spectral sensitivity arises and leads to novel quantum engineering. Here we theoretically study the multipartite entanglement properties in non-Hermitian superconducting qubits, where high-fidelity entangled states can be created under strong driving fields or strong couplings among the qubits. Under an interplay between driving fields, couplings, and non-Hermiticity, we focus on generations of GHZ states or GHZ classes in three and four qubits with all-to-all couplings, which allows a fidelity approaching unity when relatively low non-Hermitian decay rates are considered. This presents an ultimate capability of non-Hermitian qubits to host a genuine and maximal multipartite entanglement. Our results can shed light on novel quantum engineering of multipartite entanglement generations in non-Hermitian qubit systems.

TI Mixed-integer linear programming solver using Benders decomposition
   assisted by a neutral-atom quantum processor
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB This paper presents a hybrid classical-quantum approach to solve mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) using neutral-atom quantum computations. We apply Benders decomposition (BD) to segment MILPs into a master problem (MP) and a subproblem, where the MP is addressed using a neutral-atom device, after being transformed into a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) model, with an automatized procedure. Our MILP to QUBO conversion tightens the upper bounds of the continuous variables involved, positively impacting the required qubit count, and the convergence of the algorithm. To solve the QUBO, we develop a heuristic for atom register embedding and apply a variational algorithm for pulse shaping. In addition, we implement a proof of concept that outperforms existing solutions. We also conduct preliminary numerical results: In a series of small MILP instances our algorithm identifies over 95% of feasible solutions of high quality, outperforming classical BD approaches where the MP is solved using simulated annealing.

TI Coherent optical coupling to surface acoustic wave devices
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Surface acoustic waves (SAW) and associated devices are ideal for sensing, metrology, and hybrid quantum devices. While the advances demonstrated to date are largely based on electromechanical coupling, a robust and customizable coherent optical coupling would unlock mature and powerful cavity optomechanical control techniques and an efficient optical pathway for long-distance quantum links. Here we demonstrate direct and robust coherent optical coupling to Gaussian surface acoustic wave cavities with small mode volumes and high quality factors (>105 measured here) through a Brillouin-like optomechanical interaction. High-frequency SAW cavities designed with curved metallic acoustic reflectors deposited on crystalline substrates are efficiently optically accessed along piezo-active directions, as well as non-piezo-active (electromechanically inaccessible) directions. The precise optical technique uniquely enables controlled analysis of dissipation mechanisms as well as detailed transverse spatial mode spectroscopy. These advantages combined with simple fabrication, large power handling, and strong coupling to quantum systems make SAW optomechanical platforms particularly attractive for sensing, material science, and hybrid quantum systems.

TI ENCODABILITY CRITERIA FOR QUANTUM BASED SYSTEMS
SO LOGICAL METHODS IN COMPUTER SCIENCE
AB Quantum based systems are a relatively new research area for that different modelling languages including process calculi are currently under development. Encodings are often used to compare process calculi. Quality criteria are used then to rule out trivial or meaningless encodings. In this new context of quantum based systems, it is necessary to analyse the applicability of these quality criteria and to potentially extend or adapt them. As a first step, we test the suitability of classical criteria for encodings between quantum based languages and discuss new criteria. Concretely, we present an encoding, from a language inspired by CQP into a language inspired by qCCS. We show that this encoding satisfies compositionality, name invariance (for channel and qubit names), operational correspondence, divergence reflection, success sensitiveness, and that it preserves the size of quantum registers. Then we show that there is no encoding from qCCS into CQP that is compositional, operationally corresponding, and success sensitive.

TI Detecting the steerability through an optimized steering criterion in
   two-photon systems
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB The steerability of a quantum state can be detected by steering inequalities. The linear steering inequalities show that more steerable states can be discovered with the increase of measurements. In order to detect more steerable states in two-photon systems, we first theoretically derive an optimized steering criterion based on infinity measurements for an arbitrary two-qubit state. The steering criterion is only determined by the spin correlation matrix of the state, and do not require infinity measurements. Then, we prepared the Werner-like states in two-photon systems, and measure their spin correlation matrices. Finally, we apply three steering criteria, which include our steering criterion, the three-measurement steering criterion and the geometric Bell-like inequality, to distinguish the steerability of these states. The results show that our steering criterion can detect the most steerable states under the same experimental conditions. Thus, our work provides a valuable reference for detecting the steerability of quantum states.

TI Are Quantum-Classical Hybrids Compatible with Ontological Cellular
   Automata?
SO UNIVERSE
AB Based on the concept of ontological states and their dynamical evolution by permutations, as assumed in the Cellular Automaton Interpretation (CAI) of quantum mechanics, we address the issue of whether quantum-classical hybrids can be described consistently in this framework. We consider chains of 'classical' two-state Ising spins and their discrete deterministic dynamics as an ontological model with an unitary evolution operator generated by pair-exchange interactions. A simple error mechanism is identified, which turns them into quantum mechanical objects: chains of qubits. Consequently, an interaction between a quantum mechanical and a 'classical' chain can be introduced and its consequences for this quantum-classical hybrid can be studied. We found that such hybrid character of composites, generally, does not persist under interactions and, therefore, cannot be upheld consistently, or even as a fundamental notion a la Kopenhagen interpretation, within CAI.

TI Exploring far-from-equilibrium ultrafast polarization control in
   ferroelectric oxides with excited-state neural network quantum molecular
   dynamics
SO SCIENCE ADVANCES
AB Ferroelectric materials exhibit a rich range of complex polar topologies, but their study under far-from-equilibrium optical excitation has been largely unexplored because of the difficulty in modeling the multiple spatiotemporal scales involved quantum-mechanically. To study optical excitation at spatiotemporal scales where these topologies emerge, we have performed multiscale excited-state neural network quantum molecular dynamics simulations that integrate quantum-mechanical description of electronic excitation and billion-atom machine learning molecular dynamics to describe ultrafast polarization control in an archetypal ferroelectric oxide, lead titanate. Far-from-equilibrium quantum simulations reveal a marked photo-induced change in the electronic energy landscape and resulting cross-over from ferroelectric to octahedral tilting topological dynamics within picoseconds. The coupling and frustration of these dynamics, in turn, create topological defects in the form of polar strings. The demonstrated nexus of multiscale quantum simulation and machine learning will boost not only the emerging field of ferroelectric topotronics but also broader optoelectronic applications.

TI Systematic design of a robust half-W1 photonic crystal waveguide for
   interfacing slow light and trapped cold atoms
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB Novel platforms interfacing trapped cold atoms and guided light in nanoscale waveguides are a promising route to achieve a regime of strong coupling between light and atoms in single pass, with applications to quantum non-linear optics and quantum simulation. A strong challenge for the experimental development of this emerging waveguide-QED field of research is to combine facilitated optical access for atom transport, atom trapping via guided modes and robustness to inherent nanofabrication imperfections. In this endeavor, here we propose to interface Rubidium atoms with a photonic-crystal waveguide based on a large-index GaInP slab. With a specifically tailored half-W1 design, we show that a large chiral coupling to the waveguide can be obtained and guided modes can be used to form two-color dipole traps for atoms down to 115 nm from the edge of the structure. This optimized device should greatly improve the level of experimental control and facilitate the atom integration.

TI FPGA based hardware platform for trapped-ion-based multi-level quantum
   systems
SO CHINESE PHYSICS B
AB We report a design and implementation of a field-programmable-gate-arrays (FPGA) based hardware platform, which is used to realize control and signal readout of trapped-ion-based multi-level quantum systems. This platform integrates a four-channel 2.8 Gsps@14 bits arbitrary waveform generator, a 16-channel 1 Gsps@14 bits direct-digital-synthesis-based radio-frequency generator, a 16-channel 8 ns resolution pulse generator, a 10-channel 16 bits digital-to-analog-converter module, and a 2-channel proportion integration differentiation controller. The hardware platform can be applied in the trapped-ion-based multi-level quantum systems, enabling quantum control of multi-level quantum system and high-dimensional quantum simulation. The platform is scalable and more channels for control and signal readout can be implemented by utilizing more parallel duplications of the hardware. The hardware platform also has a bright future to be applied in scaled trapped-ion-based quantum systems.

TI Hyperbolic band theory under magnetic field and Dirac cones on a higher
   genus surface
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS-CONDENSED MATTER
AB We explore the hyperbolic band theory under a magnetic field for the first time. Our theory is a general extension of the conventional band theory defined on a Euclidean lattice into the band theory on a general hyperbolic lattice/Riemann surface. Our methods and results can be confirmed experimentally by circuit quantum electrodynamics, which enables us to create novel materials in a hyperbolic space. To investigate the band structures, we construct directly the hyperbolic magnetic Bloch states and find that they form Dirac cones on a coordinate neighborhood. They can be regarded as a global quantum gravity solution detectable in a laboratory. Besides this is the first explicit example of a massless Dirac state on a higher genus surface. Moreover we show that the energy spectrum exhibits an unusual fractal structure refracting the negative curvature, when plotted as a function of a magnetic flux.

TI Quantum synchronization in one-dimensional topological systems
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB The phenomenon of synchronization, where entities exhibit stable oscillations with aligned frequencies and phases, has been revealed in diverse areas of natural science. It plays a crucial role in achieving frequency locking in multiple applications such as microwave communication and signal processing. The study of synchronization in quantum systems has gained significant interest, particularly in developing robust methods for synchronizing distant objects. Here, we demonstrate that synchronization between the boundary sites of one-dimensional generalized Aubry-Andr & eacute;-Harper models can be induced through applying dissipation on the central sites. We observe two types of synchronization, stemming from the topological edge states, identified by the off-diagonal or diagonal correlations between the boundary sites. We calculate the relaxation rate to realize the synchronization and its acceleration with bulk dissipation. Remarkably, the synchronous oscillations maintain steady amplitude and frequency in the thermodynamic limit. Moreover, we show that the synchronization is robust against perturbations in the Hamiltonian and initial states, highlighting its potential for practical implementation on near-term quantum simulation platforms.

TI Emergent Glassy Behavior in a Kagome Rydberg Atom Array
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB We present large-scale quantum Monte Carlo simulation results on a realistic Hamiltonian of kagome-lattice Rydberg atom arrays. Although the system has no intrinsic disorder, intriguingly, our analyses of static and dynamic properties on large system sizes reveal emergent glassy behavior in a region of parameter space located between two valence bond solid phases. The extent of this glassy region is demarcated using the Edwards-Anderson order parameter, and its phase transitions to the two proximate valence bond solids-as well as the crossover towards a trivial paramagnetic phase-are identified. We demonstrate the intrinsically slow (imaginary) time dynamics deep inside the glassy phase and discuss experimental considerations for detecting such a quantum disordered phase with numerous nearly degenerate local minima. Our proposal paves a new route to the study of real-time glassy phenomena and highlights the potential for quantum simulation of a distinct phase of quantum matter beyond solids and liquids in current-generation Rydberg platforms.

TI Interferences of electrostatic moire potentials and bichromatic
   superlattices of electrons and excitons in transition metal
   dichalcogenides
SO 2D MATERIALS
AB Recent experimental progresses have demonstrated the great potential of electronic and excitonic moire superlattices in transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) for quantum many-body simulations and quantum optics applications. Here we reveal that the moire potential landscapes in the TMDs heterostructures have an electrostatic origin from the spontaneous charge transfer across the heterointerfaces dependent on the atomic registry. This allows engineering tunable multi-chromatic superlattices through the interference of moire potentials from independently configurable heterointerfaces in multilayers. We show examples of bichromatic moire potentials for valley electrons, holes, and interlayer trions in MX2/M'X'(2)/MX2 trilayers, which can be strain switched from multi-orbital periodic superlattices to quasi-periodic disordered landscape. The trilayer moire also hosts two independently configurable triangular superlattices of neutral excitons with opposite electric dipoles. These findings greatly enrich the versatility and controllability of TMDs moire as a quantum simulation platform.

TI Tunable Superconducting Coupling of Quantum Dots via Andreev Bound
   States in Semiconductor-Superconductor Nanowires
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Semiconductor quantum dots have proven to be a useful platform for quantum simulation in the solid state. However, implementing a superconducting coupling between quantum dots mediated by a Cooper pair has so far suffered from limited tunability and strong suppression. This has limited applications such as Cooper pair splitting and quantum dot simulation of topological Kitaev chains. In this Letter, we propose how to mediate tunable effective couplings via Andreev bound states in a semiconductor-superconductor nanowire connecting two quantum dots. We show that in this way it is possible to individually control both the coupling mediated by Cooper pairs and by single electrons by changing the properties of the Andreev bound states with easily accessible experimental parameters. In addition, the problem of coupling suppression is greatly mitigated. We also propose how to experimentally extract the coupling strengths from resonant current in a three-terminal junction. Our proposal will enable future experiments that have not been possible so far.

TI Continuous Bose-Einstein condensation
SO NATURE
AB Bose-Einstein condensates BECs) are macroscopic coherent matter waves that have revolutionized quantum science and atomic physics. They are important to quantum simulation(1) and sensing(2,3), for example, underlying atom interferometers in space(4) and ambitious tests of Einstein's equivalence principle(5,6). A long-standing constraint for quantum gas devices has been the need to execute cooling stages time-sequentially, restricting these devices to pulsed operation. Here we demonstrate continuous Bose-Einstein condensation by creating a continuous-wave (CW) condensate of strontium atoms that lasts indefinitely. The coherent matter wave is sustained by amplification through Bose-stimulated gain of atoms from a thermal bath. By steadily replenishing this bath while achieving 1,000 times higher phase-space densities than previous works(7,8), we maintain the conditions for condensation. Our experiment is the matter wave analogue of a CW optical laser with fully reflective cavity mirrors. This proof-of-principle demonstration provides a new, hitherto missing piece of atom optics, enabling the construction of continuous coherent-matter-wave devices.

TI Spectroscopy of Rydberg states in erbium using electromagnetically

AB We present a study of the Rydberg spectrum in Er-166 for series connected to the 4f(12) (H-3(6))6s, J(c) = 13/2, and J(c) = 11/2 ionic core states using an all-optical detection based on electromagnetically induced transparency in an effusive atomic beam. Identifying approximately 550 individual states, we find good agreement with a multichannel quantum defect theory (MQDT) which allows assignment of most states to ns or nd Rydberg series. We provide an improved accuracy for the lowest two ionization thresholds to E-IP,E-Jc=13/2 = 49260.750(1) cm(-1) and E-IP,E-Jc (= 11/2) = 49701.184(1) cm(-1) as well as the corresponding quantum defects for all observed series. We identify Rydberg states in five different isotopes, and states between the two lowest ionization thresholds. Our results open the way for future applications of Rydberg states for quantum simulation using erbium and exploiting its special open-shell structure.

TI Spreading of correlations and entanglement in the long-range transverse
   Ising chain
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Whether long-range interactions allow for a form of causality in nonrelativistic quantum models remains an open question with far-reaching implications for the propagation of information and thermalization processes. Here, we study the out-of-equilibrium dynamics of the one-dimensional transverse Ising model with algebraic long-range exchange coupling. Using a state of the art tensor-network approach, complemented by analytic calculations and considering various observables, we show that a weak form of causality emerges, characterized by nonuniversal dynamical exponents. While the local spin and spin correlation causal edges are sub-ballistic, the causal region has a rich internal structure, which, depending on the observable, displays ballistic or superballistic features. In contrast, the causal region of entanglement entropy is featureless and its edge is always ballistic, irrespective of the interaction range. Our results shed light on the propagation of information in long-range interacting lattice models and pave the way to future experiments, which are discussed.

TI Majorana zero mode-soliton duality and in-gap and BIC bound states in
   modified Toda model coupled to fermion
SO JOURNAL OF HIGH ENERGY PHYSICS
AB A two-dimensional field theory of a fermion chirally coupled to Toda field plus a scalar self-coupling potential is considered. Using techniques of integrable systems we obtain analytical zero modes, in-gap states and bound states in the continuum (BIC) for topological configurations of the scalar field. Fermion-soliton duality mappings are uncovered for the bound state spectrum, which interpolates the weak and strong coupling sectors of the model and give rise to novel Thirring-like and multi-frequency sine-Gordon models, respectively. The non-perturbative effects of the back-reaction of the fermion bound states on the kink are studied and it is shown that the zero mode would catalyze the emergence of a new kink with lower topological charge and greater slope at the center, in the strong coupling limit of the model. For special topological charges and certain relative phases of the fermion components the kinks can host Majorana zero modes. The Noether, topological and a novel nonlocal charge densities satisfy a formula of the Atiyah-Patodi-Singer-type. Our results may find applications in several branches of non-linear physics, such as confinement in QCD(2), braneworld models, high T-c superconductivity and topological quantum computation. We back up our results with numerical simulations for continuous families of topological sectors.

TI Characterization of Shapiro steps in the presence of a 4π-periodic
   Josephson current
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB The Majorana zero-energy modes (MZMs) residing at the boundary of topological superconductors have attracted a great deal of interest recently, as they provide a platform to explore fundamental physics such as non-Abelian statistics, as well as fault-tolerant quantum computation. Period doubling of Shapiro steps in a Josephson junction under microwave irradiation has been regarded as strong evidence for the emergence of the MZMs at the junction edges. However, questions remain as to how the Shapiro steps respond to the presence of a 4 pi-periodic Josephson current. In this study, we investigated the characteristic features of Shapiro steps with respect to the ratio (alpha) of the 4 pi-periodic current to the topologically trivial 2 pi-periodic one, as well as the reduced microwave frequency (Omega) and McCumber parameter (beta) of the junction. Our analysis reproduced Shapiro steps similar to those observed experimentally for specific parameter sets of alpha, Omega(less than or similar to 0.1), and beta(greater than or similar to 1.0). Full suppression of the first lobe of the n = 1 step guarantees the presence of a 4 pi -periodic Josephson current. In addition, we discuss the range of Omega and beta needed for full suppression of the first lobe of the n = 1 step, even for small alpha (< 0.1). To observe "period-doubled Shapiro steps," even with a small alpha, the junction should have a large IcRN product and sufficiently large junction capacitance.

TI Path Integral Simulations of Condensed-Phase Vibrational Spectroscopy
SO ANNUAL REVIEW OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY
AB Recent theoretical and algorithmic developments have improved the accuracy with which path integral dynamics methods can include nuclear quantum effects in simulations of condensed-phase vibrational spectra. Such methods are now understood to be approximations to the delocalized classical Matsubara dynamics of smooth Feynman paths, which dominate the dynamics of systems such as liquid water at room temperature. Focusing mainly on simulations of liquid water and hexagonal ice, we explain how the recently developed quasicentroid molecular dynamics (QCMD), fast-QCMD, and temperature-elevated path integral coarse-graining simulations (Te PIGS) methods generate classical dynamics on potentials of mean force obtained by averaging over quantum thermal fluctuations. These new methods give very close agreement with one another, and the Te PIGS method has recently yielded excellent agreement with experimentally measured vibrational spectra for liquid water, ice, and the liquid-air interface. We also discuss the limitations of such methods.

TI Fractional transconductance via nonadiabatic topological Cooper pair
   pumping
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Many robust physical phenomena in quantum physics are based on topological invariants arising due to intriguing geometrical properties of quantum states. Prime examples are the integer and fractional quantum Hall effects that demonstrate quantized Hall conductances, associated with topology both in the single particle and the strongly correlated many-body limit. Interestingly, the topology of the integer effect can be realized in superconducting multiterminal systems, but a proposal for the more complex fractional counterpart is lacking. In this work, we theoretically demonstrate how to achieve fractional quantized transconductance in an engineered chain of Josephson junctions. Crucially, similar to the stabilization of the conductance plateaus in Hall systems by disorder, we obtain stable transconductance plateaus as a result of nonadiabatic Landau-Zener transitions. We furthermore show that the fractional plateaus are robust to disorder and study the optimal operation regime to observe these effects. Our proposal paves the way for quantum simulation of exotic many-body out-of-equilibrium states in Josephson junction systems.

TI General solution of the time evolution of two interacting harmonic
   oscillators
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We study the time evolution of an ideal system composed of two harmonic oscillators coupled through a quadratic Hamiltonian with arbitrary interaction strength. We solve its dynamics analytically by employing tools from symplectic geometry. In particular, we use this result to completely characterize the dynamics of the two oscillators interacting in the ultrastrong-coupling regime with additional single-mode squeezing on both oscillators, as well as higher-order terms. Furthermore, we compute quantities of interest, such as the average number of excitations and the correlations that are established between the two subsystems due to the evolution. We find that this model predicts a second-order phase transition and we compute the critical exponents and the critical value. We also provide an exact decoupling of the time evolution in terms of simple quantum optical operations, which can be used for practical implementations and studies. Finally, we show how our techniques can be extended to include more oscillators and higher-order interactions.

TI Spikes in Poissonian quantum trajectories
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We consider the dynamics of a continuously monitored qubit in the limit of strong measurement rate where the quantum trajectory is described by a stochastic master equation with Poisson noise. Such limits are expected to give rise to quantum jumps between the pointer states associated with the nondemolition measurement. A surprising discovery in earlier work [A. Tilloy et al., Phys. Rev. A 92, 052111 (2015)] on quantum trajectories with Brownian noise was the phenomena of spikes observed in-between the quantum jumps. Here, we show that spikes are observed also for Poisson noise. We consider three cases where the nondemolition is broken by adding, to the basic strong measurement dynamics, either unitary evolution or thermal noise or additional measurements. We present a complete analysis of the spike and jump statistics for all three cases using the fact that the dynamics effectively corresponds to that of stochastic resetting. We provide numerical results to support our analytic results.

SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY A
AB The search for molecular or colloidal building units capable of autonomously organized configurations has been a long-standing endeavor that has resulted in the development of innovative material categories, such as metal-organic and covalent organic or long-range molecular networks. In particular, the possibility of using molecules on surfaces to create specific architectures, for example, those containing nanostructures of S = 1/2 molecular spin, can enable versatile quantum materials and the exploration of future quantum devices. Transition-metal phthalocyanines are particularly attractive candidates as they are stable molecules that can host spin-bearing transition-metal ions in a planar conjugated ring. Here, we use density functional theory calculations to systematically study electronic and magnetic properties and hyperfine parameters for the whole series of 3d transition-metal atoms. We perform transport simulations of selected qubit candidates to further elucidate their suitability for molecular spin qubits on a surface.

TI Low-temperature electron transport in [110] and [100] silicon nanowires:
   a DFT-Monte Carlo study
SO FRONTIERS IN NANOTECHNOLOGY
AB The effects of very low temperature on the electron transport in a [110] and [100] axially aligned unstrained silicon nanowires (SiNWs) are investigated. A combination of semi-empirical 10-orbital tight-binding method, density functional theory and Ensemble Monte Carlo (EMC) methods are used. Both acoustic and optical phonons are included in the electron-phonon scattering rate calculations covering both intra-subband and inter-subband events. A comparison with room temperature (300 K) characteristics shows that for both nanowires, the average electron steady-state drift velocity increases at least 2 times at relatively moderate electric fields and lower temperatures. Furthermore, the average drift velocity in [110] nanowires is 50 percent more than that of [100] nanowires, explained by the difference in their conduction subband effective mass. Transient average electron velocity suggests that there is a pronounced streaming electron motion at low temperature which is attributed to the reduced electron-phonon scattering rates.

TI Minimum Quantum Run-Time Characterization and Calibration via Restless
   Measurements with Dynamic Repetition Rates
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB The performance of a quantum processor depends on the characteristics of the device and the quality of the control pulses. Characterizing cloud-based quantum computers and calibrating the pulses that control them is necessary for high-fidelity operations. However, this time-intensive task eats into the availability of the device. Here, we show restless measurements with a dynamic repetition rate that speed-up calibration and characterization tasks. Randomized benchmarking is performed 5.3 times faster on the quantum device than when an active reset is used and without discarding any data. In addition, we calibrate a qubit with parameter scans and error-amplifying gate sequences and show speed-ups of up to a factor of 40 on the quantum device over active reset. Finally, we present a methodology to perform restless quantum process tomography that mitigates restless state preparation errors. These results reduce the footprint of characterization and calibration tasks. Quantum computers can thus either spend more time running applications or run calibrations more often to maintain gate fidelity.

TI Exchange-mediated mutual correlations and dephasing in free-electrons
   and light interactions
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB The quantum world distinguishes itself from the classical world by being governed by probability amplitudes rather than probabilities. On a single-particle level, quantum phases can be manipulated leading to observable interference patterns that can be used as a probe e.g. in matter wave microscopy. But the quantum world bears even more fascinating effects when it comes to the interplay between more than one particle. Correlations between quantum particles such as entanglement can be exploited to speed up computational algorithms or enable secure cryptography. Here, we propose and numerically explore a thought experiment to address the question whether quantum correlations between particles can be used in matter wave microscopy. Specifically, we address the following questions: can information be transferred between two mutually spin-correlated free-electron wavepackets? Can Coulomb and exchange correlations be linked to the decoherence and dephasing mechanisms of matter waves? Using a time-dependent Hartree-Fock algorithm, we will show that the exchange term has a substantial role in transferring the information between two mutually spin-correlated electrons, whereas the Hartree potential (or mean-field Coulomb potential) dominates the dephasing on a single-particle level. Our findings might facilitate fermionic matter wave interferometry experiments designed to retrieve information about non-classical correlations and the mechanism of decoherence in open quantum systems.

TI Observation of Momentum Space Josephson Effects in Weakly Coupled
   Bose-Einstein Condensates
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB The momentum space Josephson effect describes the supercurrent flow between weakly coupled BoseEinstein condensates (BECs) at two discrete momentum states. Here, we experimentally observe this exotic phenomenon using a BEC with Raman-induced spin-orbit coupling, where the tunneling between two local band minima is implemented by the momentum kick of an additional optical lattice. A sudden quench of the Raman detuning induces coherent spin-momentum oscillations of the BEC, which is analogous to the ac Josephson effect. We observe both plasma and regular Josephson oscillations in different parameter regimes. The experimental results agree well with the theoretical model and numerical simulation and showcase the important role of nonlinear interactions. We also show that the measurement of the Josephson plasma frequency gives the Bogoliubov zero quasimomentum gap, which determines the mass of the corresponding pseudo-Goldstone mode, a long-sought phenomenon in particle physics. The observation of momentum space Josephson physics offers an exciting platform for quantum simulation and sensing utilizing momentum states as a synthetic degree.

TI Characterizing quantum criticality and steered coherence in the
   XY-Gamma chain
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB In this paper, we show that an effective spin Hamiltonian with various types of couplings can be engineered using quantum simulators in atomic-molecular-optical laboratories, dubbed the XY-Gamma model. We analytically solve the one-dimensional short-range interacting case with the Jordan-Wigner transformation and establish the phase diagram. In the gapless phase, an incommensurate spiral order is manifested by the vector-chiral correlations. Between distinct gapped phases, a logarithmic scaling behavior of local measures, including spin correlations and the steered quantum coherence, is identified for the quantum critical points, yielding a compelling value of the correlation-length critical exponent. We derive explicit scaling forms of the excitation gap near the quantum critical points. The extracted critical exponents reveal the quantum phase transition on the boundary of Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid belongs to Lifshitz universality class. Our results may provide useful insights into the underlying mechanism in quantum criticality for state-of-the-art experiments of quantum simulation.

TI Experimental Determination of Electronic States via Digitized Shortcut
   to Adiabaticity and Sequential Digitized Adiabaticity
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB A combination of digitized shortcut to adiabaticity (STA) and sequential digitized adiabaticity is implemented in a superconducting quantum device to determine the electronic states in two example systems, the H-2 molecule and the topological Bernevig-Hughes-Zhang (BHZ) model. For H-2, a short internuclear distance is chosen as a starting point, at which the ground and excited states are obtained via digitized STA. From this starting point, a sequence of internuclear distances is built. The eigenstates at each distance are sequentially determined from those at the previous distance via the digitized adiabaticity, leading to the potential energy landscapes of H-2. The same approach is applied to the BHZ model and the valence and conduction bands are obtained with a high degree of accuracy along the X-Gamma-X line cut of the first Brillouin zone. Furthermore, a numerical simulation of this method is performed to successfully extract the ground states of hydrogen chains with lengths of between three and six atoms.

TI Quantum many-body scars for arbitrary integer spin in 2+1D Abelian gauge
   theories
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
AB The existence of quantum many-body scars, which prevents thermalization from certain initial states after a long time, has been established across different quantum many-body systems. These include gauge theories corresponding to spin-1=2 quantum link models. Establishing quantum scars in gauge theories with high spin is not accessible with existing numerical methods, which rely on exact diagonalization. We systematically identify scars for pure gauge theories with arbitrarily large integer spin S in 2 + 1D, where the electric field is restricted to 2S + 1 states per link. Through an explicit analytic construction, we show that the presence of scars is widespread in 2+ 1D gauge theories for arbitrary integer spin. We confirm these findings numerically for small truncated spin and S = 1 quantum link models. Our analytic construction establishes the presence of scars far beyond volumes and spins that can be probed with existing numerical methods and can guide quantum simulation experiments toward interesting nonequilibrium phenomena, inaccessible otherwise.

TI Quantum Nonlocality: How Does Nature Do It?
SO ENTROPY
AB In his article in Science, Nicolas Gisin claimed that quantum correlations emerge from outside space-time. We explainthat they are due to space-time symmetries. This paper is a critical review of metaphysical conclusions found in many recent articles. It advocates the importance of contextuality, Einstein -causality and global symmetries. Bell tests allow only rejecting probabilistic coupling provided by a local hidden variable model, but they do not justify metaphysical speculations about quantum nonlocality and objects which know about each other's state, even when separated by large distances. The violation of Bell inequalities in physics and in cognitive science can be explained using the notion of Bohr- contextuality. If contextual variables, describing varying experimental contexts, are correctly incorporated into a probabilistic model, then the Bell-CHSH inequalities cannot be proven and nonlocal correlations may be explained in an intuitive way. We also elucidate the meaning of statistical independence assumption incorrectly called free choice, measurement independence or no- conspiracy. Since correlation does not imply causation, the violation of statistical independence should be called contextuality; it does not restrict the experimenter's freedom of choice. Therefore, contrary to what is believed, closing the freedom-of choice loophole does not close the contextuality loophole.

TI High-quality superconducting tantalum resonators with beta phase defects
SO APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS
AB For practical superconducting quantum processors, orders of magnitude improvement in coherence is required, motivating efforts to optimize hardware design and explore new materials. Among the latter, the coherence of superconducting transmon qubits has been shown to improve by forming the qubit capacitor pads from alpha-tantalum, avoiding the metastable beta-phase that forms when depositing tantalum at room temperature, and has been previously identified to be a source of microwave losses. In this work, we show lumped element resonators containing beta-phase tantalum in the form of inclusions near the metal-substrate interface with internal quality factors ( Qi) up to 5.0 +/- 2.5x106 in the single photon regime. They perform at least as good as resonators with no sign of the beta-phase in x-ray diffraction and thermal quasi-particle loss. Our results indicate that small concentrations of beta-phase can be beneficial, enhancing critical magnetic fields and potentially, for improving coherence in tantalum-based superconducting circuits.

TI Sensing Coherent Nuclear Spin Dynamics with an Ensemble of Paramagnetic
   Nitrogen Spins
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB The unpolarized spin environment surrounding a central spin qubit is typically considered as an incoherent source of dephasing, however, precise characterization and control of the spin bath can yield a resource for storing and sensing with quantum states. In this work, we use nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond to measure the coherence of optically dark paramagnetic nitrogen defects (P1 centers) and detect coherent interactions between the P1 centers and a local bath of 13C nuclear spins. The dipolar coupling between the P1 centers and 13C nuclear spins is identified by signature periodic collapses and revivals in the P1 spin coherence signal. We then demonstrate, using a range of dynamical decoupling protocols, that the probing NV centers and the P1 spins are coupled to independent ensembles of 13C nuclear spins. Our work illustrates how the optically dark P1 spins can be used to extract information from their local environment and offers new insight into the interactions within a many-body system.

TI Thermal Modulation of Gigahertz Surface Acoustic Waves on Lithium
   Niobate
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB Surface-acoustic-wave (SAW) devices have a wide range of applications in microwave signal processing. Microwave SAW components benefit from higher quality factors and much smaller crosstalk when compared to their electromagnetic counterparts. Efficient routing and modulation of SAWs are essential for building large-scale and versatile acoustic wave circuits. Here, we demonstrate integrated thermoacoustic modulators using two SAW platforms: bulk lithium niobate and thin-film lithium niobate on sapphire. In both approaches, the gigahertz-frequency SAWs are routed by integrated acoustic waveguides, while onchip microheaters are used to locally change the temperature, and thus, control the phase of the SAW. Using this approach, we achieve phase changes of over 720 degrees with the responsibility of 2.6 degrees/mW for bulk lithium niobate and 0.52 degrees/mW for lithium niobate on sapphire. Furthermore, we demonstrate amplitude modulation of SAWs using acoustic Mach-Zehnder interferometers. Our thermoacoustic modulators can enable reconfigurable acoustic signal processing for next-generation wireless communications and microwave systems.

TI Variational wave functions for Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev models
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Given a class of q-local Hamiltonians, is it possible to find a simple variational state whose energy is a finite fraction of the ground-state energy in the thermodynamic limit? Whereas product states often provide an affirmative answer in the case of bosonic (or qubit) models, we show that Gaussian states fail dramatically in the fermionic case, such as for the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) models. This prompts us to propose a new class of wave functions for SYK models inspired by the variational coupled cluster algorithm. We introduce a static "(0+0)-dimensional" large-N field theory to study the energy, two-point correlators, and entanglement properties of these states. Most importantly, we demonstrate a finite disorder-averaged approximation ratio of r approximate to 0.62 between the variational and ground-state energy of the SYK model for q = 4. Moreover, the variational states provide an exact description of spontaneous symmetry breaking in a related two-flavor SYK model.

TI Resource conversion between operational coherence and multipartite
   entanglement in many-body systems
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB We establish a set of resource conversion relationships between quantum coherence and multipartite entanglement in many-body systems, where the operational measures of resource cost and distillation are focused. Under the multipartite incoherent operation, the initial coherence of single-party system bounds the maximal amounts of corresponding operational entanglement in an arbitrary bipartite partition as well as the genuine multipartite entanglement (GME) in many-body systems. Furthermore, the converted multipartite entanglement can be transferred to its subsystems and restored to coherence of a single party by means of local incoherent operations and classical communication, which constitutes a protocol of resource interconversion within the full incoherent operation scenario. As an example, we present a scheme for cyclic interconversion between coherence and GME in three-qubit systems without loss. Moreover, we analyze the property of bipartite and multipartite genuine multi-level entanglement by the initial coherence and investigate multipartite resource dynamics in the conversion.

TI Non-positive energy quasidistributions in coherent collision models
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB We determine the Kirkwood-Dirac quasiprobability (KDQ) distribution associated to the stochastic instances of internal energy variations for the quantum system and environment particles in coherent Markovian collision models. In the case the interactions between the quantum system and the particles do not conserve energy, the KDQ of the non-energy-preserving stochastic work is also derived. These KDQ distributions can account for non-commutativity, and return the unperturbed average values and variances for a generic interaction-time, and generic local initial states of the quantum system and environment particles. Using this nonequilibrium-physics approach, we certify the conditions under which the collision process of the model exhibits quantum traits, and we quantify the rate of energy exchanged by the quantum system by looking at the variance of the KDQ energy distributions. Finally, we propose an experimental test of our results on a superconducting quantum circuit implementing a qubit system, with microwave photons representing the environment particles.

TI Holographic deep thermalization for secure and efficient quantum random
   state generation
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Quantum randomness, especially random pure states, underpins fundamental questions like black hole physics and quantum complexity, as well as in practical applications such as quantum device benchmarking and quantum advantage certification. The conventional approach for generating genuine random states, known as 'deep thermalization', faces significant challenges, including scalability issues due to the need for a large ancilla system and susceptibility to attacks, as demonstrated in this work. We introduce holographic deep thermalization, a secure and hardware-efficient quantum random state generator. Via a sequence of scrambling-measure-reset processes, it continuously trades space with time, and substantially reduces the required ancilla size to as small as a system-size-independent constant; at the same time, it guarantees security by eliminating quantum correlation between the data system and potential attackers. Thanks to the resource reduction, our circuit-based implementation on IBM Quantum devices achieves genuine 5-qubit random state generation utilizing only a total of 8 qubits.

TI Electron g-factor of Ge strained by a SiGe substrate and its
   dependence on growth directions
SO JAPANESE JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS
AB We propose a Ge hole system in a strained Ge/SiGe quantum well with a diamond structure as a suitable platform for photon-spin conversion for its potential for high-performance spin qubits and optical transitions at telecom wavelengths. A critical condition of photon-hole spin transduction is that the g-factor of the electron at the Gamma point must be much larger than that of the hole. We calculated the electron g-factor in strained Ge, examining its dependence on both the growth direction ([100], [110], and [111]) and the Ge content of the SiGe substrate by using an eight-band model. Our results show that the absolute value of the electron g-factor decreases as Ge content decreases, ranging from approximately 2.88 to 2.00 across all growth directions. This indicates that the system is suitable for coherent photon-spin transduction.

TI Neutral-atom entanglement using adiabatic Rydberg dressing
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We revisit the implementation of a two-qubit entangling gate, the Mt lmer-St rensen gate, using the adiabatic Rydberg dressing paradigm for neutral atoms as studied in [A. Mitra et al., Phys. Rev. A 101, 030301(R) (2020)]. We study the implementation of rapid adiabatic passage using a two-photon transition, which does not require the use of an ultraviolet laser, and can be implemented using only amplitude modulation of one field with all laser frequencies fixed. We find that entangling gate fidelities, comparable to the one-photon excitation, are achievable with the two-photon excitation. Moreover, we address how the adiabatic dressing protocol can be used to implement entangling gates outside the regime of a perfect Rydberg blockade. We show that, by using adiabatic dressing, we can achieve scaling of the gate fidelity set by the fundamental limits to entanglement generated by the Rydberg interactions while simultaneously retaining a limited population in the doubly excited Rydberg state. This allows for fast high-fidelity gates for atoms separated beyond the blockade radius.

TI Dynamics of disordered Tavis-Cummings and Holstein-Tavis-Cummings models
SO JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS
AB By employing the time-dependent variational principle and the versatile multi-D-2 Davydov trial states, in combination with the Green's function method, we study the dynamics of the Tavis-Cummings model and the Holstein-Tavis-Cummings model in the presence of diagonal disorder and cavity-qubit coupling disorder. For the Tavis-Cummings model, time evolution of the photon population, the optical absorption spectra, and the hetero-entanglement between the qubits and the cavity mode are calculated by using the Green's function method to corroborate numerically exact results of Davydov's Ansatze. For the Holstein-Tavis-Cummings model, only the latter is utilized to simulate effects of disorder on the photon population dynamics and the absorption spectra. We have demonstrated that the complementary employment of analytical and numerical methods permits uncovering a fairly comprehensive picture of a variety of complex behaviors in disordered multidimensional polaritonic cavity quantum electrodynamics systems.

TI Double dressing by both the number of atoms and the number of photons
   inside cavity
SO RESULTS IN PHYSICS
AB We study a system of N two-level atoms interacting with a coherent field a resonant cavity in a self-consistent manner. No direct correlation between the atoms, such as induced by dipole-dipole interaction, is included. Initially all atoms are not exited, and there are n0 photons in the cavity. We show that the system reveals collective-like behavior, which stems from mutual influence of the atoms and coherent field in the cavity. In distinction from conventional dressing of atomic states by strong electromagnetic field, the system of N two-level atoms in a resonant cavity is actually dressed by both the number of photons and the number of atoms N. This double dressing results in both N and n0-dependent oscillation frequency, co(n0, N). At N >> n0 N/ the spectral density contains, apart from the main peak at the collective atomic frequency g N, additional features at odd sub-harmonics. There is interference signature at the double dressing spectrum which has half-peaks and half-dips that is a synchronization among the frequencies of photon and the atomic dressings. It is a beautiful manifestation of quantum interference in the present novel double dressing by the number n of photons and by the number N of atoms.

TI Laser cooling of a fermionic molecule
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Only bosonic molecular species have been directly laser cooled to date, primarily due to an abundance of bosonic isotopes in nature and to their simpler hyperfine structure. Fermionic molecules provide new opportunities for ultracold chemistry, quantum simulation, and precision measurements. Here we report direct laser cooling of a fermionic molecular isotopologue, calcium monodeuteride (CaD). With a nuclear spin I = 1, only 5 hyperfine states need to be addressed for rotational closure in optical cycling. These hyperfine states are unresolved for typical experimental linewidths. We present a method for efficiently producing alkaline-earth metal hydrides and deuterides. We demonstrate rotational closure and show magnetically assisted Sisyphus cooling in one dimension for a beam of CaD molecules. Our results indicate that the experimental complexity for laser cooling CaD is similar to that of calcium monohydride (CaH). Laser cooling of CaD is a promising first step for production of ultracold and trapped atomic deuterium.

TI Cyclic solid-state quantum battery: thermodynamic characterization and
   quantum hardware simulation
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB We introduce a cyclic quantum battery QB model, based on an interacting bipartite system, weakly coupled to a thermal bath. The working cycle of the battery consists of four strokes: system thermalization, disconnection of subsystems, ergotropy extraction, and reconnection. The thermal bath acts as a charger in the thermalization stroke, while ergotropy extraction is possible because the ensuing thermal state is no longer passive after the disconnection stroke. Focusing on the case of two interacting qubits, we show that phase coherence, in the presence of non-trivial correlations between the qubits, can be exploited to reach working regimes with efficiency higher than 50% while providing finite ergotropy. Our protocol is illustrated through a simple and feasible circuit model of a cyclic superconducting QB. Furthermore, we simulate the considered cycle on superconducting IBM quantum machines. The good agreement between the theoretical and simulated results strongly suggests that our scheme for cyclic QBs can be successfully realized in superconducting quantum hardware.

TI Robust Zeeman-type band splitting in sliding ferroelectrics
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW MATERIALS
AB Transition metal dichalcogenides are known for their intriguing spin-valley effects, which can be harnessed through proximity in van der Waals heterostructures. Their hexagonal monolayers exhibit significant Zeeman band splitting of valence bands, reaching up to several hundred meV and giving rise to spin textures that yield long spin lifetimes. However, this effect is suppressed in the hexagonal bilayers due to inversion symmetry. The recent discovery of sliding ferroelectricity in MX2 bilayers (M = Mo, W; X = S, Se) opens a pathway for the electrical control of the spin properties in these materials. While substantial Zeeman splitting is found in the rhombohedral structure, its behavior during the ferroelectric transition remains unclear. In this paper, we explore different stacking configurations of MX2 bilayers by sliding and demonstrate, using density functional theory calculations and symmetry analysis, that the Zeeman effect completely dominates the spin polarization of bands throughout the structural transition. This promises to maintain robust spin transport in polar MX2 bilayers, opening potential avenues for ferroelectric spintronics.

TI Quantum criticality of generalized Aubry-André models with exact
   mobility edges using fidelity susceptibility
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW E
AB In this study, we explore the quantum critical phenomena in generalized Aubry-Andr & eacute; models, with a particular focus on the scaling behavior at various filling states. Our approach involves using quantum fidelity susceptibility to precisely identify the mobility edges in these systems. Through a finite -size scaling analysis of the fidelity susceptibility, we are able to determine both the correlation -length critical exponent and the dynamical critical exponent at the critical point of the generalized Aubry-Andr & eacute; model. Based on the Diophantine equation conjecture, we can determines the number of subsequences of the Fibonacci sequence and the corresponding scaling functions for a specific filling fraction, as well as the universality class. Our findings demonstrate the effectiveness of employing the generalized fidelity susceptibility for the analysis of unconventional quantum criticality and the associated universal information of quasiperiodic systems in cutting -edge quantum simulation experiments.

TI Exploring Hilbert-Space Fragmentation on a Superconducting Processor
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Isolated interacting quantum systems generally thermalize, yet there are several examples for the breakdown of ergodicity, such as many-body localization and quantum scars. Recently, ergodicity breaking has been observed in systems subjected to linear potentials, termed Stark many-body localization. This phenomenon is closely associated with Hilbert-space fragmentation, characterized by a strong dependence of dynamics on initial conditions. Here, we explore initial-state-dependent dynamics using a ladder-type superconducting processor with up to 24 qubits, which enables precise control of the qubit frequency and initial-state preparation. In systems with linear potentials, we experimentally observe distinct nonequilibrium dynamics for initial states with the same quantum numbers and energy, but with varying domain-wall numbers. Accompanied by the numerical simulation for systems with larger sizes, we reveal that this distinction becomes increasingly pronounced as the system size grows, in contrast with weakly disordered interacting systems. Our results provide convincing experimental evidence of the fragmentation in Stark systems, enriching our understanding of the weak breakdown of ergodicity.

TI Cavity-QED simulation of a quantum metamaterial with tunable disorder
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We explore experimentally a quantum metamaterial based on a superconducting chip with 25 frequency-tunable transmon qubits coupled to a common coplanar resonator. The collective bright and dark modes are probed via the microwave response, i.e., by measuring the transmission amplitude of an external microwave signal. All qubits have individual control and readout lines. Their frequency tunability allows the number N of resonantly coupled qubits to change and a disorder in their excitation frequencies to be introduced with preassigned distributions. While increasing N, we demonstrate the expected N-1/2 scaling law for the energy gap (Rabi splitting) between bright modes around the cavity frequency. By introducing a controllable disorder and averaging the transmission amplitude over a large number of realizations, we demonstrate a decay of mesoscopic fluctuations which mimics an approach towards the thermodynamic limit. The collective bright states survive in the presence of disorder when the strength of individual qubit coupling to the cavity dominates over the disorder strength.

TI Quantum resources of the steady-state of three coupled qubits:
   Microscopic versus phenomenological model
SO PHYSICS LETTERS A
AB Quantum resources, such as entanglement, steering, and Bell nonlocality, are evaluated for three coupled qubits in the steady-state configuration. We employ the phenomenological master equation and the microscopic master equation to probe such quantum resources, which provide very different results depending on the system configuration. In particular, steering and Bell nonlocality are null within the phenomenological model, while they reach considerable values within the microscopic model. These results show that the phenomenological approach is not able to capture all quantum resources of the system. We also provide an analytical expression for the steady-state and quantum resources of the system composed of three coupled qubits in the zero temperature limit. Such results demonstrate that quantum resources between two qubits are strongly affected by the third qubit in a nontrivial way. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Closest separable state when measured by a quasi-relative entropy
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS A-MATHEMATICAL AND THEORETICAL
AB It is well known that for pure states the relative entropy of entanglement is equal to the reduced entropy, and the closest separable state is explicitly known as well. The same holds for Renyi relative entropy per recent results. We ask the same question for a quasi-relative entropy of entanglement, which is an entanglement measure defined as the minimum distance to the set of separable state, when the distance is measured by the quasi-relative entropy. First, we consider a maximally entangled state, and show that the closest separable state is the same for any quasi-relative entropy as for the relative entropy of entanglement. Then, we show that this also holds for a certain class of functions and any pure state. And at last, we consider any pure state on two qubit systems and a large class of operator convex function. For these, we find the closest separable state, which may not be the same one as for the relative entropy of entanglement.

TI Conductance asymmetries in mesoscopic superconducting devices due to
   finite bias
SO SCIPOST PHYSICS
AB Tunneling conductance spectroscopy in normal metal-superconductor junctions is an important tool for probing Andreev bound states in mesoscopic superconducting devices, such as Majorana nanowires. In an ideal superconducting device, the subgap conductance obeys specific symmetry relations, due to particle-hole symmetry and unitarity of the scattering matrix. However, experimental data often exhibits deviations from these symmetries or even their explicit breakdown. In this work, we identify a mechanism that leads to conductance asymmetries without quasiparticle poisoning. In particular, we investigate the effects of finite bias and include the voltage dependence in the tunnel barrier transparency, finding significant conductance asymmetries for realistic device parameters. It is important to identify the physical origin of conductance asymmetries: in contrast to other possible mechanisms such as quasiparticle poisoning, finite-bias effects are not detrimental to the performance of a topological qubit. To that end we identify features that can be used to experimentally determine whether finite-bias effects are the source of conductance asymmetries.

TI Antiferromagnetic spatial photonic Ising machine through optoelectronic
   correlation computing
SO COMMUNICATIONS PHYSICS
AB Recently, spatial photonic Ising machines (SPIM) have been demonstrated to compute the minima of Hamiltonians for large-scale spin systems. Here we propose to implement an antiferromagnetic model through optoelectronic correlation computing with SPIM. Also we exploit the gauge transformation which enables encoding the spins and the interaction strengths in a single phase-only spatial light modulator. With a simple setup, we experimentally show the ground-state-search acceleration of an antiferromagnetic model with 40000 spins in number-partitioning problem. Thus such an optoelectronic computing exhibits great programmability and scalability for the practical applications of studying statistical systems and combinatorial optimization problems.
   Spatial photonic Ising machines (SPIMs), a variant of optical Ising machines, are promising for large-scale problems but have limitations on the type of problems that can be mapped on them. Here, a variant of SPIMs is demonstrated that can realize anti-ferromagnetic Ising problems with some further experimental simplifications that have potentials for future large-scale Ising machines.

TI Hardware error correction for programmable photonics
SO OPTICA
AB Programmable photonic circuits of reconfigurable interferometers can be used to implement arbitrary operations on optical modes, providing a flexible platform for accelerating tasks in quantum simulation, signal processing, and artificial intelligence. A major obstacle to scaling up these systems is static fabrication error, where small component errors within each device accrue to produce significant errors within the circuit computation. Mitigating this error usually requires numerical optimization dependent on real-time feedback from the circuit, which can greatly limit the scalability of the hardware. Here we present a deterministic approach to correcting circuit errors by locally correcting hardware errors within individual optical gates. We apply our approach to simulations of large scale optical neural networks and infinite impulse response filters implemented in programmable photonics, finding that they remain resilient to component error well beyond modern day process tolerances. Our results highlight a potential way to scale up programmable photonics to hundreds of modes with current fabrication processes.

TI Lifts of Quantum CSS Codes
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION THEORY
AB We propose a notion of lift for quantum CSS codes, inspired by the geometrical construction of Freedman and Hastings. It is based on the existence of a canonical complex associated to any CSS code, that we introduce under the name of Tanner cone-complex, and over which we generate covering spaces. As a first application, we describe the classification of lifts of hypergraph product codes (HPC) and demonstrate the equivalence with the lifted product code (LPC) of Panteleev and Kalachev, including when the linear codes, factors of the HPC, are Tanner codes. As a second application, we report several new non-product constructions of quantum CSS codes, and we apply the prescription to generate their lifts which, for certain selected covering maps, are codes with improved relative parameters compared to the initial one.

TI Strong-weak duality via Jordan-Wigner transformation: Using fermionic
   methods for strongly correlated su(2) spin systems
SO JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS
AB The Jordan-Wigner transformation establishes a duality between su(2) and fermionic algebras. We present qualitative arguments and numerical evidence that when mapping spins to fermions, the transformation makes strong correlation weaker, as demonstrated by the Hartree-Fock approximation to the transformed Hamiltonian. This result can be rationalized in terms of rank reduction of spin shift terms when transformed to fermions. Conversely, the mapping of fermions to qubits makes strong correlation stronger, complicating its solution when one uses qubit-based correlators. The presence of string operators poses challenges to the implementation of quantum chemistry methods on classical computers, but these can be dealt with using established techniques of low computational cost. Our proof of principle results for XXZ and J(1)-J(2) Heisenberg (in 1D and 2D) indicates that the JW transformed fermionic Hamiltonian has reduced complexity in key regions of their phase diagrams and provides a better starting point for addressing challenging spin problems.

TI Improving quantum state detection with adaptive sequential observations
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB For many quantum systems intended for information processing, one detects the logical state of a qubit by integrating a continuously observed quantity over time. For example, ion and atom qubits are typically measured by driving a cycling transition and counting the number of photons observed from the resulting fluorescence. Instead of recording only the total observed count in a fixed time interval, one can observe the photon arrival times and get a state detection advantage by using the temporal structure in a model such as a hidden Markov model. We study what further advantage may be achieved by applying pulses to adaptively transform the state during the observation. We give a three-state example where adaptively chosen transformations yield a clear advantage, and we compare performances on an ion example, where we see improvements in some regimes. We provide a software package that can be used for exploration of temporally resolved strategies with and without adaptively chosen transformations.

TI Optical spin initialization and readout with a cavity-coupled quantum
   dot in an in-plane magnetic field
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB The spin of a charged semiconductor quantum dot (QD) coupled to an optical cavity is a promising candidate for high-fidelity spin-photon interfaces; the cavity selectively modifies the decay rates of optical transitions such that spin initialization, manipulation, and readout are all possible in a single magnetic field geometry. By performing cavity QED calculations, we show that a cavity with a single, linearly polarized mode can simultaneously support both high-fidelity optical spin initialization and readout in a single, in-plane (Voigt geometry) magnetic field. Furthermore, we demonstrate that single-mode cavities always outperform bimodal cavities in experimentally favorable driving regimes. Our analysis, when combined with established methods of control in a Voigt geometry field, provides optimal parameter regimes for high-fidelity initialization and readout, and coherent control in both cavity configurations, providing insights for the design and development of QD spin-photon interfaces as the basis of quantum network nodes and for the generation of photonic graph states.

TI Optimization of algorithmic errors in analog quantum simulations
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Analog quantum simulation is emerging as a powerful tool for uncovering classically unreachable physics such as many-body real-time dynamics. A complete quantification of uncertainties is necessary in order to make precise predictions using simulations on modern-day devices. Therefore, the inherent physical limitations of the device on the parameters of the simulation must be understood. This paper examines the interplay of errors arising from simulation of approximate time evolution with those due to practical, real-world device constraints. These errors are studied in Heisenberg-type systems on analog quantum devices described by the Ising Hamiltonian. A general framework for quantifying these errors is introduced and applied to several proposed time evolution methods, including Trotter-like methods and Floquet-engineered constant-field approaches. The limitations placed on the accuracy of time evolution methods by current devices are discussed. Characterization of the scaling of coherent effects of different error sources provides a way to extend the presented Hamiltonian engineering methods to take advantage of forthcoming device capabilities.

TI Manipulating synthetic gauge fluxes via multicolor dressing of
   Rydberg-atom arrays
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Arrays of highly excited Rydberg atoms can be used as powerful quantum simulation platforms. Here, we introduce an approach that makes it possible to implement fully controllable effective spin interactions in such systems. We show that optical Rydberg dressing with multicolor laser fields opens up distinct interaction channels that enable complete site-selective control of the induced interactions and favorable scaling with respect to decoherence. We apply this method to generate synthetic gauge fields for Rydberg excitations where the effective magnetic flux can be manipulated at the single-plaquette level by simply varying the phase of the local dressing field. The system can be mapped to a highly anisotropic Heisenberg model, and the resulting spin interaction opens the door for explorations of topological phenomena with nonlocal density interactions. A remarkable consequence of the interaction is the emergence of topologically protected long-range doublons, which exhibit strongly correlated motion in a chiral and robust manner.

TI Dark Excitonic State Preparation in a Symmetry-Protected Open Quantum
   Battery
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB Previous work (J. Phys. Chem. C 2019, 123, 18303) showed that excitation energy can be stored in a symmetry-protected dark state of an open quantum battery, without losses to the environment. However, how to prepare the battery in such a state remained unresolved. This study presents a charging protocol that uses a continuous-wave laser to excite the system from its ground state to a bright excited state just above the dark state, followed by relaxation into the target dark state. Turning off the laser after the dark state is populated preserves the stored energy indefinitely. It is also shown that different types of dephasing affect the charging process in distinct ways, with some proving detrimental while others have minimal or no impact. Overall, the results demonstrate a practical method for charging excitonic quantum batteries and show how symmetry and controlled dissipation can be used to enhance energy storage and stability.

TI General theory for extended-range percolation on simple and multiplex
   networks
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW E
AB Extended-range percolation is a robust percolation process that has relevance for quantum communication problems. In extended-range percolation nodes can be trusted or untrusted. Untrusted facilitator nodes are untrusted nodes that can still allow communication between trusted nodes if they lie on a path of distance at most R between two trusted nodes. In extended-range percolation the extended-range giant component (ERGC) includes trusted nodes connected by paths of trusted and untrusted facilitator nodes. Here, based on a message-passing algorithm, we develop a general theory of extended-range percolation, valid for arbitrary values of R as long as the networks are locally treelike. This general framework allows us to investigate the properties of extended-range percolation on interdependent multiplex networks. While the extended-range nature makes multiplex networks more robust, interdependency makes them more fragile. From the interplay between these two effects a rich phase diagram emerges including discontinuous phase transitions and reentrant phases. The theoretical predictions are in excellent agreement with extensive Monte Carlo simulations. The proposed exactly solvable model constitutes a fundamental reference for the study of models defined through properties of extended-range paths.

TI Comparative study between charge and spin thermoelectric figure of
   merits in molecular junctions with multiple loops

AB In this study, we examine the thermoelectric properties of a symmetrically connected naphthalene molecular junction with two Aharonov-Bohm (AB) fluxes. The flux-modulated hopping integrals introduce enhancement in transmission asymmetry and thermoelectric figure of merit. We compare charge- and spin-based thermoelectricity, emphasizing the higher efficiency of spin currents, which avoid heat dissipation. Additionally, we explore the effects of correlated disorder using diagonal and generalized Aubry-Andre-Harper potentials, revealing their impact on localization transitions and ZT enhancement. The interplay between AB fluxes and disorder offers tunable control over thermoelectric properties, leading to high-efficiency operation. Our results show significant improvements in ZT for both transport types under optimal conditions, providing insights into the design of advanced thermoelectric devices for next-generation energy conversion.<br /> (c) 2025 Author(s).

TI Ultranarrow electroluminescence from magnetic excitons in the van der
   Waals antiferromagnetic semiconductor NiPS3
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Electrically driven light emission from two-dimensional (2D) semiconducting materials has enabled numerous optoelectronic technologies, including light-emitting diodes, solid-state lasers, and single-photon sources for quantum communication. Here we report ultranarrow electroluminescence from the magnetic excitonic state of the van der Waals antiferromagnetic semiconductor NiPS3. This electroluminescence is enabled by the fabrication of gate-tunable NiPS3 devices that remain electrically conductive below the antiferromagnetic ordering temperature of 155 K, ultimately allowing field-effect mobilities of 1.3 cm2 V-1 s-1 and 4.5 cm2 V-1 s-1 to be directly measured at room temperature and 7 K, respectively. By applying a high-frequency square wave voltage to the gate electrode of the resulting field-effect transistors, electroluminescence is capacitively induced from the magnetic excitons of NiPS3. Due to the coupling of these excitons with the underlying NiPS3 antiferromagnetic order, the electroluminescence has an ultranarrow linewidth of 1 meV and a high degree of linear polarization (rho = 0.78). In addition to facilitating fundamental studies of the coupling between spin states and excitons in van der Waals magnetic semiconductors, this work will accelerate the development of emerging 2D opto-spintronic applications.

AB Lithium niobate (LNO) and lithium tantalate (LTO) see widespread use in fundamental research and commercial technologies reaching from electronics over classical optics to integrated quantum communication. The mixed crystal system lithium niobate tantalate (LNT) allows for the dedicate engineering of material properties by combining the advantages of the two parental materials LNO and LTO. Vibrational spectroscopies such as Raman spectroscopy or (Fourier transform) infrared (IR) spectroscopy are vital techniques to provide detailed insight into the material properties, which is central to the analysis and optimization of devices. This work presents a joint experimental-theoretical approach allowing to unambiguously assign the spectral features in the LNT material family through both Raman and IR spectroscopy, as well as providing an in-depth explanation for the observed scattering efficiencies based on first-principles calculations. The phononic contribution to the static dielectric tensor is calculated from the experimental and theoretical data using the generalized Lyddane-Sachs-Teller relation and compared with the results of the first-principles calculations.

TI Optimal control of large quantum systems: assessing memory and runtime
   performance of GRAPE
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS COMMUNICATIONS
AB Gradient Ascent Pulse Engineering (GRAPE) is a popular technique in quantum optimal control, and can be combined with automatic differentiation (AD) to facilitate on-the-fly evaluation of cost-function gradients. We illustrate that the convenience of AD comes at a significant memory cost due to the cumulative storage of a large number of states and propagators. For quantum systems of increasing Hilbert space size, this imposes a significant bottleneck. We revisit the strategy of hard-coding gradients in a scheme that fully avoids propagator storage and significantly reduces memory requirements. Separately, we present improvements to numerical state propagation to enhance runtime performance. We benchmark runtime and memory usage and compare this approach to AD-based implementations, with a focus on pushing towards larger Hilbert space sizes. The results confirm that the AD-free approach facilitates the application of optimal control for large quantum systems which would otherwise be difficult to tackle.

TI Heteroepitaxy of group IV materials for future device application
SO JAPANESE JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS
AB Heteroepitxy of group IV materials (Si, SiGe, and Ge) has great potential for boosting Si-based novel device performance because of the possibility for strain, band gap/Fermi-level engineering, and applying emerging artificial materials such as a superlattice (SL) and nanodots. In order to control group IV heteroepitaxy processes, strain, interface, and surface energies are very essential parameters. They affect dislocation formation, interface steepness, reflow of deposited layers, and also surface reaction itself during the growth. Therefore, process control and crystallinity management of SiGe heteroepitaxy are difficult especially in the case of high Ge concentrations. In this paper, we review our results of abrupt SiGe/Si interface fabrication by introducing C-delta layers and the influence of strain on the surface reaction of SiGe. Three-dimensional self-ordered SiGe and Ge nanodot fabrication by proactively using strain and surface energies by depositing SiGe/Si and Ge/SiGe SL are also reviewed.

TI Microscopic Theory of the Current-Voltage Characteristics of Josephson
   Tunnel Junctions
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Deep theoretical understanding of the electrical response of Josephson junctions is indispensable regarding both recent discoveries of new kinds of superconductivity and technological advances such as superconducting quantum computers. Here, we study the microscopic theory of the dc current-biased I-V characteristics of Josephson tunnel junctions. We derive an analytical formula of the I-V characteristics of generic junctions. We identify subharmonics of the I-V characteristics and their underlying mechanism as the feedback effect of intrinsic ac currents generated by voltage pulses in the past. We apply our theory to analytically solve the Werthamer equation and describe various dc current-biased I-V characteristics as a function of softening of the superconducting gap. Strikingly, we identify voltage staircases of the I-V characteristics in a genuine Josephson junction without ac current bias or qubit dynamics. Our general analytical formalism opens new avenues for a microscopic understanding of I-V characteristics of Josephson junctions that have been limited to phenomenological models so far.

TI Gate-defined wires in twisted bilayer graphene: From electrical
   detection of intervalley coherence to internally engineered Majorana
   modes
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB Twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) realizes a highly tunable, strongly interacting system featuring superconductivity and various correlated insulating states. We establish gate-defined wires in TBG with proximity-induced spin-orbit coupling as (i) a tool for revealing the nature of correlated insulators and (ii) a platform for Majoranabased topological qubits. We show that the band structure of a gate-defined wire immersed in an intervalley coherent correlated insulator inherits electrically detectable fingerprints of symmetry breaking native to the latter. Surrounding the wire by a superconducting TBG region on one side and an intervalley coherent correlated insulator on the other further enables the formation of Majorana zero modes-possibly even at zero magnetic field depending on the precise symmetry-breaking order present. Our proposal not only introduces a highly gate-tunable topological qubit medium relying on internally generated proximity effects but can also shed light on the Cooper-pairing mechanism in TBG.

TI Non-Markovian decoherence of a two-level system in a Lorentzian bosonic
   reservoir and a stochastic environment with finite correlation time
SO COMPUTER OPTICS
AB In this paper we investigate non-Markovian evolution of a two-level system (qubit) in a bosonic bath under influence of an external classical fluctuating environment. The interaction with the bath has the Lorentzian spectral density, and the fluctuating environment (stochastic field) is represented by a set of Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes. Each of the subenvironments of the composite environment is able to induce non-Markovian dynamics of the two-level system. By means of the numerically exact method of hierarchical equations of motion, we study steady states of the two-level system, evolution of the reduced density matrix and the equilibrium emission spectra in dependence on the frequency cutoffs and the coupling strengths of the subenvironments. Additionally, we investigate the impact of the rotating wave approximation (RWA) for the interaction with the bath on accuracy of the results.

TI Waveguide bandgap engineering with an array of superconducting qubits
SO NPJ QUANTUM MATERIALS
AB Waveguide quantum electrodynamics offers a wide range of possibilities to effectively engineer interactions between artificial atoms via a one-dimensional open waveguide. While these interactions have been experimentally studied in the few qubit limit, the collective properties of such systems for larger arrays of qubits in a metamaterial configuration has so far not been addressed. Here, we experimentally study a metamaterial made of eight superconducting transmon qubits with local frequency control coupled to the mode continuum of a waveguide. By consecutively tuning the qubits to a common resonance frequency we observe the formation of super- and subradiant states, as well as the emergence of a polaritonic bandgap. Making use of the qubits quantum nonlinearity, we demonstrate control over the latter by inducing a transparency window in the bandgap region of the ensemble. The circuit of this work extends experiments with one and two qubits toward a full-blown quantum metamaterial, thus paving the way for large-scale applications in superconducting waveguide quantum electrodynamics.

TI Demonstration of Algorithmic Quantum Speedup for an Abelian Hidden
   Subgroup Problem
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW X
AB Simon's problem is to find a hidden period (a bitstring) encoded into an unknown 2-to-1 function. It is one of the earliest problems for which an exponential quantum speedup was proven for ideal, noiseless quantum computers, albeit in the oracle model. Here, using two different 127-qubit IBM Quantum superconducting processors, we demonstrate an algorithmic quantum speedup for a variant of Simon's problem where the hidden period has a restricted Hamming weight w. For sufficiently small values of w and for circuits involving up to 58 qubits, we demonstrate an exponential speedup, albeit of a lower quality than the speedup predicted for the noiseless algorithm. The speedup exponent and the range of w values for which an exponential speedup exists are significantly enhanced when the computation is protected by dynamical decoupling. Further enhancement is achieved with measurement error mitigation. This case constitutes a demonstration of a bona fide quantum advantage for an Abelian hidden subgroup problem.

TI Design of high-performance entangling logic in silicon quantum dot
   systems with Bayesian optimization
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Device engineering based on computer-aided simulations is essential to make silicon (Si) quantum bits (qubits) be competitive to commercial platforms based on superconductors and trapped ions. Combining device simulations with the Bayesian optimization (BO), here we propose a systematic design approach that is quite useful to procure fast and precise entangling operations of qubits encoded to electron spins in electrode-driven Si quantum dot (QD) systems. For a target problem of the controlled-X (CNOT) logic operation, we employ BO with the Gaussian process regression to evolve design factors of a Si double QD system to the ones that are optimal in terms of speed and fidelity of a CNOT logic driven by a single microwave pulse. The design framework not only clearly contributes to cost-efficient securing of solutions that enhance performance of the target quantum operation, but can be extended to implement more complicated logics with Si QD structures in experimentally unprecedented ways.

TI Finite-Time Quantum Landauer Principle and Quantum Coherence
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB The Landauer principle states that any logically irreversible information processing must be accompanied by dissipation into the environment. In this Letter, we investigate the heat dissipation associated with finitetime information erasure and the effect of quantum coherence in such processes. By considering a scenario wherein information is encoded in an open quantum system whose dynamics are described by the Markovian Lindblad equation, we show that the dissipated heat is lower bounded by the conventional Landauer cost, as well as a correction term inversely proportional to the operational time. To clarify the relation between quantum coherence and dissipation, we derive a lower bound for heat dissipation in terms of quantum coherence. This bound quantitatively implies that the creation of quantum coherence in the energy eigenbasis during the erasure process inevitably leads to additional heat costs. The obtained bounds hold for arbitrary operational time and control protocol. By following an optimal control theory, we numerically present an optimal protocol and illustrate our findings by using a single-qubit system.

TI Quantum Hamiltonian Identification With Classical Colored Measurement
   Noise
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON CONTROL SYSTEMS TECHNOLOGY
AB In this brief, we present a Hamiltonian-identification method for a closed quantum system whose time-trace observables are measured with colored measurement noise. The dynamics of the quantum system are described by a Liouville equation that can be converted into a coherence vector representation. Since the measurement process is disturbed by classical colored noise, we introduce an augmented system model to describe the total dynamics, where the classical colored noise is parameterized. Based on the augmented system model as well as the measurement data, we can find a realization of the quantum system with unknown parameters by employing an eigenstate-realization algorithm. The unknown parameters can be identified using a transfer-function-based technique. An example of a two-qubit system with colored measurement noise is shown to verify the effectiveness of our method.

TI Tunable single-photon nonreciprocal scattering and targeted router in a
   giant atom-waveguide system with chiral couplings
SO COMMUNICATIONS IN THEORETICAL PHYSICS
AB We investigate the single-photon scattering properties of a driven three-level giant atom chirally coupled to two waveguides simultaneously in both the Markovian and the non-Markovian regimes. It is shown that under the Markovian limit, the chiral photon-atom interactions enable nonreciprocal scattering in a single waveguide and targeted photon routing with a probability of 100% in two waveguides, while the presence of the driving field and the giant atom structure introduce a more tunable parameter to manipulate the single-photon scattering behaviors. We also examine how the non-reciprocity and routing capability are influenced by the imperfect chirality and the atomic dissipation. In the non-Markovian regime, we show that the scattering behaviors are more complicated. The non-Markovicity induced non-reciprocity and photon routing are demonstrated in this paper. We believe that those results have potential applications in quantum network engineering.

   ergodicity
SO NATURE
AB The dynamics of quantum many-body systems is characterized by quantum observables that are reconstructed from correlation functions at separate points in space and time(1-3). In dynamics with fast entanglement generation, however, quantum observables generally become insensitive to the details of the underlying dynamics at long times due to the effects of scrambling. To circumvent this limitation and enable access to relevant dynamics in experimental systems, repeated time-reversal protocols have been successfully implemented(4). Here we experimentally measure the second-order out-of-time-order correlators (OTOC(2))(5-18) on a superconducting quantum processor and find that they remain sensitive to the underlying dynamics at long timescales. Furthermore, OTOC(2) manifests quantum correlations in a highly entangled quantum many-body system that are inaccessible without time-reversal techniques. This is demonstrated through an experimental protocol that randomizes the phases of Pauli strings in the Heisenberg picture by inserting Pauli operators during quantum evolution. The measured values of OTOC(2) are substantially changed by the protocol, thereby revealing constructive interference between Pauli strings that form large loops in the configuration space. The observed interference mechanism also endows OTOC(2) with high degrees of classical simulation complexity. These results, combined with the capability of OTOC(2) in unravelling useful details of quantum dynamics, as shown through an example of Hamiltonian learning, indicate a viable path to practical quantum advantage.

TI Realizing a rapidly switched Unruh-DeWitt detector through electro-optic
   sampling of the electromagnetic vacuum
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
AB A new theoretical framework to describe the experimental advances in electro-optic detection of broadband quantum states, specifically the quantum vacuum, is devised. Electro-optic sampling is a technique in ultrafast photonics which, when transferred into the quantum domain, can be utilized to resolve properties of a sampled quantum state via its interaction with a strong coherent probe pulse at ultrafast timescales. By making use of fundamental concepts from quantum field theory on spacetime metrics, the nonlinear interaction behind the electro-optic effect is shown to be equivalent to a stationary Unruh-DeWitt detector coupled to a conjugate field during a very short time interval. When the coupling lasts for a time interval comparable to the oscillation periods of the detected field mode (i.e., the subcycle regime), virtual particles inhabiting the field vacuum are transferred to the detector in the form of real excitation. We demonstrate that this behavior can be rigorously translated to the scenario of electro-optic sampling of the quantum vacuum, in which the (spectrally filtered) probe works as an Unruh-DeWitt detector, with its interaction-generated photons arising from virtual particles inhabiting the electromagnetic vacuum. Our analysis accurately encapsulates the quantum nature of the vacuum, and we propose the specific working regime in which we can experimentally verify the existence of virtual photons with quantum correlations in the electromagnetic ground state.

TI Chiral SQUID-metamaterial waveguide for circuit-QED
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB Superconducting metamaterials, which are designed and fabricated with structured fundamental circuit elements, have motivated recent developments of exploring unconventional quantum phenomena in circuit quantum electrodynamics (circuit-QEDs). We propose a method to engineer 1D Josephson metamaterial as a chiral waveguide by considering a programmed spatiotemporal modulation on its effective impedance. The modulation currents are in the form of travelling waves which phase velocities are much slower than the propagation speed of microwave photons. Due to the Brillouin-scattering process, non-trivial spectrum regimes where photons can propagate unidirectionally emerge. Considering superconducting qubits coupling with this metamaterial waveguide, we analyze both Markovian and non-Markovian quantum dynamics, and find that superconducting qubits can dissipate photons unidirectionally. Moreover, we show that our proposal can be extended a cascaded quantum network with multiple nodes, where chiral photon transport between remote qubits can be realized. Our work might open the possibilities to exploit SQUID metamaterials for realizing unidirectional photon transport in circuit-QED platforms.

TI Sputtering mode diagram for the precise growth of NbN superconductor
   films
SO NANO RESEARCH
AB The sputtering mode diagram (SMD) provides a powerful tool for comprehensive structure engineering of functional films in developing advanced electronic devices, but has not reported due to the complexity of dynamic process and multi-parameters. Here, we report the SMD of superconductor niobium nitride (NbN) films with reactive magnetron sputtering. Poisoned mode, competing mode, and metallic mode are drawn by the boundaries identified by the current-voltage curves of the sputtering system in the SMD, by which the phase structures and electronic properties of the NbN films can be precisely engineered. Typically, 9-nm-thick NbN films grown in the optimal poisoned and competing modes are applied for superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors (SNSPDs). The as-fabricated SNSPDs have flexible performances with saturated quantum efficiency and small kinetic inductance, which enables precise manipulation of the sensitivity and speed from the SMD. This work is also providing guidance for the research of other functional films and electronic devices, which can undoubtedly promote its practical application such as dark matter detection and high-speed quantum communication.

AB Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger states on two to eight qubits in a chain of ten 171Yb+ ions in a linear Paul trap has been prepared by executing a sequence of one- and two-qubit operations on the corresponding ions. The obtained states have been analyzed and their fidelity for the Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger state on eight qubits has been estimated at (58.9 +/- 0.6)%. The expected increase in the sensitivity of parity oscillations as a function of the phase of the probe laser pulse has also been demonstrated.

TI Time dependent Markovian master equation beyond the adiabatic limit
SO QUANTUM
AB We derive a Markovian master equation that models the evolution of systems subject to driving and control fields. and weak-coupling limits for the systemenvironment interaction with a secular approximation. The derivation makes use of the adiabatic time-evolution operator in a manner that allows for the efficient description of strong driving, while recovering the well-known adiabatic master equation in the appropriate limit. To illustrate the effectiveness of our approach, firstly we apply it to the paradigmatic case of a twolevel (qubit) system subject to a form of periodic driving that remains unsolvable using a Floquet representation and lastly we extend this scenario to the situation of two interacting qubits, the first driven while the second one directly in contact with the environment. We demonstrate the reliability and broad scope of our approach by benchmarking the solutions of the derived reduced time evolution against numerically exact simulations using tenconditions that must be satisfied by phederivations.

TI Toward Low-Power Cryogenic Metal-Oxide Semiconductor Field-Effect
   Transistors
SO PHYSICA STATUS SOLIDI A-APPLICATIONS AND MATERIALS SCIENCE
AB Herein, cryogenic field-effect transistors (FETs) are discussed. In particular, the saturation of the subthreshold swing due to band tailing is studied. It is shown with simulations and experiments that engineering of the oxide-channel interfaces and a strong increase of the gate oxide capacitance are effective in improving the switching behavior of the device. The implication of scaling the oxide capacitance on the power consumption of cryogenic devices is investigated, too. Furthermore, an alternative for conventional doping in cryogenic transistors is discussed. Based on synchrotron X-Ray absorption spectroscopy at total fluorescence (XAS-TFY) and ultraviolet photoemission spectroscopy (UPS) measurements, it is shown experimentally that in true nanoscale devices, a simple SiO 2 $\left(\text{SiO}\right)_{2}$ coating yields a shift of the conduction band that is equivalent to a very high dopant concentration. As a result, nanoscale cryogenic steep slope FETs with strongly improved electrical characteristics become feasible.

TI Quantum transport in graphene nanoribbon networks: complexity reduction
   by a network decimation algorithm
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB We study electronic quantum transport (QT) in graphene nanoribbon (GNR) networks on mesoscopic length scales. We focus on zigzag GNRs and investigate the conductance properties of statistical networks. To this end we use a density-functional-based tight-binding model to determine the electronic structure and QT theory to calculate electronic transport properties. We then introduce a new efficient network decimation algorithm that reduces the complexity in generic three-dimensional GNR networks. We compare our results to semi-classical calculations based on the nodal analysis (NA) approach and discuss the dependence of the conductance on network density and network size. We show that a NA model cannot reproduce the QT results nor their dependence on model parameters well. Thus, solving the quantum network by our efficient approach is mandatory for accurate modelling the electron transport through GNR networks.

TI Long-lifetime spin excitations near domain walls in 1T-TaS2
SO PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF
   AMERICA
AB Spin chains in solid state materials are quintessential quantum systems with potential applications in spin-based logic, memory, quantum communication, and computation. A critical challenge is the experimental determination of spin lifetimes with the ultimate goal of increasing it. Local measurements by scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) have demonstrated the importance of decoupling spins from their environment, with markedly improved lifetimes in spin chains on the surfaces of band insulators. In this work we use low-temperature scanning tunneling microscopy to reveal long-lifetime excitations in a chain of spin-1/2 electrons embedded in a charge density wave Mott insulator, 1T-TaS2. Naturally occurring domain walls trap chains of localized spin-1/2 electrons in nearby sites, whose energies lie inside the Mott gap. Spin-polarized measurements on these sites show distinct two-level switching noise, as well as negative differential resistance in the dI/dV spectra, typically associated with spin fluctuations. The excitations show exceptionally long lifetimes of a few seconds at 300 mK. Our work suggests that layered Mott insulators in the chalcogenide family, which are amenable to exfoliation and lithography, may provide a viable platform for quantum applications.

TI The role of tunable nonlinear dark resonances on vacuum Rabi splitting
   and optical bistability in an atom-cavity system
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB The phenomenon of "dark resonances" is a well-known concept in quantum optics and laser spectroscopy. As a general rule, interactions involving in such a "dark state" lead to multiple quantum superposition states that interact coherently and are undesirable. In this paper, two types nonlinear interaction in an atomic cavity, namely the nested and cascaded interactions, are theoretically analyzed how the dark resonances form the dark state peak to modulate the vacuum Rabi splitting (VRS) and optical bistability (OB) behavior. In both the zero- and high order modes, there are four VRS peaks generated in the nested interaction and three in the cascade interaction. Dark resonance can modulate not only the peak number of VRS, but also the OB thresholds. It is found that dark state can determine the asymmetric OB distribution of nested type and symmetric OB distribution of cascade type. Besides that, the distinctive OB thresholds in two kinds of interaction also be studied. The observations not only conceptually extend the conventional "dark resonances" phenomenon, but also opens the door for a variety of new applications in tunable all-optical switch and quantum communication.

TI Collecting Telecom Photons From Circular Bragg Gratings Using Optical
   Fibers and 3D Printed Micro-Lenses
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB Deterministic sources of quantum light are becoming increasingly relevant in the development of quantum communication, particularly in deployed fiber networks. Therefore, efficient fiber-coupled sources at telecom wavelength are highly sought after. With this goal in mind, the fiber coupling performance of quantum dots is systematically investigated in optical resonators under three experimental configurations. For the first time coupling efficiency and sensitivity are quantified to spatial displacement for single-mode fibers with 3D printed optics on their tip, and benchmark their behavior over a commercial cleaved-cut fiber and a standard optical setup. The reduction of the required optical elements when operating with a lensed or a bare fiber allows for an increased end-to-end efficiency over a standard setup. For the perspective of realizing a mechanically stable fiber-coupled source, the spatial tolerance is precisely quantified to fiber-cavity misalignment, observing less than count rate drop for several micrometers displacement. In the spirit of precise quantification and reproducibility, the experiments are performed on multiple photonic resonators. These results will play a key role in the future development of fiber-coupled sources of quantum light.

TI A Quantum Annealer for Subset Feature Selection and the Classification
   of Hyperspectral Images
SO IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE
   SENSING
AB Hyperspectral images (HSIs) showing objects belonging to several distinct target classes are characterized by dozens of spectral bands being available. However, some of these spectral bands are redundant and/or noisy, and hence, selecting highly informative and trustworthy bands for each class is a vital step for classification and for saving internal storage space; then the selected bands are termed a highly informative spectral band subset. We use a mutual information (MI)-based method to select the spectral band subset of a given class and two additional binary quantum classifiers, namely a quantum boost (Qboost) and a quantum boost plus (Qboost-Plus) classifier, to classify a two-label dataset characterized by the selected band subset. We pose both our MI-based band subset selection problem and the binary quantum classifiers as a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) problem. Such a quadratic problem is solvable with the help of conventional optimization techniques. However, the QUBO problem is an NP-hard global optimization problem, and hence, it is worthwhile for applying a quantum annealer. Thus, we adapted our MI-based optimization problem for selecting highly informative bands for each class of a given HSI to be run on a D-Wave quantum annealer. After the selection of these highly informative bands for each class, we employ our binary quantum classifiers to a two-label dataset on the D-Wave quantum annealer. In addition, we provide a novel multilabel classifier exploiting an error-encoding output code when using our binary quantum classifiers. As a real-world dataset in Earth observation, we used the well-known AVIRIS HSI of Indian Pine, north-western Indiana, USA. We can demonstrate that the MI-based band subset selection problem can be run on a D-Wave quantum annealer that selects the highly informative spectral band subset for each target class in the Indian Pine HSI. We can also prove that our binary quantum classifiers and our novel multilabel classifier generate a correct two- and multilabel dataset characterized by their selected bands and with high accuracy such as having been produced by conventional classifiers-and even better in some instances.

TI Visible Light Communication for Underwater Applications: Principles,
   Challenges, and Future Prospects
SO PHOTONICS
AB Underwater wireless communications face significant challenges due to high attenuation, turbulence, and water turbidity. Traditional methods like acoustic and radio frequency (RF) communication suffer from low data rates (<100 kbps), high latency (>1 s), and limited transmission distances (<10 km).Visible Light Communication (VLC) emerges as a promising alternative, offering high-speed data transmission (up to 5 Gbps), low latency (<1 ms), and immunity to electromagnetic interference. This paper provides an in-depth review of underwater VLC, covering fundamental principles, environmental factors (scattering, absorption), and dynamic water properties. We analyze modulation techniques, including adaptive and hybrid schemes (QAM-OFDM achieving 4.92 Gbps over 1.5 m), and demonstrate their superiority over conventional methods. Practical applications-underwater exploration, autonomous vehicle control, and environmental monitoring-are discussed alongside security challenges. Key findings highlight UVLC's ability to overcome traditional limitations, with experimental results showing 500 Mbps over 150 m using PAM4 modulation. Future research directions include integrating quantum communication and Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RISs) to further enhance performance, with simulations projecting 40% improved spectral efficiency in turbulent conditions.

TI Control of dual-channel optical bistability in a carbon nanotube
   nanoresonator coupled with a metallic nanoshell
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB We theoretically present a flexible method to obtain dual-channel optical bistability (OB) in a coupled system consisting of a metallic nanoshell (MNS) and a carbon nanotube (CNT) nanomechanical resonator (NR) beyond the dipole approximation. The MNS is made of a metallic core and a dielectric shell. The results show that, the four-wave mixing signal is suppressed significantly due to multipole polarizations in comparison to that in the dipole approximation. Also, the four-wave mixing signal can be enhanced greatly with the exciton-phonon coupling strength g increasing. Especially, bistability phase diagrams plotted show that, for a given shell thickness, it is realizable to achieve one (or two) bistable region(s) by adjusting the pumping intensity (or the MNS-NR distance). In a strong exciton-plasmon coupling regime, OB can be switched from single-channel to dual-channel by only changing the dielectric shell thickness or the metallic core radius. This indicates that the system proposed can behave as a channel-tunable bistable switch. Our findings may have potential applications in various domains such as quantum communication and optical functional devices.

TI Direct writing of divacancy centers in silicon carbide by femtosecond
   laser irradiation and subsequent thermal annealing
SO APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS
AB Divacancy (VSiVC) centers in silicon carbide (SiC) have potential applications in quantum communication and sensing due to their attractive optical and spin properties. To realize many of these divacancy-based quantum applications, it is vital that they are created in prescribed locations with high accuracy. Here, we describe the production of arrays of divacancy centers in 4H polytype SiC (4H-SiC) by femtosecond laser irradiation and subsequent thermal annealing. We optically characterized these divacancy centers by photoluminescence (PL) confocal mapping using a custom-built confocal microscope. The created divacancy centers show a bright stable emission that depends on the pulse energy of the femtosecond laser. PL spectra of the divacancy centers were collected using micro-Raman spectroscopy at the low temperature of 4.2 K and room temperature. The effect of thermal annealing was studied at various temperatures from 500 & DEG;C to 1000 & DEG;C and showed that the maximum divacancy center PL intensity was achieved at 800 & DEG;C. These and the aforementioned measurements show that the femtosecond laser writing method enables divacancy centers to be accurately positioned in 4H-SiC.

TI InP-based single-photon sources operating at telecom C-band with
   increased extraction efficiency
SO APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS
AB In this work, we demonstrate a triggered single-photon source operating at the telecom C-band with photon extraction efficiency exceeding any reported values in this range. The non-classical light emission with low probability of the multiphoton events is realized with single InAs quantum dots (QDs) grown by molecular beam epitaxy and embedded directly in an InP matrix. Low QD spatial density on the order of 5 x 10(8) cm(-2) to similar to 2 x 10(9) cm(-2) and symmetric shape of these nanostructures together with spectral range of emission make them relevant for quantum communication applications. The engineering of extraction efficiency is realized by combining a bottom distributed Bragg reflector consisting of 25 pairs of InP/In0.53Ga0.37Al0.1 As layers and cylindrical photonic confinement structures. Realization of such a technologically non-demanding approach even in a non-deterministic fashion results in photon extraction efficiency of (13.3 +/- 2) % into 0.4 numerical aperture detection optics at approximately 1560 nm emission wavelength, i.e., close to the center of the telecom C-band.

TI Quantum-Satellite Resource-Scheduling Strategy Based on Hybrid- Immunity
   and Simulated-Annealing Algorithm
SO LASER & OPTOELECTRONICS PROGRESS
AB By embedding quantum bits into satellites, low-orbit quantum satellites enable highly secure communications, thus protecting information from eavesdropping and tampering. Currently, quantum-satellite resources are few, and two decision-making attributes of candidate quantum satellites are prioritized, i.e., service time and signal strength, to reasonably allocate the existing quantum-satellite resources such that the normal business requirements of end-users are satisfied. In this study, to minimize the interference of X-ray flares, a star-ground quantum-communication-link fading model under the interference of X-ray flares was constructed, and a quantum-satellite resource scheduling strategy based on a hybrid-immunity and simulated-annealing algorithm was proposed by combining the remaining service time of quantum satellites and their signal strengths based on three decision-making attributes, which were used as the objective function of the system model. The results show that the strategy offers better convergence stability and load balancing than the unimproved-immune and simulated-annealing algorithm, thus providing useful reference for the efficient utilization of quantum-satellite resources and the switching of low-orbit quantum satellites under the interference of X-ray flares.

TI Adjoint-Optimized Large Dielectric Metasurface for Enhanced Purcell
   Factor and Directional Photon Emission
SO ACS OMEGA
AB Extracting photons efficiently from quantum sources, such as atoms, molecules, and quantum dots, is crucial for various nanophotonic systems used in quantum communication, sensing, and computation. To improve the performance of these systems, it is not only necessary to provide an environment that maximizes the number of optical modes, but it is also desirable to guide the extracted light toward specific directions. One way to achieve this goal is to use a large area metasurface that can steer the beam. Previous work has used small aperture devices that are fundamentally limited in their ability to achieve high directivity. This work proposes an adjoint-based topology optimization approach to design a large light extractor that can enhance the spontaneous decay rate of the embedded quantum transition and collimate the extracted photons. With the help of this approach, we present all-dielectric metasurfaces for a quantum transition emitting at lambda = 600 nm. These metasurfaces achieve a broadband improvement of spontaneous emission compared to that in the vacuum, reaching a 10x enhancement at the design frequency. Furthermore, they can beam the extracted light into a narrow cone (+/- 10 degrees) along a desired direction that is predefined through their respective design process.

TI First-Principles Investigation of the T- and M-Centers in Silicon Using
   Meta-GGA Functionals
SO ADVANCED THEORY AND SIMULATIONS
AB Quantum defects in silicon (Si), particularly the T-center, have emerged as a promising spin-photon interface and single-photon emitter for quantum communication applications, due to their telecom-compatible emission and favorable spin coherent properties. Recent advances have enabled the detailed characterization of these centers in Si, and the discovery of quantum defects in Si is especially important due to their high processability and compatibility with current technologies. Here, a systematic study of the T-center and, more importantly, an unexplored related defect, the M-center, is presented using density functional theory (DFT) with the meta-GGA functional r2SCAN. For the already studied T-center, the findings against the established hybrid functional HSE06 results are extensively discussed. The calculations on the T-center demonstrate excellent agreement with the HSE06, reinforcing the efficiency of meta-GGA approaches for accurate defect characterization in Si. Moreover, the M-center is introduced and characterized, revealing promising quantum optical properties. Both centers are found to arise from a bound exciton configuration, and for this process the zero-phonon line (ZPL) and the zero-field splitting (ZFS) are calculated.

TI High-speed waveguide lateral Ge/Si avalanche photodetector for C-band
   and L-band
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Germanium/silicon (Ge/Si) avalanche photodiodes (APDs) have been intensively investigated and are widely used in various fields, such as near-infrared detection and quantum communication. However, existing research of Ge/Si APDs mostly focuses on a single optical communication band. The influence of wavelengths has not been studied. In this paper, we propose a lateral separate absorption multiplication (SAM) APD and conduct an in-depth research into the performance of Ge/Si APDs at different wavelengths. We reveal a significant enhancement in the performance of Ge/Si APDs at L-band (1600 nm) compared to the C-band (1550 nm). A gain-bandwidth product of 279 GHz corresponding to a gain of 18.4 and a bandwidth of 15.2 GHz are achieved at 1600 nm. Through systematic experimental design and theoretical analysis, we evaluate the mechanisms of the higher gain, providing insights into its potential applications in the field of optical communication. This study holds significant implications for expanding the application scope of Ge/Si APDs in optical communication, providing experimental support for their superior performance at higher wavelengths and potentially driving advancements in related technologies.

TI Design of cost-effective environment-responsive nanoacoustic devices
   based on mesoporous thin films
SO OPTICAL MATERIALS EXPRESS
AB Gigahertz acoustic resonators have the potential to advance data processing and quantum communication. However, they are expensive and lack responsiveness to external stimuli, limiting their use in sensing applications. In contrast, low-cost nanoscale mesoporous materials, known for their high surface-to-volume ratio, have shown promise in various applications. We recently demonstrated that mesoporous silicon dioxide (SiO2) and titanium dioxide (TiO2) thin layers can support coherent acoustic modes in the 5 to 100 GHz range. In this study, we propose a new method for designing tunable acoustic resonators using mesoporous thin films on acoustic distributed Bragg reflectors. By simulating the infiltration of the pores with water, we show that the material's properties could be altered and achieve tunability in the acoustic resonances. We present four device designs and use simulations to predict resonators with Q-factors up to 1500. We also observe that the resonant frequency and intensity show a linear response to water infiltrated in the mesopores, with a tunability of up to 60%. Our platform offers a unique opportunity to design cost-effective nanoacoustic sensing and reconfigurable optoacoustic nanodevices.

TI Classification of Joint Quantum Measurements Based on Entanglement Cost
   of Localization
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW X
AB Despite their importance in quantum theory, joint quantum measurements remain poorly understood. An intriguing conceptual and practical question is whether joint quantum measurements on separated systems can be performed without bringing them together. Remarkably, by using shared entanglement, this can be achieved perfectly when disregarding the postmeasurement state. However, existing localization protocols typically require unbounded entanglement. In this work, we address the fundamental question: "Which joint measurements can be localized with a finite amount of entanglement?" We develop finite-resource versions of teleportation-based schemes and analytically classify all two-qubit measurements that can be localized in the first levels of the resulting hierarchies. These levels include several measurements with exceptional properties and symmetries, such as the Bell state measurement and the elegant joint measurement. This leads us to propose a systematic classification of joint measurements based on entanglement cost, which we argue directly connects with the complexity of implementing those measurements. We illustrate how to numerically explore higher levels and construct generalizations to higher dimensions and multipartite settings.

TI Quantum theory of Bloch oscillations in a resistively shunted transmon
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB A transmon qubit embedded in a high-impedance environment acts in a way dual to a conventional Josephson junction. In analogy to the AC Josephson effect, biasing of the transmon by a direct current leads to the oscillations of voltage across it. These oscillations are known as the Bloch oscillations. We find the Bloch oscillations spectrum, and show that the zero-point fluctuations of charge make it broadband. Despite having a broad-band spectrum, Bloch oscillations can be brought in resonance with an external microwave radiation. The resonances lead to steps in the voltage-current relation, which are dual to the conventional Shapiro steps. We find how the shape of the steps depends on the environment impedance R, parameters of the transmon, and the microwave amplitude. The Bloch oscillations rely on the insulating state of the transmon which is realized at impedances exceeding the Schmid transition point, R > R-Q = h/(2e)(2).

TI Observing a topological transition in weak-measurement-induced geometric
   phases
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Measurement plays a quintessential role in the control of quantum systems. Beyond initialization and readout which pertain to projective measurements, weak measurements, in particular through their back action on the system, may enable various levels of coherent control. The latter ranges from observing quantum trajectories to state dragging and steering. Furthermore, just like the adiabatic evolution of quantum states that is known to induce the Berry phase, sequential weak measurements may lead to path-dependent geometric phases. Here we measure the geometric phases induced by sequences of weak measurements and demonstrate a topological transition in the geometric phase controlled by measurement strength. This connection between weak measurement-induced quantum dynamics and topological transitions reveals subtle topological features in measurement-based manipulation of quantum systems. Our protocol could be implemented for classes of operations (e.g., braiding) that are topological in nature. Furthermore, our results open new horizons for measurement-enabled quantum control of many-body topological states.

TI Machine learning pipeline for quantum state estimation with incomplete
   measurements
SO MACHINE LEARNING-SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Two-qubit systems typically employ 36 projective measurements for high-fidelity tomographic estimation. The overcomplete nature of the 36 measurements suggests possible robustness of the estimation procedure to missing measurements. In this paper, we explore the resilience of machine-learning-based quantum state estimation techniques to missing measurements by creating a pipeline of stacked machine learning models for imputation, denoising, and state estimation. When applied to simulated noiseless and noisy projective measurement data for both pure and mixed states, we demonstrate quantum state estimation from partial measurement results that outperforms previously developed machine-learning-based methods in reconstruction fidelity and several conventional methods in terms of resource scaling. Notably, our developed model does not require training a separate model for each missing measurement, making it potentially applicable to quantum state estimation of large quantum systems where preprocessing is computationally infeasible due to the exponential scaling of quantum system dimension.

TI Active optomechanics
SO COMMUNICATIONS PHYSICS
AB Cavity optomechanics explores the coupling between optical and mechanical modes mediated by the radiation pressure force. Unlike the passive scheme, the active optomechanics with optical gain directly imposes the mechanical motion upon the lasing dynamics, unveiling the intrinsic properties determined by the system itself. Here we numerically explore the general characteristics of the active optomechanics. The effects of the mechanical oscillation on the macroscopic laser include introducing multiple unstable regimes in the lasing phase, shifting the laser central frequency, broadening the laser spectrum, and degrading the laser frequency stability. Reducing the optical gain down to one active atom highlights the quantum nature of atom-cavity and photon-phonon interactions. The one-atom optomechanical microlaser does not only emit nonclassical photons but also generate nonclassical photon-phonon pairs. Our work extends the cavity optomechanics to the active fashion, paving the way towards optomechanical light sources for photonic integrated circuits, on-chip quantum communication, and biosensing.
   Active optomechanics offers a route to precise microscopic sensing by measuring the intrinsic laser dynamics. Here, the principles of active optomechanics are studied numerically at the limit of a single active atom, opening a path to quantum applications.

TI Partially coherent spontaneous parametric downconversion: Twisted
   Gaussian biphotons
SO AVS QUANTUM SCIENCE
AB Partially coherent optical beams present phenomena that may not appear in perfectly coherent beams. In this regard, spontaneous parametric downconversion is an intriguing physical process, since the optical properties of the pump laser beam are transferred to the quantum properties of the down-converted photon pairs. Here, the authors study the transfer of twist phase, a novel property of the so-called twisted Gaussian Schell model beams, from a pump beam to down-converted photons. The authors show that a non-zero twist phase can lead to highly entangled yet highly mixed states. The correlations that appear in near/far-field intensity measurements, in the two-photon covariance matrix as well as in orbital angular momentum modes, are explored. The authors derive expressions for the purity of the two-photon state and relate it to the transverse spatial coherence of the pump beam. Their main results utilize a Wigner function formalism that can be applied to a number of scenarios involving partially coherent downconversion sources and contribute to the recent interest in spatially correlated photon pairs produced in mixed states, with possible applications in quantum communication and imaging.

TI Atomically Precise Detection and Manipulation of Nitrogen-Vacancy
   Centers in Nanodiamonds
SO ACS NANO
AB Nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in nanodiamonds are a promising quantum communication system offering robust and discrete single photon emission, but a more thorough understanding of properties of the NV centers is critical for real world implementation in functional devices. The first step to understanding how factors such as surface, depth, and charge state affect NV center properties is to directly characterize these defects on the atomic scale. Here we use Angstrom-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) to identify a single NV center in a similar to 4 nm natural nanodiamond through simultaneous acquisition of electron energy loss and energy dispersive X-ray spectra, which provide a characteristic NV center peak and a nitrogen peak, respectively. In addition, we identify NV centers in larger, similar to 15 nm synthetic nanodiamonds, although without the single-defect resolution afforded by the lower background of the smaller natural nanodiamonds. We have further demonstrated the potential to directly position these technologically relevant defects at the atomic scale using the scanning electron beam to "herd" NV centers and nitrogen atoms across their host nanodiamonds.

TI Sub-2 Kelvin Characterization of Nitrogen-Vacancy Centers in Silicon
   Carbide Nanopillars
SO ACS PHOTONICS
AB The development of efficient quantum communication technologies depends on the innovation in multiple layers of its implementation, a challenge we address from the fundamental properties of the physical system at the nanoscale to the instrumentation level at the macroscale. We select a promising near-infrared quantum emitter, the nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in 4H-SiC, and integrate it, at an ensemble level, with nanopillar structures that enhance photon collection efficiency into an objective lens. Moreover, changes in collection efficiency in pillars compared to bulk can serve as indicators of color center orientation in the lattice. To characterize NV center properties at the unprecedented sub-2 K temperatures, we incorporate compatible superconducting nanowire single photon detectors inside the chamber of an optical cryostat and create the ICECAP, the Integrated Cryogenic system for Emission, Collection And Photon detection. ICECAP measurements show no significant line-width broadening of NV ensemble emission and up to 14-fold enhancement in collected emission. With additional filtering, we measure emitter lifetimes of NV centers in a basal (hk) and axial (kk) orientation, unveiling their cryogenic values of 2.2 and 2.8 ns.

TI Open-Cavity in Closed-Cycle Cryostat as a Quantum Optics Platform
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB The introduction of an optical resonator can enable efficient and precise interaction between a photon and a solid-state emitter. It facilitates the study of strong light-matter interaction, polaritonic physics and presents a powerful interface for quantum communication and computing. A pivotal aspect in the progress of light-matter interaction with solid-state systems is the challenge of combining the requirements of cryogenic temperature and high mechanical stability against vibrations while maintaining sufficient degrees of freedom for in situ tunability. Here, we present a fiber-based open Fabry-Perot cavity in a closed-cycle cryostat exhibiting ultrahigh mechanical stability while providing wide-range tunability in all three spatial directions. We characterize the setup and demonstrate the operation with the root-mean-square cavity-length fluctuation of less than 90 pm at temperature of 6.5 K and integration bandwidth of 100 kHz. Finally, we benchmark the cavity performance by demonstrating the strong-coupling formation of exciton polaritons in monolayer WSe2 with a cooperativity of 1.6. This set of results manifests the open cavity in a closed-cycle cryostat as a versatile and powerful platform for low-temperature cavity QED experiments.

TI Symmetry-Protected Topological Phases of Mixed States in the Doubled
   Space
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB The interplay of symmetry and topology in quantum many-body mixed states has recently garnered significant interest. In a phenomenon not seen in pure states, mixed states can exhibit average symmetries-symmetries that act on component states while leaving the ensemble invariant. In this work, we systematically characterize symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases of short-range entangled (SRE) mixed states of spin systems-protected by both average and exact symmetries-by studying their pure Choi states in a doubled Hilbert space, where the familiar notions and tools for SRE and SPT pure states apply. This advantage of the doubled space comes with a price: extra symmetries as well as subtleties around how hermiticity and positivity of the original density matrix constrain the possible SPT invariants. Nevertheless, the doubled-space perspective allows us to obtain a systematic classification of mixed-state SPT (MSPT) phases. We also investigate the robustness of MSPT invariants under symmetric finite-depth quantum channels, the bulk-boundary correspondence for MSPT phases, and the consequences of the MSPT invariants for the separability of mixed states and the symmetry-protected sign problem. In addition to MSPT phases, we study the patterns of spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) of mixed states, including the phenomenon of exact-to-average SSB, and the order parameters that detect them. Mixed-state SSB is related to an ingappability constraint on symmetric Lindbladian dynamics.

TI Metasurface-enabled cylindrical vector beam multiplexing for compact,
   high-channel-count, and bidirectional optical fiber communication
SO OPTICS AND LASER TECHNOLOGY
AB Cylindrical vector beam (CVB) multiplexing has emerged as a promising strategy for high-performance optical backbone networks in sixth-generation communication systems, effectively addressing escalating bandwidth requirements. However, conventional CVB multiplexing systems typically scale by incorporating additional discrete optical components, presenting challenges in system integration, footprint, and bidirectional operability. In this study, we propose and demonstrate a compact, high-channel-count, bidirectional CVB multiplexing system employing all-dielectric metasurfaces (MSs) integrated onto the end facets of a few-mode fiber (FMF). The system employs identical MSs on the FMF end facets to enable nine off-axis vector mode conversions between CVBs propagating within the FMF core and fundamental Gaussian beams in free space. The FMF features an optimized core radius to ensure efficient, low-loss CVB transmission, enabling nine-channel bidirectional optical interconnection. The theoretical validation of the multiplexing and demultiplexing functions demonstrated the high mode selectivity of the system, compatibility with wavelength-division multiplexing, and significant scalability. This design forms a solid basis for scalable, low-latency, high-capacity bidirectional optical links with broad applicability in emerging domains such as smart cities, intelligent transportation systems, and quantum communication networks.

TI One-Shot Yield-Cost Relations in General Quantum Resource Theories
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Although it is well known that the amount of resources that can be asymptotically distilled from a quantum state or channel does not exceed the resource cost needed to produce it, the corresponding relation in the nonasymptotic regime hitherto has not been well understood. Here, we establish a quantitative relation between the one-shot distillable resource yield and dilution cost in terms of transformation errors involved in these processes. Notably, our bound is applicable to quantum state and channel manipulation with respect to any type of quantum resource and any class of free transformations thereof, encompassing broad types of settings, including entanglement, quantum thermodynamics, and quantum communication. We also show that our techniques provide strong converse bounds relating the distillable resource and the resource dilution cost in the asymptotic regime. Moreover, we introduce a class of channels that generalize the twirling maps encountered in many resource theories, and by directly connecting it with resource quantification, we compute analytically several smoothed resource measures and improve our one-shot yield-cost bound in relevant theories. We use these operational insights to exactly evaluate important measures for various resource states in the resource theory of magic states.

TI All-fiber function devices for twisted lights
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Lights carrying orbital angular momentum (OAM), also called twisted lights, have been applied in fields of optical manipulation, imaging, quantum communication, and modedivision -multiplexing (MDM) optical communication systems. Traditional approaches for manipulating twisted lights carrying OAM in free space paths such as Q -plates, spiral phase plates (SPPs), and spatial light modulators (SLMs) that are usually affected by diffraction effect and imperfect alignment between different optical components, limiting the practical applications of twisted lights. Here we design, fabricated, and package all -fiber function devices for twisted light carrying OAM such as all -fiber broadband OAM generator, all -fiber OAM (de)multiplexer, all -fiber OAM & WDM coupler, and all -fiber OAM 1 x 2 coupler. Base on coupled mode theory and phase -matching condition, twisted light can be generated and detected by pre -tapered single mode fiber (SMF) fusing with multi -mode fiber (MMF). The results show that the proposed all -fiber function devices for twist light have large working broadband (at least C band), high purity (above 95%), and low insert loss (less than 3 dB). The proposed devices will open a reliable way for twisted light applied in optical fiber communications and optical interconnections.

TI Deterministic positioning and alignment of a single-molecule exciton in
   plasmonic nanodimer for strong coupling
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Experimental realization of strong coupling between a single exciton and plasmons remains challenging as it requires deterministic positioning of the single exciton and alignment of its dipole moment with the plasmonic fields. This study aims to combine the host-guest chemistry approach with the cucurbit[7]uril-mediated active self-assembly to precisely integrate a single methylene blue molecule in an Au nanodimer at the deterministic position (gap center of the nanodimer) with the maximum electric field (EFmax) and perfectly align its transition dipole moment with the EFmax, yielding a large spectral Rabi splitting of 116meV for a single-molecule exciton-matching the analytical model and numerical simulations. Statistical analysis of vibrational spectroscopy and dark-field scattering spectra confirm the realization of the single exciton strong coupling at room temperature. Our work may suggest an approach for achieving the strong coupling between a deterministic single exciton and plasmons, contributing to the development of room-temperature single-qubit quantum devices.

TI A Fully Connected Quantum Convolutional Neural Network for Classifying
   Ischemic Cardiopathy
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB The prevalence of heart diseases is rising quickly throughout the world, which has an impact on both the world economy and public health. According to the recent statistical survey reports, the increasing mortality rate is due to high blood pressure, high cholesterol, the use of tobacco, obesity, and an inconsistent pulse rate. It is difficult and time-consuming to investigate the various variations of these factors and their impact on Coronary Artery Disease (CAD). Therefore, it is necessary to use modern approaches to diagnose the disease early and minimize the mortality rate. The fields of machine learning and data mining have a wide research dimension and various novel techniques that could help in the prediction of CAD in its early stages and identify their patterns and behaviors in a huge amount of data. The results of such predictions will aid the clinical staff in decision making and early diagnosis. In such a scenario, we proposed a quantum version of the Fully Convolutional Neural Network (FCQ-CNN) for Ischemic Heart Disease (IHD) classification. The proposed model evaluates the quantum circuit-based technique that was inspired by convolutional neural networks, a very successful machine learning model. This method provides O(log(n)) depth for n qubits, reducing the number of parameters and allowing for effective training and testing of real quantum devices. The model has been evaluated by considering the IHD dataset after the data has been cleaned and filtered through the Maximally Relevant Minimally Redundancy (MRMR) filter. For dimension reduction, a Support Vector Machine along with Recursive Feature Elimination (SVM-RFE) has been considered. Initially, the model is tested with 20% of the whole dataset and gets the promising results of a testing accuracy of 84.6% with a testing loss of 0.28. By taking into account the same optimal parameters, the proposed model outcomes are compared to those of the classical Optimized Convolution Neural Network (Optimized-CNN) and Fully Connected Neural Network (FCNN) models. Comparing the model's competency to that of earlier published quantum models yields improvements in accuracy of 8.6%, 12.6%, 3.5%, and 1.8% respectively.

TI Design and Experimental Research of Vortex Beam Mixer
SO PHOTONICS
AB Based on the birefringence phenomenon of vortex beam in uniaxial crystals for optical path design, yttrium vanadate crystals and waveplates are used to realize coherent mixing of vortex beam. A crystal-type spatial light mixer applied to a vortex beam communication system is designed. The effects of beam polarization, waveplate optical axis, crystal transmittance, and other factors on the performance of the mixer are explored. Simulations show that the mixer output phase error is extremely small, the insertion loss is about 1.9 dB , and the overall loss is close to 36.6%. Finally, it is applied in the vortex optical coherent communication system, and the effectiveness of the optical mixer is experimentally verified with a phase deviation of 3 degrees, a splitting ratio close to 1, and a mixing efficiency of 78.5%. Vortex beam mixer extracts information such as phase, amplitude, and polarization of the signal light by combining optical beams with orbital angular momentum modes. It enables mode multiplexing, topologically protected transmission, and high-order modulation. This technology is widely applied in space optical communication, high-speed fiber-optic systems, and quantum communication.

TI Common-mode control and confinement inversion of electrostatically
   defined quantum dots in a commercial CMOS process
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Confining electrons or holes in quantum dots formed in the channel of industry-standard fully depleted silicon-on-insulator CMOS structures is a promising approach to scalable qubit architectures. In this article, we present our results on a calibrated model of a commercial nanostructure using the simulation tool QTCAD (R), along with our experimental verification of all model predictions. We demonstrate here that quantum dots can be formed in the device channel by applying a combination of a common-mode voltage to the source and drain and a back gate voltage. Moreover, in this approach, the amount of quantum dots can be controlled and modified. Also, we report our results on an effective detuning of the energy levels in the quantum dots by varying the barrier gate voltages. Given the need and importance of scaling to larger numbers of qubits, we demonstrate here the feasibility of simulating and improving the design of quantum dot devices before their fabrication based on a commercial process.

TI Projection algorithm for state preparation on quantum computers
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW C
AB We present an efficient method to prepare states of a many-body system on quantum hardware, first isolating individual quantum numbers and then using time evolution to isolate the energy. Our method in its simplest form requires only one additional auxiliary qubit. The total time evolved for an accurate solution is proportional to the ratio of the spectrum range of the trial state to the gap to the lowest excited state, a substantial improvement over other projection algorithms, and the accuracy increases exponentially with the time evolved. Isolating the quantum numbers is efficient because of the known eigenvalues, and increases the gap thus shortening the propagation time required. The success rate of the algorithm, or the probability of producing the desired state, is a simple function of measurement times and phases and is dominated by the square overlap of the original state to the desired state. We present examples from the nuclear shell model and the Heisenberg model. We compare this algorithm to previous algorithms for short evolution times and discuss potential further improvements.

TI Implementation of Photonic Phase Gate and Squeezed States via a
   Two-Level Atom and Bimodal Cavity
SO PHOTONICS
AB We propose a theoretical model for realizing a photonic two-qubit phase gate in cavity QED using a one-step process. The fidelity and probability of success of the conditional quantum phase gate is very high in the presence of cavity decay. Our scheme only employs one two-level atom, and thus is much simpler than other schemes involving multi-level atoms. This proposal can also be applied to generate two-mode squeezed states; therefore, we give three examples, i.e., the two-mode squeezed vacuum state, two-mode squeezed odd coherent state, and two-mode squeezed even coherent state, to estimate the variance of Duan's criterion when taking into account cavity decay. It is shown that the variance is smaller than 2 for the three squeezed states in most cases. Furthermore, we utilize logarithmic negativity to measure the entanglement, and find that these squeezed states have very high degrees of entanglement.

TI Sequential Bayesian experiment design for adaptive Ramsey sequence
   measurements
SO JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS
AB The Ramsey sequence is a canonical example of a quantum phase measurement for a spin qubit. In Ramsey measurements, the measurement efficiency can be optimized through careful selection of settings for the phase accumulation time setting, tau. This paper implements a sequential Bayesian experiment design protocol in low-fidelity Ramsey measurements, and its performance is compared to a previously reported adaptive heuristic protocol, a quantum phase estimation algorithm, and random setting choices. A workflow allowing measurements and design calculations to run concurrently largely eliminates computation time from measurement overhead. When precession frequency is the lone parameter to estimate, the Bayesian design is faster by factors of roughly 2, 4, and 5 relative to the adaptive heuristic, random iota choices, and the quantum phase estimation algorithm, respectively. When four parameters are to be determined, Bayesian experiment design and random tau choices can converge to roughly equivalent sensitivity, but the Bayesian method converges four times faster.

AB We present a method to extract the phase shift of a scattering process using the real-time evolution in the early and intermediate stages of the collision in order to estimate the time delay of a wave packet. This procedure is convenient when using noisy quantum computers for which the asymptotic out-state behavior is unreachable. We demonstrate that the challenging Fourier transforms involved in the state preparation and measurements can be implemented in 1 + 1 dimensions with current trapped ion devices and IBM quantum computers. We compare quantum computations of the time delays obtained in the one-particle quantum mechanics limit and the scalable quantum field theory formulation with accurate numerical results. We discuss the finite volume effects in the Wigner formula connecting time delays to phase shifts. The results reported involve two- and four-qubit calculations, and we discuss the possibility of larger scale computations in the near future.

TI Single-atom amplification assisted by multiple sideband interference in
   waveguide QED systems
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB This study conducts a theoretical investigation into the signal amplification arising from multiple Rabi sideband coherence within a waveguide quantum electrodynamics system. We utilize a semi-infinite waveguide to drive an anharmonic multi-level transmon with a strong coherent microwave field, examining the scattering behaviour by introducing a probe signal. Our findings show signal amplification under specific resonant conditions, presenting spectra that reveal finer details than previously documented in the literature. To elucidate the mechanisms behind this amplification, we develop a model that explicitly accounts for multiple dressed sidebands in the presence of a strong driving field. From this model, we derive the reflection amplitude of the probe signal. Notably, our results indicate that amplification can occur due to either population inversion or, in some instances, through the constructive interference of multiple sidebands even in the absence of population inversion. Additionally, we explore how qubit dephasing impacts the amplification process.

TI Resource overheads and attainable rates for trapped-ion lattice surgery
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB We present estimates for the number of ions needed to implement fault-tolerant lattice surgery between spatially separated trapped-ion surface codes. Additionally, we determine attainable lattice surgery rates given a number of dedicated "communication ions" per logical qubit. Because our analysis depends heavily on the rate that syndrome extraction cycles take place, we survey the state-of the art and propose three possible cycle times between 10 and 1000 mu s that we could reasonably see realized provided certain technological milestones are met. Consequently, our numerical results indicate that hundreds of resource ions will be needed for lattice surgery in the slowest case, while close to a hundred thousand will be needed in the fastest case. The main factor contributing to these prohibitive estimates is the limited rate that ions can be coupled across traps. Our results indicate an urgent need for optical coupling to improve by one or more orders of magnitude for trapped-ion quantum computers to scale.

TI High-efficiency low-noise optomechanical crystal photon-phonon
   transducers
SO OPTICA
AB Optomechanical crystals (OMCs) enable coherent interactions between optical photons and microwave acoustic phonons, and represent a platform for implementing quantum transduction between microwave and optical signals. Optical-absorption-induced thermal noise at cryogenic (millikelvin) temperatures is one of the primary limitations of performance for OMC-based quantum transducers. Here, we address this challenge with a two-dimensional silicon OMC resonator that is side-coupled to a mechanically detached optical waveguide, realizing a six-fold reduction in the heating rate of the acoustic resonator compared to prior state-of-the-art, while operating in a regime of high optomechanical-backaction and millikelvin base temperature. This reduced heating translates into a demonstrated phonon-to-photon conversion efficiency of 93.1 +/- 0.8% at an added noise of 0.25 +/- 0.01 quanta, representing a significant advance toward quantum-limited microwave-optical frequency conversion and optically controlled quantum acoustic memories.

TI Metrology of weak quantum perturbations
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We consider quantum systems with a Hamiltonian containing a weak perturbation, i.e., H = H0 +1 center dot 1 = {lambda 1, lambda 2, . . . , }, couplings 1 are unknown and should be determined by performing measurements on the system. We consider two scenarios: in the first one we assume that measurements are performed on a given stationary state of the system, e.g., the ground state, whereas in the second one an initial state is prepared and then measured after evolution. In both cases, we look for the optimal measurements to estimate the couplings and evaluate the ultimate limits to precision. In particular, we derive general results for one and two couplings and analyze in detail some specific qubit models. Our results indicate that dynamical estimation schemes may provide enhanced precision upon a suitable choice of the initial preparation and the interaction time.

TI Quantum earth mover's distance, a no-go quantum Kantorovich-Rubinstein
   theorem, and quantum marginal problem
SO JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL PHYSICS
AB The quantum coupling of two given quantum states denotes the set of bipartite states whose marginal states are these given two states. In this paper, we provide tight inequalities to describe the structure of quantum coupling. These inequalities directly imply that the trace distance between two quantum states cannot be determined by the quantum analog of the earth mover's distance, thus ruling out the equality version of the quantum Kantorovich-Rubinstein theorem for trace distance even in the finite-dimensional case. In addition, we provide an inequality that can be regarded as a quantum generalization of the Kantorovich-Rubinstein theorem. Then, we generalize our inequalities and apply them to the three tripartite quantum marginal problems. Numerical tests with a three-qubit system show that our criteria are much stronger than the known criteria: the strong subadditivity of entropy and the monogamy of entanglement.

TI Current crowding-free superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors
SO SCIENCE ADVANCES
AB Detecting single photons is essential for applications such as dark matter detection, quantum science and technology, and biomedical imaging. Superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors (SNSPDs) excel in this task due to their near-unity detection efficiency, subhertz dark count rates, and picosecond timing jitter. However, a local increase of current density (current crowding) in the bends of meander-shaped SNSPDs limits these performance metrics. By locally irradiating the SNSPD's straight segments with helium ions while leaving the bends unirradiated, we realize current crowding-free SNSPDs with simultaneously enhanced sensitivity: After irradiation with 800 ions nm-2, locally irradiated SNSPDs showed a relative saturation plateau width of 37%, while fully irradiated SNSPDs reached only 10%. This larger relative plateau width allows operation at lower relative bias currents, thereby reducing the dark count rate while still detecting single photons efficiently. We achieve an internal detection efficiency of 94% with 7 mHz dark count rate near the onset of saturating detection efficiency for a wavelength of 780 nm.

TI Narrow-linewidth monolithic topological interface state extended laser
   with optical injection locking
SO SCIENCE ADVANCES
AB Narrow-linewidth lasers are essential for coherent optical applications, including communications, metrology, and sensing. Although compact semiconductor lasers with narrow linewidths have been demonstrated, achieving high spectral purity generally necessitates passive external cavities based on photonic integrated circuits. This study presents a theoretical and experimental demonstration of a monolithic optical injection locking topological interface state extended (MOIL-TISE) laser. By monolithically integrating a TISE laser with a micro-ring resonator on an AlGaInAs multiple quantum-well platform, the proposed device achieves efficient photon injection and linewidth narrowing. Experimental characterization indicates stable single-mode operation over a wide injection current range (65 to 300 milliamperes), exhibiting a side-mode suppression ratio exceeding 50 decibels. The laser's Voigt linewidth was reduced from 2 megahertz to 4.2 kilohertz, with an intrinsic linewidth of 983 hertz extracted from power spectrum density, underscoring the MOIL-TISE laser's promise for coherent communications and modulation-free quantum key distribution applications.

TI Experimental implementation of a quantum zero-knowledge proof for user
   authentication
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB A new interactive quantum zero -knowledge protocol for identity authentication implementable in currently available quantum cryptographic devices is proposed and demonstrated. The protocol design involves a verifier and a prover knowing a pre -shared secret, and the acceptance or rejection of the proof is determined by the quantum bit error rate. It has been implemented in modified Quantum Key Distribution devices executing two fundamental cases. In the first case, all players are honest, while in the second case, one of the users is a malicious player. We demonstrate an increase of the quantum bit error rate around 25 % in the latter case compared to the case of honesty. The protocol has also been validated for distances from a back-to-back setup to more than 60 km between verifier and prover. The security and robustness of the protocol has been analysed, demonstrating its completeness, soundness and zero -knowledge properties.

TI Gaussian Pseudorandom Number Generator Using Linear Feedback Shift
   Registers in Extended Fields
SO MATHEMATICS
AB A new proposal to generate pseudorandom numbers with Gaussian distribution is presented. The generator is a generalization to the extended field GF(2(n)) of the one using cyclic rotations of linear feedback shift registers (LFSRs) originally defined in GF(2). The rotations applied to LFSRs in the binary case are no longer needed in the extended field due to the implicit rotations found in the binary equivalent model of LFSRs in GF(2(n)). The new proposal is aligned with the current trend in cryptography of using extended fields as a way to speed up the bitrate of the pseudorandom generators. This proposal allows the use of LFSRs in cryptography to be taken further, from the generation of the classical uniformly distributed sequences to other areas, such as quantum key distribution schemes, in which sequences with Gaussian distribution are needed. The paper contains the statistical analysis of the numbers produced and a comparison with other Gaussian generators.

TI Quantum coherence as a signature of chaos
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB We establish a rigorous connection between quantum coherence and quantum chaos by employing coherence measures originating from the resource theory framework as a diagnostic tool for quantum chaos. We quantify this connection at two different levels: quantum states and quantum channels. At the level of states, we show how several well-studied quantifiers of chaos are, in fact, quantum coherence measures in disguise (or closely related to them). We further this connection for all quantum coherence measures by using tools from majorization theory. Then we numerically study the coherence of chaotic-versus-integrable eigenstates and find excellent agreement with random matrix theory in the bulk of the spectrum. At the level of channels, we show that the coherence-generating power (CGP)-a measure of how much coherence a dynamical process generates on average-emerges as a subpart of the out-of-time-ordered correlator (OTOC), a measure of information scrambling in many-body systems. Via numerical simulations of the (nonintegrable) transverse-field Ising model, we show that the OTOC and CGP capture quantum recurrences in quantitatively the same way. Moreover, using random matrix theory, we analytically characterize the OTOC-CGP connection for the Haar and Gaussian ensembles. In closing, we remark on how our coherence-based signatures of chaos relate to other diagnostics, namely, the Loschmidt echo, OTOC, and the Spectral Form Factor.

TI Benchmarking a heuristic Floquet adiabatic algorithm for the
   <monospace>Max-Cut</monospace> problem
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB According to the adiabatic theorem of quantum mechanics, a system initially in the ground state of a Hamiltonian remains in the ground state if one slowly changes the Hamiltonian. This can be used in principle to solve hard problems on quantum computers. Generically, however, implementation of this Hamiltonian dynamics on digital quantum computers requires scaling Trotter step size with system size and simulation time, which incurs a large gate count. In this work, we argue that for classical optimization problems, the adiabatic evolution can be performed with a fixed, finite Trotter step. This "Floquet adiabatic evolution" reduces by several orders of magnitude the gate count compared to the usual, continuous-time adiabatic evolution. We give numerical evidence using matrix-product-state simulations that it can optimally solve the Max-Cut problem on 3-regular graphs in a large number of instances, with surprisingly low runtime, even with bond dimensions as low as \documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$D=2$$\end{document}.

TI Witnessing latent time correlations with a single quantum particle
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB When a noisy communication channel is used multiple times, the errors occurring at different times generally exhibit correlations. Classically, these correlations do not affect the evolution of individual particles: a single classical particle can only traverse the channel at a definite moment of time, and its evolution is insensitive to the correlations between subsequent uses of the channel. In stark contrast, here we show that a single quantum particle can sense the correlations between multiple uses of a channel at different moments of time. Taking advantage of this phenomenon, it is possible to enhance the amount of information that the particle can reliably carry through the channel. In an extreme example, we show that a channel that outputs white noise whenever the particle is sent at a definite time can exhibit correlations that enable a perfect transmission of classical bits when the particle is sent at a superposition of two distinct times. In contrast, we show that, in the lack of correlations, a single particle sent at a superposition of two times undergoes an effective channel with classical capacity of at most 0.16 bits. When multiple transmission lines are available, time correlations can be used to simulate the application of quantum channels in a coherent superposition of alternative causal orders, and even to provide communication advantages that are not accessible through the superposition of causal orders.

TI A new quantum group blind signature scheme based on GHZ states
SO JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS
AB With the development of quantum computers, traditional communication security based on classical computers can no longer guarantee unconditional security. At the same time, a series of encrypted communication solutions that rely on quantum mechanical properties have been spawned. This article focuses on the field of quantum signatures, based on the entangled Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger state, combining group signatures (any member of the group can sign on behalf of the group) and blind signatures (the signer cannot know the accuracy of the signature content) proposed a new quantum group blind signature scheme that utilizes quantum key distribution to achieve unconditional security. By splitting the original message, the scheme strengthens the relevance of the signature participants and makes the signature to have stronger binding. Then, the security of the scheme against internal and external attacks is analyzed. In this scheme, a pleasing efficiency has been achieved, and the non-repudiation of signatures has been enhanced. At the same time, disputed signatures can be traced back to the signer.

TI Studying the squeezing effect and phase-space distribution of a
   single-photon-added coherent state using a postselected von Neumann
   measurement
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB In this paper, ordinary and amplitude-squared squeezing as well as Wigner functions of single-photon-added coherent state after postselected von Neumann measurements are investigated. The analytical results show that the weak measurement procedure, which is characterized by postselection and weak value, can significantly change the principal squeezing feature of the single-photon-added coherent state. From the analysis of the Winger function we notice that in the strong measurement regime significant interference structures manifest and the negative regions become larger than the initial pointer state. Our results indicate that after postselected von Neumann measurement the degree of nonclassicality of single-photon-added coherent state is increased. It is anticipated that this work may provide alternate and effective methods for solving the state optimization problems based on the single-photon-added coherent state pointer via a postselected von Neumann measurement technique.

TI Quantum estimation of the stokes vector rotation for a general
   polarimetric transformation
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB Classical polarimetry is a well-established discipline with diverse applications across different branches of science. The burgeoning interest in leveraging quantum resources to achieve highly sensitive measurements has spurred researchers to elucidate the behavior of polarized light within a quantum mechanical framework, thereby fostering the development of a quantum theory of polarimetry. In this work, drawing inspiration from polarimetric investigations in biological tissues, we investigate the precision limits of polarization rotation angle estimation about a known rotation axis, in a quantum polarimetric process, comprising three distinct quantum channels. The rotation angle to be estimated is induced by the retarder channel on the Stokes vector of the probe state. The diattenuator and depolarizer channels, acting on the probe state, can be thought of as effective noise processes. We explore the precision constraints inherent in quantum polarimetry by evaluating the quantum Fisher information for probe states of significance in quantum metrology, namely NOON, Kings of Quantumness, and Coherent states. The effects of the noise channels as well as their ordering is analyzed on the estimation error of the rotation angle to characterize practical and optimal quantum probe states for quantum polarimetry. Furthermore, we propose an experimental framework tailored for NOON state quantum polarimetry, aiming to bridge theoretical insights with empirical validation.

TI Genuine Multipartite Entanglement is Not Necessary for Standard
   Device-Independent Conference Key Agreement
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Conference key agreement aims to establish shared, private randomness among many separated parties in a network. Device-independent conference key agreement (DICKA) is a variant in which the source and the measurement devices used by each party need not be trusted. So far, DICKA protocols largely fall into two categories: those that rely on violating a joint Bell inequality using genuinely multipartite entangled states and those that concatenate many bipartite protocols. The question of whether a hybrid protocol exists, where a multipartite Bell inequality can be violated using only bipartite entanglement, was asked by Grasselli et al. [Quantum 7, 980 (2023)]. We answer this question affirmatively, by constructing an asymptotically secure DICKA protocol achieving the same rate as the concatenation of bipartite device-independent quantum key distribution, yet relying on a single joint Bell violation. Our results prompt further discussion on the benefits of multipartite entanglement for DICKA over its bipartite alternative, and we give an overview of different arguments for near-term devices.

TI High-speed integrated QKD system
SO PHOTONICS RESEARCH
AB Quantum key distribution (QKD) is nowadays a well-established method for generating secret keys at a distance in an information-theoretically secure way, as the secrecy of QKD relies on the laws of quantum physics and not on computational complexity. In order to industrialize QKD, low-cost, mass-manufactured, and practical QKD setups are required. Hence, photonic and electronic integration of the sender's and receiver's respective compo-nents is currently in the spotlight. Here we present a high-speed (2.5 GHz) integrated QKD setup featuring a transmitter chip in silicon photonics allowing for high-speed modulation and accurate state preparation, as well as a polarization-independent low-loss receiver chip in aluminum borosilicate glass fabricated by the femtosecond laser micromachining technique. Our system achieves raw bit error rates, quantum bit error rates, and secret key rates equivalent to a much more complex state-of-the-art setup based on discrete components [A. Boaron et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 121, 190502 (2018)].& COPY; 2023 Chinese Laser Press

TI Compact InGaAs/InP Single-Photon Detector Module with Ultra-Narrowband
   Interference Circuits
SO ADVANCED DEVICES & INSTRUMENTATION
AB Gated InGaAs/InP avalanche photodiodes are the most practical device for detection of telecom single photons arriving at regular intervals. Here, we report the development of a compact single-photon detector (SPD) module measured just 8.8 x 6 x 2 cm3 in size and fully integrated with driving signal generation, faint avalanche readout, and discrimination circuits as well as temperature regulation and compensation. The readout circuit employs our previously reported ultra-narrowband interference circuits (UNICs) to eliminate the capacitive response to the gating signal. We characterize a UNIC-SPD module with a 1.25-GHz clock input and find its performance comparable to its counterpart built upon discrete functional blocks. Setting its detection efficiency to 30% for 1,550-nm photons, we obtain an afterpulsing probability of 2.4% and a dark count probability of 8 x 10-7 per gate under 3-ns hold-off time. We believe that UNIC-SPDs will be useful in important applications such as quantum key distribution.

TI Environmental effects on classical and quantum free space optical
   communication
SO OPTICS CONTINUUM
AB Quantum inter net required the transmission of both quantum key distribution (QKD) through Quantum free space optic (QFSO) channel and an encrypted message through the classical free space optic (CFSO) channel. However, those channels are subjected to environmental parameters. The aim of this work is to study the joint effects of those parameters on CFSO and QFSO through the evaluation of bit error rate (BER) and QKD rate. It comes out that for a given environment roughness under LSO (line of sight) and transmitters distance, the increasing of temperature and wind velocity will not necessary increase the average BER if they are not associate with appropriate fluctuations. The increasing environment roughness and transmitters distance leads to increasing the average BER. Moreover, for a given environment roughness and transmitters distance, there is a range of temperature within which quantum mutual information between Eve and Bob is reduced; which leads to improve QKD Rate.<br /> (c) 2025 Optica Publishing Group under the terms of the Optica Open Access Publishing Agreement

TI Continuous-Variable Quantum Secret Sharing in Fast-Fluctuating Channels
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM ENGINEERING
AB Recently, several continuous-variable quantum secret sharing (CV-QSS) protocols were proposed, while most of them are limited to the fiber channel systems with a relatively stable transmissivity. However, by means of complex channels, the transmissivity fluctuates dramatically in time with a probability distribution, which will lead to a fast-fluctuating attack. Therefore, the security analysis of CV-QSS in fiber channels may not apply to CV-QSS in complex channels. In this article, we study the CV-QSS protocol in the absence of uniform fast-fluctuating channels whose transmissivity changes with respect to a uniform probability distribution. We give a lower bound of secret key rate to provide security analysis against the fast-fluctuating attack for the CV-QSS protocol. In particular, the realistic highly asymmetric beam splitter (HABS) in CV-QSS protocol is investigated in detail here for the first time, and numerical simulation shows that the security bound is overestimated when the HABS is treated as the perfect device.

TI Towards combined quantum bit detection and spatial tracking using an
   arrayed single-photon sensor
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Experimental quantum key distribution through free-space channels requires accurate pointing-and-tracking to co-align telescopes for efficient transmission. The hardware requirements for the sender and receiver could be drastically reduced by combining the detection of quantum bits and spatial tracking signal using two-dimensional single-photon detector arrays. Here, we apply a two-dimensional CMOS single-photon avalanche diode detector array to measure and monitor the single-photon level interference of a free-space time-bin receiver interferometer while simultaneously tracking the spatial position of the single-photon level signal. We verify an angular field-of-view of 1.28 degrees and demonstrate a post-processing technique to reduce background noise. The experimental results show a promising future for two-dimensional single-photon detectors in low-light level free-space communications, such as quantum communications.

TI De Finetti Theorems for Quantum Conditional Probability Distributions
   with Symmetry
SO ANNALES HENRI POINCARE
AB The aim of device-independent quantum key distribution (DIQKD) is to study protocols that allow the generation of a secret shared key between two parties under minimal assumptions on the devices that produce the key. These devices are merely modeled as black boxes and mathematically described as conditional probability distributions. A major obstacle in the analysis of DIQKD protocols is the huge space of possible black box behaviors. De Finetti theorems can help to overcome this problem by reducing the analysis to black boxes that have an iid structure. Here we show two new de Finetti theorems that relate conditional probability distributions in the quantum set to de Finetti distributions (convex combinations of iid distributions) that are themselves in the quantum set. We also show how one of these de Finetti theorems can be used to enforce some restrictions onto the attacker of a DIQKD protocol. Finally we observe that some desirable strengthenings of this restriction, for instance to collective attacks only, are not straightforwardly possible.

TI Dissipative generation of significant amount of photon-phonon asymmetric
   steering in magnomechanical interfaces
SO EPJ QUANTUM TECHNOLOGY
AB A theoretical scheme is proposed to generate significant amount of photon-phonon entanglement and asymmetric steering in a cavity magnomechanical system, which is constituted by trapping a yttrium iron garnet sphere in a microwave cavity. By applying a blue-detuned microwave driving field, we obtain an effective Hamiltonian where the magnon mode acting as an engineered resevoir cools the Bogoliubov modes of microwave cavity mode and mechanical mode via a beam-splitter-like interaction. By this means, the microwave cavity mode and mechanical mode can be driven to a two-mode squeezed state in the stationary limit. Particularly, strong two-way and one-way photon-phonon asymmetric quantum steering can be obtained with even equal dissipation. It is widely divergent with the conventional proposal, where additional unbalanced losses or noises should be imposed on the two subsystems. Our finding may be significant to expand our understanding of the essential physics of asymmetric steering and extend the potential application of the cavity spintronics to device-independent quantum key distribution.

TI Generating quantum reservoir state representations with random matrices
SO MACHINE LEARNING-SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB We demonstrate a novel approach to reservoir computation measurements using random matrices. We do so to motivate how atomic-scale devices could be used for real-world computational applications. Our approach uses random matrices to construct reservoir measurements, introducing a simple, scalable means of generating state representations. In our studies, two reservoirs, a five-atom Heisenberg spin chain and a five-qubit quantum circuit, perform time series prediction and data interpolation. The performance of the measurement technique and current limitations are discussed in detail, along with an exploration of the diversity of measurements provided by the random matrices. In addition, we explore the role of reservoir parameters such as coupling strength and measurement dimension, providing insight into how these learning machines could be automatically tuned for different problems. This research highlights the use of random matrices to measure simple quantum reservoirs for natural learning devices, and outlines a path forward for improving their performance and experimental realization.

SO INFORMATION GEOMETRY
AB The lattice of faces of the convex set of reduced density matrices is essential for the construction of the information projection to a hierarchical model. The lattice of faces is also important in quantum state tomography. Yet, the description and computation of these faces is elusive in the simplest examples. Here, we study the face lattice of the set of two-body reduced density matrices: We show that the three-qubit lattice has no elements of rank seven and that it has a family of coatoms of rank five. This contrasts with the three-bit lattice, where every coatom has rank six. We discovered the coatoms of rank five using a novel experimental method, which employs convex duality, semidefinite programming, and algebra. We also discuss nonexposed points for three and six qubits. Using frustration-free Hamiltonians, we provide a new characterization of probability distributions that factor.

TI Simulating time evolution on distributed quantum computers
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB We study a variation of the Trotter-Suzuki decomposition, in which a Hamiltonian exponential is approximated by an ordered product of two-qubit operator exponentials such that the Trotter step size is enhanced for a small number of terms. Such decomposition directly reflects hardware constraints of distributed quantum computers, where operations on monolithic quantum devices are fast compared to entanglement distribution across separate nodes using interconnects. We simulate nonequilibrium dynamics of transverse-field Ising and XY spin chain models and investigate the impact of locally increased Trotter step sizes that are associated with an increasingly sparse use of the quantum interconnect. We find that the overall quality of the approximation depends smoothly on the local sparsity and that the proliferation of local errors is slow. As a consequence, we show that fast local operations on monolithic devices can be leveraged to obtain an overall improved result fidelity even on distributed quantum computers where the use of interconnects is costly.

AB In a quantum processor, the device design and external controls together contribute to the quality of the target quantum operations. As we continuously seek better alternative qubit platforms, we explore the increasingly large device and control design space. Thus, optimization becomes more and more challenging. In this work, we demonstrate that the figure of merit reflecting a design goal can be made differentiable with respect to the device and control parameters. In addition, we can compute the gradient of the design objective efficiently in a similar manner to the back-propagation algorithm and then utilize the gradient to optimize the device and the control parameters jointly and efficiently. Therefore, our work extends the scope of the quantum optimal control to device design and provides an efficient optimization method. We also demonstrate the viability of gradient-based joint optimization over the device and control parameters through a few examples based on the superconducting qubits.

SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB A quantum dot (QD) system provides various quantum physics of nanostructures. So far, many types of semiconductor QD structures have been fabricated and investigated experimentally and analyzed theoretically. Presently, QD systems have attracted considerable attention as units for the qubit system of quantum computers. Therefore, it is vital to integrate QD systems as measurement devices in addition to qubits. Here, we theoretically investigate the side-QD system as a measurement apparatus for energy levels of the target QDs. We formulate the transport properties of both three and five QDs based on the Green's function method. The effects of the energy difference of two side-QDs on the measurement current are calculated. The tradeoff between the strength of the measurement and the back-action induced by the measurement is discussed. It is found that the medium coupling strength of the three QDs is appropriate for reading out the difference of the two energy levels.

TI Experimental demonstration of coherence flow in PT- and

SO COMMUNICATIONS PHYSICS
AB Non-Hermitian parity-time (PT) and anti-parity-time (APT)-symmetric systems exhibit novel quantum properties and have attracted increasing interest. Although many counterintuitive phenomena in PT - and APT -symmetric systems were previously studied, coherence flow has been rarely investigated. Here, we experimentally demonstrate single-qubit coherence flow in PT - and APT -symmetric systems using an optical setup. In the symmetry unbroken regime, we observe different periodic oscillations of coherence. Particularly, we observe two complete coherence backflows in one period in the PT -symmetric system, while only one backflow in the APT -symmetric system. Moreover, in the symmetry broken regime, we observe the phenomenon of stable value of coherence flow. We derive the analytic proofs of these phenomena and show that most experimental data agree with theoretical results within one standard deviation. This work opens avenues for future study on the dynamics of coherence in PT - and APT -symmetric systems.

TI Experimental tests of the density matrix's property-based
   complementarity relations
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Bohr's complementarity principle is of fundamental historic and conceptual importance for quantum mechanics (QM), and states that, with a given experimental apparatus configuration, one can observe either the wave-like or the particle-like character of a quantum system, but not both. However, it was eventually realized that these dual behaviors can both manifest partially in the same experimental setup, and, using ad hoc proposed measures for the wave and particle aspects of the quanton, complementarity relations were proposed limiting how strong these manifestations can be. Recently, a formalism was developed and quantifiers for the particleness and waveness of a quantum system were derived from the mathematical structure of QM entailed in the density matrix's basic properties (rho >= 0, Tr rho = 1). In this article, using IBM Quantum Experience quantum computers, we perform experimental tests of these complementarity relations applied to a particular class of one-qubit quantum states and also for random quantum states of one, two, and three qubits.

TI Dephasing of transverse spin current in ferrimagnetic alloys
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB It has been predicted that transverse spin current can propagate coherently (without dephasing) over a long distance in antiferromagnetically ordered metals. Here, we estimate the dephasing length of transverse spin current in ferrimagnetic CoGd alloys by spin pumping measurements across the compensation point. A modified drift-diffusion model, which accounts for spin-current transmission through the ferrimagnet, reveals that the dephasing length is about 4-5 times longer in nearly compensated CoGd than in ferromagnetic metals. This finding suggests that antiferromagnetic order can mitigate spin dephasing-in a manner analogous to spin echo rephasing for nuclear and qubit spin systems-even in structurally disordered alloys at room temperature. We also find evidence that transverse spin current interacts more strongly with the Co sublattice than the Gd sublattice. Our results provide fundamental insights into the interplay between spin current and antiferromagnetic order, which are crucial for engineering spin torque effects in ferrimagnetic and antiferromagnetic metals.

TI Manybody interferometry of quantum fluids
SO SCIENCE ADVANCES
AB Characterizing strongly correlated matter is an increasingly central challenge in quantum science, where structure is often obscured by massive entanglement. It is becoming clear that in the quantum regime, state preparation and characterization should not be treated separately-entangling the two processes provides a quantum advantage in information extraction. Here, we present an approach that we term "manybody Ramsey interferometry" that combines adiabatic state preparation and Ramsey spectroscopy: Leveraging our recently developed one-to-one mapping between computational-basis states and manybody eigenstates, we prepare a superposition of manybody eigenstates controlled by the state of an ancilla qubit, allow the superposition to evolve relative phase, and then reverse the preparation protocol to disentangle the ancilla while localizing phase information back into it. Ancilla tomography then extracts information about the manybody eigenstates, the associated excitation spectrum, and thermodynamic observables. This work illustrates the potential for using quantum computers to efficiently probe quantum matter.

TI Stellar representation of extremal Wigner-negative spin states
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS A-MATHEMATICAL AND THEORETICAL
AB The Majorana stellar representation is used to characterize spin states that have a maximally negative Wigner quasiprobability distribution on a spherical phase space. These maximally Wigner-negative spin states generally exhibit a partial but not high degree of symmetry within their star configurations. In particular, for spin j > 2, maximal constellations do not correspond to a Platonic solid when available and do not follow an obvious geometric pattern as dimension increases. In addition, they are generally different from spin states that maximize other measures of nonclassicality such as anticoherence or geometric entanglement. Random states display on average a relatively high amount of negativity, but the extremal states and those with similar negativity are statistically rare in Hilbert space. We also prove that all spin coherent states of arbitrary dimension have non-zero Wigner negativity. This offers evidence that all pure spin states also have non-zero Wigner negativity. The results can be applied to qubit ensembles exhibiting permutation invariance.

TI Wavelength-Tunable Nonlinear Interferometer in Infrared Band Based on
   Photonic Crystal Fiber
SO ACTA OPTICA SINICA
AB Objective Infrared sensing and measurement are crucial for both basic scientific research and engineering applications. However, compared to visible light devices, infrared light sources and detectors still require further improvement in terms of efficiency, dark noise, and cost. Recently, the infrared quantum sensing technology based on nonlinear interferometers has provided a new approach to address these issues. In nonlinear interferometers, the beam splitters are replaced by parametric processes, in which pump photons scatter into correlated signal and idler photons. Since the signal and idler photons can be in different wavelengths (e.g., infrared and visible), placing a sample in the infrared arm and measuring the interference pattern in the visible arm can still reveal the infrared optical properties of the sample. In this case, there is no need for infrared light sources and detectors. Most reported nonlinear interferometers for infrared sensing and measurement employ nonlinear crystals as the nonlinear medium. In this paper, we employ a photonic crystal fiber as the nonlinear medium to build a Michelson-type nonlinear interferometer. The wavelength of the signal photons from the interferometer is in the near-infrared band, and the idler photons are located near the visible light band. By changing the wavelength of the pump light, the wavelengths of the signal and idler photons can be continuously tuned without other measures such as temperature control. The experimental results demonstrate the application potential of nonlinear interferometers based on photonic crystal fibers in infrared quantum sensing. Methods We use a 25 cm long photonic crystal fiber as the nonlinear medium. The zero-dispersion wavelength of the fiber is about 1062 nm. The calculated phase matching curves of the four-wave mixing process in our fiber are shown in Fig. 2(b). When the central wavelength of the pump light is in the range of 890-1060 nm, the wavelength of the signal light is in the infrared band of 1170-3466 nm, while the corresponding idler wavelength is in the visible light band of 510-969 nm. Moreover, the signal and idler wavelengths can be continuously tuned by changing the wavelength of the pump light. We construct a Michelson-type nonlinear interferometer as shown in Fig. 3. The pump source is a mode-locked fiber laser with a repetition rate of 49.2 MHz. First, the pump light output is fed into a 10 cm long single-mode fiber, where it is broadened to approximately 40 nm by self-phase modulation. Then, by using a grating-based tunable bandpass filter (F), the central wavelength of the pump light is continuously tunable between 1015 nm and 1055 nm with a bandwidth of 0.9 nm. The pump light first enters the photonic crystal fiber in the forward direction, generating the signal and idler photon pairs through four-wave mixing. A long pass filter (LPF) then splits the forward output light field into two arms. The pump and idler light fields are reflected by the LPF, while the signal light field is transmitted. The signal light returns along its original path after passing through a mirror mounted on a piezoelectric transducer (PZT) stage. The pump and idler light fields, after traveling different paths, are also reflected and return along their original paths. The reflected light from the two arms rejoins at the LPF and enters the photonic crystal fiber in the opposite direction. At this time, the three light fields undergo a phase-sensitive four-wave mixing process, and nonlinear interference occurs in the signal and idler light fields.
   We place a short pass filter (SPF) at the reverse-output (i.e., input) of the photonic crystal fiber. The reverse-output pump and signal light fields are reflected by the SPF, while the idler light field is transmitted. The separated idler photons are detected by a fiber-coupled single-photon detector (SPD). Results and Discussions The experimental results are shown in Fig. 4. When the pump wavelengths are 1049.8 nm, 1035.9 nm, and 1029.4 nm, the corresponding wavelengths of the idler (signal) photons are 858.8 nm (1350 nm), 783.0 nm (1530 nm), and 756.6 nm (1610 nm), respectively. For each case, we apply a triangular high-voltage signal with a frequency of 0.15 Hz and a voltage amplitude of approximately 40 V to the PZT to scan the phase of the signal light field. The data points in Figs. 4(a1) - (a3) represent the measured idler photon count rates under different pump wavelength conditions. The sampling time for each data point is 0.012 s, and only the detector dark counts are subtracted during data processing. It is seen that although the phase shift is introduced in the signal light field, interference fringes are also observed in the idler light field. We fit the data using a sine function, and the visibility of the fringe is 19.2 degrees o, 15.4 degrees o, and 14.2 degrees o, respectively. To verify that the interference fringes in the idler light field originate from a nonlinear interference process, we block one arm of the signal light, retaining only the pump and idler light fields and returning them to the photonic crystal fiber. The idler photon count rate is measured under the same conditions, and the results are shown in the data points in the Figs. 4 (b1) -(b3). The experimentally measured interference visibility is 14 degrees o -19 degrees o, decreasing with increasing signal light wavelength. The factors limiting the interference contrast in this device primarily include two factors: transmission loss between the two-stage nonlinear media and the walk-off effect between different light fields introduced by fiber dispersion. Therefore, we can point out two approaches to improving interference: reducing losses in fiber coupling and optical devices, and minimizing the fiber length while maintaining a certain photon generation rate. Conclusions We demonstrate a wavelength-tunable nonlinear interferometer in the infrared band based on a photonic crystal fiber. Theoretical calculations show that when the pump wavelength is between 890 nm and 1060 nm, the signal wavelength satisfying the four-wave mixing phase matching condition is in the infrared band of 1170 nm to 3466 nm, while the idler wavelength is in the near visible light band of 510 nm to 969 nm. We experimentally characterize our nonlinear interferometer when the wavelengths of the signal photons are 1350 nm, 1530 nm, and 1610 nm, respectively, and obtain interference visibility of up to 19.2%. The wavelengths of the obtained signal photons are consistent with the theoretical calculations, confirming the accuracy of the theoretical results. The results of this paper reveal the potential of photonic crystal fibers for developing integrated infrared wavelength-tunable nonlinear interferometers, and pave the way for further applications in infrared quantum sensing technology.

TI Security of the BB84 protocol with passive biased basis choice by the
   receiver
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB The Bennett-Brassard 1984 (BB84) protocol is one of the simplest protocols for implementing quantum key distribution (QKD). In the protocol, the sender and the receiver iteratively choose one of two complementary measurement bases. Regarding the basis choice by the receiver, a passive setup has been adopted in a number of its implementations, including satellite QKD and time-bin encoding. However, conventional theoretical techniques to prove the security of the BB84 protocol are not applicable if the receiver chooses their measurement basis passively, rather than actively, with a biased probability, followed by measurement with threshold detectors. Here we present a fully analytical security proof against coherent attacks for such a decoy-state BB84 protocol with the receiver's passive basis choice and measurement with threshold detectors. Numerical simulations under practical situations show that the difference in secure key rate between the active and passive implementations of the protocol is negligible except for long communication distances.

TI Quantum nonlocal modulation cancelation with distributed clocks
SO OPTICA QUANTUM
AB We demonstrate nonlocal modulation of entangled photons with truly distributed radio frequency (RF) clocks. Leveraging a custom radio-over-fiber (RFoF) system characterized via classical spectral interference, we validate its effectiveness for quantum networking by multiplexing the RFoF clock with one photon from a frequency-bin-entangled pair and distributing the coexisting quantum-classical signals over fiber. Phase modulation of the two photons reveals nonlocal correlations in excellent agreement with theory: in-phase modulation produces additional sidebands in the joint spectral intensity, while out-of-phase modulation is nonlocally canceled. Our simple, feedback-free design attains subpicosecond synchronization-namely, drift less than similar to 0.5 ps in a 5.5 km fiber over 30 min (fractionally only similar to 2x10-8 of the total fiber delay)-and should facilitate frequency-encoded quantum networking protocols such as high-dimensional quantum key distribution and entanglement swapping, unlocking frequency-bin qubits for practical quantum communications in deployed metropolitan-scale networks.

TI 5G network slicing with QKD and quantum-safe security
SO JOURNAL OF OPTICAL COMMUNICATIONS AND NETWORKING
AB We demonstrate how the 5G network slicing model can be enhanced to address data security requirements. In this work, we demonstrate two different slice configurations, with different encryption requirements, representing two diverse use-cases for 5G networking, namely, an enterprise application hosted at a metro network site and a content delivery network. We create a modified software-defined networking (SDN) orchestrator that calculates and provisions network slices according to the requirements, including encryption backed by quantum key distribution (QKD) and other methods. Slices are automatically provisioned by SDN orchestration of network resources, allowing selection of encrypted links as appropriate, including those that use encryption with standard Diffie-Hellman key exchange, QKD, or quantum-resistant algorithms, as well as no encryption at all. We show that the setup and teardown times of the network slices take approximately 1-2 min, which is at least an order of magnitude improvement over manually provisioning a link today.

TI Dead Time Duration and Active Reset Influence on the Afterpulse
   Probability of InGaAs/InP Single-Photon Avalanche Diodes
SO IEEE JOURNAL OF QUANTUM ELECTRONICS
AB We have performed a detailed study of the dependence of afterpulse probability in InGaAs/InP sine-gated SPAD on the dead time and the existing approach for its implementation. We demonstrated an electrical scheme combining sinusoidal gating and active reset. We have shown when such solutions are beneficial from the key distribution point of view, and enough to use a simple scheme with a snatching comparator. We have also proposed a precise method for measuring the afterpulse and presented a model describing the non-markovian dynamic of this effect. We have demonstrated that our afterpulsing measurement approach makes these measurements less dependent on the parameters of the flow of the diode and the laser pulses' power changes, in contrast to the other methods considered in this paper.

TI Frame-dependent coherence of a quantum state
SO PHYSICS LETTERS A
AB The tight frames can be regarded as a particular case of POVMs (positive operator-valued measures describing generalized measurements), namely the case when all the operators are rank-one. Each orthonormal basis is a tight frame, and every tight frame, after the embedding into a higher-dimensional space, is the orthogonal projection of an orthonormal basis. There exist several POVM-based definitions of coherence, and they are well-investigated. Our aim is to identify properties specific to the particular case of tight frames, and to look for some applications. All the POVM-based definitions use a Naimark extension. The frame-dependent coherence can be regarded as a particular case of POVM-based coherence, but it can be defined directly, without to use a Naimark extension. Its definition is a direct generalization of the basis-dependent l(1)-norm of coherence, and it offers a more accurate description because we can use a frame containing several orthogonal bases. A quasi frame-independent definition of coherence for qubit systems is presented.

TI Hot Carrier Degradation in Si n-MOSFETs at Cryogenic Temperatures
SO IEEE JOURNAL OF THE ELECTRON DEVICES SOCIETY
AB This study experimentally investigated hot carrier degradation (HCD) in Si-MOSFETs at cryogenic temperatures. Stress was applied to the devices at 4 K and 300 K, followed by temperature-dependent characterization from 4 K to 300 K to evaluate the degradation mechanism. The results indicated that at 4 K, the effect of HCD on current-voltage characteristics is attributable to band-edge states, whereas at 300 K, it is primarily due to deep states. Despite the temperature at which HCD occurred, both states are induced simultaneously by hot carriers. Deuterium termination of dangling bonds mitigates HCD even at 4 K, where degradation is caused by band-edge states. These results suggest that the band-edge states and deep states should be considered in conjunction, rather than in isolation, to fully understand the degradation behavior.

TI Proposal for Brillouin microwave-to-optical conversion on a chip
   [Invited]
SO OPTICAL MATERIALS EXPRESS
AB We propose a novel scheme for efficient and low-noise microwave-to-optical quantum transduction based on cavity-enhanced Brillouin interaction between telecom photons and 10 gigahertz phonons on a lithium niobate-on-Sapphire chip. By employing a dual-microring cavity design and tailoring the geometry dispersion, triply-resonant and phase-matching conditions can be achieved for the backward Brillouin process, resulting in strong vacuum coupling strengths between the confined phononic and photonic modes. Our numerical analysis, taking into account the material anisotropy of lithium niobate and sapphire, predicts near-unity internal conversion efficiency with only sub-milliwatt pump power. The unsuspended all-solid-state architecture offers superior mechanical stability and robustness, overcoming a major challenge in piezo-optomechanical systems. Furthermore, the broadband nature of the Brillouin process enables multi-channel conversion, a key advantage over existing approaches. This versatile platform opens up exciting opportunities for scalable quantum processors with hybrid photonicphononic-superconducting integrated circuits.

TI Optimizing the number of measurements for vibrational structure on
   quantum computers: coordinates and measurement schemes
SO CHEMICAL SCIENCE
AB One of the primary challenges prohibiting demonstrations of practical quantum advantages for near-term devices amounts to excessive measurement overheads for estimating relevant physical quantities such as ground state energies. However, with major differences between the electronic and vibrational structures of molecules, the question of how the resource requirements of computing anharmonic, vibrational states can be reduced remains relatively unexplored compared to its electronic counterpart. Importantly, bosonic commutation relations, distinguishable Hilbert spaces and vibrational coordinates allow manipulations of the vibrational system that can be exploited to minimize resource requirements. In this work, we investigate the impact of different coordinate systems and measurement schemes on the number of measurements needed to estimate anharmonic, vibrational states for a variety of three-mode (six-mode) molecules. We demonstrate an average of 3-fold (1.5-fold), with up to 7-fold (2.5-fold), reduction in the number of measurements required by employing appropriate coordinate transformations, based on an automized construction of qubit Hamiltonians from a conventional vibrational structure program.

TI A new quantum cryptanalysis method on block cipher Camellia
SO IET INFORMATION SECURITY
AB Symmetric cryptography is expected to be quantum safe when long-term security is needed. Kuwakado and Morii gave a 3-round quantum distinguisher of the Feistel cipher based on Simon's algorithm. However, the quantum distinguisher without considering the specific structure of the round function is not accurate enough. A new quantum cryptanalysis method for Feistel structure is studied here. It can make full use of the specific structure of the round function. The properties of Camellia round function and its linear transformation P are taken into account, and a 5-round quantum distinguisher is proposed. Then, the authors follow a key-recovery attack framework by Leander and May, that is, Grover-meet-Simon algorithm, and give a quantum key-recovery attack on 7-round Camellia in Q2 model with the time complexity of 2(24). It is the very first time that the specific structure of the round function is used to improve quantum attack on Camellia.

TI Reconfigurable Three-Dimensional Superconducting Nanoarchitectures
SO ADVANCED FUNCTIONAL MATERIALS
AB When materials are patterned in 3D, there exist opportunities to tailor and create functionalities associated with an increase in complexity, the breaking of symmetries, and the introduction of curvature and non-trivial topologies. For superconducting nanostructures, the extension to the third dimension triggers the emergence of new physical phenomena, and lead to advances in technologies. Here, 3D nanopatterning is harnessed to fabricate and control the emergent properties of a 3D superconducting nanostructure. Not only are the existence and motion of superconducting vortices demonstrated in 3D but, with numerical simulations, it is shown that the confinement leads to well-defined bending of the vortices within the volume of the structure. This 3D confinement manifests experimentally in a strong geometrical anisotropy of the critical field, through which the reconfigurable coexistence of superconducting and normal states in the 3D superconducting architecture, and the local definition of weak links, are achieved. In this way, an intermediate regime of nanosuperconductivity is uncovered, where the vortex state is truly 3D and can be designed and manipulated by geometrical confinement. This insight into the influence of 3D geometries on superconducting properties offers a route to local reconfigurable control for future computing devices, sensors, and quantum technologies.

TI Bottom-Up Formation of III-Nitride Nanowires: Past, Present, and Future
   for Photonic Devices
SO ADVANCED MATERIALS
AB The realization of semiconductor heterostructures marks a significant advancement beyond silicon technology, driving progress in high-performance optoelectronics and photonics, including high-brightness light emitters, optical communication, and quantum technologies. In less than a decade since 1997, nanowires research has expanded into new application-driven areas, highlighting a significant shift toward more challenging and exploratory research avenues. It is therefore essential to reflect on the past motivations for nanowires development, and explore the new opportunities it can enable. The advancement of heterogeneous integration using dissimilar substrates, materials, and nanowires-semiconductor/electrolyte operating platforms is ushering in new research frontiers, including the development of perovskite-embedded solar cells, photoelectrochemical (PEC) analog and digital photonic systems, such as PEC-based photodetectors and logic circuits, as well as quantum elements, such as single-photon emitters and detectors. This review offers rejuvenating perspectives on the progress of these group-III nitride nanowires, aiming to highlight the continuity of research toward high impact, use-inspired research directions in photonics and optoelectronics.

TI Temperature dependence of the AB lines and optical properties of the
   carbon-antisite-vacancy pair in 4H-SiC H-SiC
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB Defects in semiconductors have in recent years been revealed to have interesting properties in the venture towards quantum technologies. In this regard, silicon carbide has shown great promise as a host for quantum defects. In particular, the ultrabright AB photoluminescence lines in 4H-SiC H-SiC are observable at room temperature and have been proposed as a single-photon quantum emitter. These lines have previously been studied and assigned to the carbon-antisite-vacancy (CAV) pair. In this paper, we report on new measurements of the AB lines' temperature dependence, and carry out an in-depth computational study on the optical properties of the CAV defect. We find that the CAV defect has the potential to exhibit several different zero-phonon luminescences with emissions in the near-infrared telecom band, in its neutral and positive charge states. However, our measurements show that the AB lines only consist of three nonthermally activated lines instead of the previously reported four lines; meanwhile, our calculations on the CAV defect are unable to find optical transitions in full agreement with the AB-line assignment. In light of our results, the identification of AB lines and the associated room-temperature emission require further study.

TI Dual-laser self-injection locking to an integrated microresonator
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Diode laser self-injection locking (SIL) to a whispering gallery mode of a high quality factor resonator is a widely used method for laser linewidth narrowing and high-frequency noise suppression. SIL has already been used for the demonstration of ultra-low-noise photonic microwave oscillators and soliton microcomb generation and has a wide range of possible applications. Up to date, SIL was demonstrated only with a single laser. However, multifrequency and narrow-linewidth laser sources are in high demand for modern telecommunication systems, quantum technologies, and microwave photonics. Here we experimentally demonstrate the dual-laser SIL of two multifrequency laser diodes to different modes of an integrated Si3N4 microresonator. Simultaneous spectrum collapse of both lasers, as well as linewidth narrowing and high-frequency noise suppression , as well as strong nonlinear interaction of the two fields with each other, are observed. Locking both lasers to the same mode results in a simultaneous frequency and phase stabilization and coherent addition of their outputs. Additionally, we provide a comprehensive dual-SIL theory and investigate the influence of lasers on each other caused by nonlinear effects in the microresonator.

TI Quantum thermal machines in BTZ black hole spacetime
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
AB We investigate an Otto thermodynamic cycle with a qubit Unruh-DeWitt detector as the working medium, coupled to a massless, conformally coupled scalar quantum field in the Hartle-Hawking vacuum in a (2 + 1)-dimensional BTZ black hole spacetime. We employ the thermal properties of the field to model heat and cold reservoirs between which the thermal machine operates. Treating the detector as an open quantum system, we employ a master equation to study its finite-time dynamics during each cycle stroke. We evaluate the output performance of the Otto heat engine and refrigerator by computing, respectively, the total work output and the cooling power for each of the Neumann, transparent, and Dirichlet boundary condition cases satisfied by the field at spatial infinity. Furthermore, we evaluate the optimal performance of the thermal machine by analyzing its efficiency at maximum power output and ecological impact. Our study presents a general framework for understanding the finite-time operation of relativistic quantum thermal machines, focusing on their energy optimization.

TI Quantum Switch as a Thermodynamic Resource in the Context of Passive
   States
SO ENTROPY
AB In recent years, many works have explored possible advantages of indefinite causal order, with the main focus on its controlled implementation known as quantum switch. In this paper, we tackle advantages in quantum thermodynamics, studying whether quantum switch is capable of activating a passive state, either alone or with extra resources (active control state) and/or operations (measurement of the control system). By disproving the first possibility and confirming the second one, we show that quantum switch is not a thermodynamic resource in the discussed context, though it can facilitate work extraction given external resources. We discuss our findings by considering specific examples: a qubit system subject to rotations around the x and y axes in the Bloch sphere, as well as general unitaries from the U(2) group; and the system as a quantum harmonic oscillator with displacement operators, as well as with a combination of displacement and squeeze operators.

TI Layer VQE: A Variational Approach for Combinatorial Optimization on
   Noisy Quantum Computers
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM ENGINEERING
AB Combinatorial optimization on near-term quantum devices is a promising path to demonstrating quantum advantage. However, the capabilities of these devices are constrained by high noise or error rates. In this article, inspired by the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE), we propose an iterative layer VQE (L-VQE) approach. We present a large-scale numerical study, simulating circuits with up to 40 qubits and 352 parameters, that demonstrates the potential of the proposed approach. We evaluate quantum optimization heuristics on the problem of detecting multiple communities in networks, for which we introduce a novel qubit-frugal formulation. We numerically compare L-VQE with the quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) and demonstrate that QAOA achieves lower approximation ratios while requiring significantly deeper circuits. We show that L-VQE is more robust to finite sampling errors and has a higher chance of finding the solution as compared with standard VQE approaches. Our simulation results show that L-VQE performs well under realistic hardware noise.

TI QED driven QAOA for network-flow optimization
SO QUANTUM
AB We present a general framework for modifying quantum approximate optimization algorithms (QAOA) to solve constrained network flow problems. By exploiting an analogy between flow-constraints and Gauss' law for electromagnetism, we design lattice quantum electrodynamics (QED)-inspired mixing Hamiltonians that preserve flow constraints throughout the QAOA process. This results in an exponential reduction in the size of the configuration space that needs to be explored, which we show through numerical simulations, yields higher quality approximate solutions compared to the original QAOA routine. We outline a specific implementation for edge-disjoint path (EDP) problems related to traffic congestion minimization, numerically analyze the effect of initial state choice, and explore trade-offs between circuit complexity and qubit resources via a particle-vortex duality mapping. Comparing the effect of initial states reveals that starting with an ergodic (unbiased) superposition of solutions yields better performance than beginning with the mixer ground-state, suggesting a departure from the "short-cut to adiabaticity" mechanism often used to motivate QAOA.

TI Partonic distribution functions and amplitudes using tensor network
   methods
SO JOURNAL OF HIGH ENERGY PHYSICS
AB Calculations of the parton distribution function (PDF) and distribution amplitude (DA) are highly relevant to core experimental programs as they provide non-perturbative inputs to inclusive and exclusive processes, respectively. Direct computation of the PDFs and DAs remains challenging because they are non-perturbative quantities defined as light-cone correlators of quark and gluon fields, and are therefore inherently time-dependent. In this work, we use a uniform quantum strategy based on tensor network simulation techniques to directly extract these hadronic quantities from first principles using the matrix product state of the hadrons in the same setup. We present exemplary numerical calculations with the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model in 1+1 dimensions and compare with available exact diagonalization and quantum circuit simulation results. Using tensor networks, we evaluate the PDF and DA at various strong couplings in the large-qubit limit, which is consistent with expectations at perturbative and non-relativistic limits.

TI Maximal steady-state entanglement in autonomous quantum thermal machines
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB We devise an autonomous quantum thermal machine consisting of three pairwise-interacting qubits, two of which are locally coupled to thermal reservoirs. The machine operates autonomously, as it requires no time-coherent control, external driving or quantum bath engineering, and is instead propelled by a chemical potential bias. Under ideal conditions, we show that this out-of-equilibrium system can deterministically generate a maximally entangled steady-state between two of the qubits, or any desired pure two-qubit entangled state, emerging as a dark state of the system. We study the robustness of entanglement production with respect to several relevant parameters, obtaining nearly-maximally-entangled states well-away from the ideal regime of operation. Furthermore, we show that our machine architecture can be generalised to a configuration with 2n - 1 qubits, in which only a potential bias and two-body interactions are sufficient to generate genuine multipartite maximally entangled steady states in the form of a W state of n qubits.

TI Unitary partitioning and the contextual subspace variational quantum
   eigensolver
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB The contextual subspace variational quantum eigensolver (CS-VQE) is a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm that approximates the ground-state energy of a given qubit Hamiltonian. It achieves this by separating the Hamiltonian into contextual and noncontextual parts. The ground-state energy is approximated by classically solving the noncontextual problem, followed by solving the contextual problem using VQE, constrained by the noncontextual solution. In general, computation of the contextual correction needs fewer qubits and measurements compared with solving the full Hamiltonian via traditional VQE. We simulate CS-VQE on different tapered molecular Hamiltonians and apply the unitary partitioning measurement reduction strategy to further reduce the number of measurements required to obtain the contextual correction. Our results indicate that CS-VQE combined with measurement reduction is a promising approach to allow feasible eigenvalue computations on noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices. We also provide a modification to the CS-VQE algorithm; the CS-VQE algorithm previously could cause an exponential increase in Hamiltonian terms but with this modification now at worst will scale quadratically.

TI Adaptive optimal control of entangled qubits
SO SCIENCE ADVANCES
AB Developing fast, robust, and accurate methods for optimal control of quantum systems comprising interacting particles is one of the most active areas of current science. Although a valuable repository of algorithms is avail-able for numerical applications in quantum control, the high computational cost is somewhat overlooked. Here, we present a fast and accurate optimal control algorithm for systems of interacting qubits, QOALA (quantum optimal control by adaptive low-cost algorithm), which is predicted to offer O(M2) speedup for an M-qubit system, compared to the state-of-the-art exact methods, without compromising overall accuracy of the optimal solution. The method is general and compatible with diverse Hamiltonian structures. The proposed approach uses inexpensive low-accuracy approximations of propagators far from the optimum, adaptively switching to higher accuracy, higher-cost propagators when approaching the optimum. In addition, the utiliza-tion of analytical Lie algebraic derivatives that do not require computationally expensive matrix exponential brings even better performance.

AB The famous combinatorial problem of Euler concerns an arrangement of 36 officers from six different regiments in a 6x6 square array. Each regiment consists of six officers each belonging to one of six ranks. The problem, originating from Saint Petersburg, requires that each row and each column of the array contains only one officer of a given rank and given regiment. Euler observed that such a configuration does not exist. In recent work, we constructed a solution to a quantum version of this problem assuming that the officers correspond to superpositions of quantum states. In this paper, we explain the solution which is based on a partition of 36 officers into nine groups, each with four elements. The corresponding quantum states are locally equivalent to maximally entangled two-qubit states, hence each quantum officer is represented by a superposition of at most 4 classical states. The entire quantum combinatorial design involves 9 Bell bases in nine complementary 4-dimensional subspaces.

TI Amount of quantum coherence needed for measurement incompatibility
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB A pair of quantum observables diagonal in the same "incoherent" basis can be measured jointly, so some coherence is obviously required for measurement incompatibility. Here we first observe that coherence in a single observable is linked to the diagonal elements of any observable jointly measurable with it, leading to a general criterion for the coherence needed for incompatibility. Specializing to the case where the second observable is incoherent (diagonal), we develop a concrete method for solving incompatibility problems, tractable even in large systems by analytical bounds, without resorting to numerical optimization. We verify the consistency of our method by a quick proof of the known noise bound for mutually unbiased bases, and apply it to study emergent classicality in the spin-boson model of an N-qubit open quantum system. Finally, we formulate our theory in an operational resource-theoretic setting involving "genuinely incoherent operations" used previously in the literature, and show that if the coherence is insufficient to sustain incompatibility, the associated joint measurements have sequential implementations via incoherent instruments.

TI Principle, Current Status, and Prospect of Nuclear Magnetic Resonance
   Gyroscopes (Invited)
SO ACTA OPTICA SINICA
AB Significance In the new round of information technology revolution represented by quantum technology and artificial intelligence, quantum sensing technology is not only an effective means to obtain high-precision information, but also a key factor affecting the development of new-quality productive forces. In particular, with the rapid development of equipment toward unmanned, clustered and intelligent directions, attitude control and autonomous navigation systems based on quantum inertial technology have caught focused attention. As an important research direction of quantum inertial technology, the nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) gyroscope is a new type of gyroscope that balances performances such as high precision and small volume after rotor gyroscopes, optical wave Sagnac interferometric gyroscopes and MEMS gyroscopes. It is also the first type of atomic gyroscope that has formed an inertial navigation system and completed on-board verification. It has important application prospects in scenarios such as underwater autonomous navigation of unmanned underwater vehicles, autonomous cruise and formation flight of unmanned aerial vehicle swarms, and autonomous navigation of unmanned vehicles in non-satellite-supported areas. Progress With the support of the "Navigation Grade Integrated Micro Gyroscope" program of DARPA, USA, Northrop Grumman Corporation of USA has successfully developed a miniaturized NMR gyroscope based on optical bonding and stacking technology. The gyroscope head has a volume of 10 cm3, a bias stability of 0.02 (degrees)/root h, an angular random walk of 0.001 (degrees)/, a bandwidth of 300 Hz, a measurement range of 2500 (degrees)/s, and a scale factor nonlinearity better than 5x10(-6). The successful development of this prototype means that this type of gyroscope has initially crossed the threshold of engineering application. In recent years, the University of California in the USA has developed NMR gyroscopes by employing micro-electromechanical system (MEMS) technology. With the funding of the DARPA "C-SCAN" program of USA, it has developed a foldable miniaturized NMR gyroscope with a volume of approximately 19.2 cm3 (about 4 cmx4 cmx1.2 cm), which is further optimized to 4.8 cm3 (about 2 cmx2 cmx1.2 cm). Subsequently, the MEMS process optimization of components such as the magnetic field coil, spherical gas cell, non-magnetic heating sheet and optical elements of the NMR gyroscope is completed, promoting the development of the NMR gyroscope toward miniaturization. Conclusions and Prospects It has been more than 70 years since the proposal of the NMR gyroscope. Its process integration scheme has evolved from "lamp pumping+mechanical structure" to "laser pumping+optical bonding and stacking", and then to "laser pumping+MEMS process". Additionally, its sensitive medium has changed from "Hg-199+Hg-201" to "Xe-129+Xe-131", with its gradually improved technical specifications. This proves that the NMR gyroscope can balance navigation-grade precision and small volume. With the advancement of the MEMS gyroscope toward navigation grade and the rapid development of micro-hemispherical resonant gyroscopes, the NMR gyroscope faces not only technical challenges such as the realization of its own miniaturized mass production process, precision maintenance under small volume and stable control of the rotation-sensitive axis, but also engineering application competition.
   The NMR gyroscope is developing toward miniaturization suitable for mass production and large dynamic range with navigation-grade precision, and has sound application prospects in military and civilian fields such as unmanned aerial vehicle swarms, underwater unmanned vehicles, individual soldier equipment and autonomous vehicles. In addition, the "co-magnetometer" embedded in the NMR gyroscope has typical applications in fields such as dark matter detection.

TI Storage and retrieval of optical solitons in nanofibersemiconductor
   quantum dot molecule coupling systems
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB The best carrier for quantum information transmission is light signal, which has a fast propagation speed and can carry a large amount of information. However, during the propagation of light, dispersion effect and diffraction effect can cause quantum information to be distorted to a certain extent. On the contrary, optical solitons are formed due to the balance between the system's dispersion (diffraction) effect and nonlinear effect, and they exhibit very high stability and fidelity. Therefore, they have received widespread attention in electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) media with ultracold atoms. However, cold atomic gas media require extremely low operating temperatures, and the performances of the materials are difficult to control precisely. These factors are unfavorable for the miniaturization and integration of future information devices, thus significantly limiting their practical applications. Semiconductor quantum dot media, on the other hand, possess advantages such as discrete energy level structures and spectral properties similar to those of cold atomic gases, longer decoherence times, larger electric dipole moments, more significant nonlinear optical effects, and easy integration, making them an ideal alternative to cold atomic media. In this work, semiconductor quantum dots are coupled with optical fibers, the most common carrier in optical communication, to explore the formation, storage, and retrieval of temporal optical solitons in the coupled system. The results show that due to the tunneling-induced transparency effect between dots in semiconductor quantum dot molecules, light absorption in the system is greatly suppressed. At the same time, the transverse confinement of the nanofiber can enhance the interaction between light and the system, and the enhanced nonlinear response of the system can balance the dispersion effect, resulting in stable temporal optical solitons. Further research indicates that by turning on and off the inter-dot tunneling coupling, the high-efficiency and high-fidelity storage and retrieval of optical solitons can be realized in the system. These findings have certain guiding significance and potential application value for the processing all-optical information in solid quantum materials.

TI Accurate Nonrelativistic Energy Calculations for Helium
   1snp1,3P (n = 2 to 27) States via
   Correlated B-Spline Basis Functions
SO ATOMS
AB Rydberg atoms play a crucial role in testing atomic structure theory, quantum computing and simulation. Measurements of transition frequencies from the 21,3S states to Rydberg P1,3 states have reached a precision of several kHz, which poses significant challenges for theoretical calculations, since the accuracy of variational energy calculations decreases rapidly with increasing principal quantum number n. Recently the complex "triple" Hylleraas basis was employed to attain the ionization energy of helium 24P1 state with high accuracy. Different from it, we extended the correlated B-spline basis functions (C-BSBFs) to calculate the Rydberg states of helium. The nonrelativistic energies of 1snpP1,3 states up to n=27 achieve at least 14 significant digits using a unified basis set, thereby greatly reducing the complexity of the optimization process. Results of geometric structure parameters and cusp conditions were presented as well. Both the global operator and direct calculation methods are employed and cross-checked for contact potentials. This C-BSBF method not only obtains high-accuracy energies across all studied levels but also confirms the effectiveness of the C-BSBFs in depicting long-range and short-range correlation effects, laying a solid foundation for future high-accuracy Rydberg-state calculations with relativistic and QED corrections included in helium atom and low-Z helium-like ions.

TI Quantum Artificial Intelligence Based Node Localization Technique for
   Wireless Networks
SO CMC-COMPUTERS MATERIALS & CONTINUA
AB Artificial intelligence (AI) techniques have received significant attention among research communities in the field of networking, image processing, natural language processing, robotics, etc. At the same time, a major problem in wireless sensor networks (WSN) is node localization, which aims to identify the exact position of the sensor nodes (SN) using the known position of several anchor nodes. WSN comprises a massive number of SNs and records the position of the nodes, which becomes a tedious process. Besides, the SNs might be subjected to node mobility and the position alters with time. So, a precise node localization (NL) manner is required for determining the location of the SNs. In this view, this paper presents a new quantum bird migration optimizer-based NL (QBMA-NL) technique for WSN. The goal of the QBMA-NL approach is for determining the position of unknown nodes in the network by the use of anchor nodes. The QBMA-NL technique is mainly based on the mating behavior of bird species at the time of mating season. In addition, an objective function is derived based on the received signal strength indicator (RSSI) and Euclidean distance from the known to unknown SNs. For demonstrating the improved performance of the QBMA-NL technique, a wide range of simulations take place and the results reported the supreme performance over the recent NL techniques.

TI Tomographic entanglement indicators from NMR experiments
SO JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS
AB In recent years, the performance of different entanglement indicators obtained directly from tomograms has been assessed in continuous-variable and hybrid quantum systems. In this paper, we carry out this task in the case of spin systems. We compute the entanglement indicators from actual experimental data obtained from three liquid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) experiments and compare them with standard entanglement measures calculated from the corresponding density matrices, both experimentally reconstructed and numerically computed. The gross features of entanglement dynamics and spin squeezing properties are found to be reproduced by these entanglement indicators. However, the extent to which these indicators and spin squeezing track the entanglement during time evolution of the multipartite systems in the NMR experiments is very sensitive to the precise nature and strength of interactions as well as the manner in which the full system is partitioned into subsystems. We also use the IBM quantum computer to implement equivalent circuits that capture the dynamics of the multipartite system in one of the NMR experiments and carry out a similar comparative assessment of the performance of tomographic indicators. This exercise shows that these indicators can estimate the degree of entanglement without necessitating detailed state reconstruction procedures, establishing the advantage of the tomographic approach.

TI Inverse superconductor-insulator transition in weakly monitored
   Josephson junction arrays
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB Control and manipulation of quantum states by measurements and bath engineering in open quantum systems, like in a quantum computer, have emerged as new paradigms in many-body physics. Taking a prototypical example of Josephson junction arrays (JJAs), we show how monitoring through continuous weak measurements and feedback can transform an insulating steady state in JJAs to a superconductor (SC) and vice versa. We show that the quantum feedback, when not too large, is crucial to realize such a superconducting steady state by maintaining an effective temperature in a semiclassical limit. However, we show that large feedback can destroy superconductivity by enhancing quantum phase fluctuations. Thus, dissipation and phase fluctuations in the presence of monitoring have fundamental differences from those in the well-studied case of JJAs in contact with an equilibrium Ohmic bath. In general, a description in terms of only an effective temperature is not adequate for the monitored JJAs. Using a variational approximation, and by considering various limiting cases, we demonstrate that these differences can give rise to reentrant SC-insulator phase transitions leading to an unusual inverse transition from a seemingly low-effective-temperature insulating normal state to a superconducting state at intermediate temperature.

TI Local ergotropy dynamically witnesses many-body localized phases
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Many-body localization is a dynamical phenomenon characteristic of strongly interacting and disordered many-body quantum systems that fail to achieve thermal equilibrium. From a quantum information perspective, one of the most relevant fingerprints of this phenomenon is the logarithmic growth of the entanglement entropy over time. We perform intensive numerical simulations, applied to a paradigmatic model system, showing that the local ergotropy, the maximum extractable work via local unitary operations on a small subsystem in the presence of Hamiltonian coupling, dynamically witnesses the change from ergodic to localized phases. Within the many-body localized phase, both the local ergotropy and its quantum fluctuations slowly vary over time with a characteristic logarithmic law analogous to the behavior of entanglement entropy. This showcases how directly leveraging local control, instead of local observables or entropies analyzed in previous works, provides a thermodynamic marker of localization phenomena based on the locally extractable work.

TI All-optical controlled multichannel nonlinear holography for switchable
   beam shaping in an atomic vapor
SO OPTICA
AB Nonlinear holography is a powerful technique for shaping beams at new optical frequencies. Selectively reconstructing target wavefront information from multichannel nonlinear holography is challenging due to the critical phase-matching condition. Herein, we propose a scheme for all-optical controlled multichannel nonlinear holography using four-wave mixing (FWM) in Rb vapor. A dispersion-controlled wavevector was dynamically tuned to achieve a full phase-matching condition for efficient target wavefront reconstruction. We adjusted the frequency and intensity of the control beam to selectively reconstruct annular vortex arrays in the FWM signal. Four switchable holographic channels were established for beam shaping via experimental parameter optimization. Our study demonstrates that the atomic system is ideal for studying nonlinear control of structured light and aids in constructing all-optical multichannel devices for classical and quantum information processing.

TI Sub-20 kHz low-frequency noise near ultraviolet butt-coupled fiber Bragg
   grating external cavity laser diode
SO APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS
AB We present a butt-coupled InGaN fiber Bragg grating (FBG) semiconductor laser diode operating below 400 nm in the single-mode emission regime. This compact coherent laser source exhibits an intrinsic linewidth of 14 kHz in the near-UV range and a side-mode suppression ratio reaching up to 40 dB accompanied by almost 2 mW output power. Furthermore, the properties of the FBG, including its central wavelength, bandwidth, and reflectivity, can be readily customized to fulfill specific requirements. As a result, the small footprint design of this laser is compatible with integration into a standard butterfly package to ease the lab-to-market technology transfer. The combination of low-frequency noise and fibered output signal positions these FBG laser systems as strong candidates for hybridization with integrated photonic platforms tailored for quantum information processing and metrology.

TI Strong Electron-Vibration Signals in Weakly Coupled Molecular Junctions:
   Activation of Spin-Crossover
SO NANO LETTERS
AB Manipulating individual molecular spin states with electronic current has the potential to revolutionize quantum information devices. However, it is still unclear how a current can cause a spin transition in single-molecule devices. Here, we propose a spin-crossover (SCO) mechanism induced by electron-phonon coupling in an iron(II) phthalocyanine molecule situated on a graphene-decoupled Ir(111) substrate. We performed simulations of both elastic and inelastic electron tunneling spectroscopy (IETS), which reveal current-induced Fe-N vibrations and an underestimation of established electron-vibration signals. Going beyond standard perturbation theory, we examined molecules in various charge and spin states using the Franck-Condon framework. The increased probability of spin switching suggests that notable IETS signals indicate SCO triggered by the inelastic vibrational excitation associated with Fe-N stretching.

TI Extracting GHZ states from linear cluster states
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Quantum information processing architectures typically only allow for nearest -neighbor entanglement creation. In many cases, this prevents the direct generation of GHZ states, which are commonly used for many communication and computation tasks. Here, we show how to obtain GHZ states between nodes in a network that are connected in a straight line, naturally allowing them to initially share linear cluster states. We prove a strict upper bound of [(n + 3)/2J on the size of the set of nodes sharing a GHZ state that can be obtained from a linear cluster state of n qubits, using local Clifford unitaries, local Pauli measurements, and classical communication. Furthermore, we completely characterize all selections of nodes below this threshold that can share a GHZ state obtained within this setting. Finally, we demonstrate these transformations on the IBMQ Montreal quantum device for linear cluster states of up to n = 19 qubits.

TI Quantum spread complexity in neutrino oscillations
SO EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL C
AB Quantum information theory has recently emerged as a flourishing area of research and quantum complexity, one of its powerful measures, is being applied for investigating complex systems in many areas of physics. Its application to practical physical situations, however, is still few and far between. Neutrino flavor oscillation is a widely studied physical phenomena with far reaching consequences in understanding the standard model of particle physics and to search for physics beyond it. Oscillation arises because of mixing between the flavor and mass eigenstates, and their evolution over time. It is an inherent quantum system for which flavor transitions are traditionally studied with probabilistic measures. We have applied quantum complexity formalism as an alternate measure to study neutrino oscillations. In particular, quantum spread complexity revealed additional information on the violation of charge-parity symmetry in the neutrino sector. Our results indicate that complexity favors the maximum violation of charge-parity, hinted recently by experimental data.

AB Since its invention in 2001, superconducting nanowire single-photon detector (SNSPD) has rapidly grown into a star photon detector in the near-infrared band. Up to date, its system detection efficiency has exceeded 95% at the wavelength of 1550 nm, dark count rate less than 1 cps (counts per second), timing jitter better than 10 ps, detection rate higher than 1 GHz, and it is widely used in the field of quantum information. Recently, limited by the low signal-to-noise ratio and afterpulsing of semiconductor single-photon detectors in the near-infrared band, researchers began to introduce SNSPDs into biology. This article introduces the detection principle and performance of SNSPD, and review the application status and development prospects of SNSPD in the field of biology.

TI Families of bosonic suppression laws beyond the permutation symmetry
   principle
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB Exact cancellation of quantum amplitudes in multiphoton interferences with Fock states at the input, the so-called suppression or zero transmission laws generalizing the Hong-Ou-Mandel dip, are useful tools in quantum information and computation. It was recently suggested that all bosonic suppression laws follow from a common permutation symmetry both in the input quantum state and in the unitary matrix of the interferometer. By using the recurrence relations for the interference of Fock states, we find a wealth of suppression laws on the beamsplitter and tritter interferometers that do not follow from the permutation symmetry principle. In general, our results point on the existence of whole families of suppression laws with only a fraction of them being accounted for by the permutation symmetry principle, suggested as the general principle behind all the suppression laws.

TI Joint remote state preparation in multi-hop network under noisy
   environment
SO PHYSICA SCRIPTA
AB Joint remote state preparation is an important method to transmit quantum information with more senders and higher security. In this paper, we present a deterministic joint remote state preparation scheme in multi-hop network with two senders and N intermediate parties, using only projective measurements and recovery operations. We describe the scheme under the framework of density matrix to investigate the performance of the scheme in noisy environment. The relation of fidelity, noise rate and the number of intermediate nodes is given for three types of noise. It is revealed that the average fidelity attains its minimum when the noise rate is at the most uncertain point, decreases monotonically as the number of intermediate nodes increases. However, in some special cases, the average fidelity of the multi-hop scheme is greater than some existing one step joint remote state preparation scheme.

TI Light-matter entanglement after above-threshold ionization processes in
   atoms
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Light-matter entanglement plays a fundamental role in many applications of quantum information science. Thus, finding processes where it can be observed is an important task. Here, using a one-dimensional model, we address this matter by investigating theoretically the entanglement between light and electrons generated in the above-threshold ionization (ATI) process. The study is based on the backaction of the ATI process on the quantum optical state of the system, and its dependence on the kinetic energy and direction of the emitted photoelectrons. Taking into account the dynamics of the process, we demonstrate the creation of hybrid entangled states. The amount of entanglement has been studied in terms of the entropy of entanglement. Additionally, we use the Wigner function of the driving field mode to motivate the entanglement characterization when considering electrons propagating in opposite directions.

TI Coexistence of antiferromagnetism and superconductivity in Mn/Nb(110)
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB We report on the structural, magnetic, and superconducting properties of single and double atomic layers of Mn on a clean and unreconstructed Nb(110) substrate. Low-temperature scanning tunneling spectroscopy measurements reveal a proximity-induced superconducting state and in-gap Yu-Shiba-Rusinov bands in the Mn thin films, which are found to grow pseudomorphically on the Nb surface. Spin-polarized scanning tunneling microscopy measurements reveal a c(2 x 2) antiferromagnetic (AFM) order in the Mn layers, with an out-of-plane spin orientation. First-principles density functional theory calculations confirm the experimentally observed magnetic state, which is understood as the consequence of a strong intralayer and interlayer nearest-neighbor AFM exchange coupling. These results are expected to be of importance for the design of superconducting AFM spintronic systems and quantum information technologies.

TI Variational approach to relative entropies with an application to QFT
SO LETTERS IN MATHEMATICAL PHYSICS
AB We define a new divergence of von Neumann algebras using a variational expression similar in nature to Kosaki's formula for Umegaki's relative entropy. Our divergence satisfies several of the usual desirable properties, upper bounds the sandwiched Renyi entropy and reduces to the fidelity in a limit. As an illustration, we use the formula in quantum field theory to compute our divergence between the vacuum in a bipartite system and an "orbifolded"-in the sense of a conditional expectation-system in terms of the Jones index. We take the opportunity to point out an entropic certainty relation associated with an inclusion of von Neumann factors related to the relative entropy. This certainty relation has an equivalent formulation in terms of error correcting codes.

TI Optically detected NMR in a diamond-anvil cell for geochemistry
SO RECENT HIGHLIGHTS I
SE Advances in Inorganic Chemistry
AB Developments in quantum-information processing are being adapted to perform nuclear-magnetic resonance (NMR) measurements on solutions in very small volumes. Here we describe efforts to adapt the technology to a diamond-anvil cell (DAC), with the goal of conducting solution NMR measurements at elevated pressures and temperatures. At the center of the method is the use of diamonds that have a particular type of defect that pairs a nitrogen atom substitution for near-surface carbon with a vacancy. These NV- sites have unpaired electrons that can be excited while conserving electron spins and the amount of light released upon decay of the excited state depends upon the orientation of the electron spin. Under certain conditions the NV- centers can probe AC magnetic fields from nearby nuclei with exquisite sensitivity.

TI Enhanced frequency and temperature estimation by a PT-symmetric
   quantum oscillator
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Quantum metrology employs quantum properties to enhance the precision of physical parameters, in order to characterize quantum states as well as channels. Frequency and temperature estimations are of fundamental importance for these tasks and have been extensively studied in quantum sensing strategies. Among the quantum features that can be exploited in quantum metrology, those related to non-Hermitian systems have received much attention in recent times. Here, we consider a paradigmatic non-Hermitian system, the quantum Swanson oscillator, as a probe system in order to investigate how the non-Hermitian contribution affects the frequency and temperature estimation. We use the quantum Fisher information to compute the main results. Furthermore, to perform a fair comparison, we define a gain function which is the ratio between the quantum Fisher information with the non-Hermitian contribution and the quantum Fisher information when this term becomes Hermitian. In addition, the quantum Fisher information is discussed in terms of the energetic cost to include the non-Hermitian contribution. Dissipative effects are also considered by interacting different probe systems with a Markovian thermal reservoir. Given that we obtain the Hermitian counterpart of the Hamiltonian by applying the Dyson map, we also study the estimation of the parameters characterizing this mapping. Our results indicate that the non-Hermitian contribution in the Swanson quantum oscillator can contribute to enhancing the frequency and temperature estimation.

TI Quantitative Electron Beam-Single Atom Interactions Enabled by Sub-20-pm
   Precision Targeting
SO ADVANCED SCIENCE
AB The ability to probe and control matter at the picometer scale is essential for advancing quantum and energy technologies. Scanning transmission electron microscopy offers powerful capabilities for materials analysis and modification, but sample damage, drift, and scan distortions hinder single atom analysis and deterministic manipulation. Materials analysis and modification via electron-solid interactions can be transformed by precise delivery of electrons to a specified atomic location, maintaining the beam position despite drift, and minimizing collateral dose. Here a fast, low-dose, sub-20-pm precision electron beam positioning technique is developed, "atomic lock-on," (ALO), which offers the ability to position the beam on a specific atomic column without previously irradiating that column. This technique is used to lock onto a single selected atomic location to repeatedly measure its weak electron energy loss signal despite sample drift. Moreover, electron beam-matter interactions in single atomic events are measured with mu s$\,\umu\mathrm{s}$ time resolution. This enables observation of single-atom dynamics, such as atomic bistability, revealing partially bonded atomic configurations and recapture phenomena. This opens prospects for using electron microscopy for high-precision measurements and deterministic control of matter for quantum technologies.

TI Electrically interfaced Brillouin-active waveguide for microwave
   photonic measurements
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB New strategies for converting signals between optical and microwave domains could play a pivotal role in advancing both classical and quantum technologies. Traditional approaches to optical-to-microwave transduction typically perturb or destroy the information encoded on intensity of the light field, eliminating the possibility for further processing or distribution of these signals. In this paper, we introduce an optical-to-microwave conversion method that allows for both detection and spectral analysis of microwave photonic signals without degradation of their information content. This functionality is demonstrated using an optomechanical waveguide integrated with a piezoelectric transducer. Efficient electromechanical and optomechanical coupling within this system permits bidirectional optical-to-microwave conversion with a quantum efficiency of up to -54.16 dB. Leveraging the preservation of the optical field envelope in intramodal Brillouin scattering, we demonstrate a multi-channel microwave photonic filter by transmitting an optical signal through a series of electro-optomechanical waveguide segments, each with distinct resonance frequencies. Such electro-optomechanical systems could offer flexible strategies for remote sensing, channelization, and spectrum analysis in microwave photonics.
   The authors showcase an optical-to-microwave conversion method using an optomechanical waveguide integrated with a piezoelectric transducer. The presented system allows bidirectional optical-to-microwave conversion with a quantum efficiency of up to-54.16 dB.

TI Photoinduced EPR and ENDOR studies of the divacancies and
   nitrogen-vacancy defects in silicon carbide
SO MAGNETIC RESONANCE IN SOLIDS
AB Defects (color centers) in wide-gap semiconductors are considered as the basis for the realization of highly sensitive sensors, single-photon sources, and for the implementation of quantum technologies. Silicon carbide (SiC) crystal can serve as a reliable solid-state matrix for the range of high-spin (electron spin S = 1) color centers to become an alternative to the diamond with the widely-known nitrogen-vacancy (NV-) centers. This paper reviews the electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and electron-nuclear double resonance (ENDOR) studies of the divacancies (VV) and negatively charged NV- centers in different SiC polytypes. The main spin Hamiltonian components of non-equivalent spin defects in SiC are presented depending on their structural features (positions) and local environment: the zero-field splitting (D approximate to 1.3 GHz), hyperfine (A approximate to 1.1 MHz) and quadrupole (P approximate to 1.8 MHz) interaction values. The luminescence spectrum of the color center in SiC (lambda = 1.1 - 1.25 mu m) in near-IR range is favorable for fiberoptic channels (O-band) and biological objects study, which brings these defects to a higher level of practical application.

TI Microwave-Based Quantum Control and Coherence Protection of Tin-Vacancy
   Spin Qubits in a Strain-Tuned Diamond-Membrane Heterostructure
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW X
AB Robust spin-photon interfaces in solids are essential components in quantum networking and sensing technologies. Ideally, these interfaces combine a long-lived spin memory, coherent optical transitions, fast and high-fidelity spin manipulation, and straightforward device integration and scaling. The tin-vacancy center (SnV) in diamond is a promising spin-photon interface with desirable optical and spin properties at 1.7 K. However, the SnV spin lacks efficient microwave control, and its spin coherence degrades with higher temperature. In this work, we introduce a new platform that overcomes these challenges-SnV centers in uniformly strained thin diamond membranes. The controlled generation of crystal strain introduces orbital mixing that allows microwave control of the spin state with 99.36(9)% gate fidelity and spin coherence protection beyond a millisecond. Moreover, the presence of crystal strain suppresses temperature-dependent dephasing processes, leading to a considerable improvement of the coherence time up to 223(10) mu s at 4 K, a widely accessible temperature in common cryogenic systems. Critically, the coherence of optical transitions is unaffected by the elevated temperature, exhibiting nearly lifetime-limited optical linewidths. Combined with the compatibility of diamond membranes with device integration, the demonstrated platform is an ideal spin-photon interface for future quantum technologies.

TI Quantum hypothesis testing via robust quantum control
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB Quantum hypothesis testing plays a pivotal role in quantum technologies, making decisions or drawing conclusions about quantum systems based on observed data. Recently, quantum control techniques have been successfully applied to quantum hypothesis testing, enabling the reduction of error probabilities in the task of distinguishing magnetic fields in presence of environmental noise. In real-world physical systems, such control is prone to various channels of inaccuracies. Therefore improving the robustness of quantum control in the context of quantum hypothesis testing is crucial. In this work, we utilize optimal control methods to compare scenarios with and without accounting for the effects of signal frequency inaccuracies. For parallel dephasing and spontaneous emission, the optimal control inherently demonstrates a certain level of robustness, while in the case of transverse dephasing with an imperfect signal, it may result in a higher error probability compared to the uncontrolled scheme. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a robust control approach optimized for a range of signal noise, demonstrating superior robustness beyond the predefined tolerance window. On average, both the optimal control and robust control show improvements over the uncontrolled schemes for various dephasing or decay rates, with the robust control yielding the lowest error probability.

TI Quantum-Safe Group Key Establishment Protocol from Lattice Trapdoors
SO SENSORS
AB Group communication enables Internet of Things (IoT) devices to communicate in an efficient and fast manner. In most instances, a group message needs to be encrypted using a cryptographic key that only devices in the group know. In this paper, we address the problem of establishing such a key using a lattice-based one-way function, which can easily be inverted using a suitably designed lattice trapdoor. Using the notion of a bad/good basis, we present a new method of coupling multiple private keys into a single public key, which is then used for encrypting a group message. The protocol has the apparent advantage of having a conjectured resistance against potential quantum-computer-based attacks. All functions-key establishment, session key update, node addition, encryption, and decryption-are effected in constant time, using simple linear-algebra operations, making the protocol suitable for resource-constrained IoT networks. We show how a cryptographic session group key can be constructed on the fly by a user with legitimate credentials, making node-capture-type attacks impractical. The protocol also incorporates a mechanism for node addition and session-key generation in a forward- and backward-secrecy-preserving manner.

TI Rare-earth engineering of NaAlO3 perovskites unlocks unified
   optoelectronic, thermoelectric, and spintronic functionalities
SO PHYSICA B-CONDENSED MATTER
AB Perovskite oxides hold promise for energy and quantum technologies, but wide-gap hosts like NaAlO3 are limited by poor transport and deep-UV absorption. Using first-principles GGA + U + SOC calculations, we investigate Eu3+-, Gd3+-, and Tb3+-doped NaAlO3, analyzing electronic, optical, elastic, and thermoelectric properties. Rare-earth substitution is thermodynamically favorable (formation energies 1.2-1.6 eV) and induces strong f-p hybridization, reducing the pristine bandgap (similar to 6.2 eV) to similar to 3.1 eV (Tb). Spin-resolved band structures reveal Gd-driven half-metallicity, Eu-induced spin-selective metallicity, and Tb-stabilized p-type semiconducting behavior. Optical spectra show red-shifted absorption (similar to 2.0-2.2 eV), large dielectric constants (epsilon(1)(0) approximate to 95 for Eu), and plasmonic resonances near 4 eV, enabling visible-light harvesting. Elastic analysis indicates slight lattice softening with preserved ductility (B/G approximate to 1.56-1.57). Thermoelectric results show Seebeck coefficients >210 mu V/K (Eu, Tb) with ZT similar to 0.45 at 500 K, surpassing pristine NaAlO3. These findings position rare-earth-doped NaAlO3 as a multifunctional platform for photovoltaics, photocatalysis, thermoelectrics, and spintronics.

TI Hybridization of Terahertz Phonons and Magnons in Disparate and
   Spatially-Separated Material Specimens
SO ADVANCED FUNCTIONAL MATERIALS
AB The interaction between condensed matter excitations and electromagnetic cavity fields serves as a rich playground for fundamental research and lies at the core of photonic and quantum technologies. Herein, the intriguing concept of composite states formed by distinct quasiparticles strongly coupled to the same optical cavity modes is experimentally and theoretically demonstrated. Specifically, magnons excited in a slab of an antiferromagnetic crystal and phonons excited in a distinct specimen of an insulating material are explored. The crystal slabs form an optical cavity with Fabry-P & eacute;rot oscillations in the terahertz range. Hybridized phonon-magnon polariton modes and their tunability by adjusting the distance between the slabs, showing that hybridization persists even at separations of up to several millimeters is demonstrated. The experimental results are interpreted using both classical and quantum electrodynamical models. The quantum description allows us to quantify the degree of hybridization linked to a topological behavior of the electric field phasor, in agreement with the classical electrodynamics expectations. The presented results are obtained at room temperature and cavities of millimeter size, paving the way for the engineering of realistic, frequency-tunable THz devices through the hybridization of electric (phononics) and magnetic (spintronics) elementary excitations of matter.

TI Theory of criticality for quantum ferroelectric metals
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB A variety of compounds, for example, doped paraelectrics and polar metals, exhibit both ferroelectricity and correlated electronic phenomena such as low-density superconductivity and anomalous transport. Characterizing such properties is tied to understanding the quantum dynamics of inversion symmetry breaking in the presence of itinerant electrons. Here, we present a comprehensive analysis of the properties of a metal near a quantum critical transition to a ferroelectric state, in both two and three dimensions. Starting from a minimal model of electrons coupled to a transverse polar phonon via a Rashba-type spin-orbit interaction, we compute the dynamical response of both electrons and phonons. We find that the system can evince both Fermi and non-Fermi liquid phases, as well as enhanced pairing in both singlet and triplet channels. Furthermore, we systematically compute corrections to one-loop theory and find a tendency to quantum order-by-disorder, leading to a phase diagram that can include second-order, first-order, and finite-momentum phase transitions. Finally, we show that the entire phase diagram can be controlled via application of external strain, either compressive or volume-preserving. Our results provide a map of the dynamical and thermodynamical phase space of quantum ferroelectic metals, which can serve in characterizing existing materials and in seeking applications for quantum technologies.

TI Entanglement protection of classically driven qubits in a lossy cavity
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Quantum technologies able to manipulating single quantum systems, are presently developing. Among the dowries of the quantum realm, entanglement is one of the basic resources for the novel quantum revolution. Within this context, one is faced with the problem of protecting the entanglement when a system state is manipulated. In this paper, we investigate the effect of the classical driving field on the generation entanglement between two qubits interacting with a bosonic environment. We discuss the effect of the classical field on the generation of entanglement between two (different) qubits and the conditions under which it has a constructive role in protecting the initial-state entanglement from decay induced by its environment. In particular, in the case of similar qubits, we locate a stationary sub-space of the system Hilbert space, characterized by states non depending on the environment properties as well as on the classical driving-field. Thus, we are able to determine the conditions to achieve maximally entangled stationary states after a transient interaction with the environment. We show that, overall, the classical driving field has a constructive role for the entanglement protection in the strong coupling regime. Also, we illustrate that a factorable initial-state can be driven in an entangled state and, even, in an entangled steady-state after the interaction with the environment.

TI Optical-grade diamond: characteristics, synthesis, and recent research
   progress
SO FUNCTIONAL DIAMOND
AB Diamonds, characterized by their elegant tetrahedral arrangement of carbon atoms, exhibit outstanding thermal, mechanical, and electrical properties. In the fields of optics and photonics, diamonds are highly regarded for their exceptionally wide spectral transmission range, excellent thermo-optical properties, remarkable mechanical strength, and unique nonlinear optical characteristics. Recent advancements in chemical vapor deposition (CVD) technologies have enabled the production of synthetic diamonds with lower dislocation densities, reduced impurities, minimal residual stress, and low absorption coefficients, thereby meeting the stringent demands of optical applications, even under extreme conditions. Additionally, progress in diamond processing techniques-such as polishing, anti-reflection coatings, micro/nanostructuring, and color center engineering-has further enhanced the potential of optical-grade diamonds, expanding their applications in areas such as lasers, quantum technologies, and precision instrumentation. This review provides a comprehensive overview of recent research progress in diamond synthesis and processing technologies, with a focus on controlling dislocation density and impurity levels in optical-grade diamonds. Furthermore, it explores future development trends and advanced applications of diamonds, offering valuable insights and guidance for researchers dedicated to high-quality diamond crystal growth and its utilization.

TI Nearly quantum-limited microwave amplification via interfering
   degenerate stimulated emission in a single artificial atom
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Reaching the quantum limit for added noise in amplification processes is an important step toward many quantum technologies. Nearly quantum-limited traveling-wave parametric amplifiers with Josephson junction arrays have been developed and recently even become commercially available. However, the fundamental question of whether a single atom also can reach this quantum limit has not yet been answered in practice. Here, we investigate the amplification of a microwave probe signal by a superconducting artificial atom, a transmon, at the end of a semi-infinite transmission line, under a strong pump field. The end of the transmission line acts as a mirror for microwave fields. Due to the weak anharmonicity of the artificial atom, the strong pump field creates multi-photon excitations among the dressed states. Transitions between these dressed states, Rabi sidebands, give rise to either amplification or attenuation of the weak probe. We obtain a maximum power amplification of 1.402 +/- 0.025, higher than in any previous experiment with a single artificial atom. We achieve near-quantum-limited added noise (0.157 +/- 0.003 quanta; the quantum limit is 0.143 +/- 0.006 quanta for this level of amplification), due to quantum coherence between Rabi sidebands, leading to constructive interference between emitted photons.

TI Nonreciprocal optomechanically induced transparency and enhanced
   ground-state cooling in a reversed-dissipation cavity system
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB We explore the prospects of phase -modulated optical nonreciprocity and enhanced ground -state cooling of a mechanical resonator for the reversed -dissipation system, where the dissipative coupling between two cavities is realized through the adiabatic elimination of a low -Q mechanical mode, while a high -Q mechanical mode interacts with two mutually coupled cavities, forming a closed -loop structure. This unique system facilitates the nontrivial phenomenon of optomechanically induced transparency (OMIT), which exhibits asymmetry due to the frequency shift effect. We also observe the emergence of parity -dependent unidirectional OMIT windows (appearing under the phase -matching condition), which can be dynamically modulated by both the phase factors and the strength of the dissipative coupling. Furthermore, our study delves into the ground -state cooling effect operating within the reversed -dissipation regime. Intriguingly, the cooling effect can be significantly enhanced by carefully engineering dissipative complex coupling, such as in the phase -matching condition. The potential applications of this scheme extend to the fabrication of ideal optical isolators in optical communication systems and the manipulation of macroscopic mechanical resonators at the quantum level, presenting exciting opportunities in quantum technologies.

TI Long-range, non-local switching of spin textures in a frustrated
   antiferromagnet
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Several recent works have demonstrated current based control of antiferromagnetic order, with the potential that such switching could be used for information processing and storage. Here, Haley et al demonstrate that in FexNbS2, this switching is non-local, with magnetic order changing due to an applied current at distances much larger than the spin diffusion length in the material.
   Antiferromagnetic spintronics is an emerging area of quantum technologies that leverage the coupling between spin and orbital degrees of freedom in exotic materials. Spin-orbit interactions allow spin or angular momentum to be injected via electrical stimuli to manipulate the spin texture of a material, enabling the storage of information and energy. In general, the physical process is intrinsically local: spin is carried by an electrical current, imparted into the magnetic system, and the spin texture will then rotate in the region of current flow. In this study, we show that spin information can be transported and stored "non-locally" in the material FexNbS2. We propose that collective modes can manipulate the spin texture away from the flowing current, an effect amplified by strong magnetoelastic coupling of the ordered state. This suggests a novel way to store and transport spin information in strongly spin-orbit coupled magnetic systems.

TI Deterministic hBN Bubbles as a Versatile Platform for Studies on
   Single-Photon Emitters
SO ADVANCED FUNCTIONAL MATERIALS
AB Single-photon emitters (SPEs) in 2D materials are highly promising candidates for quantum technologies. SPEs in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) are widely investigated, but mostly in exfoliated or powder samples that require an activation process, making it difficult to compare studies and reproduce results. Here, this problem is addressed and a platform based on large-area metalorganic vapor phase epitaxy (MOVPE)-grown hBN is proposed, which combines reproducibility and scalability with the ability to readily host SPEs without activation. Through the creation of bubbles via electron-beam irradiation, additional functionalities are achieved, including an interference-mediated enhancement of emission by approximately 100-200%, dedicated structures that allow the relocation of individual emitters across different systems, and the opportunity to investigate strain-induced effects. Moreover, in contrast to other gas-filled bubbles that deflate at low temperatures, the bubbles remain stable under cryogenic conditions, allowing studies as a function of temperature. To improve the control over the shape and position of bubbles, a mask-based method is demonstrated that enables deterministic control over bubble formation. The presented hBN bubbles constitute a versatile platform for reproducible studies of hBN-based emitters, providing a reliable insight into their nature and properties.

   waveguides etched by chlorine-based inductive coupled plasma reactive
   ion etching
SO JOURNAL OF VACUUM SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY A
AB Among rare-earth ion-doped crystals that are of high interest for quantum technologies, yttrium orthosilicate [Y2SiO5 (YSO)] crystal has demonstrated the longest coherence times. Etching optical guiding structures enables the creation of complex structures offering the advantage of technological scalability. We report on the dry etching of YSO crystal wafers performed by inductive coupled plasma (ICP) reactive ion etching. The material etching rate, the etch rate selectivity versus the material mask, and the etched side wall's shape have been measured for various ICP process parameters and gas combinations including Ar-alone, Cl-2:Ar, and Cl-2:N-2 plasma chemistry. These gas-combination choices have enabled identifying the etching mechanisms involved. Etching results have evidenced that Ar ions are the primary contributors for YSO etching, with Cl ions being also efficient, while Cl neutrals play a marginal role. ICP YSO etching is predominantly a physical process carried out by ions. Several ICP powers and RF powers have been investigated. The highest 80 nm/min etch rate is obtained under the Ar-alone plasma, but at the expense of trenching, while chlorine-based etching provides no trenching and smooth side walls. The choice of the dielectric material mask is also discussed.

TI Education for expanding the quantum workforce: Students' perceptions of
   the quantum industry in an upper-division physics capstone course
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW PHYSICS EDUCATION RESEARCH
AB As quantum technologies transition out of the research lab and into commercial applications, it becomes important to better prepare students to enter this new and evolving workforce. To work toward this goal of preparing physics students for a career in the quantum industry, a senior capstone course called "Quantum Forge" was created at the University of Colorado Boulder. This course aims to provide students with a hands-on quantum experience and prepare them to enter the quantum workforce directly after their undergraduate studies. Some of the course's goals are to have students understand what comprises the quantum industry and have them feel confident they could enter the industry if desired. To understand to what extent these goals are achieved, we followed the first cohort of Quantum Forge students through their year in the course in order to understand their perceptions of the quantum industry, including what it is, whether they feel that they could be successful in it, and whether or not they want to participate in it. The results of this work can assist educators in optimizing the design of future quantum-industry-focused courses and programs to better prepare students to be a part of this burgeoning industry.

TI Spectroscopy of the 85Rb 4D3/2 state for
   hyperfine-structure determination
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB We report a measurement of the hyperfine-structure constants of the Rb-85 4D(3/2) state using two-photon optical spectroscopy of the 5S(1/2) -> 4D(3/2) transition. The spectra are acquired by measuring the transmission of the low-power 795 nm lower-stage laser beam through a cold-atom sample as a function of laser frequency, with the frequency of the upper-stage, 1476 nm laser fixed. All 4 hyperfine components of the 4D(3/2) state are well-resolved in the experimental data. The dominant systematic is the light shift from the 1476 nm laser, which is addressed by extrapolating line positions measured for a set of 1476 nm laser powers to zero laser power. The analysis of our experimental data yields both the magnetic-dipole and electric-quadrupole constants for the (85)Rb4D(3/2) level, without using earlier hyperfine measurements of other atomic levels. The respective results, A =7.419(35) MHz and B =4.19(19) MHz, are discussed in context with previous works. Our investigation may be useful for optical atomic clocks for precision metrology and emerging atom-based quantum technologies, all-infrared excitation of Rb Rydberg levels, and molecular physics.

TI Frequency stabilisation and SI tracing of mid-infrared quantum-cascade
   lasers for precision molecular spectroscopy
SO MOLECULAR PHYSICS
AB The advancement of technologies for the precise interrogation of molecules offers exciting possibilities for new studies in the realms of precision spectroscopy and quantum technologies. Experiments in these domains often address molecular vibrations in the mid-infrared (MIR) spectral region, thus generating the need for spectrally pure and accurate MIR laser sources. Quantum-cascade lasers (QCLs) have emerged as flexible sources of coherent radiation available over a wide range of MIR frequencies. Here, we demonstrate a robust approach for the simultaneous linewidth narrowing, frequency stabilisation, and absolute frequency referencing of MIR QCLs all of which are prerequisites for precise spectroscopic experiments. Following upconversion of its radiation to the visible domain, we implement a phase lock of the QCL to a linewidth-narrowed optical frequency comb which is referenced to a remote SI-traceable primary frequency standard via a fibre link for absolute frequency calibration. To achieve a reliable frequency counting of the beat note between the QCL and the OFC, we employ redundant tracking oscillators and demonstrate a frequency instability of 5x10(-13) at 1 s and 2x10(-14) at 1000 s integration time, limited by the accuracy of our remote reference.

TI Metastability in Individual Magnetic Vortices at Low Temperatures
SO SMALL STRUCTURES
AB Magnetic vortices are relevant in fields like biomedicine, data storage, and quantum technologies. For quantum applications, it is crucial to have nanoparticles free from metastable configurations and with narrow switching field distributions, especially at very low temperatures, where vortex nucleation and annihilation have rarely been studied. This work shows that these properties are strongly influenced by the shape of the nanoparticle, with an even greater impact at low temperatures. To investigate this, high-transition-temperature nanoscopic Superconducting Quantum Interference Devices are used to detect the magnetization of individual permalloy nanodiscs that host a magnetic vortex. Both the sensors and the nanodiscs are fabricated using focused ion beam milling, and each nanodisc is carefully attached to the sensor using a micromanipulator inside a dual-beam microscope. The measurements allow to explore the complex energy landscape that governs vortex nucleation and annihilation at the nanoscale, particularly at low temperatures. This study quantifies how likely it is for the system to get trapped in metastable states and shows that this can be minimized by carefully controlling the nanoparticle's shape during fabrication. This study's data thus illustrate how ion beam nanofabrication enables precise control over nanoparticle morphology, with significant implications for their performance.

TI Strong Local Passivity in Unconventional Scenarios: A New Protocol for
   Amplified Quantum Energy Teleportation
SO ENTROPY
AB Quantum energy teleportation (QET) has been proposed to overcome the restrictions of strong local passivity (SLP) and to facilitate energy transfer in quantum systems. Traditionally, QET has only been considered under strict constraints, including the requirements that the initial state be the ground state of an interacting Hamiltonian, that Alice's measurement commute with the interaction terms, and that entanglement be present. These constraints have significantly limited the broader applicability of QET protocols. In this work, we demonstrate that SLP can arise beyond these conventional constraints, establishing the necessity of QET in a wider range of scenarios for local energy extraction. This leads to a more flexible and generalized framework for QET. Furthermore, we introduce the concept of a "local effective Hamiltonian," which eliminates the need for optimization techniques in determining Bob's optimal energy extraction in QET protocols. As an additional advantage, the amount of energy that can be extracted using our new protocol is amplified to be 7.2 times higher than that of the original protocol. These advancements enhance our understanding of QET and extend its broader applications to quantum technologies. To support our findings, we implement the protocol on quantum hardware, confirming its theoretical validity and experimental feasibility.

TI Luminescence From Localized States in Solids: A First-Principles
   Perspective
SO ADVANCED FUNCTIONAL MATERIALS
AB Localized-state luminescence (LSL) has emerged as a promising mechanism for high-performance optoelectronic applications, including lighting, photodetection, and quantum technologies. Characterized by rich and intriguing spectral features, LSL involves significant electron-phonon coupling, which varies in strength across different systems. First-principles methods, particularly density functional theory (DFT) and its extensions provide an efficient framework for modeling the LSL process with reasonable accuracy. This comprehensive review examines DFT-based studies on three representative types of LSL in solids: luminescence from self-trapped excitons (STEs), normal defects, and intentionally doped ions. The discussion begins with an overview of the entire LSL process, highlighting computational methods for excited state structures and energies, as well as simulations of the luminescent spectrum within a multi-phonon transition framework. Detailed discussions follow, focusing on the structural distortion modes of STEs, spectral behavior of normal defects, and transition mechanisms in intentionally doped ions. Finally, strategies to address current challenges and advance the theoretical design of high-performance LSL materials are proposed, offering valuable insights for future developments in the field.

TI Lithium niobate on insulator: an emerging nanophotonic crystal for
   optimized light control
SO BEILSTEIN JOURNAL OF NANOTECHNOLOGY
AB Lithium niobate (LN) stands out as a versatile nonlinear optoelectronic material which can be directly applied in tunable modulators, filters, parametric amplifiers, and photonic integrated circuits. Recently, LN photonic crystals have garnered attention as a compelling candidate for incorporation into photonic integrated circuits, showcasing their potential in advancing the field. Photonic crystals possess a widely acknowledged capability to manipulate the transmission of light modes, similar to how nanostructures have been utilized to regulate electron-related phenomena. Here we study the optical performance of a one-dimensional stacked photonic crystal based on LN and TiO2/SiO2. We studied the quarter wavelength multi-layered stack using electromagnetic simulation. The forbidden-frequency region indifferent from the bulk material has been observed around 1.55 mu m. A high refractive index and non-linear optical and electro-optical properties enable LN to be used for more efficient manipulation of light. The highly reflective quarternary stack can play an important role in diverse fields such as photonics, optomechanics, optoelectronics, signal processing, and quantum technologies, spanning the spectrum from photon generation (including single-photon sources and lasers) to their manipulation (encompassing waveguiding, beam splitting, filters, and spin-photon entanglement), and detection (involving single-photon detectors).

TI Unveiling sulfur vacancy pairs as bright and stable color centers in
   monolayer WS2
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Color centers, arising from zero-dimensional defects, exploit quantum confinement to access internal electron quantum degrees of freedom, holding potential for quantum technologies. Despite intensive research, the structural origin of many color centers remains elusive. In this study, we employ in-situ cathodoluminescence scanning transmission electron microscopy combined with integrated differential phase contrast imaging to examine how defect configuration in tungsten sulfide determines color-center emission. Using an 80-kV accelerated electron beam, defects were deliberately produced, visualized, excited in situ and characterized in real time in monolayer WS2 within hBN|WS2 | hBN heterostructures at 100 K. These color centers were simultaneously measured by cathodoluminescence microscopy and differentiated by machine learning. Supported by DFT calculations, our results identified a crucial sulfur vacancy configuration organized into featured vacancy pairs, generating stable and bright luminescence at 660 nm. These findings elucidate the atomic-level structure-exciton relationship of color centers, advancing our understanding and quantum applications of defects in 2D materials.
   The controlled fabrication and microscopic understanding of quantum emitters in 2D materials remain challenging. Here, the authors report the production and characterization of defects in monolayer WS2 via cathodoluminescence electron microscopy, identifying sulfur vacancy pairs as bright and stable emitters at 660 nm.

TI A highly stable and fully tunable open microcavity platform at cryogenic
   temperatures
SO APL PHOTONICS
AB Open-access microcavities are a powerful tool to enhance light-matter interactions for solid-state quantum and nano systems and are key to advance applications in quantum technologies. For this purpose, the cavities should simultaneously meet two conflicting requirements - full tunability to cope with spatial and spectral inhomogeneities of a material, and highest stability under operation in a cryogenic environment to maintain resonance conditions. To tackle this challenge, we have developed a fully-tunable, open-access, fiber-based Fabry-P\'erot microcavity platform which can be operated also under increased noise levels in a closed-cycle cryostat. It comprises custom-designed monolithic micro- and nanopositioning elements with up to mm-scale travel range that achieve a passive cavity length stability at low temperature of only 15 pm rms in a closed-cycle cryostat, and 5 pm in a more quiet flow cryostat. This can be further improved by active stabilization, and even higher stability is obtained under direct mechanical contact between the cavity mirrors, yielding 0:8 pm rms during the quiet phase of the closed-cycle cryo cooler. The platform provides operation of cryogenic cavities with high finesse and small mode volume for strong enhancement of light-matter interactions, opening up novel possibilities for experiments with a great variety of quantum and nano materials.

TI Modeling of Josephson Traveling Wave Parametric Amplifiers
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON APPLIED SUPERCONDUCTIVITY
AB The recent developments in quantum technologies, as well as advanced detection experiments, have raised the need to detect extremely weak signals in the microwave frequency spectrum. To this aim, the Josephson travelling wave parametric amplifier, a device capable of reaching the quantum noise limit while providing a wide bandwidth, has been proposed as a suitable cryogenic front-end amplifier. This work deals with the numerical study of a Josephson travelling wave parametric amplifier, without approximations regarding the nonlinearity of the key elements. In particular, we focus on the investigation of the system of coupled nonlinear differential equations representing all the cells of the Josephson travelling wave parametric amplifier, with proper input and output signals at the boundaries. The investigation of the output signals generated by the parametric amplification process explores the phase-space and the Fourier spectral analysis of the output voltage, as a function of the parameters describing the pump and signal tones that excite the device. Beside the expected behavior, i.e., the signal amplification, we show that, depending on the system operation, unwanted effects (such as pump tone harmonics, incommensurate frequency generation, and noise rise), which are not accounted for in simple linearized approaches, can be generated in the whole nonlinear system.

TI Trip Planning Based on subQUBO Annealing
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB The trip planning problem (TPP) can be formulated as a combinatorial optimization problem that searches for the best route to visit a series of landmarks and hotels. Meanwhile, Ising machines have attracted attention due to their efficiency in solving combinatorial optimization problems. The Ising machines solve the combinatorial optimization problems by transforming the problems into quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) models. However, the possible input QUBO size of current Ising machines is quite limited. Thus, it is hard to directly embed a large-scale TPP onto the current Ising machines. In this paper, we propose a novel subQUBO annealing method based on the combined variable selection method to solve the TPP. The proposed method finds a quasi-optimal solution to a large problem by repeatedly partitioning the original QUBO model into small subQUBOs that can be embedded onto the Ising machine. Specifically, to construct a subQUBO, we select variables from the original QUBO model, which have small deviation values. Further, we select variables randomly from the original QUBO model, so as not to fall into the local optimum. We have conducted an evaluation experiment using Ising machines on TPP and confirmed that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in terms of POI satisfaction and POI cost.

TI Variational quantum eigensolver for the Heisenberg antiferromagnet on
   the kagome lattice
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB Establishing the nature of the ground state of the Heisenberg antiferromagnet (HAFM) on the kagome lattice is well-known to be a prohibitively difficult problem for classical computers. Here, we give a detailed proposal for a variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) intending to solve this physical problem on a quantum computer. At the same time, this VQE constitutes an explicit experimental proposal for showing a useful quantum advantage on noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices because of its natural hardware compatibility. We classically emulate noiseless and noisy quantum computers with either 2D-grid or all-to-all connectivity and simulate patches of the kagome HAFM of up to 20 sites. In the noiseless case, the ground-state energy, as found by the VQE, approaches the true ground-state energy exponentially as a function of the circuit depth. Furthermore, VQEs for the HAFM on any graph can inherently perform their quantum computations in a decoherence-free subspace that protects against collective longitudinal and collective transversal noise, adding to the noise resilience of these algorithms. Nevertheless, the extent of the effects of other noise types suggests the need for error mitigation and performance targets alternative to high-fidelity ground-state preparation, even for essentially hardware-native VQEs.

TI Versatile High-Sensitivity EPR Using Superconducting Spiral
   Microresonators
SO SMALL METHODS
AB Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy is a broadly used technique to study paramagnetic centers in diverse fields ranging from biology to quantum technologies. The availability of well-established commercial instrumentation, including features such as rapid sample exchange, has been a key enabler for EPR to be applied widely across disciplines. Here, a three-order-of-magnitude increase is presented in the spin number sensitivity of the commonly used X-band pulsed EPR while retaining full compatibility with conventional instrumentation and typical sample conditions. This approach employs planar spiral-shaped microresonators with 7 nL mode volumes fabricated from yttrium barium copper oxide (YBCO) high-temperature superconductor. A wide range of microwave coupling is achieved by a single microresonator inside a conventional EPR tube, loaded into an EPR cavity. The performance of the spiral microresonators is demonstrated through a suite of pulsed EPR experiments on standard samples, including dipolar and hyperfine spectroscopies. By placing a sample within a microfluidic microstructure fabricated to match the mode profile of the microresonator, a high-fidelity spin control is obtained with a spin-number sensitivity of 107 spins/G/. The approach significantly advances the applicability of superconducting microresonators as versatile and readily applicable tools for high sensitivity EPR.

TI Temperature-dependent zero-field splittings in graphene
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB Graphene is a quantum spin Hall insulator with a 45 mu eV-wide nontrivial topological gap induced by the intrinsic spin-orbit coupling. Even though this zero-field spin splitting is weak, it makes graphene an attractive candidate for applications in quantum technologies, given the resulting long spin-relaxation time. On the other side, the staggered sublattice potential, resulting from the coupling of graphene with its boron nitride substrate, compensates intrinsic spin-orbit coupling and decreases the nontrivial topological gap, which may lead to the phase transition into trivial band insulator state. In this work, we present extensive experimental studies of the zero-field splittings in monolayer and bilayer graphene in a temperature range 2-12 K by means of subterahertz photoconductivity-based electron spin-resonance technique. Surprisingly, we observe a decrease of the spin splittings with increasing temperature. We discuss the origin of this phenomenon by considering possible physical mechanisms likely to induce a temperature dependence of the spin-orbit coupling. These include the difference in the expansion coefficients between the graphene and the boron nitride substrate or the metal contacts, the electron-phonon interactions, and the presence of a magnetic order at low temperature. Our experimental observation expands knowledge about the nontrivial topological gap in graphene.

TI 3D nanoprinted fiber-interfaced hollow-core waveguides for high-accuracy
   nanoparticle tracking analysis
SO LIGHT-SCIENCE & APPLICATIONS
AB The integration of functional components into flexible photonic environments is a critical area of research in integrated photonics and is essential for high-precision sensing. This work presents a novel concept of interfacing square-core hollow-core waveguides with commercially available optical fibers using 3D nanoprinting, and demonstrates its practical relevance through a nanoscience-based characterization technique. In detail, this innovative concept results in a monolithic, fully fiber-integrated device with key advantages such as alignment-free operation, high-purity fundamental mode excitation, full polarization control, and a unique handling flexibility. For the first time, the application potential of a fiber-interfaced waveguide in nanoscale analysis is demonstrated by performing nanoparticle-tracking-analysis experiments. These experiments involve the tracking and analysis of individual gold nanospheres diffusing in the hollow core waveguide, enabled by nearly aberration-free imaging, extended observation times, and homogeneous light-line illumination. The study comprehensively covers design strategy, experimental implementation, key principles, optical characterization, and practical applications. The fiber-interfaced hollow-core waveguide concept offers significant potential for applications in bioanalytics, environmental sciences, quantum technologies, optical manipulation, and life sciences. It also paves the way for the development of novel all-fiber devices that exploit enhanced light-matter interaction in a monolithic form suitable for flexible and remote applications.

TI Orbital-symmetry effects on magnetic exchange in open-shell
   nanographenes
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Nanographenes, as their name suggests, are small sections of graphene. They offer a diverse array of magnetic behaviors; for example, sublattice imbalances in the nanographene lead to unpaired spins. Here, Du et al uncover a large variation in the exchange energy in nanographenes, due to changes in the frontier orbital symmetries.
   Open-shell nanographenes appear as promising candidates for future applications in spintronics and quantum technologies. A critical aspect to realize this potential is to design and control the magnetic exchange. Here, we reveal the effects of frontier orbital symmetries on the magnetic coupling in diradical nanographenes through scanning probe microscope measurements and different levels of theoretical calculations. In these open-shell nanographenes, the exchange energy exhibits a remarkable variation between 20 and 160 meV. Theoretical calculations reveal that frontier orbital symmetries play a key role in affecting the magnetic coupling on such a large scale. Moreover, a triradical nanographene is demonstrated for investigating the magnetic interaction among three unpaired electrons with unequal magnetic exchange, in agreement with Heisenberg spin model calculations. Our results provide insights into both theoretical design and experimental realization of nanographene materials with different exchange interactions through tuning the orbital symmetry, potentially useful for realizing magnetically operable graphene-based nanomaterials.

TI How to Read Out the Phonon Number Statistics via Resonance Fluorescence
   Spectroscopy of a Single-Photon Emitter
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB In today's development of quantum technologies a hybrid integration of phononic excitations becomes increasingly attractive. As natural quasi-particle excitations in solid state systems, phonons couple to virtually any other excitation and therefore constitute a useful interaction channel between different building blocks in hybrid quantum systems. This work explores how the efficient light-scattering properties of a single-photon emitter and the appearance of characteristic sidebands in resonance fluorescence spectra, when interfaced with an arbitrary phonon quantum state, can be utilized for acousto-optical transduction. Within reasonable approximations, an analytical description for the optical spectra in the low excitation limit is developed which can be used to read the number statistics of the initial phonon state from a given spectrum. It is shown that the readout is faulty in situations where relevant resonant transitions are forbidden due to vanishing Franck-Condon factors, especially when considering spectra with a noisy background. Two possible solutions to this problem are presented: (A) changing the detuning of the laser relative to the single-photon emitter which modifies the relevant resonant transitions, or (B) increasing dissipation of the single-photon emitter to promote off-resonant transitions.

TI Topological states in finite graphene nanoribbons tuned by electric
   fields
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS-CONDENSED MATTER
AB In this comprehensive study, we conduct a theoretical investigation into the Stark shift of topological states (TSs) in finite armchair graphene nanoribbons (AGNRs) and heterostructures under transverse electric fields. Our focus centers on the multiple end zigzag edge states of AGNRs and the interface states of 9--7--9 AGNR heterostructures. For the formal TSs, we observe a distinctive blue Stark shift in energy levels relative to the electric field within a range where the energy levels of TSs do not merge into the energy levels of bulk states. Conversely, for the latter TSs, we identify an oscillatory Stark shift in energy levels around the Fermi level. Simultaneously, we reveal the impact of the Stark effect on the transmission coefficients for both types of TSs. Notably, we uncover intriguing spectra in the multiple end zigzag edge states. In the case of finite 9--7--9 AGNR heterostructures, the spectra of transmission coefficient reveal that the coupling strength between the topological interface states can be well controlled by the transverse electric fields. The outcomes of this research not only contribute to a deeper understanding of the electronic property in graphene-based materials but also pave the way for innovations in next-generation electronic devices and quantum technologies.

TI Coordinative Self-assembly of π-Electron Magnetic Porphyrins
SO ANGEWANDTE CHEMIE-INTERNATIONAL EDITION
AB pi-Electron magnetic compounds on surfaces have emerged as a powerful platform to interrogate spin interactions at the atomic scale, with great potential in spintronics and quantum technologies. A key challenge is organizing these compounds over large length scales, while elucidating their resulting magnetic properties. Herein, we offer a relevant contribution toward this objective, which consists of using on-surface synthesis coupled with coordination chemistry to promote the self-assembly of pi-electron magnetic porphyrin species. A porphyrin precursor equipped with carbonitrile moieties in a trans arrangement was prepared by solution synthesis and deposited on Au(111)/mica. Depending on the specific growth protocol, surface-promoted reactions led to the transformation of the precursor into non-magnetic Au-CN coordinated porphyrin monomers, covalent porphyrin dimers, and one-dimensional porphyrin polymers (based on porphyrin monomers or covalent porphyrin dimers), as revealed by scanning probe microscopy studies combined with theoretical calculations. Interestingly, the scanning tunneling microscopy tip could convert such closed-shell porphyrin units into open-shell species by the removal of some peripheral hydrogen atoms. The magnetic features (i.e., singlet or triplet ground state) of the porphyrin units comprising the polymers were investigated for polymers of different lengths. No magnetic exchange coupling between adjacent units was observed, suggesting protection of the magnetic entities.

TI Microfluidics-guided fluorescent nanodiamond assembly method for highly
   sensitive thermometry
SO SENSORS AND ACTUATORS A-PHYSICAL
AB Fluorescent nanodiamonds (FNDs) with nitrogen vacancy centers (NVCs) show promise for use as thermometers owing to their unique physicochemical and optical properties. FND-based thermometry has been steadily developing and is now transitioning into the practical application phase. Various approaches have been proposed for FND assembly, which is a key process for temperature mapping applications. However, the assembly of highsensitivity FND thermometers remains challenging because it requires the fabrication of three-dimensionally aggregated FNDs across the target area to generate a strong fluorescence signal. To overcome this drawback, we aimed to enable the microfluidics-guided assembly of FNDs to enhance the sensitivity of FND-based thermometry. Specifically, a microfluidic template with through-holes was used to fabricate vertically aggregated FNDs (FND clusters) on a substrate, thereby improving the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) by superimposing the individual fluorescence events of the FNDs. The FND clusters were arrayed over a millimeter-scale area, and sensitivity improvements were achieved through vertical aggregation. Furthermore, the fluorescence spectra of the FND clusters were investigated to test the increase in temperature-mapping accuracy. Our microfluidicsguided assembly method has potential as a practical approach for creating an array of high-sensitivity FND thermometers on scalable substrates, broadening their use in various fields such as chemistry, electronics, and biology.

TI Bi-Frequency Illumination: A Quantum-Enhanced Protocol
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB Quantum-enhanced, idler-free sensing protocol to measure the response of a target object to the frequency of a probe in a noisy and lossy scenario is proposed. In this protocol, a target with frequency-dependent reflectivity eta(omega)$\eta (\omega )$ embedded in a thermal bath is considered. The aim is to estimate the parameter lambda=eta(omega 2)-eta(omega 1)$\lambda = \eta (\omega _2)-\eta (\omega _1)$, since it contains relevant information for different problems. For this, a bi-frequency quantum state is employed as the resource, since it is necessary to capture the relevant information about the parameter. Computing the quantum Fisher information H relative to the parameter lambda in an assumed neighborhood of lambda approximate to 0$\lambda \approx \ 0$ for a two-mode squeezed state (HQ$H_\text{Q}$), and a pair of coherent states (HC$H_\text{C}$), a quantum enhancement is shown in the estimation of lambda. This quantum enhancement grows with the mean reflectivity of the probed object, and is noise-resilient. Explicit formulas are derived for the optimal observables, and an experimental scheme based on elementary quantum optical transformations is proposed. Furthermore, this work opens the way to applications in both radar and medical imaging, in particular in the microwave domain.

TI A mechanism of compass-free migratory navigation
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS D-APPLIED PHYSICS
AB How migratory birds can find the right way when navigating over thousands of miles is an intriguing question that has greatly interested researchers in both the fields of biology and physics for centuries. There are several putative proposals that sound intuitively plausible; all remain contested so far because these hypothetical models of magnetoreceptors that sense the geomagnetic field need either extremely high sensitivity or humankind-like intelligence to guide. Here we explore theoretically whether birds can navigate to their destination through an entirely new scenario to sense the geomagnetic field. Our proposal is based on separate peaks of the resonance-fluorescence spectrum of a four-level system derived from the ferric sulfide cluster that exists in a MagR/Cry protein complex (Drosophila CG8198) of migratory birds. As the separation of spectral peaks contains information about the geomagnetic field at both the current location and the birthland, the change of such separation cues the bird to choose the right direction to move, and double-resonance emerges once it has arrived at its destination. Our theoretical mechanism can explain previous experiments on the disorientation of migratorybirds caused by oscillating magnetic field naturally and more precisely. This work provides insight into explaining migratory navigation and motivates possible humanmade practical devices.

TI Observation of Exceptional Points in Thermal Atomic Ensembles
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Exceptional points (EPs) in non-Hermitian systems have recently attracted wide interest and spawned intriguing prospects for enhanced sensing. However, EPs have not yet been realized in thermal atomic ensembles, which is one of the most important platforms for quantum sensing. Here we experimentally observe EPs in multilevel thermal atomic ensembles and realize enhanced sensing of the magnetic field for 1 order of magnitude. We take advantage of the rich energy levels of atoms and construct effective decays for selected energy levels by employing laser coupling with the excited state, yielding unbalanced decay rates for different energy levels, which finally results in the existence of EPs. Furthermore, we propose the optical polarization rotation measurement scheme to detect the splitting of the resonance peaks, which makes use of both the absorption and dispersion properties and shows an advantage with enhanced splitting compared with the conventional transmission measurement scheme. Additionally, in our system both the effective coupling strength and decay rates are flexibly adjustable, and thus the position of the EPs are tunable, which expands the measurement range. Our Letter not only provides a new controllable platform for studying EPs and non-Hermitian physics, but also provide new ideas for the design of EP-enhanced sensors and opens up realistic opportunities for practical applications in the high-precision sensing of magnetic field and other physical quantities.

TI Temperature sensing with nitrogen vacancy center in diamond
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB Temperature is the most intuitive and widespread in various physical quantities. Violent changes in temperature usually implies the appearing of fluctuations in physical properties of an object. Therefore, temperature is often an important indicator. With the development of science and technology, the scales in many fields are being more and more miniaturized. However, there are no mature temperature measurement systems in the case where the spatial scale is less than 10 mu m. In addition to the requirement for spatialresolution, the sensor ought to exert no dramatic influence on the object to be measured. The nitrogen vacancy(NV) center in diamond is a stable luminescence defect. The measurements of its spectrum and spin state canbe used to obtain the information about physical quantities near the color center, such as temperature and electro-magnetic field. Owing to its stable chemical properties and high thermal conductivity, the NV center can be applied to the noninvasive detection for nano-scale researches. It can also be used in the life field because it is non-toxic to cells. Moreover, combined with different techniques, such as optical fiber, scanning thermal microscopy, NV center can be used to measure the local temperatures in different scenarios. This review focuses on the temperature properties, the method of measuring temperature, and relevant applications of NV centers

TI Range Limitations in Microwave Quantum Radar
SO REMOTE SENSING
AB This work, written for engineers or managers with no special knowledge of quantum mechanics, nor deep experience in radar, aims to help the scientific, industrial, and governmental community to better understand the basic limitations of proposed microwave quantum radar (QR) technologies and systems. Detection and ranging capabilities for QR are critically discussed and a comparison with its closest classical radar (CR), i.e., the noise radar (NR), is presented. In particular, it is investigated whether a future fielded and operating QR system might really outperform an "equivalent" classical radar, or not. The main result of this work, coherently with the recent literature, is that the maximum range of a QR for typical aircraft targets is intrinsically limited to less than one km, and in most cases to some tens of meters. Detailed computations show that the detection performance of all the proposed QR types are orders of magnitude below the ones of any much simpler and cheaper equivalent "classical" radar set, in particular of the noise radar type. These limitations do not apply to very-short-range microwave applications, such as microwave tomography and radar monitoring of heart and breathing activity of people (where other figures, such as cost, size, weight, and power, shall be taken into account). Moreover, quantum sensing at much higher frequencies (optical and beyond) is not considered here.

AB Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) play a major role in various applications, but the main challenge is to maintain security and balanced energy efficiency. Classical routing protocols struggle to achieve both energy efficiency and security because they are more vulnerable to security risks and resource limitations. This paper introduces QSEER, a novel approach that uses quantum technologies to overcome these limitations. QSEER employs quantum-inspired optimization algorithms that leverage superposition and entanglement principles to efficiently explore multiple routing possibilities, thereby identifying energy-efficient paths and reducing redundant transmissions. The proposed protocol enhances the security of data transmission against eavesdropping and tampering by using the principles of quantum mechanics, thus mitigating potential security vulnerabilities. Through extensive simulations, we demonstrated the effectiveness of QSEER in achieving both security and energy efficiency objectives, which achieves 15.1% lower energy consumption compared to state-of-the-art protocols while maintaining 99.8% data integrity under various attack scenarios, extending network lifetime by an average of 42%. These results position QSEER as a significant advancement for next-generation WSN deployments in critical applications such as environmental monitoring, smart infrastructure, and healthcare systems.

TI Tunable Hyperbolic Landau-Level Polaritons in Charge-Neutral Graphene
   Nanoribbon Metasurfaces
SO ACS PHOTONICS
AB Magnetized charge-neutral graphene supports collective hybrid electronic excitations-polaritons-which have a quantum origin. In contrast to polaritons in doped graphene, which arise from intraband electronic transitions, those in charge-neutral graphene originate from interband transitions between Landau levels, enabled by the applied magnetic field. Control of such quantum polaritons and shaping their wavefronts remains totally unexplored. Here, we design an artificial two-dimensional quantum material formed by charge-neutral graphene nanoribbons exposed to an external magnetic field. In such a metasurface, quantum polaritons acquire a hyperbolic dispersion. We find that the topology of the isofrequency curves of quantum hyperbolic magnetoexciton polaritons excited in this quantum material can change, so that the shape of the isofrequency curves transforms from a closed to an open one by tuning the external magnetic field strength. At the topological transition, we observe canalization phenomena, consisting of the propagation of all of the polaritonic plane waves in the continuum along the same direction when excited by a point source. From a general perspective, our fundamental findings introduce a novel type of actively tunable quantum polaritons with hyperbolic dispersion and can be further generalized to other types of quantum materials and polaritons in them. In practice, quantum hyperbolic polaritons can be used for applications related to quantum sensing and computing.

TI Frequency-domain multiplexing of SNSPDs with tunable superconducting
   resonators
SO APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS
AB This work culminates in a demonstration of an alternative frequency-domain multiplexing (FDM) scheme for superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors (SNSPDs) using the kinetic inductance parametric up-converter (KPUP) made out of NbTiN. There are multiple multiplexing architectures for SNSPDs that are already in use, but FDM could prove superior in applications where the operational bias currents are very low, especially for mid-infrared and far-infrared SNSPDs. Previous FDM schemes integrated the SNSPD within the resonator, while, in this work, we use an external resonator, which gives more flexibility to optimize the SNSPD architecture. The KPUP is a DC-biased superconducting lambda/2 resonator that is sensitive to current perturbations. When coupled to an SNSPD, the KPUP can be used to read out current pulses on a few mu A scale. The KPUP is made out of NbTiN, which has a large kinetic inductance and a high operating temperature. Meanwhile, the SNSPD is made from WSi, which is a popular material for broadband SNSPDs. A software-defined radio platform and a graphics processing unit are used to read out the KPUP and SNSPD array. Frequency-domain multiplexed SNSPDs have applications in astronomy, remote sensing, exoplanet science, dark matter detection, and quantum sensing. (c) 2024 Author(s).

TI Sensors in Civil Engineering: From Existing Gaps to Quantum
   Opportunities
SO SMART CITIES
AB The vital role of civil engineering is to enable the development of modern cities and establish foundations for smart and sustainable urban environments of the future. Advanced sensing technologies are among the instrumental methods used to enhance the performance of civil engineering infrastructures and address the multifaceted challenges of future cities. Through this study, we discussed the shortcomings of traditional sensors in four primary civil engineering domains: construction, energy, water, and transportation. Then, we investigated and summarized the potential of quantum sensors to contribute to and revolutionize the management of civil engineering infrastructures. For the water sector, advancements are expected in monitoring water quality and pressure in water and sewage infrastructures. In the energy sector, quantum sensors may facilitate renewables integration and improve grid stability and buildings' energy efficiency. The most promising progress in the construction field is the ability to identify subsurface density and underground structures. In transportation, these sensors create many fresh avenues for real-time traffic management and smart mobility solutions. As one of the first-in-the-field studies offering the adoption of quantum sensors across four primary domains of civil engineering, this research establishes the basis for the discourse about the scope and timeline for deploying quantum sensors to real-world applications towards the quantum transformation of civil engineering.

TI Bernhard Riemann, the Ear, and an Atom of Consciousness
SO FOUNDATIONS OF SCIENCE
AB Why did Bernhard Riemann (1826-1866), arguably the most original mathematician of his generation, spend the last year of life investigating the mechanism of hearing? Fighting tuberculosis and the hostility of eminent scientists such as Hermann Helmholtz, he appeared to forsake mathematics to prosecute a case close to his heart. Only sketchy pages from his last paper remain, but here we assemble some significant clues and triangulate from them to build a broad picture of what he might have been driving at. Our interpretation is that Riemann was a committed idealist and from this philosophical standpoint saw that the scientific enterprise was lame without the "poetry of hypothesis". He believed that human thought was fundamentally the dynamics of "mind-masses" and that the human mind interpenetrated, and became part of, the microscopic physical domain of the cochlea. Therefore, a full description of hearing must necessarily include the perceptual dimensions of what he saw as a single manifold. The manifold contains all the psychophysical aspects of hearing, including the logarithmic transformations that arise from Fechner's law, faithfully preserving all the subtle perceptual qualities of sound. For Riemann, hearing was a unitary physical and mental event, and parallels with modern ideas about consciousness and quantum biology are made. A unifying quantum mechanical model for an atom of consciousness-drawing on Riemann's mind-masses and the similar "psychons" proposed by Eccles-is put forward.

TI 2D electron gas formation on InAs wurtzite nanosheet surfaces
SO APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS
AB The two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) that forms on a semiconductor surface can be used to explore a variety of phenomena in quantum physics and plays an important role in nanoscale electronics, such as transistors. Controlling its formation is, thus, relevant. Using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) and accumulating the signal over many nanocrystals, we find that on clean InAs nanosheets with non-polar surfaces and wurtzite (WZ) crystal structures, a 2DEG can be observed at the Gamma-point. We suggest that the step morphology on the WZ InAs specimens facilitates the appearance of the electron gas, since previous studies on InAs nanowire surfaces with the same crystal facet and a similar defect density did not exhibit a 2DEG. Subsequently, bismuth deposition leads to the disappearance of the 2DEG as well as a shift of the valence band. This is in contrast to previous observations on InAs surfaces, in which metal deposition would lead to the formation of a 2DEG. The control of the 2DEG with the addition of Bi atoms is relevant for applications of InAs nanosheets in quantum technologies. This study also illustrates that ARPES accumulated over several 2D materials oriented randomly around their normal axis can provide valuable information on their band structure with a fast turnover and low irradiation.

TI Directional imbalance of Bloch surface waves for ultrasensitive
   displacement metrology
SO NANOSCALE
AB Precise position sensing and nanoscale optical rulers are important in many applications in nanometrology, gravitational wave detection and quantum technologies. Several implementations of such nanoscale displacement sensors have been recently developed based on interferometers, nanoantennas, optical field singularities and optical skyrmions. Here, we propose a method for ultrasensitive displacement measurements based on the directional imbalance of the excitation of Bloch surface waves by an asymmetric double slit, which have low propagation loss and provide high detected intensity. The directionality of excitation changes dramatically with a sub-nanometric displacement of the illuminating Gaussian beam across the slit and can be used for displacement and refractive index metrology. We demonstrate a theoretical intensity ratio of the BSW excitation in opposite directions exceeding 890, which provides a displacement sensitivity of up to 2.888 nm(-1) with a resolution below 0.5 nm over a 100 nm linearity range. Experimentally, a directional intensity ratio more than 90 has been achieved, with a displacement sensitivity of 0.122 nm(-1) over a 300 nm linearity range, resulting in a resolution below 8 nm for a 600 nm illumination wavelength. The proposed facile configuration may have potential applications in nanometrology and super-resolution microscopy.

TI Optical control of ultrafast photocurrent in graphene
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB The ability to manipulate electrons with the intense laser pulse enables an unprecedented control over the electronic motion on its intrinsic timescale. Present work explores the desired control of photocurrent generation in monolayer graphene on ultrafast timescale. The origin of photocurrent is attributed to the asymmetric residual electronic population in the conduction band after the end of the laser pulse, which also facilitates valley polarization. Present study offers a comprehensive analysis of the differences between these two observables, namely photocurrent and valley polarization. It is found that the corotating circularly polarized w-2w laser pulses allow the generation of photocurrent but no valley polarization, whereas counterrotating circularly polarized w-2w laser pulses yield significant valley polarization without any photocurrent in graphene. Different laser parameters, such as subcycle phase, wavelength, and intensity provide different knobs to control the generation of the photocurrent. In addition, threefold increase in the photocurrent's amplitude can be achieved by altering electronic properties of graphene via strain engineering. Our findings reveal intriguing underlying mechanisms into the interplay between the symmetries of the graphene's electronic structure and the driving laser pulses, shedding light on the potential for harnessing graphene's properties for novel applications in ultrafast photonics, optoelectronic devices, and quantum technologies.

TI A review of gallium phosphide nanophotonics towards omnipotent nonlinear
   devices
SO NANOPHOTONICS
AB Gallium phosphide (GaP) has been increasingly prioritized, fueled by the enormous demands in visible light applications such as biomedical and quantum technologies. GaP has garnered tremendous attention in nanophotonics thanks to its high refractive index, indirect bandgap width of 2.26 eV, lattice perfectly matched with silicon, and omnipotent and competitive nonlinear optical properties. Herein, we review the progress and application of GaP in nanoscale devices over the past two decades. The material properties of bulk GaP are first listed, followed by a summary of the methodologies for fabricating nanoscale devices and related integration techniques. Then, we digest the operational mechanisms across different GaP-based devices on their optical linear responses. Following this, we categorize the GaP nonlinear optical effects into multiple aspects including second-harmonic generation, four-wave mixing, Kerr optical frequency combs, etc. Ultimately, we present a perspective on GaP nanophotonics in the context of coexisting and competing modes of various nonlinear effects. We believe that a comprehensive overview of unique GaP will propel these nanophotonic devices toward a mature state, underpinning foundational understanding and leveraging practical innovations.

TI High-Speed Electro-Optic Modulators Based on Thin-Film Lithium Niobate
SO NANOMATERIALS
AB Electro-optic modulators (EOMs) are pivotal in bridging electrical and optical domains, essential for diverse applications including optical communication, microwave signal processing, sensing, and quantum technologies. However, achieving the trifecta of high-density integration, cost-effectiveness, and superior performance remains challenging within established integrated photonics platforms. Enter thin-film lithium niobate (LN), a recent standout with its inherent electro-optic (EO) efficiency, proven industrial performance, durability, and rapid fabrication advancements. This platform inherits material advantages from traditional bulk LN devices while offering a reduced footprint, wider bandwidths, and lower power requirements. Despite its recent introduction, commercial thin-film LN wafers already rival or surpass established alternatives like silicon and indium phosphide, benefitting from decades of research. In this review, we delve into the foundational principles and technical innovations driving state-of-the-art LN modulator demonstrations, exploring various methodologies, their strengths, and challenges. Furthermore, we outline pathways for further enhancing LN modulators and anticipate exciting prospects for larger-scale LN EO circuits beyond singular components. By elucidating the current landscape and future directions, we highlight the transformative potential of thin-film LN technology in advancing electro-optic modulation and integrated photonics.

TI Toward Edge Engineering of Two-Dimensional Layered Transition-Metal
   Dichalcogenides by Chemical Vapor Deposition
SO ACS NANO
AB The manipulation of edge configurations and structures in atomically-thin transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) for versatile functionalization has attracted intensive interest in recent years. The chemical vapor deposition (CVD) approach has shown promise for TMD edge engineering of atomic edge configurations (1H, 1T or 1T'-zigzag or armchair edges) as well as diverse edge morphologies (1D nanoribbons, 2D dendrites, 3D spirals, etc.). These edge-rich TMD layers offer versatile candidates for probing the physical and chemical properties and exploring potential applications in electronics, optoelectronics, catalysis, sensing, and quantum technologies. In this Review, we present an overview of the current state-of-the-art in the manipulation of TMD atomic edges and edge-rich structures using CVD. We highlight the vast range of distinct properties associated with these edge configurations and structures and provide insights into the opportunities afforded by such edge-functionalized crystals. The objective of this Review is to motivate further research and development efforts to use CVD as a scalable approach to harness the benefits of such crystal-edge engineering.

TI Quantum coherent spin-electric control in a molecular nanomagnet at
   clock transitions
SO NATURE PHYSICS
AB Electrical control of spins at the nanoscale offers significant architectural advantages in spintronics, because electric fields can be confined over shorter length scales than magnetic fields(1-5). Thus, recent demonstrations of electric-field sensitivities in molecular spin materials(6-8) are tantalizing, raising the viability of the quantum analogues of macroscopic magneto-electric devices(9-15). However, the electric-field sensitivities reported so far are rather weak, prompting the question of how to design molecules with stronger spin-electric couplings. Here we show that one path is to identify an energy scale in the spin spectrum that is associated with a structural degree of freedom with a substantial electrical polarizability. We study an example of a molecular nanomagnet in which a small structural distortion establishes clock transitions (that is, transitions whose energy is to first order independent of the magnetic field) in the spin spectrum; the fact that this distortion is associated with an electric dipole allows us to control the clock-transition energy to an unprecedented degree. We demonstrate coherent electrical control of the quantum spin state and exploit it to independently manipulate the two magnetically identical but inversion-related molecules in the unit cell of the crystal. Our findings pave the way for the use of molecular spins in quantum technologies and spintronics.

TI Optimization of quantum light sources and four-wave mixing based on a
   reconfigurable silicon ring resonator
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Being a key component on a photonic chip, the microring usually specializes in a certain nonlinear optical process and can not simultaneously meet different working conditions for different processes. Here, we theoretically and experimentally investigate a reconfigurable silicon microring resonator to act as a optimization strategy for both classical tour-wave mixing and quantum light sources. Experimental results show that the four-wave mixing efficiency with continuous wave and pulsed pump can be both optimized to a high value well matching numerical analysis. A variety of quantum light sources - including the heralded single-photon source, two-photon source and multi-photon source - are demonstrated to present a high performance and their key parameters including the pair generation rates (PGR), the heralding efficiency (HE) and the coincidence-to-accidental ratio (CAR) are controllable and optimizable. Such tunable nonlinear converter is immune to fabrication variations and can be popularized to other nonlinear optical materials, providing a simple and compact post-fabrication trimming strategy for on-chip all-optical signal processing and photonic quantum technologies.

TI Magnetic nanoribbons with embedded cobalt grown inside single-walled
   carbon nanotubes
SO NANOSCALE
AB Molecular magnetism and specifically magnetic molecules have recently gained plenty of attention as key elements for quantum technologies, information processing, and spintronics. Transition to the nanoscale and implementation of ordered structures with defined parameters is crucial for advanced applications. Single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) provide natural one-dimensional confinement that can be implemented for encapsulation, nanosynthesis, and polymerization of molecules into nanoribbons. Recently, the formation of atomically precise graphene nanoribbons inside SWCNTs has been reported. However, there have been only a limited amount of approaches to form ordered magnetic structures inside the nanotube channels and the creation of magnetic nanoribbons is still lacking. In this work we synthesize and reveal the properties of cobalt-phthalocyanine based nanoribbons (CoPcNRs) encapsulated in SWCNTs. Raman spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy, absorption spectroscopy, and density functional theory calculations allowed us to confirm the encapsulation and to reveal the specific fingerprints of CoPcNRs. The magnetic properties were studied by transverse magnetooptical Kerr effect measurements, which indicated a strong difference in comparison with the pristine unfilled SWCNTs due to the impact of Co incorporated atoms. We anticipate that this approach of polymerization of encapsulated magnetic molecules inside SWCNTs will result in a diverse class of protected low-dimensional ordered magnetic materials for various applications.

TI Local Strain Engineering of Two-Dimensional Transition Metal
   Dichalcogenides Towards Quantum Emitters
SO NANO-MICRO LETTERS
AB Two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides (2D TMDCs) have received considerable attention in local strain engineering due to their extraordinary mechanical flexibility, electonic structure, and optical properties. The strain-induced out-of-plane deformations in 2D TMDCs lead to diverse excitonic behaviors and versatile modulations in optical properties, paving the way for the development of advanced quantum technologies, flexible optoelectronic materials, and straintronic devices. Research on local strain engineering on 2D TMDCs has been delved into fabrication techniques, electronic state variations, and quantum optical applications. This review begins by summarizing the state-of-the-art methods for introducing local strain into 2D TMDCs, followed by an exploration of the impact of local strain engineering on optical properties. The intriguing phenomena resulting from local strain, such as exciton funnelling and anti-funnelling, are also discussed. We then shift the focus to the application of locally strained 2D TMDCs as quantum emitters, with various strategies outlined for modulating the properties of TMDC-based quantum emitters. Finally, we discuss the remaining questions in this field and provide an outlook on the future of local strain engineering on 2D TMDCs.

TI Identification of Defects and the Origins of Surface Noise on
   Hydrogen-Terminated (100) Diamond
SO ADVANCED MATERIALS INTERFACES
AB Near-surface nitrogen vacancy centres are critical to many diamond-based quantum technologies such as information processors and nanosensors. Surface defects play an important role in the design and performance of these devices. The targeted creation of defects is central to proposed bottom-up approaches to nanofabrication of quantum diamond processors, and uncontrolled surface defects may generate noise and charge trapping which degrade shallow NV device performance. Surface preparation protocols may be able to control the production of desired defects and eliminate unwanted defects, but only if their atomic structure can first be conclusively identified. This work uses a combination of scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM) imaging and first-principles simulations to identify several surface defects on H:C(100)-2 x 1 surfaces prepared using chemical vapour deposition (CVD). The atomic structure of these defects is elucidated, from which the microscopic origins of magnetic noise and charge trapping are determined based on the modeling of their paramagnetic properties and acceptor states. Rudimentary control of these deleterious properties is demonstrated through STM tip-induced manipulation of the defect structure. Furthermore, the results validate accepted models for CVD diamond growth by identifying key adsorbates responsible for the nucleation of new layers.

TI Mechanical Control of Quantum Transport in Graphene
SO ADVANCED MATERIALS
AB 2D materials (2DMs) are fundamentally electro-mechanical systems. Their environment unavoidably strains them and modifies their quantum transport properties. For instance, a simple uniaxial strain can completely turn off the conductance of ballistic graphene or switch on/off the superconducting phase of magic-angle bilayer graphene. This article reports measurements of quantum transport in strained graphene transistors which agree quantitatively with models based on mechanically-induced gauge potentials. A scalar potential is mechanically induced in situ to modify graphene's work function by up to 25 meV. Mechanically generated vector potentials suppress the ballistic conductance of graphene by up to 30% and control its quantum interferences. The data are measured with a custom experimental platform able to precisely tune both the mechanics and electrostatics of suspended graphene transistors at low-temperature over a broad range of strain (up to 2.6%). This work opens many opportunities to harness quantitative strain effects in 2DM quantum transport and technologies.

TI Observation of strong backscattering in valley-Hall photonic topological
   interface modes
SO NATURE PHOTONICS
AB This work investigates the real-world value of topological protection in reciprocal photonics. Measurements of propagation losses in the slow-light regime of valley-Hall topological waveguides yield no indications of topological protection against backscattering on structural defects.
   The unique properties of light underpin the visions of photonic quantum technologies, optical interconnects and a wide range of novel sensors, but a key limiting factor today is losses due to either absorption or backscattering on defects. Recent developments in topological photonics have fostered the vision of backscattering-protected waveguides made from topological interface modes, but, surprisingly, measurements of their propagation losses were so far missing. Here we report on measurements of losses in the slow-light regime of valley-Hall topological waveguides and find no indications of topological protection against backscattering on ubiquitous structural defects. We image the light scattered out from the topological waveguides and find that the propagation losses are due to Anderson localization. The only photonic topological waveguides proposed for materials without intrinsic absorption in the optical domain are quantum spin-Hall and valley-Hall interface states, but the former exhibit strong out-of-plane losses, and our work, therefore, raises fundamental questions about the real-world value of topological protection in reciprocal photonics.

TI Anomalous magnetoresistance by breaking ice rule in
   Bi2Ir2O7/Dy2Ti2O<
   sub>7 heterostructure
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB While geometrically frustrated quantum magnets host rich exotic spin states with potentials for revolutionary quantum technologies, most of them are necessarily good insulators which are difficult to be integrated with modern electrical circuit. The grand challenge is to electrically detect the emergent fluctuations and excitations by introducing charge carriers that interact with the localized spins without destroying their collective spin states. Here, we show that, by designing a Bi2Ir2O7/Dy2Ti2O7 heterostructure, the breaking of the spin-ice rule in insulating Dy2Ti2O7 leads to a charge response in the conducting Bi2Ir2O7 measured as anomalous magnetoresistance during the field-induced Kagome ice-to-saturated ice transition. The magnetoresistive anomaly also captures the characteristic angular and temperature dependence of this ice-rule-breaking transition, which has been understood as magnetic monopole condensation. These results demonstrate a novel heteroepitaxial approach for electronically probing the transition between exotic insulating spin states, laying out a blueprint for the metallization of frustrated quantum magnets. Spin ice compounds are typically insulating and introducing carriers can destroy the spin ice state, making integration into electronic devices problematic. Here the authors report a transport response to an ice-rule-breaking transition in a heterostructure of a pyrochlore spin ice and a nonmagnetic metal.

TI Quantum double lock-in amplifier
SO COMMUNICATIONS PHYSICS
AB Quantum lock-in amplifiers have been proposed to extract an alternating signal from a strong noise background. However, due to the typical target signal has unknown initial phase, it is challenging to extract complete information about the signal's amplitude, frequency, and initial phase. Here, we present a general protocol for achieving a quantum double lock-in amplifier by employing two quantum mixers operating under orthogonal pulse sequences. To demonstrate the practical implementation, we discuss the experimental feasibility using a five-level double-Lambda coherent population trapping system with Rb atoms. Here, each Lambda structure acts as a quantum mixer, and two applied dynamical decoupling sequences serve as orthogonal reference signals. Notably, the system significantly reduces the total measurement time by nearly half and mitigates time-dependent systematic errors compared to conventional two-level systems. Furthermore, our quantum double lock-in amplifier is robust against experimental imperfections. This study establishes a pathway to alternating signal measurement, thereby facilitating the development of practical quantum sensing technologies.
   In analogy to the classical double lock-in amplifier, this work presents a general protocol for achieving a quantum double lock-in amplifier to extract complete information about the signal's amplitude, frequency, and initial phase. The realization of the quantum double lock-in amplifier is illustrated using a five-level double-Lambda coherent population trapping system as an example.

TI Back action evasion in optical lever detection
SO OPTICA
AB The optical lever is a centuries old and widely used detection technique employed in applications ranging from consumer products and industrial sensors to precision force microscopes used in scientific research. However, despite the long history, its quantum limits have yet to be explored. In general, any precision optical measurement is accompanied by optical force induced disturbance to the measured object (termed as back action) leading to a standard quantum limit (SQL). Here, we give a simple ray optics description of how such back action can be evaded in optical lever detection. We perform a proof -of -principle experiment demonstrating the mechanism of back action evasion in the classical regime, by developing a lens system that cancels extra tilting of the reflected light off a silicon nitride membrane mechanical resonator caused by laser -pointing -noise -induced optical torques. We achieve a readout noise floor two orders of magnitude lower than the SQL, corresponding to an effective optomechanical cooperativity of 100 without the need for an optical cavity. As the state-of-the-art ultralow dissipation optomechanical systems relevant for quantum sensing are rapidly approaching the level where quantum noise dominates, simple and widely applicable back action evading protocols will be crucial for pushing beyond quantum limits.

TI Scalable and efficient grating couplers on low-index photonic platforms
   enabled by cryogenic deep silicon etching
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Efficient fiber-to-chip couplers for multi-port access to photonic integrated circuits are paramount for a broad class of applications, ranging, e.g., from telecommunication to photonic computing and quantum technologies. Grating-based approaches are often desirable for providing out-of-plane access to the photonic circuits. However, on photonic platforms characterized by a refractive index similar or equal to 2 at telecom wavelength, such as silicon nitride or thin-film lithium niobate, the limited scattering strength has thus far hindered the achievement of coupling efficiencies comparable to the ones attainable in silicon photonics. Here we present a flexible strategy for the realization of highly efficient grating couplers on such low-index photonic platforms. To simultaneously reach a high scattering efficiency and a near-unitary modal overlap with optical fibers, we make use of self-imaging gratings designed with a negative diffraction angle. To ensure high directionality of the diffracted light, we take advantage of a metal back-reflector patterned underneath the grating structure by cryogenic deep reactive ion etching of the silicon handle. Using silicon nitride as a testbed material, we experimentally demonstrate coupling efficiency up to - 0.55 dB in the telecom C-band with high chip-scale device yield.

TI Polarization-controlled tunable directional spin-driven photocurrents in
   a magnetic metamaterial with threefold rotational symmetry
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Future spintronics and quantum technologies will require a portfolio of techniques for manipulating electron spins in functional nanodevices. Especially, the establishment of the methods to control spin current is the key ingredient essential for the transfer and processing of information, enabling faster and low-energy operation. However, a universal method for manipulating spin currents with full-directional controllability and tunable magnitude has not been established. Here we show that an artificial material called a magnetic metamaterial (MM), which possesses a novel spintronic functionality not exhibited by the original substance, generates photo-driven ultrafast spin currents at room temperature via the magneto-photogalvanic effect. By tuning the polarization state of the excitation light, these spin currents can be directed with tunable magnitude along an arbitrary direction in the two-dimensional plane of the MM. This new concept may guide the design and creation of artificially engineered opto-spintronic functionalities beyond the limitations of conventional material science.
   By carefully structuring and patterning a material, it is possible to introduce emergent properties that would otherwise not exist. These metamaterials have allowed the development of a wide variety of new optical properties. Here, Matsubara et al present a magnetic metamaterial, where spin-currents can be directed by tuning the polarization of the incident light.

TI Topological triplet-superconductivity in spin-1 semimetal
SO COMMUNICATIONS PHYSICS
AB Spin-triplet superconductors are expected to host topological excitations, which makes them potentially useful materials for future quantum technologies. Here, the authors theoretically report a triple point semimetal that, through triple point fermions, stabilizes an s-wave spin-triplet pairing distinct from conventional BCS and other multi-band superconductors.
   Superconductivity in topological semimetals gives a new paradigm of unconventional superconductors. Their exotic gap structures and topological properties have fascinated searching for material realizations and applications. In this work, we focus on a triple point semimetal where quasiparticle excitations, triple point fermions, carry the effective integer spin-1 in two distinct valleys. Our work demonstrates that the triple point fermion stabilizes inter-valley s-wave spin-triplet pairing. This is due to Fermi statistics, which strictly forbids the formation of inter-valley s-wave spin-singlet pairings. This feature is clearly distinct from the BCS and other multi-band superconductors. We find that two distinct inter-valley s-wave spin-triplet superconductors are allowed which in principle can be controlled by tuning the chemical potential: time-reversal symmetric (s(z)) state with topologically protected nodal lines and time-reversal broken (s(x) + is(y)) state with topologically protected Bogoliubov Fermi surfaces. Our study provides guidance in searching for spin-triplet superconductivity.

TI Gigahertz Phononic Integrated Circuits on Thin-Film Lithium Niobate on
   Sapphire
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB Acoustic devices play an important role in classical information processing. The slower speed and lower losses of mechanical waves enable compact and efficient elements for delaying, filtering, and storing of electric signals at radio and microwave frequencies. Discovering ways of better controlling the propagation of phonons on a chip is an important step towards enabling larger-scale phononic circuits and systems. We present a platform, inspired by decades of advances in integrated photonics, that utilizes the strong piezoelectric effect in a thin film of lithium niobate on sapphire to excite guided acoustic waves immune from leakage into the bulk due to the phononic analogue of index guiding. We demonstrate an efficient transducer matched to 50 Omega and guiding within a 1 mu m wide mechanical waveguide as key building blocks of this platform. Putting these components together, we realize acoustic delay lines, racetrack resonators, and meander line waveguides for sensing applications. To evaluate the promise of this platform for emerging quantum technologies, we characterize losses at low temperature and measure quality factors on the order of 50 000 at 4 K. Finally, we demonstrate phononic four-wave mixing in these circuits and measure the nonlinear coefficients to provide estimates of the power needed for relevant parametric processes.

TI The contribution of methyl groups to electron spin decoherence of
   nitroxides in glassy matrices
SO JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS
AB Long electron spin coherence lifetimes are crucial for high sensitivity and resolution in many pulse electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) experiments aimed at measuring hyperfine and dipolar couplings, as well as in potential quantum sensing applications of molecular spin qubits. In immobilized systems, methyl groups contribute significantly to electron spin decoherence as a result of methyl torsional quantum tunneling. We examine the electron spin decoherence dynamics of the nitroxide radical 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidin-1-oxyl (TEMPO) in both a methyl-free solvent and a methyl-containing solvent at cryogenic temperature. We model nitroxide and solvent methyl effects on decoherence using cluster correlation expansion (CCE) simulations extended to include methyl tunneling and compare the calculations to experimental data. We show that by using the methyl tunneling frequency as a fit parameter, experimental Hahn echo decays can be reproduced fairly well, allowing structural properties to be investigated in silico. In addition, we examine the Hahn echo of a hypothetical system with an unpaired electron and a single methyl to determine the effect of geometric configuration on methyl-driven electron spin decoherence. The simulations show that a methyl group contributes the most to electron spin decoherence if it is located between 2.5 and 6-7 & Aring; from the electron spin, with its orientation being of secondary importance.

TI Two-dimensional quantum motion of a levitated nanosphere
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB We report on the two-dimensional (2D) dynamics of a levitated nanoparticle in an optical cavity. The motion of the nanosphere is strongly coupled to the cavity field by coherent scattering and heavily cooled in the plane orthogonal to the tweezer axis. Due to the characteristics of the 2D motion and the strong optomechanical coupling, the motional sideband asymmetry that reveals the quantum nature of the dynamics is not limited to mere scale factors between Stokes and anti-Stokes peaks, as customary in quantum optomechanics, but assumes a peculiar spectral dependence. We introduce and discuss an effective thermal occupancy that quantifies how close the system is to a minimum uncertainty state and allows us to consistently characterize the particle motion. By rotating the polarization angle of the tweezer beam we tune the system from a 1D cooling regime, where we achieve a best thermal occupancy of 0.51 +/- 0.05, to a regime in which the fully 2D dynamics of the particle exhibit strong nonclassical properties. We achieve a strong 2D confinement with thermal occupancy of 3.4 +/- 0.4 along the warmest direction and around one in the orthogonal one. These results represent a major improvement over previous experiments considering both the 1D and the 2D motion and pave the way toward the preparation of tripartite optomechanical entangled states and novel applications to directional force and displacement quantum sensing.

TI Causal framework for nonlinear quantum mechanics
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
AB We add nonlinear and state-dependent terms to quantum field theory. We show that the resulting low energy theory, nonlinear quantum mechanics, is causal, preserves probability and permits a consistent description of the process of measurement. We explore the consequences of such terms and show that nonlinear quantum effects can be observed in macroscopic systems even in the presence of decoherence. We find that current experimental bounds on these nonlinearities are weak and propose several experimental methods to significantly probe these effects. The locally exploitable effects of these nonlinearities have enormous technological implications. For example, they would allow large-scale parallelization of computing (in fact, any other effort) and enable quantum sensing beyond the standard quantum limit. We also expose a fundamental vulnerability of any nonlinear modification of quantum mechanics-these modifications are highly sensitive to cosmic history and their locally exploitable effects can dynamically disappear if the observed universe has a tiny overlap with the overall quantum state of the universe, as is predicted in conventional inflationary cosmology. We identify observables that should persist in this case and discuss opportunities to detect them in cosmic ray experiments, tests of strong field general relativity and current probes of the equation of state of the universe. Nonlinear quantum mechanics also enables novel gravitational phenomena and may open new directions to solve the black hole information problem and to uncover the theory underlying quantum field theory and gravitation.

TI Proton Quantum Tunneling: Influence and Relevance to Acidosis-Induced
   Cardiac Arrhythmias/Cardiac Arrest
SO PATHOPHYSIOLOGY
AB Acidosis and its associated pathologies predispose patients to develop cardiac arrhythmias and even cardiac arrest. These arrhythmias are assumed to be the result of membrane depolarization, however, the exact mechanism of depolarization during acidosis is not well defined. In our study, the model of quantum tunneling of protons is used to explain the membrane depolarization that occurs during acidosis. It is found that protons can tunnel through closed activation and inactivation gates of voltage-gated sodium channels Nav1.5 that are present in the membrane of cardiac cells. The quantum tunneling of protons results in quantum conductance, which is evaluated to assess its effect on membrane potential. The quantum conductance of extracellular protons is higher than that of intracellular protons. This predicts an inward quantum current of protons through the closed sodium channels. Additionally, the values of quantum conductance are influential and can depolarize the membrane potential according to the quantum version of the GHK equation. The quantum mechanism of depolarization is distinct from other mechanisms because the quantum model suggests that protons can directly depolarize the membrane potential, and not only through indirect effects as proposed by other mechanisms in the literature. Understanding the pathophysiology of arrhythmias mediated by depolarization during acidosis is crucial to treat and control them and to improve the overall clinical outcomes of patients.

TI Laser cooling a membrane-in-the-middle system close to the quantum
   ground state from room temperature
SO OPTICA
AB Many protocols in quantum science and technology require initializing a system in a pure quantum state. In the context of the motional state of massive resonators, this enables studying fundamental physics at the elusive quantum-classical transition, and measuring force and acceleration with enhanced sensitivity. Laser cooling has been a method of choice to prepare mechanical resonators in the quantum ground state, one of the simplest pure states. However, to overcome the heating and decoherence by the thermal bath, this usually has to be combined with cryogenic cooling. Here, we laser-cool an ultracoherent, soft-clamped mechanical resonator close to the quantum ground state directly from room temperature. To this end, we implement the versatile membrane-in-the-middle setup with one fiber mirror and one phononic crystal mirror, which reaches a quantum cooperativity close to unity already at room temperature. We further-more introduce a powerful combination of coherent and measurement-based quantum control techniques, which allows us to mitigate thermal intermodulation noise. The lowest occupancy we reach is 30 phonons, limited by measurement imprecision. Doing away with the necessity for cryogenic cooling should further facilitate the spread of optomechanical quantum technologies.

TI Cross-Sectoral Digital Platform as a Tool for Innovation Ecosystem
   Development
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB At present, issues of ecosystem self-organization and the mechanisms for their sustainable development have been insufficiently explored in academic literature. The key idea of our research is that for enterprises interacting in different industries based on a network partnership, a special tool is needed to ensure the openness of interaction between participants in the transfer of knowledge, technology, information, and resources. The authors argue that the development and practical implementation of a cross-sectoral digital ecosystem platform will allow for the synchronizing of the scientific and technological progress of several industries, making the most effective use of the synergistic effect from the interaction of ecosystem actors and ensuring the transparency and openness of the ongoing processes therein. The authors demonstrate their propositions with the example of unmanned aircraft system (UAS) industry. The proposed model and mechanism of cross-sectoral interaction can be replicated in different technological niches, such as robotics, neurotechnology, quantum technologies, etc. The conclusions arising from the conducted research provide scientists, government bodies, and decision-makers with the necessary information for a better understanding of practical mechanisms and tools that allow for the implementation of self-organization and sustainable development in modern innovation ecosystems.

TI Comprehensive characterization and analysis of hexagonal boron nitride
   on sapphire
SO AIP ADVANCES
AB Hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) is considered as one of the most promising materials for next-generation quantum technologies. In this paper, we report bulk-like multilayer h-BN epitaxially grown using a carbon-free precursor on c-plane sapphire with a strong emphasis on material characterization and analysis. In particular, structural, morphological, and vibrational properties, and chemical bonding of such van der Waals materials are presented. Between as-grown h-BN and c-plane sapphire, a compressive residual strain induced by both lattice mismatch and thermal expansion mismatch is examined by both theoretical and experimental studies. Atomic force microscopy revealed and scanning electron microscopy supported the presence of wrinkles across the entire surface of the film, likely due to biaxial compressive strain further verified by Raman spectroscopy. Stacking orders in h-BN with a clearly layered structure were confirmed by high resolution transmission electron microscopy, showing that the films have crystallographic homogeneity. Chemical analysis of the as-grown films was done by x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, which confirmed the formation of stoichiometric h-BN films with excellent uniformity. This wafer-scale chemical vapor deposition-grown layered h-BN with 2D morphology facilitates applications in the fields of quantum- and deep ultraviolet-photonics.

TI Extracting phonon coupling parameters from multi color center
   photoluminescence
SO JOURNAL OF OPTICS
AB Vibronic coupling of color centers plays a crucial role in their effectiveness for quantum technologies. This study presents a novel approach to extract key parameters, including the Huang-Rhys factor and the one-phonon coupling function, from photoluminescence spectra containing the signal from multiple color centers. Monotonic splines are used to represent the one-phonon coupling function, optimized using a variable-length non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm. Our method is applied to the combination of the well-studied negatively charged nitrogen-vacancy center and its less explored neutral counterpart in diamond, observed through photoluminescence at 14 K. Despite the complexity inherent in the theoretical framework governing phonon coupling in photoluminescence, we achieve robust fits, yielding a normalized root-mean-squared error of approximately 6%. The neutral nitrogen-vacancy center exhibits a Huang-Rhys factor of 3.0, while its negatively charged counterpart showcases a value of 3.95. The quasi-localized vibrations of both charge states are clearly present in the fitted one-phonon spectral function. Furthermore, the consistency of our methodology is bolstered by temperature-dependent photoluminescence, which was calculated up to numerical constants using fit-derived parameters, matching the experimental measurements up to 300 K.

TI Pit-formation in germanium homoepitaxial layers
SO SURFACE SCIENCE
AB With increasing importance of germanium (Ge) for semiconductor quantum technologies, the necessity of growing defect-free Ge films has become crucial. Here, Ge homoepitaxial growth experiments were conducted using molecular beam epitaxy (MBE). This requires a smooth (sigma(rms) <= 10 angstrom) and contamination-free substrate surface. We have shown that common ex-situ wet chemical cleaning methods are not sufficient. Foreign atoms like carbon stick to the substrate surface and tend to form clusters which results in macroscopic growth defects which are referred here as pits. The density of such pits is in the range of 10(6) to 10(9) cm(-2). The formation and characteristics of the pits have been investigated. Pits emerge after a growth at 370 degrees C with a thickness of above 5 nm. At growth temperatures lower than 300 degrees C, the density of pits increases, while it decreases at temperatures higher than 400 degrees C. Pits can be faceted with the main facets being {1 1 3} and {3 15 23}. Furthermore, a procedure is presented involving a Ge buffer growth at room temperature with a high growth rate (0.02 nm/s). This leads to a coverage of present contamination and the formation of a new substrate surface which prevent pit formation.

TI Grating magneto-optical traps with complicated level structures
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB We study the forces and optical pumping within grating magneto-optical traps (MOTs) operating on transitions with non-trivial level structure. In contrast to the standard six-beam MOT configuration, rate equation modeling predicts that the asymmetric laser geometry of a grating MOT will produce spin-polarized atomic samples. Furthermore, the Lande g-factors and total angular momenta of the trapping transition strongly influence both the confinement and equilibrium position of the trap. Using the intuition gained from the rate equation model, we realize a grating MOT of fermionic 87Sr and observe that it forms closer to the center of the trap's quadrupole magnetic field than its bosonic counterpart. We also explore the application of grating MOTs to molecule laser cooling, where the rate equations suggest that dual-frequency operation is necessary, but not sufficient, for stable confinement for type-II level structures. To test our molecule laser cooling models, we create grating MOTs using the D 1 line of 7Li and see that only two of the four possible six-beam polarization configurations operate in the grating geometry. Our results will aid the development of portable atom and molecule traps for time keeping, inertial navigation, and precision measurement.

TI Spatiotemporal dynamics of moiré excitons in van der Waals
   heterostructures
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Heterostructures of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) offer unique opportunities in optoelectronics due to their strong light-matter interaction and the formation of dipolar interlayer excitons. Introducing a twist angle or lattice mismatch between layers creates a periodic moir & eacute; potential that significantly reshapes the energy landscape and introduces a high-dimensional complexity absent in aligned bilayers. Recent experimental advances have enabled direct observation and control of interlayer excitons in such moir & eacute;-patterned systems, yet a microscopic theoretical framework capturing both their thermalization and spatiotemporal dynamics remains lacking. Here, we address this challenge by developing a predictive, material-specific many-body model that tracks exciton dynamics across time, space, and momentum, fully accounting for the moir & eacute; potential and the complex non-parabolic exciton band structure. Surprisingly, we reveal that flat bands, which typically trap excitons, can significantly enhance exciton propagation. This counterintuitive behavior emerges from the interplay between the flat-band structure giving rise to a bottleneck effect for exciton relaxation and thermal occupation dynamics creating hot excitons. Our work not only reveals the microscopic mechanisms behind the enhanced propagation but also enables the control of exciton transport via twist-angle engineering. These insights lay the foundation for next-generation moir & eacute;-based optoelectronic and quantum technologies.

TI Hierarchy of quantum non-Gaussian conservative motion
SO COMMUNICATIONS PHYSICS
AB Mechanical quantum systems embedded in an external nonlinear potential currently offer the first deep excursion into quantum non-Gaussian motion. The Gaussian statistics of the motion of a linear mechanical quantum system, characterised by its mass and a linear-and-quadratic potential, possess a limited capacity to reduce noise in nonlinear variables. This limitation induces thresholds for noise reduction in nonlinear variables beyond which linear mechanical oscillators cannot pass. Squeezing below the thresholds for such variables is relevant for the implementation of nonlinear mechanical devices, such as sensors, processors or engines. First however, quantum non-Gaussian conservative motion must be identified in experiments with diverse nonlinear potentials. For this purpose, we provide sufficient criteria for quantum non-Gaussian motional states in conservative systems based on the observation of squeezing in nonlinear variables. We further extend these criteria to a hierarchy able to recognise the quantum non-Gaussian motion induced via diverse nonlinear potentials through their various capacities to produce nonlinear squeezing.
   Gaussian systems are useful for many quantum technologies but new applications will require control over nonlinear systems generating quantum non-Gaussian states. The authors present a method for the detection of quantum non-Gaussian states of mechanical particles which may be applied for future experiments in optomechanics and levitated nanoparticles in the quantum regime.

TI Systematically Navigating Through the Parameter Space During the Lateral
   Manipulation of PTCDA on the Ag(111) Surface
SO SMALL METHODS
AB The lateral manipulation of single perylene-3,4,9,10-tetracarboxylic dianhydride (PTCDA) molecules serves as a key model process for both building surface-supported nanostructures and enabling quantum sensing with single molecules attached to scanning probe microscopy tips. This work introduces an instructive procedure that guarantees the controlled lateral movement of single PTCDA molecules, in particular the isolation from molecular island edges. The lateral manipulation relies on establishing a specific bond between one of the molecular carboxylic oxygen atoms and the metallic tip of a combined scanning tunneling (STM) and atomic force microscope (AFM) before displacing the molecule by laterally moving the tip. From analyzing both the tip-position data during this movement and the STM imaging contrast after the manipulation, a categorization scheme containing four resulting tip-molecule-surface configurations is proposed. Together with transitions observed between some of these configurations, the complex tip-molecule-surface system parameter space during the manipulation procedure can be compressed into an instructive flowchart. Following through this flowchart guarantees the lateral isolation of a single PTCDA molecule in a systematic manner and without requirement for previous knowledge. Broad applicability is verified by also manipulating molecules from Ag(111) surface step-edges and from molecular island edges on the Au(111) surface.

TI Exploiting ionization dynamics in the nitrogen vacancy center for rapid,
   high-contrast spin, and charge state initialization
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB We propose and experimentally demonstrate a method to strongly increase the sensitivity of spin measure-ments on nitrogen vacancy (NV) centers in diamond, which can be readily implemented in existing quantum sensing experiments. While charge state transitions of this defect are generally considered a parasitic effect to be avoided, we show here that these can be used to significantly increase the NV center's spin contrast, a key quantity for high-sensitivity magnetometry and high-fidelity state readout. The protocol consists of a two-step procedure, in which the charge state of the defect is first purified by a strong laser pulse, followed by weak illumination to obtain high spin polarization. We observe a relative improvement of the readout contrast by 17% and infer a reduction of the initialization error of more than 50%. The contrast enhancement is accompanied by a beneficial increase of the readout signal. For long sequence durations, typically encountered in high-resolution magnetometry, a measurement speedup by a factor of >1.5 is extracted, and we find that the technique is beneficial for sequences of any duration. Additionally, our findings give detailed insight into the charge and spin polarization dynamics of the NV center and provide actionable insights for direct optical, spin-to-charge, and electrical readout of solid-state spin centers.

TI Birefringent Spin-Photon Interface Generates Polarization Entanglement
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB A spin-photon interface based on the luminescence of a singly charged quantum dot in a micropillar cavity allows for the creation of photonic entangled states. Current devices suffer from cavity birefringence, which limits the generation of spin-photon entanglement. In this study, we conduct a theoretical analysis of the light absorption and emission by the interface with an anisotropic cavity and derive the maximal excitation and spin-photon entanglement conditions. It is shown that the concurrence of the spin-photon state equal to one and complete quantum dot population inversion can be reached for a micropillar cavity with any degree of birefringence by tuning the quantum dot resonance strictly between the cavity modes. This sweet spot is also valid for generating a multiphoton cluster state, as demonstrated by calculating the three-tangle and fidelity with the maximally entangled state.
   The impact of birefringence in a micropillar cavity on spin-photon entanglement is investigated. The optimal conditions for the trion population in a quantum dot and the generation of cluster states are identified. The study demonstrates that, by tuning the quantum dot resonance, a fully entangled spin-photon state can be achieved despite cavity birefringence, enabling the creation of multiphoton cluster states for advanced quantum technologies. image
