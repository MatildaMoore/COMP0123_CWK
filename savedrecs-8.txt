TI Fault-Tolerant Quantum Simulation of Materials Using Bloch Orbitals
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB The simulation of chemistry is among the most promising applications of quantum computing. However, most prior work exploring algorithms for block encoding, time evolving, and sampling in the eigenbasis of electronic structure Hamiltonians has either focused on modeling finite-sized systems, or has required a large number of plane-wave basis functions. In this work, we extend methods for quantum simulation with Bloch orbitals constructed from symmetry-adapted atom-centered orbitals so that one can model periodic ab initio Hamiltonians using only a modest number of basis functions. We focus on adapting existing algorithms based on combining qubitization with tensor factorizations of the Coulomb operator. Significant modifications of those algorithms are required to obtain an asymptotic speedup leveraging translational (or, more broadly, Abelian) symmetries. We implement block encodings using known tensor factorizations and a new Bloch orbital form of tensor hypercontraction. Finally, we estimate the resources required to deploy our algorithms to classically challenging model materials relevant to the chemistry of lithium nickel oxide battery cathodes within the surface code. We find that even with these improvements, the quantum runtime of these algorithms is on the order of thousands of days and further algorithmic improvements are required to make realistic quantum simulation of materials practical.

TI C-band single photons from a trapped ion via two-stage frequency
   conversion
SO APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS
AB Fiber-based quantum networks require photons at telecommunications wavelengths to interconnect qubits separated by long distances. Trapped ions are leading candidates for quantum networking with high-fidelity two-qubit gates, long coherence times, and the ability to readily emit photons entangled with the ion's internal qubit states. However, trapped ions typically emit photons at wavelengths incompatible with telecommunications fiber. Here, we demonstrate frequency conversion of visible photons, emitted from the S-P dipole transition of a trapped Ba+ ion into the telecommunications C-band. These results are an important step toward enabling a long-distance trapped ion quantum internet. Published under an exclusive license by AIP Publishing.

TI Recent progress of quantum control in solid-state single-spin systems
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB In the field of quantum physics, quantum control is essential. Precise and efficient quantum control is a prerequisite for the experimental research using quantum systems, and it is also the basis for applications such as in quantum computing and quantum sensing. As a solid-state spin system, the nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond has a long coherence time at room temperature. It can be initialized and read out by optical methods, and can achieve universal quantum control through the microwave field and radio frequency fields. It is an excellent experimental platform for studying quantum physics. In this review, we introduce the recen tresults of quantum control in NV center and discuss the following parts: 1) the physical properties of the NV center and the realization method of quantum control, 2) the decoherence mechanism of the NV center spinqubit, and 3) the application of single-spin quantum control and relevant research progress

TI Full network nonlocality sharing in extended bilocal scenario via weak
   measurements with the optimal pointer
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS A-MATHEMATICAL AND THEORETICAL
AB The investigation of network nonlocality (NN) has expanded the study of quantum nonlocality, yet it fails to fully capture the complexities within quantum networks. Recently, a stronger and more genuine definition of NN, known as full quantum network nonlocality (FNN), has been explored, which is considered a vital resource for realizing network-based device-independent quantum cryptography protocols. In this work, we explore the recycling of FNN as quantum resources by analyzing the FNN sharing between different combinations of observers. The FNN sharing in an extended bilocal scenario (consisting of two independent two-qubit quantum states as sources) via weak measurements has been thoroughly discussed. Based on the different motivations of the observer-Charlie1, two types of possible FNN sharing, passive FNN sharing and active FNN sharing, can be investigated by checking the simultaneous violation of Kerstjens-Gisin-Tavakoli inequalities between Alice-Bob-Charlie1 and Alice-Bob-Charlie2. Our results show that passive FNN sharing is impossible while active FNN sharing can be achieved through proper measurements, indicating that FNN sharing in this scenario requires more cooperation by intermediate observers compared to Bell nonlocality sharing and NN sharing.

TI Inferring the Dynamics of the State Evolution During Quantum Annealing
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PARALLEL AND DISTRIBUTED SYSTEMS
AB To solve an optimization problem using a commercial quantum annealer, one has to represent the problem of interest as an Ising or a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) problem and submit its coefficients to the annealer, which then returns a user-specified number of low-energy solutions. It would be useful to know what happens in the quantum processor during the anneal process so that one could design better algorithms or suggest improvements to the hardware. However, existing quantum annealers are not able to directly extract such information from the processor. Hence, in this article we propose to use advanced features of D-Wave 2000Q to indirectly infer information about the dynamics of the state evolution during the anneal process. Specifically, D-Wave 2000Q allows the user to customize the anneal schedule, that is, the schedule with which the anneal fraction is changed from the start to the end of the anneal. Using this feature, we design a set of modified anneal schedules whose outputs can be used to generate information about the states of the system at user-defined time points during a standard anneal. With this process, called slicing, we obtain approximate distributions of lowest-energy anneal solutions as the anneal time evolves. We use our technique to obtain a variety of insights into the annealer, such as the state evolution during annealing, when individual bits in an evolving solution flip during the anneal process and when they stabilize, and we introduce a technique to estimate the freeze-out point of both the system as well as of individual qubits.

TI Analysis of outage performance in a 6G-V2X communications system
   utilising free-space optical quantum key distribution
SO IET QUANTUM COMMUNICATION
AB Quantum-based technologies will provide system engineers with new capabilities for securing data communications. The UK AirQKD project has implemented a Free-Space Optical Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) system to enable the continuous generation of symmetric encryption keys. One of the use cases for the generated keys is to secure Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communications. V2X applications would benefit from the certificate-free security provided by QKD for a post-quantum society. How FSO-QKD could integrate into a V2X architecture is examined. An overview of V2X is provided with the role that FSO-QKD could secure V2X data though some obstacles exist. One of the issues with 6G communications is the potential line-of-sight (LOS) considerations between the V2X devices. The modelling required for LOS is examined to analyse the outage performance of the building to infrastructure links in the 6G architecture. The results from the model show that further work is required if 6G LOS communications are going to be relied upon for future safety-critical V2X applications.

TI Mirror-mediated ultralong-range atomic dipole-dipole interactions
SO OPTICAL AND QUANTUM ELECTRONICS
AB In three dimensions, dipole-dipole interactions which alter atomic level shifts and spontaneous decay rates only persist over distances comparable to the wavelength of the emitted light. In this paper we show that it is possible to significantly extend the range of these interactions with the help of a partially transparent asymmetric mirror interface. Suppose two two-level atoms are placed on opposite sides of the interface, each at the position of the mirror image of the other. In this case, their emitted light interferes almost exactly as it would when the atoms are right next to each other. Hence their dipole-dipole interaction assumes an additional maximum, even when the actual distance of the atoms is several orders of magnitude larger than the transition wavelength. Although the resulting ultralong-range interactions are in general relatively weak, we expect them to find applications in quantum technology, like non-invasive quantum sensing.

TI Systematic-Error-Tolerant Multiqubit Holonomic Entangling Gates
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB Quantum holonomic gates hold built-in resilience to local noises and provide a promising approach for implementing fault-tolerant quantum computation. We propose to realize high-fidelity holonomic (N + 1)-qubit controlled gates using Rydberg atoms confined in optical arrays or superconducting circuits. We identify the scheme, deduce the effective multibody Hamiltonian, and determine the working condition of the multiqubit gate. Uniquely, the multiqubit gate is immune to systematic errors, i.e., laser parameter fluctuations and motional dephasing, as the N control atoms largely remain in the very stable qubit space during the operation. We show that C-N-NOT gates can reach the same level of fidelity at a given gate time for N <= 5 under a suitable choice of parameters, and the gate tolerance against errors in systematic parameters can be further enhanced through optimal pulse engineering. In the case of Rydberg atoms, the proposed protocol is intrinsically different from typical schemes based on Rydberg block-ade or antiblockade. Our study paves an alternative way to build robust multiqubit gates with Rydberg atoms trapped in optical arrays or with superconducting circuits. It contributes to current efforts to develop scalable quantum computation with trapped atoms and fabricable superconducting devices.

TI Feasibility of space-based measurement-device-independent quantum key
   distribution
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB The measurement-device-independent (MDI) quantum key distribution (QKD) is considered to be an alternative to overcome the currently trusted satellite paradigm. However, the feasibility of the space-based MDI-QKD remains unclear in terms of the factors: the high-loss uplink between a ground station and a satellite, the limited duration when two ground stations are simultaneously visible, as well as the rigorous requirements for the two-photon interference when performing the Bell-state measurement. In this paper, we present a feasibility assessment of space-based MDI-QKD based on the Micius satellite. Integrated with the orbital dynamics model and atmosphere channel model, a framework is presented to explore the whole parameters space including orbit height, elevation angle, apertures of transceiver and atmospheric turbulence intensity to give the considerations for improving key rates and subsequently provide a relevant parameter tradeoff for the implementation of space-based MDI-QKD. We further investigate the heart of MDI-QKD, the two-photon interference considerations such as the frequency calibration and time synchronization technology against Doppler shift, and the way of performing the intensity optimization method in the dynamic and asymmetric channels. Our work can be used as a pathfinder to support decisions involving as the selection of the future quantum communication satellite missions.

TI The universal unambiguous discriminator between two unknown qudit states
SO EPL
AB In this work, the unambiguous discrimination between two unknown states in d-dimensional (d >= 2) Hilbert space is investigated. To achieve this goal, the Hilbert space of the states is divided into a series of subspaces, where the components of the two states projected in some of these subspaces can be unambiguously distinguished, and then the unambiguous discriminator between two unknown qudit states can be constructed. Moreover, the optimal success probability of the discrimination between two unknown states is obtained and the form of detection operators is given. Copyright (C) 2022 EPLA

TI Learning Correlated Noise in a 39-Qubit Quantum Processor
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Building error-corrected quantum computers relies crucially on measuring and modeling noise on candidate devices. In particular, optimal error correction requires knowing the noise that occurs in the device as it executes the circuits required for error correction. As devices increase in size, we will become more reliant on efficient models of this noise. However, such models must still retain the information required to optimize the algorithms used for error correction. Here, we propose a method of extracting detailed information of the noise in a device running syndrome extraction circuits. We introduce and execute an experiment on a superconducting device using 39 of its qubits in a surface code doing repeated rounds of syndrome extraction but omitting the midcircuit measurement and reset. We show how to extract from the 20 data qubits the information needed to build noise models of various sophistication in the form of graphical models. These models give efficient descriptions of noise in large-scale devices and are designed to illuminate the effectiveness of error correction against correlated noise. Our estimates are furthermore precise: we learn a consistent global distribution where all one- and two-qubit error rates are known to a relative error of 0.1%. By extrapolating our experimentally learned noise models toward lower error rates, we demonstrate that accurate correlated noise models are increasingly important for successfully predicting subthreshold behavior in quantum error-correction experiments.

TI Subsystem analysis of continuous-variable resource states
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Continuous-variable (CV) cluster states are a universal resource for fault-tolerant quantum computation when supplemented with the Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) bosonic code. We generalize the recently introduced subsystem decomposition of a bosonic mode [G. Pantaleoni et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 125, 040501 (2020)], and we use it to analyze CV cluster-state quantum computing with GKP states. Specifically, we decompose squeezed-vacuum states and approximate GKP states to reveal their encoded logical information, and we decompose several gates crucial to CV cluster-state quantum computing. Then, we use the subsystem decomposition to quantify damage to the logical information in approximate GKP states teleported through noisy CV cluster states. Each of these studies uses the subsystem decomposition to circumvent complications arising from the full CV nature of the mode in order to focus on the encoded qubit information.

TI Reference-State Error Mitigation: A Strategy for High Accuracy Quantum
   Computation of Chemistry
SO JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL THEORY AND COMPUTATION
AB Decoherence and gate errors severely limit the capabilities of state-of-the-art quantum computers. This work introduces a strategy for reference-state error mitigation (REM) of quantum chemistry that can be straightforwardly implemented on current and near-term devices. REM can be applied alongside existing mitigation procedures, while requiring minimal post-processing and only one or no additional measurements. The approach is agnostic to the underlying quantum mechanical ansatz and is designed for the variational quantum eigensolver. Up to two orders-of-magnitude improvement in the computational accuracy of ground state energies of small molecules (H2, HeH+, and LiH) is demonstrated on superconducting quantum hardware. Simulations of noisy circuits with a depth exceeding 1000 two-qubit gates are used to demonstrate the scalability of the method.

TI Hyperfine Interactions in the NV-13C Quantum Registers in
   Diamond Grown from the Azaadamantane Seed
SO NANOMATERIALS
AB Nanostructured diamonds hosting optically active paramagnetic color centers (NV, SiV, GeV, etc.) and hyperfine-coupled with them quantum memory C-13 nuclear spins situated in diamond lattice are currently of great interest to implement emerging quantum technologies (quantum information processing, quantum sensing and metrology). Current methods of creation such as electronic-nuclear spin systems are inherently probabilistic with respect to mutual location of color center electronic spin and C-13 nuclear spins. A new bottom-up approach to fabricate such systems is to synthesize first chemically appropriate diamond-like organic molecules containing desired isotopic constituents in definite positions and then use them as a seed for diamond growth to produce macroscopic diamonds, subsequently creating vacancy-related color centers in them. In particular, diamonds incorporating coupled NV-C-13 spin systems (quantum registers) with specific mutual arrangements of NV and C-13 can be obtained from anisotopic azaadamantane molecule. Here we predict the characteristics of hyperfine interactions (hfi) for the NV-C-13 systems in diamonds grown from various isotopically substituted azaadamantane molecules differing in C-13 position in the seed, as well as the orientation of the NV center in the post-obtained diamond. We used the spatial and hfi data simulated earlier for the H-terminated cluster C-510[NV]H--(252). The data obtained can be used to identify (and correlate with the seed used) the specific NV-C-13 spin system by measuring, e.g., the hfi-induced splitting of the m(S) = +/- 1 sublevels of the NV center in optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) spectra being characteristic for various NV-C-13 systems.

TI Generating the Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill qubit using a cross-Kerr
   interaction between squeezed light and Fock states in optics
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB The Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) qubit is a promising ingredient for fault-tolerant quantum computation (FTQC) in optical continuous variables due to its advantage of noise tolerance and scalability. However, one of the main problems in the preparation of the optical GKP qubit is the difficulty in obtaining the nonlinearity. Cross-Kerr interaction is one of the promising candidates for this nonlinearity. There is no existing scheme to use the cross-Kerr interaction to generate the optical GKP qubit for FTQC. In this work, we propose a generation method of the GKP qubit by using a cross-Kerr interaction between a squeezed light and a superposition of Fock states. We numerically show that the GKP qubit with the 10 dB can be generated with mean fidelities of 99.99 and 99.9% at the success probabilities of 2.7 and 4.8%, respectively. Therefore, our method has the potential to generate the optical GKP qubit with a quality required for FTQC when we obtain the sufficient technologies for the preparation of ancillary Fock states and a cross-Kerr interaction.

TI Development of Quantum Protocol Modification CSLOE-2022, Increasing the
   Cryptographic Strength of Classical Quantum Protocol BB84
SO ELECTRONICS
AB Quantum cryptography protocols make it possible not only to ensure the protection of data transmitted in a communication channel from unauthorized access by intruders, but also to detect the existence of any attempted interception. This scientific direction is currently relevant, since it is related to the problem of security and data protection in current information and communication networks. The article is devoted to quantum cryptography; it describes the development of quantum protocols as quantum key distribution systems. Grounded on the laws of quantum mechanics, the elaboration of modifications of secure data transfer protocols is shown. The authors considered the best-known protocol to be BB84 of quantum key distribution; a more modern modification of this protocol is BB84 Info-Z. Comparative analysis of these has also been carried out. It has been established that the BB84-Info-Z quantum protocol works more efficiently than BB84 since its lower error threshold allows the interceptor to obtain much less information about the secret key. The authors put forward a new idea to improve the BB84 protocol (which has been quite outdated for almost 40 years), due to the increase in modern requirements for quantum cryptography protocols. The modification is called CSLOE-2022. It enables significant intensification of cryptographic strength and the entanglement degree of the interceptor (cryptanalyst), which greatly complicates the very possibility of intercepting information. The ultimate goal of the CSLOE-2022 modification is to complicate the eavesdropping process so much that it can be considered completely useless for an attacker in terms of wasting time and resources. The modification allows exceeding the known speed limit of key generation without repeaters since it uses two sources, the phases of which, in addition to the hundreds of kilometers of fiber between them, are very difficult to stabilize. Comparison of the protocols by working distance showed that for BB84, this distance does not exceed 70 km; for BB84-Info-Z it is similar, at no more than 70 km, and the modification of CSLOE-2022 proposed by the authors theoretically allows increasing the working distance of the quantum protocol to 511 km (7.3 times).

AB Quantum Error Correction (QEC) codes store information reliably in logical qubits by encoding them in a larger number of less reliable qubits. The surface code, known for its high resilience to physical errors, is a leading candidate for fault-tolerant quantum computing (FTQC). Logical qubits encoded with the surface code can be in different phases of their syndrome generation cycle, thereby introducing desynchronization in the system. This can occur due to the production of non-Clifford states, dropouts due to fabrication defects, and the use of other QEC codes with the surface code to reduce resource requirements. Logical operations require the syndrome generation cycles of the logical qubits involved to be synchronized. This requires the leading qubit to pause or slow down its cycle, allowing more errors to accumulate before the next cycle, thereby increasing the risk of uncorrectable errors.
   To synchronize the syndrome generation cycles of logical qubits, we define three policies - Passive, Active, and Hybrid. The Passive policy is the baseline, and the simplest, wherein the leading logical qubits idle until they are synchronized with the remaining logical qubits. On the other hand, the Active policy aims to slow the leading logical qubits down gradually, by inserting short idle periods before multiple code cycles. This approach reduces the logical error rate (LER) by up to 2.4x compared to the Passive policy. The Hybrid policy further reduces the LER by up to 3.4x by reducing the synchronization slack and running a few additional rounds of error correction. Furthermore, the reduction in the logical error rate with the proposed synchronization policies enables a speedup in decoding latency of up to 2.2x with a circuit-level noise model.

TI Integrated quantum communication network and vibration sensing in
   optical fibers
SO OPTICA
AB Communication and sensing technologies play crucial roles in various aspects of modern society. The seamless combination of communication and sensing systems has attracted significant interest in recent years. Without adding core devices, vibration-sensing functions can be integrated to build a quantum network with high efficiency and versatility. In this study, we propose and demonstrate a network architecture that integrates a downstream quantum access network (DQAN) and vibration sensing in optical fibers. By encoding the key information of eight users simultaneously on the sidemode quantum states of a single laser source and successively separating them using a specially designed narrow-bandwidth filter network, we achieved a secure and efficient DQAN with an average key rate of 1.94 x 104 bits per second over an 80 km single-mode fiber. Meanwhile, vibration locations with spatial resolutions of 131, 25, and 4 m at vibration frequencies of 100 Hz, 1 kHz, and 10 kHz, respectively, were implemented using the existing DQAN system infrastructure. The results indicate that the backward probe beam has a negligible effect on the DQAN system. Our integrated architecture provides a viable and cost-effective solution for building a quantum communication sensor network and paves the way for the functionality expansion of quantum communication networks.

TI Experimental Verification of Fluctuation Relations with a Quantum
   Computer
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Inspired by the idea that quantum computers can be useful in advancing basic science, we use a quantum processor to experimentally validate a number of theoretical results in non-equilibrium quantum thermodynamics, that were not (or were very little) corroborated so far. In order to do so, we first put forward a novel method to implement the so called two-point measurement scheme, which is at the basis of the study of nonequilibrium energetic exchanges in quantum systems. Like previously established methods, our method uses an ancillary system, but at variance with them, it provides direct access to the energy exchange statistics, and is, accordingly more effective, at least when applied to small quantum systems. Using a quantum computer as a remotely programmable experimental platform, we first validate our ancilla-assisted two-point measurement scheme, and then apply it to (i) experimentally verify that fluctuation theorems are robust against projective measurements, a theoretical prediction, which was not validated so far; (ii) experimentally verify the so-called heat-engine fluctuation relation, by implementing a SWAP quantum heat engine; (iii) experimentally verify that the heat-engine fluctuation relation holds for measurement-fueled quantum heat engines, by implementing the design at the basis of the so-called quantum-measurement-cooling concept. For both engines, we report the measured average heat and work exchanged and single out their operation mode. Our experiments constitute an experimental basis for the understanding of the nonequilibrium energetics of quantum computation and for the implementation of energy-management devices on quantum processors.

TI Magnetic ac susceptibility of superconducting Ta films for quantum
   computing
SO SUPERCONDUCTOR SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY
AB Recently, breakthroughs were reported in the long coherence time (>0.5 ms) transmon qubit using tantalum films (Ta). Identifying the loss mechanism in Ta films will help further improve the performance of Ta-based superconducting qubits. Here, we report a study of superconducting properties in two sets of Ta films grown on c-cut and a-cut sapphires respectively using contact transport and noncontact magnetic ac susceptibility measurements. Although the resistive transition appears to be similar in both films, we found strikingly different responses in their complex magnetic susceptibilities . in the c-cut films exhibits a sharp peak at superconducting transition T-c and becomes featureless below T-c indicating a strongly coupled superconducting state. In contrast, in the a-cut films exhibits a broad peak near T-c and a second peak appears below T-c, indicating granular superconductivity behavior. This second peak in is associated with the hysteresis loss at weak-link-type grain boundaries, which is believed to be a leading source of decoherence in the a-cut Ta films. The derived magnetic loss tangent in the a-cut films is about one order of magnitude higher than in the c-cut films. This study demonstrates that ac susceptibility is an excellent probe for characterizing bulk superconducting properties of the constituent superconducting materials used in qubits.

TI Extending quantum key distribution through proxy re-encryption
SO JOURNAL OF OPTICAL COMMUNICATIONS AND NETWORKING
AB Modern quantum key distribution (QKD) network designs are based on sending photons from one node to another and require free-space or dedicated fiber optic cables between nodes. The purpose of this is to co-generate secret key material on both sides of the quantum channel. In addition to this quantum link, there are several insecure classical channels that allow QKD algorithms to exchange book-keeping information and send symmetrically encrypted data. The attenuation of photons transmitted through fiber becomes too high to practically generate key material over fiber at distances of more than 100 km. Free-space transmission through the atmosphere or the vacuum of space can reduce attenuation, but at the cost of system complexity and sensitivity to other impairments, such as weather. To extend the effective range of QKD networks, we present a method that combines QKD algorithms with post-quantum, homomorphic key-switching to allow multiple parties to effectively share secret key material over longer distances through semi-trusted relay nodes. We define how such a system should work for arbitrary network topologies and provide proofs that our scheme is both correct and secure. We assess the feasibility of this solution by building and evaluating two implementations based on lattice-based cryptography: learning with errors.

TI When quantum annealing meets multitasking: Potentials, challenges and
   opportunities
SO ARRAY
AB Quantum computers have provided a promising tool for tackling NP hard problems. However, most of the existing work on quantum annealers assumes exclusive access to all resources available in a quantum annealer. This is not resource efficient if a task consumes only a small part of an annealer and leaves the rest wasted. We ask if we can run multiple tasks in parallel or concurrently on an annealer, just like the multitasking capability of a classical general-purpose processor. By far, multitasking is not natively supported by any of the existing annealers. In this paper, we explore Multitasking in Quantum Annealer (QAMT) by identifying the parallelism in a quantum annealer from the aspect of space and time. Based on commercialised quantum annealers from D-Wave, we propose a realisation scheme for QAMT, which packs multiple tasks into a quantum machine instruction (QMI) and uses predefined sampling time to emulate task preemption. We enumerate a few scheduling algorithms that match well with QAMT and discuss the challenges in QAMT. To demonstrate the potential of QAMT, we simulate a quantum annealing system, implement a demo QAMT scheduling algorithm, and evaluate the algorithm. Experimental results suggest that there is great potential in multitasking in quantum annealing.

TI Free-space quantum key distribution during daylight and at night
SO OPTICA
AB Current satellite -based quantum key distribution (QKD) is limited to nighttime operations, and the reliance on microwave communication for key distillation leads to significant delays, often spanning several days. These challenges collectively hinder the establishment of a practical global -scale quantum network. Here, by developing a 625 -MHz inherently robust decoy -state light source and daytime noise suppression close to the Fourier transform limitation, we achieve QKD covering all the 24 h of the day over a 20 -km terrestrial free -space channel, resulting in an average secure key rate of approximately 495 bps. Additionally, bidirectional laser communication is integrated into the QKD transmitter and the ground station to enable real-time key distillation, improving the timeliness from days to real time. This comprehensive verification lays a solid foundation and paves the way for all -day real-time QKD with quantum satellites.

TI Advantages of Fixing Spins in Quantum Annealing
SO JOURNAL OF THE PHYSICAL SOCIETY OF JAPAN
AB Quantum annealing can efficiently obtain solutions to combinatorial optimization problems. Size-reduction methods are used to treat large-scale combinatorial optimization problems that cannot be input directly into a quantum annealer because of its size limitation. Various size-reduction methods using fi xing spins have been proposed as quantum- classical hybrid methods to obtain solutions. However, the high performance of these hybrid methods is yet to be clearly elucidated. In this study, we adopted a parameterized fi xing spins method to verify the effects of fi xing spins. The results revealed that setting the appropriate number of spins of the subproblem is crucial for obtaining a satisfactory solution, and the energy gap expansion is confirmed after fi xing spins.

In order to enable quantum systems in arid and desertified areas to work almost under all-weather condition, it is necessary to study the attenuation of free-space quantum signal transmission and the influence of the turbulence atmosphere carrying sand and dust on communication performance. Using Mie scattering theory, multiple scattering simulation method, and atmospheric turbulence theory, the attenuation of optical wave transmission in sand and dust turbulent atmospheric channels with different visibility, and the influence of multiple scattering and turbulence on attenuation are studied. The results show that the effect of multiple scattering increases with the decrease of visibility, the turbulence effect gradually strengthens with the increase of distance. According to the quantum amplitude damped channel model, the effects of multiple scattering and turbulence in the sand and dust turbulent atmosphere with different visibility on the quantum channel capacity, fidelity and bit error rate are analyzed. The results show that as the visibility decreases, the multiple scattering effect increases, resulting in the decrease of attenuation and bit error rate, but an increase in channel capacity, fidelity and the boundaries of security key rate. The existence of turbulence in the dust atmosphere will increase the attenuation and bit error rate, but reduce the channel capacity, fidelity and security key rate. It can be seen that the influence of multiple scattering and turbulence on the communication performance, when the visibility of the sand and dust atmosphere are both low, cannot be ignored. In practical applications, the relevant parameters of quantum communication should be adaptively adjusted according to the visibility and turbulence intensity to improve the probability, efficiency and reliability of quantum communication.

TI Room-temperature single-photon source with near-millisecond built-in
   memory
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Non-classical photon sources are a crucial resource for distributed quantum networks. Photons generated from matter systems with memory capability are particularly promising, as they can be integrated into a network where each source is used on-demand. Among all kinds of solid state and atomic quantum memories, room-temperature atomic vapours are especially attractive due to their robustness and potential scalability. To-date room-temperature photon sources have been limited either in their memory time or the purity of the photonic state. Here we demonstrate a single-photon source based on room-temperature memory. Following heralded loading of the memory, a single photon is retrieved from it after a variable storage time. The single-photon character of the retrieved field is validated by the strong suppression of the two-photon component with antibunching as low as g(RR|W=1)((2)) = 0:20 +/- 0:07. Non-classical correlations between the heralding and the retrieved photons are maintained for up to tau(R)(NC) = (0:68 +/- 0:08) ms, more than two orders of magnitude longer than previously demonstrated with other room-temperature systems. Correlations sufficient for violating Bell inequalities exist for up to tau(BI) = (0.15 +/- 0.03) ms.

TI Entangled Optical Quantum Imaging Method Based on Two-Step Coincidence
   Counting
SO ACTA OPTICA SINICA
AB Objective Classical optical imaging requires that the light source, object, imaging lens, and imaging plane are in a collinear position, and the first-order correlation property of the light field is employed to obtain the object information for imaging. Different from classical optical imaging, quantum imaging divides the imaging optical path into the signal optical path and the reference optical path and separates the process into the detection process and imaging process, which can complete imaging in the case that classical optical imaging cannot be achieved. As an important development field of quantum information science, quantum precision measurement studies how to utilize quantum effects to measure physical quantities. Compared with traditional measurement techniques, quantum precision measurement has more advantages in measurement accuracy, sensitivity, and security. In the medical and aerospace fields, it has caught widespread attention in China and abroad, with great development potential. Although quantum imaging is based on photon arrival time series received on signal and reference optical paths for coincidence measurement or intensity correlation to achieve imaging, with strong anti- interference ability compared with classical optical imaging, there are still some problems. In the reference optical path, it is necessary to adopt digital micromirror device (DMD) for two- dimensional spatial scanning to obtain spatial information. Pixel-by- pixel scanning is required to obtain accurate coincidence values, which limits imaging efficiency. To improve the efficiency of entangled optical quantum imaging, our study adopts the two-step coincidence counting method to quickly obtain target imaging information and reduce the time overhead of entangled optical quantum imaging.
   Methods First, the pump light generated by the laser is modulated by the combination of the lens and wave plate to improve the efficiency of spontaneous parametric down-conversion of the periodically poled KTiOPO4 (PPKTP) crystal. Second, the ranging region is selected by the DMD to construct the difference value of the single-photon time pulse sequence. Third, this difference value is leveraged to complete local coincidence counting to obtain the time difference between signal and reference optical paths. Fourth, by controlling the DMD, the imaging region is selected; the single-photon time pulse sequence is corrected, and then global coincidence counting is completed by this corrected sequence. Finally, the quantum image of the target is obtained by mapping the coincidence counting value into the gray value.
   Results and Discussions As the distance between the light source and the target increases, the image quality decreases (Figs. 4 and 5). Although the imaging quality of the proposed method is slightly lower than that of the classical quantum imaging method, the required imaging time overhead is significantly reduced. The average imaging time overhead of the classical quantum imaging method is 179. 1807 s, while that of our method is only 0. 2412 s. Our method can significantly improve imaging efficiency and obtain the distance between the light source and the target, and the corresponding average ranging error is 0. 039 m ( Table 1). With the increasing ranging area size, the imaging quality improves. When the ranging region is greater than 16 pixelx16 pixel, the imaging quality of our proposed method is better than that of the classical quantum imaging method. The main reason is that the classical quantum imaging method only employs the photon information of a single pixel position to estimate the delay difference, while our method processes the photon information of all pixels in the ranging region. The increase in photon information can obtain more accurate coincidence values and better imaging quality ( Figs. 6 and 7). Compared with the imaging time overhead of the classical quantum imaging method (with an average imaging time overhead of 180. 1317 s), the imaging efficiency of our method is significantly improved (with an average imaging time overhead of 1. 1326 s), and meanwhile, accurate target ranging can be achieved spontaneously (Table 2). With the rising single pixel exposure time ( SPET), the number of photons received at each pixel increases, and then more accurate coincidence values can be obtained. When SPET are 1, 2, and 3 s, the PSNRs of the proposed method are 4. 2914, 14. 6427, and 17. 8427 respectively, while the PSNRs of the classical quantum imaging method are 3. 1075, 12. 8154, and 17. 7154 respectively. As the SPET increases, the image quality also improves (Table 3). In addition, a real optical path is built to conduct actual experiments based on the above simulation analysis. The associated results are shown in Table 4, Table 5, and Table 6, and are consistent with simulation results.
   Conclusions A new entangled optical quantum imaging method based on two-step coincidence counting is proposed. This method adaptively acquires and corrects the delay difference between signal and reference optical paths when the target location is unknown to obtain more accurate coincidence values and realize quantum imaging and distance estimation of the target. Compared with the classical quantum imaging method that corrects coincidence counting for each pixel, the proposed method employs the DMD to select local areas for coincidence counting and then utilizes the delay difference obtained during the imaging to correct the photon arrival time series. This method can reduce repeated operations in the classical quantum imaging method and improve the imaging speed on the premise of ensuring certain imaging quality. In addition, with the decreasing distance between the light source and the target and the increasing ranging area, the imaging quality can be effectively improved. Furthermore, an actual quantum imaging optical path is built, and the corresponding experimental results are consistent with simulation results, verifying the effectiveness of the proposed method.

TI Multicomponent Unitary Coupled Cluster and Equation-of-Motion for
   Quantum Computation
SO JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL THEORY AND COMPUTATION
AB The variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) algorithm combined with the unitary coupled cluster (UCC) ansatz has been developed for the quantum computation of molecular energies and wave functions within the Born-Oppenheimer approximation. Herein, this approach is extended to multicomponent systems to enable the quantum mechanical treatment of more than one type of particle, such as electrons and positrons or electrons and nuclei, without invoking the Born-Oppenheimer approximation. Specifically, we introduce the multicomponent unitary coupled cluster (mcUCC) method combined with the VQE algorithm for the calculation of ground-state energies and wave functions as well as the multicomponent equation-of-motion (mcEOM) method for the calculation of excitation energies. These methods are developed within the nuclear-electronic orbital (NEO) framework and are formulated in the qubit basis to enable implementations on quantum computers. Moreover, these methods are used to calculate the ground-state energy and excitation energies of positronium hydride, where both electrons and the positron are treated quantum mechanically, as well as the H-2 molecule, where both electrons and one proton are treated quantum mechanically. These applications validate the implementation and provide benchmark data for future calculations. The errors due to Trotterization of the mcUCC ansatz are also analyzed. This formalism, as well as the accompanying computer code, will serve as the basis for applications to more complex multicomponent systems, such as simulations of photoinduced nonadiabatic molecular processes, on both classical and quantum computers.

TI Quantum algorithm for polaritonic chemistry based on an exact ansatz
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Cavity-modified chemistry uses strong light-matter interactions to modify the electronic properties of molecules in order to enable new physical phenomena such as novel reaction pathways. As cavity chemistry often involves critical regions where configurations become nearly degenerate, the ability to treat multireference problems is crucial to understanding polaritonic systems. In this Letter, we show through the use of a unitary ansatz derived from the anti-Hermitian contracted Schr & ouml;dinger equation that cavity-modified systems with strong correlation, such as the deformation of rectangular H4 coupled to a cavity mode, can be solved efficiently and accurately on a quantum device. In contrast, while our quantum algorithm can be made formally exact, classical-computing methods as well as other quantum-computing algorithms often yield answers that are both quantitatively and qualitatively incorrect. Additionally, we demonstrate the current feasibility of the algorithm on near intermediate-scale quantum hardware by computing the dissociation curve of H2 strongly coupled to a bosonic bath.

TI Deep unfolded local quantum annealing
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Local quantum annealing (LQA), an iterative algorithm, is designed to solve combinatorial optimization problems. It draws inspiration from QA, which utilizes adiabatic time evolution to determine the global minimum of a given objective function. In the original LQA, the classical Hamiltonian is minimized via gradient descent. The performance of LQA depends on the choice of the parameters. Owing to the nonconvex nature of the original cost function, LQA often becomes trapped in local minima, limiting its effectiveness. To address this challenge, we combine LQA with a deep unfolding scheme, which enables us to tune the parameters from the training data via back-propagation. As a demonstration, we apply the deep unfolded LQA to the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model, which is a fundamental model in statistical physics. Our findings exhibit that deep unfolded LQA outperforms the original LQA, exhibiting remarkable convergence speed and performance improvement. As the trained parameters can be generalized to unknown instances and different system sizes, our results have significant practical implications and provide valuable insights for real-world applications.

TI Harnessing hybrid frequency-entangled qudits through quantum
   interference
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB High-dimensional (HD) quantum entanglement expands the Hilbert space, offering a robust framework for quantum information processing with enhanced capacity and error resilience. In this work, we present an HD frequency-domain entangled state, the hybrid frequency-entangled qudit (HFEQ), generated via Hong-OuMandel (HOM) interference, exhibiting both discrete-variable (DV) and continuous-variable (CV) characteristics in the frequency domain. By tuning HOM interference, we generate and control HFEQs with dimensions D = 5, 7, 9, and 11, confirming their DV nature. Franson interferometry verifies global frequency correlations with a visibility of 97.6 +/- 0.6% and CV entanglement within individual frequency modes with a visibility exceeding 95%. Furthermore, based on the developed theoretical model, the generated HFEQs exhibit a Schmidt number that exceeds the upper bound D of conventional frequency-entangled qudits, certifying additional entanglement inherent to the hybrid structure. Our findings provide deeper insight into the physical nature of frequency-entangled qudits generated by quantum interference and introduce a resource for HD time-frequency quantum information processing.

TI Single-qubit universal classifier implemented on an ion-trap quantum
   device
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Quantum computers can provide solutions to certain classically intractable problems. However, current devices have limited computational resources, and an effort is made to develop useful quantum algorithms under this constraint. This work demonstrates experimentally that a single-qubit processor can host a universal classifier based on the re-uploading scheme. The quantum processor used in this work is built with an ion trap, providing highly accurate control on a one-qubit system as required by the re-uploading scheme. A set of nontrivial classification tasks are completed successfully. The training procedure is performed in two steps combining simulation and experiment. Final results are benchmarked against exact simulations of the same method and also classical algorithms, showing a competitive performance of the ion-trap quantum classifier. This work constitutes the experimental implementation of a classification algorithm based on the re-uploading scheme.

TI Simulating unsteady flows on a superconducting quantum processor
SO COMMUNICATIONS PHYSICS
AB Recent advancements of quantum technologies have triggered tremendous interest in exploring practical quantum advantage. The simulation of fluid dynamics, a highly challenging problem in classical physics but vital for practical applications, emerges as a potential direction. Here, we report an experiment on the digital simulation of unsteady flows with a superconducting quantum processor. The quantum algorithm is based on the Hamiltonian simulation using the hydrodynamic formulation of the Schr & ouml;dinger equation. With the median fidelities of 99.97% and 99.67% for parallel single- and two-qubit gates respectively, we simulate the dynamics of a two-dimensional (2D) compressible diverging flow and a 2D decaying vortex with ten qubits. Note that the former case is an inviscid potential flow, and the latter one is an artificial vortical flow with an external body force. The experimental results well capture the temporal evolution of averaged density and momentum profiles, and qualitatively reproduce spatial flow fields with moderate noises. This work demonstrates the potential of quantum computing in simulating more complex flows, such as turbulence, for practical applications.
   Fluid dynamics simulation, a complex challenge in classical physics, is relevant for real-world applications and highlights the potential of quantum computing. The authors report an experiment for the digital simulation of unsteady flows on a superconducting quantum processor, and show that the results effectively capture the evolution of flow fields.

TI Quantum Annealing Sampling with a Bias Field
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB The presence of a bias field, encoding some information about a target state, can enhance the performance of quantum optimization methods. Here we investigate the effect of such a bias field on the outcome of quantum annealing sampling, with the example of the exact cover problem. The sampling is carried out on a D-Wave machine, and different bias configurations are benchmarked against the unbiased sampling procedure. It is found that the biased annealing algorithm works particularly well for larger problem sizes, where the Hamming distance between bias and target configuration becomes less important. This work motivates future research efforts for finding good bias configurations, either on the quantum machine itself or in a hybrid fashion via classical algorithms.

TI Quantum simulation of the phase transition of the massive Thirring model
SO JOURNAL OF HIGH ENERGY PHYSICS
AB Recent advancements in quantum computing technology have enabled the study of fermionic systems at finite temperature via quantum simulations. This presents a novel approach to investigating the chiral phase transition in such systems. Among these, the quantum minimally entangled typical thermal states (QMETTS) algorithm has recently attracted considerable interest. The massive Thirring model, which exhibits a variety of phenomena at low temperatures, includes both a chiral phase transition and a topologically non-trivial ground state. It therefore raises the intriguing question of whether its phase transition can be studied using a quantum simulation approach. In this study, the chiral phase transition of the massive Thirring model and its dual topological phase transition are studied using the QMETTS algorithm. Numerical results are obtained on a classical computer simulating circuit-based quantum computations. The results show that QMETTS is able to accurately reproduce the phase transition and thermodynamic properties of the massive Thirring model.

TI Quantum annealing with special drivers for circuit fault diagnostics
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB We present a very general construction for quantum annealing protocols to solve Combinational Circuit Fault Diagnosis problems that restricts the evolution to the space of valid diagnoses. This is accomplished by using special local drivers that induce a transition graph on the space of feasible configurations that is regular and instance independent for each given circuit topology. Analysis of small instances shows that the energy gap has a generic form, and that the minimum gap occurs in the last third of the evolution. We used these features to construct an improved annealing schedule and benchmarked its performance through closed system simulations. We found that degeneracy can help the performance of quantum annealing, especially for instances with a higher number of faults in their minimum fault diagnosis. This contrasts with the performance of classical approaches based on brute force search that are used in industry for large scale circuits.

TI Efficient Quantum Secure Vector Dominance and Its Applications in
   Computational Geometry
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON COMPUTERS
AB Secure vector dominance is a key cryptographic primitive in secure computational geometry (SCG), determining the dominance relationship of vectors between two participants without revealing their private information. However, the security of traditional SVD protocols is compromised by the formidable computational power of quantum computing, and their efficiency needs further improvement. To address these challenges, an efficient quantum secure vector dominance (QSVD) protocol is proposed. Specifically, we first introduce a quantum private permutation (QPP) subprotocol to shuffle the elements of each participant's private input vector. To further facilitate secure data comparison, we propose an enhanced quantum millionaire subprotocol with equality determination functionality, building upon Jia's original protocol. Based on the above two subprotocols, we propose a QSVD protocol with polynomial complexity, deriving vector dominance in a single interaction with a semi-honest third party. Performance analyses confirm that QSVD protocol is correct, resilient against malicious attacks, and retains polynomial computational complexity, ensuring both security and efficiency. To demonstrate the scalability of the QSVD protocol, we illustrate its applications in several geometric computation problems, such as point-line inclusion determination, line-line intersect determination, and point-in-polygon determination. Finally, we validate the feasibility of our protocol by conducting comprehensive simulations on IBM's Qiskit platform, demonstrating its practical applicability and effectiveness in real quantum computing environments.

AB In the near term, programming quantum computers will remain severely limited by low quantum volumes. Therefore, it is desirable to implement quantum circuits with the fewest resources possible. For the common Clifford+T circuits, most research is focused on reducing the number of T gates, since they are an order of magnitude more expensive than Clifford gates in quantum error corrected encoding schemes. However, this optimization sometimes leads to more 2-qubit gates, which, even though they are less expensive in terms of fault-tolerance, contribute significantly to the overall circuit cost. Approaches based on the ZX-calculus have recently gained some popularity in the field, but reduction of 2-qubit gates is not their focus. In this work, we present an alternative for improving 2-qubit gate count of a quantum circuit with the ZX-calculus by using heuristics in ZX-diagram simplification. Our approach maintains the good reduction of the T gate count provided by other strategies based on ZX-calculus, thus serving as an extension for other optimization algorithms. Our results show that combining the available ZX-calculus-based optimizations with our algorithms can reduce the number of 2-qubit gates by as much as 40 % compared to current approaches using ZXcalculus. Additionally, we improve the results of the best currently available optimization technique of Nam et. al [22] for some circuits by up to 15 %.

TI Privately Generated Key Pairs for Post Quantum Cryptography in a
   Distributed Network
SO APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
AB In the proposed protocol, a trusted entity interacts with the terminal device of each user to verify the legitimacy of the public keys without having access to the private keys that are generated and kept totally secret by the user. The protocol introduces challenge-response-pair mechanisms enabling the generation, distribution, and verification of cryptographic public-private key pairs in a distributed network with multi-factor authentication, tokens, and template-less biometry. While protocols using generic digital signature algorithms are proposed, the focus of the experimental work was to implement a solution based on Crystals-Dilithium, a post-quantum cryptographic algorithm under standardization. Crystals-Dilithium generates public keys consisting of two interrelated parts, a matrix generating seed, and a vector computed from the matrix and two randomly picked vectors forming the secret key. We show how such a split of the public keys lends itself to a two-way authentication of both the trusted entity and the users.

TI Assessing the performance of quantum annealing with nonlinear driving
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Current-generation quantum annealers have already proven to be successful problem solvers. Yet quantum annealing is still very much in its infancy, with suboptimal applicability. For instance, to date it is still an open question which annealing protocol causes the fewest diabatic excitations for a given eigenspectrum, and even whether there is a universally optimal strategy. Therefore, in this paper, we report analytical and numerical studies of the diabatic excitations arising from nonlinear protocols applied to the transverse field Ising chain, the exactly solvable model that serves as a quantum annealing playground. Our analysis focuses on several driving schemes that inhibit or facilitate the dynamic phases discussed in a previous work. Rather remarkably, we find that the paradigmatic Kibble-Zurek behavior can be suppressed with ???pauses??? in the evolution, both for crossing and for stopping at the quantum critical point of the system.

TI Universal control of a bosonic mode via drive-activated native cubic
   interactions
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Linear bosonic modes offer a hardware-efficient alternative for quantum information processing but require access to some nonlinearity for universal control. The lack of nonlinearity in photonics has led to encoded measurement-based quantum computing, which relies on linear operations but requires access to resourceful ('nonlinear') quantum states, such as cubic phase states. In contrast, superconducting microwave circuits offer engineerable nonlinearities but suffer from static Kerr nonlinearity. Here, we demonstrate universal control of a bosonic mode composed of a superconducting nonlinear asymmetric inductive element (SNAIL) resonator, enabled by native nonlinearities in the SNAIL element. We suppress static nonlinearities by operating the SNAIL in the vicinity of its Kerr-free point and dynamically activate nonlinearities up to third order by fast flux pulses. We experimentally realize a universal set of generalized squeezing operations, as well as the cubic phase gate, and exploit them to deterministically prepare a cubic phase state in 60 ns. Our results initiate the experimental field of polynomial quantum computing, in the continuous-variables notion originally introduced by Lloyd and Braunstein.
   Manipulating quantum information encoded in a bosonic mode requires sizeable and controllable nonlinearities, but superconducting devices' strong nonlinearities are normally static. Here, the authors use a SNAIL to suppress static nonlinearities and use drive-dependent ones to reach universal control of a bosonic mode.

AB In the present manuscript, we introduce a quantum system of two superconducting qubits (S-Qs) interacting with a quantized field under the influence of the Kerr nonlinear medium and Ising interaction. We formulate the Hamiltonian of the quantum model and determine the density operator of whole quantum system as well as quantum subsystems. We examine the dynamics of the quantumness measures for subsequent times including the S-Qs entanglement, S-Qs-field entanglement and quantum Fisher information in relation to the system parameters. Finally, we display the connection among the measures of quantumness during the time evolution.

TI Quantum simulation of second-quantized Hamiltonians in compact encoding
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We describe methods for simulating general second-quantized Hamiltonians using the compact encoding, in which qubit states encode only the occupied modes in physical occupation number basis states. These methods apply to second-quantized Hamiltonians composed of a constant number of interactions, i.e., linear combinations of ladder operator monomials of fixed form. Compact encoding leads to qubit requirements that are optimal up to logarithmic factors. We show how to use sparse Hamiltonian simulation methods for second-quantized Hamiltonians in compact encoding, give explicit implementations for the required oracles, and analyze the methods. We also describe several example applications including the free boson and fermion theories, the phi(4)-theory, and the massive Yukawa model, all in both equal-time and light-front quantization. Our methods provide a general-purpose tool for simulating second-quantized Hamiltonians, with optimal or near-optimal scaling with error and model parameters.

TI Software techniques for training restricted Boltzmann machines on
   size-constrained quantum annealing hardware
SO FRONTIERS IN COMPUTER SCIENCE
AB Restricted Boltzmann machines are common machine learning models that can utilize quantum annealing devices in their training processes as quantum samplers. While this approach has shown promise as an alternative to classical sampling methods, the limitations of quantum annealing hardware, such as the number of qubits and the lack of connectivity between the qubits, still pose a barrier to wide-scale adoption. We propose the use of multiple software techniques such as dropout method, passive labeling, and parallelization techniques for addressing these hardware limitations. The study found that using these techniques along with quantum sampling showed comparable results to its classical counterparts in certain contexts, while in others the increased complexity of the sampling process hindered the performance of the trained models. This means that further research into the behavior of quantum sampling needs to be done to apply quantum annealing to training tasks of more complicated RBM models.

AB Quantum computing has shown great potential to revolutionize traditional computing and can provide an exponential speedup for a wide range of possible applications, attracting various stakeholders. However, understanding fundamental quantum computing concepts remains a significant challenge for novices because of their abstract and counterintuitive nature. Thus, we propose an analogy-based characterization framework to construct the mental mapping between quantum computing concepts and daily objects, informed by in-depth expert interviews and a literature review, covering key quantum concepts and characteristics like number of qubits, output state duality, quantum concept type, and probability quantification. Then, we developed an AR-based prototype system, Intuit, using situated analytics to explain quantum concepts through daily objects and phenomena (e.g., rotating coins, paper cutters). We thoroughly evaluated our approach through in-depth user and expert interviews. The Results demonstrate the effectiveness and usability of Intuit in helping learners understand abstract concepts in an intuitive and engaging manner.

TI mRLWE-CP-ABE: A revocable CP-ABE for post-quantum
   cryptography
SO JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL CRYPTOLOGY
AB We address the problem of user fast revocation in the lattice-based Ciphertext Policy Attribute-Based Encryption (CP-ABE) by extending the scheme originally introduced by Zhang and Zhang [Zhang J, Zhang Z. A ciphertext policy attribute-based encryption scheme without pairings. In: International Conference on Information Security and Cryptology. Springer; 2011. p. 324-40. doi: https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-34704-7_23.]. While a lot of work exists on the construction of revocable schemes for CP-ABE based on pairings, works based on lattices are not so common, and - to the best of our knowledge - we introduce the first server-aided revocation scheme in a lattice-based CP-ABE scheme, hence being embedded in a post-quantum secure environment. In particular, we rely on semi-trusted "mediators" to provide a multi-step decryption capable of handling mediation without re-encryption. We comment on the scheme and its application, and we provide performance experiments on a prototype implementation in the Attribute-Based Encryption spin-off library of Palisade to evaluate the overhead compared with the original scheme.

TI Enhancing Security of Error Correction in Quantum Key Distribution Using
   Tree Parity Machine Update Rule Randomization
SO APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
AB This paper presents a novel approach to enhancing the security of error correction in quantum key distribution by introducing randomization into the update rule of Tree Parity Machines. Two dynamic update algorithms-dynamic_rows and dynamic_matrix-are proposed and tested. These algorithms select the update rule quasi-randomly based on the input vector, reducing the effectiveness of synchronization-based attacks. A series of simulations were conducted to evaluate the security implications under various configurations, including different values of K, N, and L parameters of neural networks. The results demonstrate that the proposed dynamic algorithms can significantly reduce the attacker's synchronization success rate without requiring additional communication overhead. Both proposed solutions outperformed hebbian, an update rule-based synchronization method utilizing the percentage of attackers synchronization. It has also been shown that when the attacker chooses their update rule randomly, the dynamic approaches work better compared to random walk rule-based synchronization, and that in most cases it is more profitable to use dynamic update rules when an attacker is using random walk. This study contributes to improving QKD's robustness by introducing adaptive neural-based error correction mechanisms.

TI A universal variational quantum eigensolver for non-Hermitian systems
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Many quantum algorithms are developed to evaluate eigenvalues for Hermitian matrices. However, few practical approach exists for the eigenanalysis of non-Hermintian ones, such as arising from modern power systems. The main difficulty lies in the fact that, as the eigenvector matrix of a general matrix can be non-unitary, solving a general eigenvalue problem is inherently incompatible with existing unitary-gate-based quantum methods. To fill this gap, this paper introduces a Variational Quantum Universal Eigensolver (VQUE), which is deployable on noisy intermediate scale quantum computers. Our new contributions include: (1) The first universal variational quantum algorithm capable of evaluating the eigenvalues of non-Hermitian matrices-Inspired by Schur's triangularization theory, VQUE unitarizes the eigenvalue problem to a procedure of searching unitary transformation matrices via quantum devices; (2) A Quantum Process Snapshot technique is devised to make VQUE maintain the potential quantum advantage inherited from the original variational quantum eigensolver-With additional O(log(2)N) quantum gates, this method efficiently identifies whether a unitary operator is triangular with respect to a given basis; (3) Successful deployment and validation of VQUE on a real noisy quantum computer, which demonstrates the algorithm's feasibility. We also undertake a comprehensive parametric study to validate VQUE's scalability, generality, and performance in realistic applications.

TI Quantum correlation between a qubit and a relativistic boson in an
   expanding spacetime
SO CLASSICAL AND QUANTUM GRAVITY
AB We use the quantum correlation of both logarithmic negativity and mutual information between a qubit and a relativistic boson to analyze the dynamics of Universe expansion. These dynamical quantum correlations can encode the information about underlying spacetime structure, which suggests a promising application in observational cosmology. We find that the dynamics of both logarithmic negativity and mutual information between the qubit and the boson are very similar. They decrease monotonically with the growth of the expansion volume and the expansion rate. Smaller momentum and medium-sized mass of boson are more favourable for extracting the information about history of Universe expansion. The quantum correlation between the qubit and the antiboson however has very different behavior: the logarithmic negativity is always zero and the mutual information can be generated through the expansion of Universe. Smaller momentum and medium-sized mass of antiboson are beneficial for the production of mutual information. Finally, the trigger phenomenon and conservation for mutual information are witnessed.

TI Quantum simulation of realistic materials in first quantization using
   non-local pseudopotentials
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB This paper improves and demonstrates the usefulness of the first quantized plane-wave algorithms for the quantum simulation of electronic structure. We describe our quantum algorithm for first quantized simulation that accurately includes pseudopotentials. We focus on the Goedecker-Tetter-Hutter pseudopotential, and despite its complicated form, we block encode the associated operator without significantly increasing the overall cost of quantum simulation. This is surprising since simulating the nuclear potential is much simpler without pseudopotentials, yet is still the bottleneck. We also generalize prior methods to enable the simulation of materials with non-cubic unit cells, which requires nontrivial modifications. Finally, we combine these techniques to estimate block-encoding costs for commercially relevant instances of heterogeneous catalysis (e.g. carbon monoxide adsorption) and compare to the quantum resources needed to simulate materials in second quantization. We conclude that for computational cells with many particles, first quantization often requires meaningfully less spacetime volume.

TI Sumcheck-based delegation of quantum computing to rational server
SO THEORETICAL COMPUTER SCIENCE
AB Delegated quantum computing enables a client with weak computational power to delegate quantum computing to a remote quantum server in such a way that the integrity of the server can be efficiently verified by the client. Recently, a new model of delegated quantum computing has been proposed, namely, rational delegated quantum computing. In this model, after the client interacts with the server, the client pays a reward to the server depending on the server's messages and the client's random bits. The rational server sends messages that maximize the expected value of the reward. It is known that the classical client can delegate universal quantum computing to the rational quantum server in one round. In this paper, we propose novel one-round rational delegated quantum computing protocols by generalizing the classical rational sumcheck protocol. An advantage of our protocols is that they are gate-set independent: the construction of the previous rational protocols depends on gate sets, while our sumcheck technique can be easily realized with any local gate set (each of whose elementary gates can be specified with a polynomial number of bits). Furthermore, as with the previous protocols, our reward function satisfies natural requirements (the reward is non-negative, upper-bounded by a constant, and its maximum expected value is lower-bounded by a constant). We also discuss the reward gap. Simply speaking, the reward gap is a minimum loss on the expected value of the server's reward incurred by the server's behavior that makes the client accept an incorrect answer. The reward gap should therefore be large enough to incentivize the server to behave optimally. Although our sumcheck-based protocols have only exponentially small reward gaps as in the previous protocols, we show that a constant reward gap can be achieved if two noncommunicating but entangled rational servers are allowed. We also discuss whether a single rational server is sufficient under the (widely believed) assumption that the learning-with-errors problem is hard for polynomial-time quantum computing. Apart from these results, we show, under a certain condition, the equivalence between rational and ordinary delegated quantum computing protocols. This equivalence then serves as a basis for a reward-gap amplification method. (C) 2022 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier B.V.

TI Mixed state entanglement classification using artificial neural networks
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB Reliable methods for the classification and quantification of quantum entanglement are fundamental to understanding its exploitation in quantum technologies. One such method, known as separable neural network quantum states (SNNS), employs a neural network inspired parameterization of quantum states whose entanglement properties are explicitly programmable. Combined with generative machine learning methods, this ansatz allows for the study of very specific forms of entanglement which can be used to infer/measure entanglement properties of target quantum states. In this work, we extend the use of SNNS to mixed, multipartite states, providing a versatile and efficient tool for the investigation of intricately entangled quantum systems. We illustrate the effectiveness of our method through a number of examples, such as the computation of novel tripartite entanglement measures, and the approximation of ultimate upper bounds for qudit channel capacities.

Amongst available single-photon detection schemes, superconducting nanowire single photon detectors (SNSPDs) remain the most promising technology for effective on-chip coupling, because they can be seamlessly integrated with a wide range of waveguide materials and substrates and have shown unparalleled performance from visible to the mid-infrared regime. Here, we review different aspects of SNSPDs and schemes for their on-chip integration for different integrated photonics applications. Although mostly concentrated on quantum applications, we also cover some of the important wider photonics applications including imaging, AI and machine learning, and single-photon spectroscopy, and conclude the review with a future outlook discussing emerging research areas enabled by photonic integrated circuits based on SNSPDs.

TI A Computational Framework for Simulations of Dissipative Nonadiabatic
   Dynamics on Hybrid Oscillator-Qubit Quantum Devices
SO JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL THEORY AND COMPUTATION
AB We introduce a computational framework for simulating nonadiabatic vibronic dynamics on circuit quantum electrodynamics (cQED) platforms. Our approach leverages hybrid oscillator-qubit quantum hardware with midcircuit measurements and resets, enabling the incorporation of environmental effects such as dissipation and dephasing. To demonstrate its capabilities, we simulate energy transfer dynamics in a triad model of photosynthetic chromophores inspired by natural antenna systems. We specifically investigate the role of dissipation during the relaxation dynamics following photoexcitation, where electronic transitions are coupled to the evolution of quantum vibrational modes. Our results indicate that hybrid oscillator-qubit devices, operating with noise levels below the intrinsic dissipation rates of typical molecular antenna systems, can achieve the simulation fidelity required for practical computations on near-term and early fault-tolerant quantum computing platforms.

TI Quantum Key Distribution for V2I communications with software-defined
   networking
SO IET QUANTUM COMMUNICATION
AB The evolution of Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) promises improvements in our travel experience and the potential to enhance road safety and reduce environmental impact. This will be utilising highly diverse traffic environments that enable several advanced mobility applications. A secure, efficient, reliable, and resilient communications infrastructure is required to support developments in these CAV systems. Next generation of telecommunication networks will seamlessly integrate terrestrial, satellite, and airborne networks into a single wireless system satisfying the requirements of trustworthy future transport systems. Given the increasing importance of CAVs, coupled with their attractiveness as a cyber-attack for threat agents (e.g., disruption of transportation systems by nation states), security is paramount. Future communications systems offer an opportunity to integrate Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) into vehicular environments, protecting against advances in quantum computation that render many of the classical algorithms that underpin Public Key Infrastructure obsolete. This paper proposes a method for the integration of QKD in V2I networks to enable secure data communication. Quantum Key Distribution is used in the end-to-end path of vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) networks. Furthermore, an overarching Software-Defined Network, with integrated QKD, is introduced. We have investigated the security performance of QKD in a V2I network over an urban environment.

TI Δ-Quantum machine-learning for medicinal chemistry
SO PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY CHEMICAL PHYSICS
AB Many molecular design tasks benefit from fast and accurate calculations of quantum-mechanical (QM) properties. However, the computational cost of QM methods applied to drug-like molecules currently renders large-scale applications of quantum chemistry challenging. Aiming to mitigate this problem, we developed DelFTa, an open-source toolbox for the prediction of electronic properties of drug-like molecules at the density functional (DFT) level of theory, using Delta-machine-learning. Delta-Learning corrects the prediction error (Delta) of a fast but inaccurate property calculation. DelFTa employs state-of-the-art three-dimensional message-passing neural networks trained on a large dataset of QM properties. It provides access to a wide array of quantum observables on the molecular, atomic and bond levels by predicting approximations to DFT values from a low-cost semiempirical baseline. Delta-Learning outperformed its direct-learning counterpart for most of the considered QM endpoints. The results suggest that predictions for non-covalent intra- and intermolecular interactions can be extrapolated to larger biomolecular systems. The software is fully open-sourced and features documented command-line and Python APIs.

TI Decomposing the generalized Toffoli gate with qutrits
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB The problem of finding efficient decompositions of multiqubit gates is of importance for quantum computing, especially, in application to existing noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices, whose resources are substantially limited. Here we propose a decomposition scheme for a generalized N-qubit Toffoli gate with the use of 2N - 3 two-qutrit gates for arbitrary connectivity. The fixed number of the required additional levels (the choice of qutrits is optimal) and the use of the iSWAP gate as a native operation make our approach directly applicable for ongoing experiments with superconducting quantum processors. Specifically, we present a blueprint of the realization of the proposed scheme for the Aspen-9 processor supporting quantum operations with qutrits.

TI Anti-Loss Characteristics of Continuous-Variable All-Optical
   Entanglement Swapping (Invited)
SO LASER & OPTOELECTRONICS PROGRESS
AB Quantum entanglement swapping plays a crucial role in quantum communication by enabling entanglement establishment between two particles that have never directly interacted. For bipartite continuous-variable system, the entanglement characteristics are typically witnessed by the positivity under the partial transposition (PPT) criterion. The entanglement degree is inversely related to the smallest symplectic eigenvalue of covariance matrices-smaller values indicate stronger entanglement. This study theoretically investigates the impact of optical loss on all-optical entanglement swapping by introducing vacuum fields through beam splitters placed in light beam transmission paths to simulate experimental losses. Through theoretical calculations, we found that the all-optical channel between Claire and Bob of all-optical entanglement swapping is highly loss resistant. This work is of great significance for promoting the practical application of all-optical entanglement swapping in quantum network construction.

TI Optimal quantum discrimination of single-qubit unitary gates between two
   candidates
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We analyze a discrimination problem of a single-qubit unitary gate with two candidates, where the candidates are not provided with their classical description, but their quantum sample is. More precisely, there are three unitary quantum gates-one target and one sample for each of the two candidates-whose classical description is unknown except for their dimension. The target gate is chosen equally among the candidates. We obtain the optimal protocol that maximizes the expected success probability, assuming the Haar distribution for the candidates. This problem is originally introduced in Ref. [5] which provides a protocol achieving 7/8 in the expected success probability based on the "unitary comparison" protocol of Ref. [6]. The optimality of the protocol has been an open question since then. We prove the optimality of the comparison protocol, implying that only one of the two samples (one for each candidate) is needed to achieve an optimal discrimination. The optimization includes protocols outside the scope of quantum testers due to the dynamic ordering of the sample and target gates within a given protocol.

TI Quantum Entanglement from Classical Trajectories
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB A long-standing challenge in mixed quantum-classical trajectory simulations is the treatment of entanglement between the classical and quantal degrees of freedom. We present a novel approach that describes the emergence of entangled states entirely in terms of independent and deterministic Ehrenfest-like classical trajectories. For a two-level quantum system in a classical environment, this is derived by mapping the quantum system onto a path-integral representation of a spin 1/2. We demonstrate that the method correctly accounts for coherence and decoherence and thus reproduces the splitting of a wave packet in a nonadiabatic scattering problem. This discovery opens up a new class of simulations as an alternative to stochastic surface-hopping, coupled-trajectory, or semiclassical approaches.

TI Nonstabilizerness in kinetically constrained Rydberg atom arrays
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB Nonstabilizer states are a fundamental resource for universal quantum computation. However, despite broad significance in quantum computing, the emergence of many-body nonstabilizerness in interacting quantum systems remains poorly understood due to its analytical intractability. Here we show that Rydberg atom arrays provide a natural reservoir of nonstabilizerness that extends beyond single qubits and arises from quantum correlations generated by the Rydberg blockade. We demonstrate that this nonstabilizerness can be experimentally accessed using two complementary methods, either performing quench dynamics or via adiabatic ground state preparation. Using the analytical framework based on matrix product states, we explain the origin of Rydberg nonstabilizerness via a quantum circuit decomposition of the wave function.

TI A parameterized quantum circuit for estimating distribution measures
SO QUANTUM MACHINE INTELLIGENCE
AB Quantum computing is a new and exciting field with the potential to solve some of the world's most challenging problems. Currently, with the rise of quantum computers, the main challenge is the creation of quantum algorithms (under the limitations of quantum physics) and making them accessible to scientists who are not physicists. This study presents a parametrized quantum circuit and its implementation in estimating the distribution measures for discrete value vectors. Various applications can be derived from this method, including information analysis, exploratory data analysis, and machine learning algorithms. This method is unique in providing access to quantum computation and enabling users to run it without prior knowledge of quantum physics. The proposed method was implemented and tested over a dataset and five discrete value distributions with different parameters. The results showed a high level of agreement between the classical computation and the proposed method using quantum computing. The maximum error obtained for the dataset was 5.996%, while for the discrete distributions, a maximum error of 5% was obtained.

TI Efficient Characterization of Quantum Evolutions via a Recommender
   System
SO QUANTUM
AB We demonstrate characterizing quantum evolutions via matrix factorization algorithm, a particular type of the recommender system (RS). A system undergoing a quantum evolution can be characterized in several ways. Here we choose (i) quantum correlations quantified by measures such as entropy, negativity, or discord, and (ii) state-fidelity. Using quantum registers with up to 10 qubits, we demonstrate that an RS can efficiently characterize both unitary and nonunitary evolutions. After carrying out a detailed performance-analysis of the RS in two-qubits, we show that it can be used to distinguish a clean database of quantum correlations from a noisy or a fake one. Moreover, we find that the RS brings about a significant computational advantage for building a large database of quantum discord, for which no simple closed-form expression exists. Also, RS can efficiently characterize systems undergoing nonunitary evolutions in terms of quantum discord reduction as well as state-fidelity. Finally, we utilize RS for the construction of discord phase space in a nonlinear quantum system.

TI Bell Nonlocality Is Not Sufficient for the Security of Standard
   Device-Independent Quantum Key Distribution Protocols
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Device-independent quantum key distribution is a secure quantum cryptographic paradigm that allows two honest users to establish a secret key, while putting minimal trust in their devices. Most of the existing protocols have the following structure: first, a bipartite nonlocal quantum state is distributed between the honest users, who perform local projective measurements to establish nonlocal correlations. Then, they announce the implemented measurements and extract a secure key by postprocessing their measurement outcomes. We show that no protocol of this form allows for establishing a secret key when implemented on any correlation obtained by measuring local projective measurements on certain entangled nonlocal states, namely, on a range of entangled two-qubit Werner states. To prove this result, we introduce a technique for upper bounding the asymptotic key rate of device-independent quantum key distribution protocols, based on a simple eavesdropping attack. Our results imply that either different reconciliation techniques are needed for device-independent quantum key distribution in the large-noise regime, or Bell nonlocality is not sufficient for this task.

TI Variational Quantum Based Simulation of Cylindrical Waveguides
SO IEEE JOURNAL ON MULTISCALE AND MULTIPHYSICS COMPUTATIONAL TECHNIQUES
AB The advent of noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) systems signifies an important stage in quantum computing development. Despite the constraints due to their limited qubit numbers and noise susceptibility, NISQ devices exhibit substantial potential to tackle complex computational challenges via hybrid classical-quantum algorithms. Among the various hybrid algorithms, variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) are gaining increasing attention due to their ability to solve highly complex, large-scale problems where classical algorithms fail. In particular, the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) shows its potential in calculating the energies and ground states of large systems, where the complexity of solving such problems grows exponentially and becomes intractable for classical computers. At this regard, the aim of this paper is to extend the use of VQE for solving circular waveguide modes to verify their applicability to mathematically complex EM problems. In particular, we propose to calculate the fundamental and the some higher order modes for both transverse electric and transverse magnetic cases in circular waveguides. This is mathematically challenging due to the nature of geometry and the associated boundary conditions of circular structures. The results confirm the possibility of applying VQE for mathematically complex EM problems, announcing its potential to scale up and solve high-dimensional, large-scale EM problems where classical algorithms can fail.

TI Optimal Control of Molecular Spin Qudits
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB We demonstrate, numerically, the possibility of manipulating the spin states of molecular nanomagnets with shaped microwave pulses designed with quantum optimal control theory techniques. The stateto-state or full gate transformations can be performed in this way in shorter times than using simple monochromatic resonant pulses. This enhancement in the operation rates can therefore mitigate the effect of decoherence. The optimization protocols and their potential for practical implementations are illustrated by simulations performed for a simple molecular cluster hosting a single Gd3+ ion. Its eight accessible levels (corresponding to a total spin S = 7/2) allow encoding an eight-level qudit or a system of three coupled qubits. All necessary gates required for universal operation can be obtained with optimal pulses using the intrinsic couplings present in this system. The application of optimal control techniques can facilitate the implementation of quantum technologies based on molecular spin qudits.

TI Operator algebra, quantum entanglement, and emergent geometry from
   matrix degrees of freedom
SO JOURNAL OF HIGH ENERGY PHYSICS
AB For matrix model and QFT, we discuss how dual gravitational geometry emerges from matrix degrees of freedom (specifically, adjoint scalars in super Yang-Mills theory) and how operator algebra that describes an arbitrary region of the bulk geometry can be constructed. We pay attention to the subtle difference between the notions of wave packets that describe low-energy excitations: QFT wave packet associated with the spatial dimensions of QFT, matrix wave packet associated with the emergent dimensions from matrix degrees of freedom, and bulk wave packet which is a combination of QFT and matrix wave packets. In QFT, there is an intriguing interplay between QFT wave packet and matrix wave packet that connects quantum entanglement and emergent geometry. We propose that the bulk wave packet is the physical object in QFT that describes the emergent geometry from entanglement. This proposal sets a unified view on two seemingly different mechanisms of holographic emergent geometry: one based on matrix eigenvalues and the other based on quantum entanglement. Further intuition comes from the similarity to a traversable wormhole discussed as the dual description of the coupled SYK model by Maldacena and Qi: the bulk can be seen as an eternal traversable wormhole connecting boundary regions.

TI Tripartite hybrid quantum systems: Skyrmion-mediated quantum
   interactions between single nitrogen-vacancy centers and superconducting
   qubits
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond and superconducting qubits are two promising solid-state quantum systems for quantum science and technology, but the realization of controlled interfaces between individual solid-state spins and superconducting qubits remains fundamentally challenging. Here, we propose and analyze a hybrid quantum system consisting of a magnetic skyrmion, an NV center, and a superconducting qubit, where the solid-state qubits are both positioned in proximity to the skyrmion structure in a thin magnetic disk. We show that it is experimentally feasible to achieve strong (coherent or dissipative) coupling between the NV center and the superconducting qubit by using the quantized gyration mode of the skyrmion as an intermediary. This allows coherent information transfer and nonreciprocal responses between the NV center and the superconducting qubit at the single quantum level with high controllability. The proposed platform provides a scalable pathway for implementing quantum protocols that synergistically exploit the complementary advantages of spin-based quantum memories, microwave-frequency superconducting circuits, and topologically protected magnetic excitations.

TI Minimizing incident response time in real-world scenarios using quantum
   computing
SO SOFTWARE QUALITY JOURNAL
AB The Information Security Management Systems (ISMS) are global and risk-driven processes that allow companies to develop their cybersecurity strategy by defining security policies, valuable assets, controls, and technologies for protecting their systems and information from threats and vulnerabilities. Despite the implementation of such management infrastructures, incidents or security breaches happen. Each incident has associated a level of severity and a set of mitigation controls, so in order to restore the ISMS, the appropriate set of controls to mitigate their damage must be selected. The time in which the ISMS is restored is a critical aspect. In this sense, classic solutions are efficient in resolving scenarios with a moderate number of incidents in a reasonable time, but the response time increases exponentially as the number of incidents increases. This makes classical solutions unsuitable for real scenarios in which a large number of incidents are handled and even less appropriate for scenarios in which security management is offered as a service to several companies. This paper proposes a solution to the incident response problem that acts in a minimal amount of time for real scenarios in which a large number of incidents are handled. It applies quantum computing, as a novel approach that is being successfully applied to real problems, which allows us to obtain solutions in a constant time regardless of the number of incidents handled. To validate the applicability and efficiency of our proposal, it has been applied to real cases using our framework (MARISMA).

TI Temperature field ultrafast detection and identification quantum sensor
   based on diamond array
SO MICROSYSTEMS & NANOENGINEERING
AB Ultrafast temperature field detection and identification is crucial for applications ranging from environmental sensing and biomedical monitoring to thermal management in advanced energy systems. Conventional temperature sensors-comprising discrete sensing arrays, data storage units, and external processors-suffer from high latency due to slow sensor response, repeated analog-to-digital conversions, and extensive data transmission inherent to von Neumann architectures. Here, we report a diamond array-based quantum sensor that integrates temperature sensing and real-time processing within a unified in-sensor computing (ISC) architecture. Exploiting the strong linear correlation between temperature and the zero-field splitting of nitrogen-vacancy (NV) color center centers in diamond, we realize a fixed-frequency temperature sensor with ultrafast response and tunable responsivity, enabled by multi-parameter microwave modulate. Matrix-vector multiplication of temperature intensity and responsivity, combined with Kirchhoff's current summation, enables direct execution of neural-network-style computations on sensed data. The proposed system achieves a single-shot detection and identification latency of just 196.8 mu s, as experimentally validated. This work demonstrates a scalable ISC-enabled quantum sensing paradigm, offering a promising route toward high-speed, low-power intelligent temperature field detection.

TI Two-dimensional gallium phosphide optomechanical crystal in the
   resolved-sideband regime
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Faithful quantum state transfer between telecom photons and microwave frequency mechanical oscillations necessitate a fast conversion rate and low thermal noise. Two-dimensional (2D) optomechanical crystals (OMCs) are favorable candidates that satisfy those requirements. 2D OMCs enable sufficiently high mechanical frequency (1 similar to 10 GHz) to make the resolved-sideband regime achievable, a prerequisite for many quantum protocols. It also supports higher thermal conductance than 1D structures, mitigating the parasitic laser absorption heating. Furthermore, gallium phosphide (GaP) is a promising material choice thanks to its large electronic bandgap of 2.26 eV, which suppresses two-photon absorption, and high refractive index n = 3.05 at the telecom C-band, leading to a high vacuum optomechanical coupling rate. Here, we fabricate and characterize a 2D OMC made of GaP. We realize a high optical Q-factor of 7.9 x 104, corresponding to a linewidth kappa/2 pi = 2.5 GHz at the telecom frequency 195.6 THz. This optical mode couples to several mechanical modes, whose frequencies all exceed the cavity linewidth. The most strongly coupled mode oscillates at 7.7 GHz, more than 3 times the optical linewidth, while achieving a substantial vacuum optomechanical coupling rate g0/2 pi = 450 kHz. This makes the platform a promising candidate for a long-lived, deterministic quantum memory for telecom photons at low temperatures.

TI Implementation of single-qubit measurement-based t-designs using IBM
   processors
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Random unitary matrices sampled from the uniform Haar ensemble have a number of important applications both in cryptography and in the simulation of a variety of fundamental physical systems. Since the Haar ensemble is very expensive to sample, pseudorandom ensembles in the form of t-designs are frequently used as an efficient substitute, and are sufficient for most applications. We investigate t-designs generated using a measurement-based approach on superconducting quantum computers. In particular, we implemented an exact single-qubit 3-design on IBM quantum processors by performing measurements on a 6-qubit graph state. By analysing channel tomography results, we were able to show that the ensemble of unitaries realised was a 1-design, but not a 2-design or a 3-design under the test conditions set, which we show to be a result of depolarising noise during the measurement-based process. We obtained improved results for the 2-design test by implementing an approximate 2-design, in which measurements were performed on a smaller 5-qubit graph state, but the test still did not pass for all states. This suggests that the practical realisation of measurement-based t-designs on superconducting quantum computers will require further work on the reduction of depolarising noise in these devices.

TI Full Software Control on MZI-Based Photonic Integrated Circuit
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB A software platform for quantum computing is required to run a complex algorithm on a real quantum device through automatically converting a quantum circuit level algorithm to a control sequence of target device. Moreover, the software platform must be tailored for the target quantum system by exploiting the properties of qubits and gates. In this work, we show how to implement a software platform for a photonic integrated circuit (PIC) platform with path-encoded photon qubits and quantum gates realized by means of interference in a mesh of tuneable Mach-Zehnder interferometers (MZIs). For universal and programmable quantum computing, the software platform consists of three standard modules: decomposer, mapper, and controller. To verify the software we runs example circuit through software and hardware integration platform and confirm each module generates correct output. Also the validation is done by comparing two results for conventionally used manual way and the software supported automatic way. These two points ensure that the implemented software works correctly when applied to the PIC.

TI Perfect state transfer by means of discrete-time quantum walk on the
   complete bipartite graph
SO PHYSICA SCRIPTA
AB Perfect state transfer has attracted a great deal of attention recently due to its crucial role in quantum communication and scalable quantum computation. In this paper, we propose the perfect state transfer algorithms with a pair of sender-receiver and two pairs of sender-receiver on the complete bipartite graph respectively. The algorithm with a pair of sender-receiver is implemented through discrete-time quantum walk, flexibly setting the coin operators based on the positions of the sender and receiver. The algorithm with two pairs of sender-receiver ensures that the two quantum states are distributed on both sides of the complete bipartite graph during the process, thereby achieving perfect state transfer. In addition, the quantum circuits corresponding to the algorithms are provided. The algorithms can transfer an arbitrary quantum state and can simultaneously transfer two arbitrary quantum states from the senders to the receivers in any case. Moreover, the algorithms are not only applicable to complete bipartite graphs but also to more graph structures with complete bipartite subgraphs, which will provide potential applications for quantum information processing.

TI DRL-based progressive recovery for quantum-key-distribution networks
SO JOURNAL OF OPTICAL COMMUNICATIONS AND NETWORKING
AB With progressive network recovery, operators restore network connectivity after massive failures along multiple stages, by identifying the optimal sequence of repair actions to maximize carried live traffic. Motivated by the initial deployments of quantum-key-distribution (QKD) over optical networks appearing in several locations worldwide, in this work we model and solve the progressive QKD network recovery (PQNR) problem in QKD networks to accelerate the recovery after failures. We formulate an integer linear programming (ILP) model to optimize the achievable accumulative key rates during recovery for four different QKD network architectures, considering different capabilities of using trusted relay and optical bypass. Due to the computational limitations of the ILP model, we propose a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm based on a twin delayed deep deterministic policy gradients (TD3) framework to solve the PQNR problem for large-scale topologies. Simulation results show that our proposed algorithm approaches well compared to the optimal solution and outperforms several baseline algorithms. Moreover, using optical bypass jointly with trusted relay can improve the performance in terms of the key rate by 14% and 18% compared to the cases where only optical bypass and only trusted relay are applied, respectively.

TI In-Network Quantum Computing for Future 6G Networks
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB In light of the imperative for expeditious data processing and enhanced global connectivity, the domain of communication technology is experiencing a rapid progression from the Fifth Generation (5G) to the forthcoming Sixth Generation (6G) within the research community. Furthermore, 6G promises to significantly augment the synergy between the human, digital, and physical realms, thereby necessitating the formulation of novel Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) as well as Key Values Indicators (KVIs), and the assimilation of commensurate technologies. Among these technologies, quantum computing is evolving rapidly due to its inherent advantages from quantum mechanics. Nevertheless, scant attention is directed toward a comprehensive exploration of the consequences attendant to its present-day application. The principal objective of this article resides in its endeavor to underscore, from a compensatory perspective, the convergence of 6G and quantum computing while concurrently considering the Sustainable Development Goals and its KVIs.

TI Quantum Gram-Schmidt processes and their application to efficient state
   readout for quantum algorithms
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Many quantum algorithms that claim speedup over their classical counterparts only generates quantum states as solutions instead of their final classical description. The additional step to decode quantum states into classical vectors normally will destroy the quantum advantage in most scenarios because all existing tomographic methods require runtime that is polynomial with respect to the state dimension. In this work, we present an efficient readout protocol that yields the classical vector form of the generated state, so it will achieve the end-to-end advantage for those quantum algorithms. Our protocol suits the case in which the output state lies in the row space of the input matrix, of rank r, that is stored in the quantum random access memory. The quantum resources for decoding the state in l(2) norm with epsilon error require poly(r, 1/epsilon) copies of the output state and poly(r, K-r, 1/epsilon) queries to the input oracles, where K is the condition number of the input matrix. With our readout protocol, we completely characterize the end-to-end resources for quantum linear equation solvers and quantum singular value decomposition. One of our technical tools is an efficient quantum algorithm for performing the Gram-Schmidt orthonormal procedure, which we believe will be of independent interest.

We seek certain decomposition of variance into classical and quantum parts in terms of the Wigner-Yanase skew information.

TI Performance of quantum annealing for 2-satisfiability problems with
   multiple satisfying assignments
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Using a specially constructed set of hard 2-satisfiability problems with four satisfying assignments, we study the scaling and sampling performance of numerical simulation of quantum annealing as well as that of the physical quantum annealers offered by D-Wave. To this end, we use both the standard quantum annealing and reverse annealing protocols in both our simulations and on the D-Wave quantum annealer. In the case of ideal quantum annealing the sampling behavior can be explained by perturbation theory and the scaling behavior of the time to solution depends on the scaling behavior of the minimum energy gap between the ground state and the first-excited state of the annealing Hamiltonian. The corresponding results from the D-Wave quantum annealers do not fit to this ideal picture, but suggest that the scaling of the time to solution from the quantum annealers matches those calculated from the equilibrium probability distribution.

TI Twin-field quantum key distribution without optical frequency
   dissemination
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Twin-field (TF) quantum key distribution (QKD) has rapidly risen as the most viable solution to long-distance secure fibre communication thanks to its fundamentally repeater-like rate-loss scaling. However, its implementation complexity, if not successfully addressed, could impede or even prevent its advance into real-world. To satisfy its requirement for twin-field coherence, all present setups adopted essentially a gigantic, resource-inefficient interferometer structure that lacks scalability that mature QKD systems provide with simplex quantum links. Here we introduce a technique that can stabilise an open channel without using a closed interferometer and has general applicability to phase-sensitive quantum communications. Using locally generated frequency combs to establish mutual coherence, we develop a simple and versatile TF-QKD setup that does not need service fibre and can operate over links of 100 km asymmetry. We confirm the setup's repeater-like behaviour and obtain a finite-size rate of 0.32 bit/s at a distance of 615.6 km.
   Twin-field QKD should allow secure quantum communication with favourable rate-loss scaling, but requires interferometric implementations which are often impractical for long distances. Here, the authors show how to realise it without the need for closed interferometers.

TI Gutzwiller wave function on a quantum computer using a discrete
   Hubbard-Stratonovich transformation
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB We propose a quantum-classical hybrid scheme for implementing the nonunitary Gutzwiller factor using a discrete Hubbard-Stratonovich transformation, which allows us to express the Gutzwiller factor as a linear combination of unitary operators involving only single-qubit rotations, at the cost of the sum over the auxiliary fields. To perform the sum over the auxiliary fields, we introduce two approaches that have complementary features. The first approach employs a linear-combination-of-unitaries circuit, which enables one to probabilistically prepare the Gutzwiller wave function on a quantum computer, while the second approach uses importance sampling to estimate observables stochastically, similar to a quantum Monte Carlo method in classical computation. The proposed scheme is demonstrated with numerical simulations for the half-filled Fermi-Hubbard model. Furthermore, we perform quantum simulations using a real quantum device, demonstrating that the proposed scheme can reproduce the exact ground-state energy of the two-site Fermi-Hubbard model within error bars.

TI Unified framework for quantum classification
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Quantum machine learning is an emerging field that combines machine learning with advances in quantum technologies. Many works have suggested great possibilities of using near-term quantum hardware in supervised learning. Motivated by these developments, we present an embedding-based framework for supervised learning with trainable quantum circuits. We introduce both explicit and implicit approaches. The aim of these approaches is to map data from different classes to separated locations in the Hilbert space via a parametrized quantum circuit. We will show that the implicit approach is a generalization of a recently introduced strategy, so-called quantum metric learning. Furthermore, we discuss an intrinsic connection between the explicit approach and those previously proposed quantum classification models. The implicit and explicit approaches, together, provide a unified framework for quantum classification. The utility of our framework is demonstrated by our noise-free and noisy numerical simulations. Moreover, we have conducted classification testing with both implicit and explicit approaches using several IBM Q devices.

TI Subspace-based local compilation of variational quantum circuits for
   large-scale quantum many-body simulation
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Simulation of quantum many-body systems is one of the most promising applications of quantum computers. It is crucial to efficiently implement the time-evolution operator as a quantum circuit to execute such simulations on near-term quantum computing devices with limited computational resources. However, standard approaches such as Trotterization sometimes require a deep quantum circuit, which is hard to implement on near-term quantum computers. Here, we propose a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm, called local subspace variational quantum compilation (LSVQC), for compiling the time-evolution operator of quantum many-body systems. The LSVQC performs a variational optimization to reproduce the action of the target time-evolution operator within a physically reasonable subspace. The optimization is performed for small local subsystems based on the Lieb-Robinson bound, which allows us to execute the cost function evaluation using small-scale quantum devices and/or classical computers. We demonstrate the validity of the LSVQC algorithm through numerical simulations of a simple spin-lattice model and an effective model of a parent compound of cuprate superconductors, Sr2CuO3, constructed by the ab initio downfolding method. It is shown that the LSVQC achieves a 95% reduction of the circuit depth for simulating quantum many-body dynamics compared to the Trotterization at best while maintaining the same computational accuracy. We also demonstrate that the restriction to a subspace leads to a substantial reduction of required resources and improved accuracy compared to the case of considering the entire Hilbert space. Furthermore, we estimate the gate count needed to execute the quantum simulations using the LSVQC on near-term quantum computing architectures in the noisy intermediate-scale or early fault-tolerant quantum computing era. Our estimation suggests that the acceptable physical gate error rate for the LSVQC can be about one order of magnitude larger than that for the Trotterization.

TI Symbolic Reasoning About Quantum Circuits in Coq
SO JOURNAL OF COMPUTER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB A quantum circuit is a computational unit that transforms an input quantum state to an output state. A natural way to reason about its behavior is to compute explicitly the unitary matrix implemented by it. However, when the number of qubits increases, the matrix dimension grows exponentially and the computation becomes intractable. In this paper, we propose a symbolic approach to reasoning about quantum circuits. It is based on a small set of laws involving some basic manipulations on vectors and matrices. This symbolic reasoning scales better than the explicit one and is well suited to be automated in Coq, as demonstrated with some typical examples.

TI Quantum Natural Language Processing on Near-Term Quantum Computers
SO ELECTRONIC PROCEEDINGS IN THEORETICAL COMPUTER SCIENCE
CT Electronic Proceedings in Theoretical Computer Science
CY SEP 08-10, 2021
CL Hagenberg, AUSTRIA
AB In this work, we describe a full-stack pipeline for natural language processing on near-term quantum computers, aka QNLP. The language-modelling framework we employ is that of compositional distributional semantics (DisCoCat), which extends and complements the compositional structure of pregroup grammars. Within this model, the grammatical reduction of a sentence is interpreted as a diagram, encoding a specific interaction of words according to the grammar. It is this interaction which, together with a specific choice of word embedding, realises the meaning (or "semantics") of a sentence. Building on the formal quantum-like nature of such interactions, we present a method for mapping DisCoCat diagrams to quantum circuits. Our methodology is compatible both with NISQ devices and with established Quantum Machine Learning techniques, paving the way to near-term applications of quantum technology to natural language processing.

TI Probing a Hybrid Channel for the Dynamics of Non-Local Features
SO SYMMETRY-BASEL
AB Effective information transmission is a central element in quantum information protocols, but the quest for optimal efficiency in channels with symmetrical characteristics remains a prominent challenge in quantum information science. In light of this challenge, we introduce a hybrid channel that encompasses thermal, magnetic, and local components, each simultaneously endowed with characteristics that enhance and diminish quantum correlations. To investigate the symmetry of this hybrid channel, we explored the quantum correlations of a simple two-qubit Heisenberg spin state, quantified using measures such as negativity, l1-norm coherence, entropic uncertainty, and entropy functions. Our findings revealed that the hybrid channel can be adeptly tailored to preserve quantum correlations, surpassing the capabilities of its individual components. We also identified optimal parameterizations to attain maximum entanglement from mixed entangled/separable states, even in the presence of local dephasing. Notably, various parameters and quantum features, including non-Markovianity, exhibited distinct behaviors in the context of this hybrid channel. Ultimately, we discuss potential experimental applications of this configuration.

TI Benchmarking quantum annealing with maximum cardinality matching
   problems
SO FRONTIERS IN COMPUTER SCIENCE
AB We benchmark Quantum Annealing (QA) vs. Simulated Annealing (SA) with a focus on the impact of the embedding of problems onto the different topologies of the D-Wave quantum annealers. The series of problems we study are especially designed instances of the maximum cardinality matching problem that are easy to solve classically but difficult for SA and, as found experimentally, not easy for QA either. In addition to using several D-Wave processors, we simulate the QA process by numerically solving the time-dependent Schr & ouml;dinger equation. We find that the embedded problems can be significantly more difficult than the unembedded problems, and some parameters, such as the chain strength, can be very impactful for finding the optimal solution. Thus, finding a good embedding and optimal parameter values can improve the results considerably. Interestingly, we find that although SA succeeds for the unembedded problems, the SA results obtained for the embedded version scale quite poorly in comparison with what we can achieve on the D-Wave quantum annealers.

TI Tripartite entanglement and quantum correlation
SO JOURNAL OF HIGH ENERGY PHYSICS
AB We provide an analytical tripartite-study from the generalized R-matrix. It provides the upper bound of the maximum violation of Mermin's inequality. For a generic 2-qubit pure state, the concurrence or R-matrix characterizes the maximum violation of Bell's inequality. Therefore, people expect that the maximum violation should be proper to quantify Quantum Entanglement. The R-matrix gives the maximum violation of Bell's inequality. For a general 3-qubit state, we have five invariant entanglement quantities up to local unitary transformations. We show that the five invariant quantities describe the correlation in the generalized R-matrix. The violation of Mermin's inequality is not a proper diagnosis due to the non-monotonic behavior. We then classify 3-qubit quantum states. Each classification quantifies Quantum Entanglement by the total concurrence. In the end, we relate the experiment correlators to Quantum Entanglement.

TI Singlet-Triplet and Exchange-Only Flopping-Mode Spin Qubits
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Semiconductor-based spin qubits embedded into a superconducting microwave cavity constitute a fast-progressing and promising platform for realizing fast and fault-tolerant qubit control with long-range two-qubit coupling. The flopping-mode spin qubit consists of a single electron in a double quantum dot; it combines a charge qubit with a spin qubit. With its strong and tunable cavity coupling, the flopping-mode qubit is proven to be well suited for low-power qubit control and cavity-mediated long-range quantum gates. The singlet-triplet (ST) and exchange-only (EO) qubits are multielectron realizations that go without broadband control and are protected from some types of noise, but are challenging to couple to each other and to microwave cavities. We combine the flopping-mode concept with the ST and EO qubits and propose two new flopping-mode qubits that consist of three (four) quantum dots, occupied by two (three) electrons near the (1, 0, 1) <-> (0, 1, 1) [(1, 0, 1, 1) <-> (0, 1, 1, 1)] charge transition. The two-electron system augments the ST0 spin qubit with a charge qubit that interacts transversally and longitudinally with a cavity. Both couplings are highly tunable, and the longitudinal coupling distinguishes the flopping-mode ST qubit from the regular flopping-mode qubit. The longitudinal coupling allows for nondissipative universal control similar to superconducting transmon qubits. The EO flopping-mode qubit comprises four dots occupied by three electrons and opens a new possibility to perform two-qubit gates for EO qubits that are challenging to perform directly with the exchange coupling. We use input-output theory to provide means of extracting the coupling strengths from cavity transmission data.

TI Dynamics and resonance fluorescence from a superconducting artificial
   atom doubly driven by quantized and classical fields
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB We report an experimental demonstration of resonance fluorescence in a two-level superconducting artificial atom under two driving fields coupled to a detuned cavity. One of the fields is classical and the other is varied from quantum (vacuum fluctuations) to classical by controlling the photon number inside the cavity. The device consists of a transmon qubit strongly coupled to a one-dimensional transmission line and a coplanar waveguide resonator. We observe a sideband anticrossing and asymmetry in the emission spectra of the system through a one-dimensional transmission line, which is fundamentally different from the weak-coupling case. By changing the photon number inside the cavity, the emission spectrum of our doubly driven system approaches the case when the atom is driven by two classical bichromatic fields. We also measure the dynamical evolution of the system through the transmission line and study the properties of the first-order correlation function, Rabi oscillations, and energy relaxation in the system. The study of resonance fluorescence from an atom driven by two fields promotes understanding decoherence in superconducting quantum circuits and may find applications in superconducting quantum computing and quantum networks.

As such it is important to teach quantum computing concepts to users to allow them to incorporate quantum computing into their toolbox. As educational research has shown the potential of game-based learning in the past years, we are thus proposing QRogue, an educational game with Rogue-like elements targeted at computer science students. The game's goal is to teach the math behind quantum computing in a playful environment with analogies to this technology's counter-intuitive fundamentals. To gather first feedback and stir the further development, we conducted a user study - involving playtesting and a post-experience survey - with eight students showing that the game was positively received but requires further tuning of the onboarding process and of the in-game feedback provided to players.

TI Bath-Induced Collective Phenomena on Superconducting Qubits:
   Synchronization, Subradiance, and Entanglement Generation
SO ANNALEN DER PHYSIK
AB A common environment acting on a pair of qubits gives rise to a plethora of different phenomena, such as the generation of qubit-qubit entanglement, quantum synchronization, and subradiance. Here, time-independent figures of merit for entanglement generation, quantum synchronization, and subradiance are defined, and an extensive analytical and numerical study of their dependence on model parameters is performed. A recently proposed measure of the collectiveness of the dynamics driven by the bath is also addressed, and it is found that it almost perfectly witnesses the behavior of entanglement generation. The results show that synchronization and subradiance can be employed as reliable local signatures of an entangling common-bath in a general scenario. Finally, an experimental implementation of the model based on two transmon qubits capacitively coupled to a common resistor is proposed, which provides a versatile quantum simulation platform of the open system in any regime.

TI QSA-QConvLSTM: A Quantum Computing-Based Approach for Spatiotemporal
   Sequence Prediction
SO INFORMATION
AB The ability to capture long-distance dependencies is critical for improving the prediction accuracy of spatiotemporal prediction models. Traditional ConvLSTM models face inherent limitations in this regard, along with the challenge of information decay, which negatively impacts prediction performance. To address these issues, this paper proposes a QSA-QConvLSTM model, which integrates quantum convolution circuits and quantum self-attention mechanisms. The quantum self-attention mechanism maps query, key, and value vectors using variational quantum circuits, effectively enhancing the ability to model long-distance dependencies in spatiotemporal data. Additionally, the use of quantum convolution circuits improves the extraction of spatial features. Experiments on the Moving MNIST dataset demonstrate the superiority of the QSA-QConvLSTM model over existing models, including ConvLSTM, TrajGRU, PredRNN, and PredRNN v2, with MSE and SSIM scores of 44.3 and 0.906, respectively. Ablation studies further verify the effectiveness and necessity of the quantum convolution circuits and quantum self-attention modules, providing an efficient and accurate approach to quantized modeling for spatiotemporal prediction tasks.

TI Equilibration of apparent temperature in non-equilibrium steady state of
   Lindblad dynamics
SO AVS QUANTUM SCIENCE
AB Temperature in a non-equilibrium system is not well defined. If the non-equilibrium dynamics is Lindbladian, it is possible to associate several apparent temperatures with it. However, the apparent temperature governed by the Lindblad equation and its properties as the system approaches a steady state have not been extensively studied. Representing a finite-dimensional quantum system as a graph, we extended Kirchhoff's matrix-tree theorem to a case where the system's graph is not strongly connected and showed that the diagonal and off-diagonal components of a density matrix can be dynamically evolved separately. We discovered that the apparent temperatures of different interaction channels between the system's graph and the environment can be different. It can be equilibrated in each channel if the system has only cycles with length & ell; <= 2 . In contrast, when the system has a cycle with length & ell; > 2 , the apparent temperatures of the system and environment are different at a steady state or not equilibrated. Equilibration of an apparent temperature may occur in some channels but not in others and can be undefined in some cases. Generally, an apparent temperature is not transitive because it depends on the interaction channels between the subsystem and its environment. Considering the apparent temperature for each interaction channel, instead of one value of temperature representing the entire system, will provide more insights about the state of a quantum system and potentially lead to more efficient control of quantum systems for many applications in quantum technology. We demonstrated these points in some important finite-dimensional quantum systems pertaining to quantum memory, thermalizing channels in a qutrit and quantum sensing. (c) 2025 Author(s).

TI Silicon photonic quantum computing with spin qubits
SO APL PHOTONICS
AB Universal quantum computing holds the promise to fundamentally change today's information-based society, yet a hardware platform that will provide a clear path to fault-tolerant quantum computing remains elusive. One recently proposed platform involves the use of circuit-bound photons to build cluster states and perform one-way measurement-based quantum computations on arrays of long-coherence-time solid-state spin qubits. Herein, we discuss the challenges that are faced during any practical implementation of this architecture by itemizing the key physical building blocks and the constraints imposed on the spin qubits and the photonic circuit components by the requirements of fault-tolerant performance. These considerations point to silicon as a leading candidate to host such a platform, and a roadmap for developing a silicon photonic circuit-based platform for measurement-based, fault-tolerant universal quantum computing is offered.

TI Quantum algorithms for anomaly detection using amplitude estimation
SO PHYSICA A-STATISTICAL MECHANICS AND ITS APPLICATIONS
AB Anomaly detection, as an important branch of machine learning, plays a critical role in fraud detection, health care, intrusion detection, military surveillance, etc. An anomaly detection algorithm based on density estimation (called ADDE algorithm) is one of the widely used algorithms. However, the ADDE algorithm is computationally expensive when processing big data sets. To solve this problem, in this paper, we propose an efficient quantum ADDE algorithm based on amplitude estimation. It is shown that our algorithm achieves exponential speedup on the number of training data points M over its classical counterpart.

TI Error-heralded high-dimensional quantum gate with robust fidelity
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Quantum computing in high-dimensional spaces holds promise for a plethora of applications, i.e., handling more intricate information and executing wider quantum operations, in complex quantum information technologies (QITs). In the paper, we set up an error-heralded, resource-saving, circuit-simplified, and 4x4 x 4-dimensional controlled-not (CNOT) gate, where the polarized and spatial state of the flying photon (i.e., the control qudit) can effectively control the collective spin wave state of two atomic ensembles (i.e., the target qudit) in two double-sided cavities. Moreover, through meticulous analysis, the feasibility of the high-dimensional gate using existing technology boasts the exceptional performance including a near-unity fidelity and high efficiency exceeding 0.95, in principle, as the undesired performances originated from the little side leakage and the finite coupling strength, and the imperfect atom-ensemble-cavity interactions are heralded by single-photon detectors. Besides, auxiliary photons or atomic ensembles are unnecessary. Therefore, our protocol stands out for its simplicity, efficient resource utilization, and real-time error prediction, contributing significantly to the efficacy of QIT and charting a promising path towards the realization of high-dimensional quantum computing endowed with heightened capabilities.

TI Quantum Embedding of Non-Local Quantum Many-Body Interactions in an
   Prototypal Anti-Tumor Vaccine Metalloprotein on Near-Term Quantum
   Computing Hardware
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR SCIENCES
AB The world obeys quantum physics and quantum computing presents an alternative way to map physical problems to systems that follow the same laws. Such computation fundamentally constitutes a better way to understand the most challenging quantum problems. One such problem is the accurate simulation of highly correlated quantum systems. Still, modern-day quantum hardware has limitations and only allows for the modeling of simple systems. Here, we present for the first time a quantum computer model simulation of a complex hemocyanin molecule, which is an important respiratory protein involved in various physiological processes and is also used as a key component in therapeutic vaccines for cancer. To characterize the mechanism by which hemocyanin transports oxygen, variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) and quantum embedding methods are used in the context of dynamic mean field theory to solve the Anderson impurity model (AIM). Finally, it is concluded that the magnetic structure of hemocyanin is largely influenced by the many-body correction and that the computational effort for solving correlated electron systems could be substantially reduced with the introduction of quantum computing algorithms. We encourage the use of the Hamiltonian systems presented in this paper as a benchmark for testing quantum computing algorithms' efficiency for chemistry applications.

TI Modeling quantum volume using randomized benchmarking of
   Room-Temperature NV center quantum registers
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Accurately estimating the performance of quantum hardware is crucial for comparing different platforms and predicting the performance and feasibility of quantum algorithms and applications. In this paper, we tackle the problem of benchmarking a quantum register based on the NV center in diamond operating at room temperature. We define the connectivity map as well as single-qubit performance. Thanks to an all-to-all connectivity, the 2 and 3-qubit gates performance is promising and competitive among other platforms. We experimentally calibrate the error model for the register and use it to estimate the quantum volume, a metric used for quantifying the quantum computational capabilities of the register, of 8. Our results pave the way towards the unification of different architectures of quantum hardware and the evaluation of the joint metrics.

SO SYNTHESE
AB In de Ronde and Massri (Against 'particle metaphysics' and 'collapses' within the definition of quantum entanglement, submitted, 2019b) it was argued against the orthodox definition of quantum entanglement in terms of pure and separable states. In this paper we attempt to discuss how the logos categorical approach to quantum mechanics (de Ronde and Massri in Int J Theor Phys, 2018. ; in Int J Theor Phys 58:1968-1988, 2019a) is able to provide an objective formal account of the notion of entanglement-completely independent of both purity and separability-in terms of the potential coding of intensive relations and effective relations. We will show how our novel redefinition allows us to provide an anschaulich content to the notion of entanglement, erasing in this way the "spookiness" still present within its orthodox understanding in terms of space-time separated collapse particles.

TI One to many one-way control in quadripartite asymmetric
   Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen steering
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) steering is different from quantum entanglement because of its unique asymmetry. Multipartite asymmetric EPR steering can break through one-to-one monogamy steering and achieve one to many one-way steering. That is to say, the state of one part can steer the other rest parts simultaneously, while the other parts cannot steer this part. Here, a scheme is proposed to generate one to many one-way steering by optical parametric amplification cascaded with a sum-frequency generation process. One to many non-monogamy EPR steering, such as one to two and one to three one-way steering are demonstrated based on the criterion for asymmetric EPR steering. It is also find that different kinds of asymmetric EPR steering can be obtained by choosing different nonlinear parameters. This non-monogamous one to many quantum control has potential application in constructing quantum networks and realizing one-way quantum computing.

TI Transferable room-temperature single-photon emitters in hexagonal boron
   nitride grown by molecular beam epitaxy
SO AIP ADVANCES
AB The solid-state single-photon source is the core of applications such as quantum cryptography, quantum sensing, and quantum computing. Recently, the point defects in two-dimensional (2D) hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) have become excellent candidates for next-generation single-photon sources due to their chemical and physical stability and ultra-high brightness at room temperature. The 2D layered structure of h-BN allows the single-photon emitters (SPEs) in it to have high photon extraction efficiency and be integrated into photonic circuits easily. However, most of the SPEs found in h-BN flakes are present at the edges or wrinkles. Here, we report on the room-temperature SPEs in h-BN film grown by molecular beam epitaxy followed by a high-temperature post-annealing process and their deterministic transfer. Using the all-dry viscoelastic stamping method, the h-BN film grown on the Al2O3 substrate can be transferred to other substrates. The transferred SPEs are discretely distributed among the continuous h-BN flakes, and the SPE density is as high as similar to 0.17 mu m(-2). After identification, the determined SPE can be deterministically transferred to other structures by the all-dry transfer method. The deterministic transfer of SPEs distributed on the h-BN flakes promises the potential to integrate SPEs into many quantum technology applications. (C) 2021 Author(s).

TI Silicon-28-Tetrafluoride as an Educt of Isotope-Engineered Silicon
   Compounds and Bulk Materials for Quantum Systems
SO MOLECULES
AB This review provides a summary of the existing literature on a crucial raw material for the production of isotopically pure semiconductors, which are essential for the development of second-generation quantum systems. Silicon-28-tetrafluoride (28SiF4) is used as an educt for several isotope-engineered chemicals, such as silane-28 (28SiH4) and silicon-28-trichloride (28SiHCl3), which are needed in the pursuit of various quantum technologies. We are exploring the entire chain from the synthesis of 28SiF4 to quantum applications. This includes the chemical properties of SiF4, isotopic enrichment, conversion to silanes, conversion to bulk 28Si and thin films, the physical properties of 28Si (spin neutrality, thermal conductivity, optical properties), and the applications in quantum computing, photonics, and quantum sensing techniques.

TI Variational Quantum Circuits to Prepare Low Energy Symmetry States
SO SYMMETRY-BASEL
AB We explore how to build quantum circuits that compute the lowest energy state corresponding to a given Hamiltonian within a symmetry subspace by explicitly encoding it into the circuit. We create an explicit unitary and a variationally trained unitary that maps any vector output by ansatz A (($)over-right-arrow alpha) from a defined subspace to a vector in the symmetry space. The parameters are trained varitionally to minimize the energy, thus keeping the output within the labelled symmetry value. The method was tested for a spin XXZ Hamiltonian using rotation and reflection symmetry and H-2 Hamiltonian within S-z = 0 subspace using S-2 symmetry. We have found the variationally trained unitary gives good results with very low depth circuits and can thus be used to prepare symmetry states within near term quantum computers.

TI Quantum integration in swin transformer mitigates overfitting in breast
   cancer screening
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB To explore the potential of quantum computing in advancing transformer-based deep learning models for breast cancer screening, this study introduces the Quantum-Enhanced Swin Transformer (QEST). This model integrates a Variational Quantum Circuit (VQC) to replace the fully connected layer responsible for classification in the Swin Transformer architecture. In simulations, QEST exhibited competitive accuracy and generalization performance compared to the original Swin Transformer, while also demonstrating an effect in mitigating overfitting. Specifically, in 16-qubit simulations, the VQC reduced the parameter count by 62.5% compared with the replaced fully connected layer and improved the Balanced Accuracy (BACC) by 3.62% in external validation. Furthermore, validation experiments conducted on an actual quantum computer have corroborated the effectiveness of QEST.

TI Approximate Unitary t-Designs by Short Random Quantum Circuits
   Using Nearest-Neighbor and Long-Range Gates
SO COMMUNICATIONS IN MATHEMATICAL PHYSICS
AB We prove that poly(t) . n(1/D)-depth local random quantum circuits with two qudit nearest-neighbor gates on a D-dimensional lattice with n qudits are approximate t-designs in various measures. These include the "monomial" measure, meaning that the monomials of a random circuit from this family have expectation close to the value that would result from the Haar measure. Previously, the best bound was poly(t) . n due to Brandao-Harrow-Horodecki (Commun Math Phys 346(2):397-434, 2016) for D = 1. We also improve the "scrambling" and "decoupling" bounds for spatially local random circuits due to Brown and Fawzi (Scrambling speed of random quantum circuits, 2012). One consequence of our result is that assuming the polynomial hierarchy (PH) is infinite and that certain counting problems are #P-hard "on average", sampling within total variation distance from these circuits is hard for classical computers. Previously, exact sampling from the outputs of even constant-depth quantum circuits was known to be hard for classical computers under these assumptions. However the standard strategy for extending this hardness result to approximate sampling requires the quantum circuits to have a property called "anti-concentration", meaning roughly that the output has near-maximal entropy. Unitary 2-designs have the desired anti-concentration property. Our result improves the required depth for this level of anti-concentration from linear depth to a sub-linear value, depending on the geometry of the interactions. This is relevant to a recent experiment by the Google Quantum AI group to perform such a sampling task with 53 qubits on a two-dimensional lattice (Arute in Nature 574(7779):505-510, 2019; Boixo et al. in Nate Phys 14(6):595-600, 2018) (and related experiments by USTC), and confirms their conjecture that O(root n) depth suffices for anti-concentration. The proof is based on a previous construction of t-designs by Brandao et al. (2016), an analysis of how approximate designs behave under composition, and an extension of the quasi-orthogonality of permutation operators developed by Brandao et al. (2016). Different versions of the approximate design condition correspond to different norms, and part of our contribution is to introduce the norm corresponding to anti-concentration and to establish equivalence between these various norms for low-depth circuits. For random circuits with long-range gates, we use different methods to show that anti-concentration happens at circuit size O(n ln(2) n) corresponding to depth O(ln(3) n). We also show a lower bound of Omega(n ln n) for the size of such circuit in this case. We also prove that anti-concentration is possible in depth O(ln n ln ln n) (size O(n ln n ln ln n)) using a different model.

TI Tailored XZZX codes for biased noise
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Quantum error correction (QEC) for generic errors is challenging due to the demanding threshold and resource requirements. Interestingly, when physical noise is biased, we can tailor our QEC schemes to the noise to improve performance. Here we study a family of codes having XZZX-type stabilizer generators, including a set of cyclic codes generalized from the five-qubit code and a set of topological codes that we call generalized toric codes (GTCs). We show that these XZZX codes are highly qubit efficient if tailored to biased noise. To characterize the code performance, we use the notion of effective distance, which generalizes code distance to the case of biased noise and constitutes a proxy for the logical failure rate. We find that the XZZX codes can achieve a favorable resource scaling by this metric under biased noise. We also show that the XZZX codes have remarkably high thresholds that reach what is achievable by random codes, and furthermore they can be efficiently decoded using matching decoders. Finally, by adding only one flag qubit, the XZZX codes can realize fault-tolerant QEC while preserving their large effective distance. In combination, our results show that tailored XZZX codes give a resource-efficient scheme for fault-tolerant QEC against biased noise.

In this paper, we mainly study the performance of the CV-MDI-QKD system using the noiseless linear amplifier (NLA). The NLA is added to the output of the detector at Charlie's side.

TI Quantum Entanglement Asymmetry and the Cosmic Matter-Antimatter
   Imbalance: A Theoretical and Observational Analysis
SO ENTROPY
AB We propose a distinct mechanism to explain the matter-antimatter imbalance observed in the universe, rooted in quantum entanglement asymmetry (QEA). Our concept of QEA differs from its usage in the recent literature, where it typically measures how much symmetry is broken within a subsystem of a larger quantum system. Here, we define QEA as an intrinsic asymmetry in the entanglement properties of particle-antiparticle pairs in the early universe, leading to a preferential survival of matter over antimatter. We develop a theoretical framework incorporating QEA into the standard cosmological model, providing clear justification for the asymmetry in entangled states and corresponding modifications to the Hamiltonian. Numerical simulations using lattice Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) demonstrate that QEA can produce a net baryon asymmetry consistent with observations. We also predict specific signatures in Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) anisotropies and large-scale structure formation, offering potential avenues for empirical verification. This work aims to deepen the understanding of cosmological asymmetries and highlight the significance of quantum entanglement in the universe's evolution.

TI Impacts of intrinsic noise and quantum entanglement on the geometric and
   dynamical properties of the XXZ Heisenberg interacting spin model
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Understanding how intrinsic decoherence affects the interplay between geometry, dynamics, and entanglement in quantum systems is a central challenge in quantum information science. In this work, we develop a unified framework that explores this interplay for a pair of interacting spins governed by an XXZ-type Heisenberg model under an external magnetic field and intrinsic decoherence. We quantify entanglement using the concurrence measure and examine its evolution under decoherence, revealing that intrinsic noise rapidly suppresses entanglement as it increases. We then analyze the Hilbert-Schmidt and Bures distances between quantum states and show how both the degree of entanglement and the noise rate modulate these distances and their associated quantum speeds. Importantly, we demonstrate that the Hilbert-Schmidt speed is more responsive to entanglement and coherence loss than the Bures speed, making it a powerful tool for probing the geometry of quantum dynamics. Moreover, we solve the quantum brachistochrone problem in the presence of intrinsic decoherence, identifying the minimal evolution time and the corresponding optimal entangled states. Finally, we explore the geometric phase accumulated during the system's evolution. Our results show that decoherence hinders geometric phase accumulation, while entanglement counteracts this effect, enhancing phase stability.

AB Workforce assignment (WA) is a crucial aspect of production planning and control. However, current global crises have led to workforce absence and skill shortages. To tackle these challenges, a short-term WA approach is necessary for manufacturing systems flexibility and workforce health. Conventional methods for WA face complexity issues due to complex manufacturing systems, requiring substantial computation time. A Quantum Annealing-based WA approach is proposed in this paper to allocate tasks and shifts to workers. The proposed method is validated in a use case, showing improved solution quality compared to traditional methods. (c) 2023 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

TI Quantum Random Access Codes Implementation for Resource Allocation and
   Coexistence with Classical Telecommunication
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB In a world where Quantum Networks are rapidly becoming a reality, the development of the Quantum Internet is gaining increasing interest. Nevertheless, modern quantum networks are still in the early stages of development and have limited capacity to distribute resources among different users - a constraint that needs to be taken into account. In this work, it aims to investigate these constraints, using a novel setup for implementing Quantum Random Access Codes (QRACs), communication protocols known for their quantum advantage over their classical counterparts and semi- device-independent self-testing applications. The QRAC states, made for the first time using weak coherent pulses instead of entangled single photons, allow us to experimentally test the encoding and decoding strategy from the resource allocation perspective. Moreover, by emulating a coexistent classical communication, it test the resilience of the implementation in presence of noise. The achieved results represent a significant milestone both for theoretical studies of quantum resource allocation and for the implementation of quantum infrastructures capable of coexisting with regular telecommunication networks.
   For the first time, a setup capable of performing Quantum Random Access Code, a communication protocol known for showing quantum advantage, is implemented utilizing weak coherent pulses instead of real single photons. The results for 2 and 4D quantum states demonstrate an optimal allocation of quantum resources, a question of utmost importance in quantum networks and quantum internet.image

TI Energetic Perspective on Rapid Quenches in Quantum Annealing
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB There are well-developed theoretical tools to analyze how quantum dynamics can solve computational problems by varying Hamiltonian parameters slowly, near the adiabatic limit. On the other hand, there are relatively few tools to understand the opposite limit of rapid quenches, as used in quantum annealing and (in the limit of infinitely rapid quenches) in quantum walks. In this paper, we develop several tools that are applicable in the rapid-quench regime. Firstly, we analyze the energy expectation value of different elements of the Hamiltonian. From this, we show that monotonic quenches, where the strength of the problem Hamiltonian is consistently increased relative to fluctuation (driver) terms, will yield a better result on average than random guessing. Secondly, we develop methods to determine whether dynamics will occur locally under rapid-quench Hamiltonians and identify cases where a rapid quench will lead to a substantially improved solution. In particular, we find that a technique we refer to as "preannealing" can significantly improve the performance of quantum walks. We also show how these tools can provide efficient heuristic estimates for Hamiltonian parameters, a key requirement for practical application of quantum annealing.

TI Double-Transmon Coupler: Fast Two-Qubit Gate with No Residual Coupling
   for Highly Detuned Superconducting Qubits
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB Although two-qubit entangling gates are necessary for universal quantum computing, they are notoriously difficult to implement with high fidelity. Recently, tunable couplers have become a key component for realizing high-fidelity two-qubit gates in superconducting quantum computers. However, it is still difficult to achieve tunable coupling free of unwanted residual coupling-in particular, for highly detuned qubits, which are desirable for mitigating qubit-frequency crowding or errors due to crosstalk between qubits. We thus propose a kind of tunable coupler that we call a double-transmon coupler, because it is composed of two transmon qubits coupled through a common loop with an additional Josephson junction. By controlling the magnetic flux in the loop, we can achieve not only fast high-fidelity twoqubit gates but also no residual coupling during the idle time, where computational qubits are highly detuned fixed-frequency transmons. The proposed coupler is expected to offer an alternative approach to higher-performance superconducting quantum computers.

TI Solving Linear Systems of Equations by Using the Concept of Grover's
   Search Algorithm: an IBM Quantum Experience
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF THEORETICAL PHYSICS
AB Quantum algorithm, as compared to classical algorithm, plays a notable role in solving linear systems of equations with an exponential speedup. Here, we demonstrate a method for solving a particular system of equations by using the concept of well-known Grover's quantum search algorithm. The algorithm finds the solution by rotating the initial state vector in the Hilbert space to get the target solution state. It mainly involves finding particular matrices that solve the set of equations and constructing corresponding quantum circuits using the basic quantum gates. We explicitly illustrate the whole process by taking 48 different set of equations and solving them by using the concept of Grover's algorithm. We propose new quantum circuits for each set of equations and design those on the IBM quantum simulator. We run the quantum circuit for one set of equations and obtain the desired results, and hence verify the working of the algorithm.

TI Preparing valence-bond-solid states on noisy intermediate-scale quantum
   computers
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Quantum state preparation is a key step in all digital quantum simulation algorithms. Here we propose methods to initialize on a gate-based quantum computer a general class of quantum spin wave functions, the so-called valence-bond-solid (VBS) states, that are important for two reasons. First, VBS states are the exact ground states of a class of interacting quantum spin models introduced by Affleck, Kennedy, Lieb, and Tasaki (AKLT). Second, the two-dimensional VBS states are universal resource states for measurement-based quantum computing. We find that schemes to prepare VBS states based on their tensor-network representations yield quantum circuits that are too deep to be within reach of noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) computers. We then apply the general nondeterministic method herein proposed to the preparation of the spin-1 and spin-3/2 VBS states, the ground states of the AKLT models defined in one dimension and in the honeycomb lattice, respectively. Shallow quantum circuits of depth independent of the lattice size are explicitly derived for both cases, making use of optimization schemes that outperform standard basis gate decomposition methods. The probabilistic nature of the proposed routine translates into an average number of repetitions to successfully prepare the VBS state that scales exponentially with the number of lattice sites N. However, two strategies to quadratically reduce this repetition overhead for any bipartite lattice are devised. Our approach should permit to use NISQ processors to explore the AKLT model and variants thereof, outperforming conventional numerical methods in the near future.

AB Design, simulation, analysis and verification methodologies are crucial for developing electronic circuits and systems at large. Whereas long-standing EDA software is used in the semiconductor technology, there is no counterpart for quantum computing systems yet. Although the quantum computing community started utilizing and adapting some of the already existing EDA tools, for instance, to design quantum processors and control electronics for driving the qubits, or even to solve some quantum computing design tasks, they do not fully use the expertise gained over the last decades in the field of design automation. Current intermediate-scale quantum computers have been designed in an 'adhoc' manner with heterogeneous methods and tools. As we are entering the large-scale era, it is timely and key to further adopt EDA methodologies and software for quantum computing. In this paper, we provide an overview on how full-stack quantum computing systems are being implemented nowadays and discuss which the main challenges are for transitioning from this current scenario to a comprehensive framework encompassing full automated system-wide architecting, design, simulation, verification, and test.

TI Analog simulation of noisy quantum circuits
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB It is well known that simulating quantum circuits with low but nonzero hardware noise is more difficult than without noise. It requires either to perform density matrix simulations (coming with a space overhead) or to sample over "quantum trajectories" where Kraus operators are inserted randomly (coming with a runtime overhead). We propose a simulation technique based on a representation of hardware noise in terms of trajectories generated by operators that remain close to identity at low noise. We give explicit expressions for noise that can be represented by Pauli channels, as well as for certain non-Pauli channels. This representation significantly reduces the variance over the quantum trajectories, speeding up noisy simulations by factors around 10 to 100. As a by-product, we provide a formula to factorize generic Pauli channels into a concatenation of channels involving only one nontrivial Pauli string.

TI An Efficient Quantum Algorithm for the Traveling Salesman Problem
SO QUANTUM INFORMATION & COMPUTATION
AB The traveling salesman problem is the problem of finding out the shortest route in a network of cities, that a salesman needs to travel to cover all the cities, without visiting the same city more than once. This problem is known to be NP-hard with a brute-force complexity of O(N-N) or O(N-2N) for N number of cities. This problem is equivalent to finding out the shortest Hamiltonian cycle in a given graph, if at least one Hamiltonian cycle exists in it. Quantum algorithms for this problem typically provide with a quadratic speedup only, using Grover's search, thereby having a complexity of O(N-N/2) or O(N-N). We present a bounded-error quantum polynomial-time (BQP) algorithm for solving the problem, providing with an exponential speedup. The overall complexity of our algorithm is O(N-3 log(N)kappa/epsilon+ 1/epsilon(3)), where the errors varepsilon; are O(1/poly(N)), and kappa is the not-too-large condition number of the matrix encoding all Hamiltonian cycles.

TI A cost-efficient quantum access network with qubit-based synchronization
SO SCIENCE CHINA-PHYSICS MECHANICS & ASTRONOMY
AB Quantum key distribution (QKD) is a physical layer encryption technique that enables two distant parties to exchange secure keys with information-theoretic security. In the last two decades, QKD has transitioned from laboratory research to real-world applications, including multi-user quantum access networks (QANs). This network structure allows users to share a single-photon detector at a network node through time-division multiplexing, thereby significantly reducing the network cost. However, current QAN implementations require additional hardware for auxiliary tasks such as time synchronization. To address this issue, we propose a cost-efficient QAN that uses qubit-based synchronization. In this approach, the transmitted qubits facilitate time synchronization, eliminating the need for additional synchronization hardware. We tested our scheme by implementing a network for two users and successfully achieved average secure key rates of 53.84 kbps and 71.90 kbps for each user over a 50-km commercial fiber spool. In addition, we investigated the capacity of the access network under cross-talk and loss conditions. The simulation results demonstrate that this scheme can support a QAN with 64 users with key rates up to 1070 bps. Our work provides a feasible and cost-effective way to implement a multi-user QKD network, further promoting the widespread application of QKD.

TI Optimal quantum state tomography with noisy gates
SO EPJ QUANTUM TECHNOLOGY
AB Quantum state tomography (QST) represents an essential tool for the characterization, verification, and validation (QCVV) of quantum processors. Only for a few idealized scenarios, there are analytic results for the optimal measurement set for QST. E.g., in a setting of non-degenerate measurements, an optimal minimal set of measurement operators for QST has eigenbases which are mutually unbiased. However, in other set-ups, dependent on the rank of the projection operators and the size of the quantum system, the optimal choice of measurements for efficient QST needs to be numerically approximated. We have generalized this problem by introducing the framework of customized efficient QST. Here we extend customized QST and look for the optimal measurement set for QST in the case where some of the quantum gates applied in the measurement process are noisy. To achieve this, we use two distinct noise models: first, the depolarizing channel, and second, over- and under-rotation in single-qubit and to two-qubit gates (for further information, please see Methods). We demonstrate the benefit of using entangling gates for the efficient QST measurement schemes for two qubits at realistic noise levels, by comparing the fidelity of reconstruction of our optimized QST measurement set to the state-of-the-art scheme using only product bases.

AB In this Letter, we study quantum circuit Born machines (QCBMs) in the context of photonic quantum computing. QCBMs are a popular choice of quantum generative machine learning models, and we present a QCBM designed for linear optics. We show that a recently developed error mitigation technique called recycling mitigation greatly improves the training of QCBMs in realistic scenarios with photon loss, which is the primary source of noise in photonic systems. We demonstrate this through numerical simulations and through an experiment on a quantum photonic integrated processor. We expect our work to pave the way towards more demonstrations of error mitigation techniques tailored to photonic devices which can enhance the performance of a quantum algorithm.

TI Theoretical prediction of materials with diffuse electrons with possible
   applications in redox catalysis and quantum computing
SO MATERIALS TODAY SUSTAINABILITY
AB The spin of diffuse electrons has been proposed in the literature as qubit for quantum hardware applications. Here we provide the first investigation of the thermal stability for a newly reported family of materials with diffuse electrons. This material has a diamond-like grid of Li + centers bridged by diamine chains NH2(CH2)nH2N of varying carbon length. The tetracoordinated lithium-amine center is surrounded by one diffuse electron solvated by the N-H bonds. Previous work has demonstrated the tunability of the electronic structure of this material, with short chain lengths producing a metallic material and longer a semiconductor. Density functional theory-based ab initio molecular dynamics simulations are employed to characterize the thermal stability and melting point of the crystalline material. Calculations show that the thermal stability ranges from 100 to 220 K, primarily depending on the carbon chain length, with longer chains increasing the stability. Melting of the material is characterized by dissociation of the diamine coordination and formation of disordered clumps of undercoordinated Li-diamine centers. These melting points are well above temperatures used in typical quantum computing applications. The computational study provides insight into avenues for the future development of similar materials and the improvement of their stability.

TI Fabrication and nanophotonic waveguide integration of silicon carbide
   colour centres with preserved spin-optical coherence
SO NATURE MATERIALS
AB Colour centres are a promising quantum information platform, but coherence degradation after integration in nanostructures has hindered scalability. Here, the authors show that waveguide-integrated V-Si centres in SiC maintain spin-optical coherences, enabling nuclear high-fidelity spin qubit operations.
   Optically addressable spin defects in silicon carbide (SiC) are an emerging platform for quantum information processing compatible with nanofabrication processes and device control used by the semiconductor industry. System scalability towards large-scale quantum networks demands integration into nanophotonic structures with efficient spin-photon interfaces. However, degradation of the spin-optical coherence after integration in nanophotonic structures has hindered the potential of most colour centre platforms. Here, we demonstrate the implantation of silicon vacancy centres (V-Si) in SiC without deterioration of their intrinsic spin-optical properties. In particular, we show nearly lifetime-limited photon emission and high spin-coherence times for single defects implanted in bulk as well as in nanophotonic waveguides created by reactive ion etching. Furthermore, we take advantage of the high spin-optical coherences of V-Si centres in waveguides to demonstrate controlled operations on nearby nuclear spin qubits, which is a crucial step towards fault-tolerant quantum information distribution based on cavity quantum electrodynamics.

TI Enhancing multiple object tracking accuracy via quantum annealing
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Multiple object tracking (MOT), a key task in image recognition, poses a persistent challenge in balancing processing speed and tracking accuracy. This study presents a novel approach that leverages quantum annealing (QA) to expedite computation speed, while improving tracking accuracy through the ensemble processing of object tracking methods. A method to improve the matching integration process is also proposed. By utilizing the sequential nature of MOT, this study further augments the tracking method via reverse annealing. Experimental validation confirms the maintenance of high accuracy with an annealing time of a mere 3 \documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$\mu$$\end{document}s per tracking process. Notably, the time-to-solution achieved reductions of over 99% compared to conventional QA implementations. The proposed method holds significant potential for real-time MOT applications, including traffic flow measurement for urban traffic light control, collision prediction for autonomous robots and vehicles, and management of products mass-produced in factories.

AB Quantum neural networks are emerging as potential candidates to leverage noisy quantum processing units for applications. Here we introduce hybrid quantum-classical autoencoders for end-to-end radio communication. In the physical layer of classical wireless systems, we study the performance of simulated architectures for standard encoded radio signals over a noisy channel. We implement a hybrid model, where a quantum decoder in the receiver works with a classical encoder in the transmitter part. Besides learning a latent space representation of the input symbols with good robustness against signal degradation, a generalized data re-uploading scheme for the qubit-based circuits allows to meet inference-time constraints of the application.

AB Trapped-ion systems can have a limited number of ions (qubits) in a single trap. Increasing the qubit count to run meaningful quantum algorithms would require multiple traps where ions need to shuttle between traps to communicate. The existing compiler has several limitations, which result in a high number of shuttle operations and degraded fidelity. In this paper, we target this gap and propose compiler optimizations to reduce the number of shuttles. Our technique achieves a maximum reduction of 51.17% in shuttles (average approximate to 33%) tested over 125 circuits. Furthermore, the improved compilation enhances the program fidelity up to 22.68X with a modest increase in the compilation time.

TI Design and Characterization of a 6-mW Cryogenic SiGe IC for
   Superconducting Qubit Readout
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON MICROWAVE THEORY AND TECHNIQUES
AB In this article, a cryogenically cooled SiGe BiCMOS integrated circuit is described and used to achieve > 98% readout fidelity when measuring the state of a superconducting transmon qubit coupled to a 6.5-GHz resonant cavity. The circuit employs homodyne detection and uses a novel local oscillator chopping approach to reduce the effects of LO-RF feedthrough in the presence of a high-gain LNA. At 6 mW, the integrated circuit is employed to demonstrate comparable fidelity to a standard HEMT-amplifier-based readout setup, when preceded by a Josephson parametric amplifier with >=similar to 18 dB of power gain. In addition, this performance is achieved with the IC consuming less power than the commercial HEMT LNA used in the standard readout setup. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first demonstration of high-fidelity state readout of superconducting qubits without a standalone cryogenic semiconductor LNA. This demonstration represents an important step in the realization of fully integrated large-scale cryogenic qubit control systems.

TI Composable security for inter-satellite continuous-variable quantum key
   distribution in the terahertz band
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Continuous-variable quantum key distribution (CVQKD) can be effectively compatible with off-the-shelf communication systems and has been proven to be the security against collective attacks in the finite-size regime and composability. In this paper, we classify three different trust levels for the loss and noise experienced by the sender and receiver. Based on these trust levels, we derive the composable finite-size security bounds of inter-satellite CVQKD in the terahertz (THz) band. We also show how these trust levels can nontrivially increase the composable secret key rates of THz-CVQKD and tolerate higher loss. Furthermore, the numerical simulations strongly support the feasibility of inter-satellite THz-CVQKD even in the worst trust level. This work provides an efficient path for building an inter-satellite quantum communication network. (C) 2022 Optica Publishing Group under the terms of the Optica Open Access Publishing Agreement

TI Topological Two-Dimensional Floquet Lattice on a Single Superconducting
   Qubit
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Current noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices constitute powerful platforms for analog quantum simulation. The exquisite level of control offered by state-of-the-art quantum computers make them especially promising to implement time-dependent Hamiltonians. We implement quasiperiodic driving of a single qubit in the IBM Quantum Experience and thus experimentally realize a temporal version of the half-Bernevig-Hughes-Zhang Chem insulator. Using simple error mitigation, we achieve consistently high fidelities of around 97%. From our data we can infer the presence of a topological transition, thus realizing an earlier proposal of topological frequency conversion by Martin, Refael, and Halperin. Motivated by these results, we theoretically study the many-qubit case, and show that one can implement a wide class of Floquet Hamiltonians, or time-dependent Hamiltonians in general. Our study highlights promises and limitations when studying many-body systems through multifrequency driving of quantum computers.

TI Protection of Quantum Information in a Chain of Josephson Junctions
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB Symmetry considerations are key to our understanding of the fundamental laws of nature. The presence of a symmetry implies that a physical system is invariant under specific transformations, and this invariance may have deep consequences. For instance, symmetry arguments state that a system will remain in its initial state if incentives to actions are equally balanced. Here, we apply this principle to a chain of qubits and show that it is possible to engineer the symmetries of its Hamiltonian in order to keep quantum information intrinsically protected from both relaxation and decoherence. We show that the coherence properties of this system are strongly enhanced relative to those of its individual components. Such a qubit chain can be realized using a simple architecture consisting of a relatively small number of superconducting Josephson junctions.

TI Improving source-in-the-middle continuous-variable quantum key
   distribution using a heralded hybrid linear amplifier
SO CHINESE PHYSICS B
AB A hybrid linear amplifier is inserted at the output of the source-in-the-middle distribution protocol to overcome the shortcomings of the transmission distance. The modified protocol aims to maintain a high key rate for long-distance transmission under high noise. It has the potential to significantly broaden the application range of the continuous variable quantum key distribution protocol. The effects of amplifier parameters and noise on the modified protocol are analyzed in detail with regard to applying it to a practical system. To make the simulation more realistic, the effect of finite size on the new protocol is taken into account. It will serve as a guideline for the future use of hybrid linear amplifiers. Different parameters can be adjusted to achieve the best performance for key rates of different quantum channels.

TI A hybrid algorithm for quadratically constrained quadratic optimization
   problems
SO PHYSICA SCRIPTA
AB Quadratically Constrained Quadratic Programs (QCQPs) are an important class of optimization problems with diverse real-world applications. In this work, we propose a variational quantum algorithm for general QCQPs. By encoding the variables in the amplitude of a quantum state, the requirement for the qubit number scales logarithmically with the dimension of the variables, which makes our algorithm suitable for current quantum devices. Using the primal-dual interior-point method in classical optimization, we can deal with general quadratic constraints. Our numerical experiments on typical QCQP problems, including Max-Cut and optimal power flow problems, demonstrate better performance of our hybrid algorithm over classical counterparts.

TI Integrable deformations of superintegrable quantum circuits
SO SCIPOST PHYSICS
AB Superintegrable models are very special dynamical systems: they possess more conservation laws than what is necessary for integrability. This severely constrains their dynamical processes, and it often leads to their exact solvability, even in non-equilibrium situations. In this paper we consider special Hamiltonian deformations of superintegrable quantum circuits. The deformations break superintegrability, but they preserve integrability. We focus on a selection of concrete models and show that for each model there is an (at least) one parameter family of integrable deformations. Our most interesting example is the so-called Rule54 model. We show that the model is compatible with a one parameter family of Yang-Baxter integrable spin chains with six-site interaction. Therefore, the Rule54 model does not have a unique integrability structure, instead it lies at the intersection of a family of quantum integrable models.

TI Optimum phase estimation with two control qubits
SO AVS QUANTUM SCIENCE
AB Phase estimation is used in many quantum algorithms, particularly in order to estimate energy eigenvalues for quantum systems. When using a single qubit as the probe (used to control the unitary we wish to estimate the eigenvalue of), it is not possible to measure the phase with a minimum mean-square error. In standard methods, there would be a logarithmic (in error) number of control qubits needed in order to achieve this minimum error. Here, we show how to perform this measurement using only two control qubits, thereby reducing the qubit requirements of the quantum algorithm. To achieve this task, we prepare the optimal control state one qubit at a time, at the same time as applying the controlled unitaries and inverse quantum Fourier transform. As each control qubit is measured, it is reset to | 0 > then entangled with the other control qubit, so only two control qubits are needed.

TI Improved Decoding of Circuit Noise and Fragile Boundaries of Tailored
   Surface Codes
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW X
AB Realizing the full potential of quantum computation requires quantum error correction (QEC), with most recent breakthrough demonstrations of QEC using the surface code. QEC codes use multiple noisy physical qubits to encode information in fewer logical qubits, enabling the identification of errors through a decoding process. This process increases the logical fidelity (or accuracy) making the computation more reliable. However, most fast (efficient run-time) decoders neglect important noise characteristics, thereby reducing their accuracy. In this work, we introduce decoders that are both fast and accurate, and can be used with a wide class of QEC codes including the surface code. Our decoders, named belief-matching and belief-find, exploit all noise information and thereby unlock higher accuracy demonstrations of QEC. Using the surface code threshold as a performance metric, we observe a threshold at 0.94% error probability for our decoders, outperforming the 0.82% threshold for a standard minimum-weight perfect matching decoder. We also test our belief-matching decoders in a theoretical case study of codes tailored to a biased noise model. We find that the decoders lead to a much higher threshold and lower qubit overhead in the tailored surface code with respect to the standard, square surface code. Surprisingly, in the well -below-threshold regime, the rectangular surface code becomes more resource efficient than the tailored surface code due to a previously unnoticed phenomenon that we call "fragile boundaries." Our decoders outperform all other fast decoders in terms of threshold and accuracy, enabling better results in current quantum-error-correction experiments and opening up new areas for theoretical case studies.

TI Expressibility, entangling power, and quantum average causal effect for
   causally indefinite circuits
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Parameterized quantum circuits are the core of new technologies such as variational quantum algorithms and quantum machine learning, which makes studying its properties a valuable task. We implement parameterized circuits with definite and indefinite causal order and compare their performance under particular descriptors. One of these is the expressibility, which measures how uniformly a given quantum circuit can reach the whole Hilbert space. Another property that we focus on this work is the entanglement capability, more specifically the concurrence and the entangling power. We also find the causal relation between the qubits of our system with the quantum average causal effect measure. We have found that indefinite circuits offer expressibility advantages over definite ones while maintaining the level of entanglement generation. Our results also point to the existence of a correlation between the quantum average causal effect and the entangling power.

TI Controlled Quantum Secure Direct Communication Based on Four-Qubit
   Cluster States and Quantum Search Algorithm

AB A controlled quantum secure direct communication protocol based on four-qubit cluster states and quantum search algorithm is put forward, in which four users, a sender, a receiver and two controllers, are involved in achieving the secure transmission of secret message. The four-qubit cluster state can ensure the feasibility and security of the protocol because of its large persistency of entanglement. Meanwhile, the idea of quantum search algorithm is used to accomplish the task of encoding and decoding secret message. The proposed protocol can successfully avoid the information leakage problem and resist some common attacks including the outsider attacks and the internal attacks, and its qubit efficiency is up to 20%. Furthermore, compared with the previous quantum secure direct communication protocols, it can effectively resist the attacks from the dishonest receiver.

TI Variational Learning for Quantum Artificial Neural Networks
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM ENGINEERING
AB In the past few years, quantum computing and machine learning fostered rapid developments in their respective areas of application, introducing new perspectives on how information processing systems can be realized and programmed. The rapidly growing field of quantum machine learning aims at bringing together these two ongoing revolutions. Here, we first review a series of recent works describing the implementation of artificial neurons and feedforward neural networks on quantum processors. We then present an original realization of efficient individual quantum nodes based on variational unsampling protocols. We investigate different learning strategies involving global and local layerwise cost functions, and we assess their performances also in the presence of statistical measurement noise. While keeping full compatibility with the overall memory-efficient feedforward architecture, our constructions effectively reduce the quantum circuit depth required to determine the activation probability of single neurons upon input of the relevant data-encoding quantum states. This suggests a viable approach toward the use of quantum neural networks for pattern classification on near-term quantum hardware.

TI Multivariate Goppa Codes
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION THEORY
AB In this paper, we introduce multivariate Goppa codes, which contain, as a particular case, the well-known classical Goppa codes. We provide a parity check matrix for a multivariate Goppa code in terms of a tensor product of generalized Reed-Solomon codes. We prove that multivariate Goppa codes are subfield subcodes of augmented Cartesian codes. By showing how this new family of codes relates to a tensor product of generalized Reed-Solomon codes and augmented codes, we obtain information about the parameters, subcodes, duals, and hulls of multivariate Goppa codes. We see that in some instances, the hulls of multivariate Goppa codes (resp., tensor product of generalized Reed-Solomon codes) are also multivariate Goppa codes (resp. tensor product of generalized Reed-Solomon codes). We utilize the multivariate Goppa codes to obtain entanglement-assisted quantum error-correcting codes and to build families of long LCD, self-dual, or self-orthogonal codes.

TI Detecting the event of a single photon loss on quantum signals
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS B-ATOMIC MOLECULAR AND OPTICAL PHYSICS
AB We design a scheme for detecting a single photon loss from multi-modal quantum signals transmitted via a fiber or in free space. This consists of a special type of unitary coding transformation, the parity controlled-squeezing, applied prior to the transmission on the signal composed by information and ancilla modes. At the receiver, the inverse unitary transformation is applied-decoding, and the ancilla mode is measured via photon detection. The outcome reveals whether a photon loss has occurred. Distortion of the information part of the signal caused by an ancilla photon loss can be corrected via unitary transformation while loss of a photon from the information part of the signal can be detected with the probability exponentially close to unity but cannot be corrected. In contrast to the schemes of decoherence free subspaces and quantum error correction protocols, this method allows one to make use in principle of entire Hilbert space dimensionality. We discuss possible ways of synthesizing the required encoding-decoding transformation.

TI Quantum gates robust to secular amplitude drifts
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Quantum gates are typically vulnerable to imperfections in the classical control fields applied to physical qubits to drive the gates. One approach to reduce this source of error is to break the gate into parts, known as composite pulses, that typically leverage the constancy of the error over time to mitigate its impact on gate fidelity. Here we extend this technique to suppress secular drifts in Rabi frequency by regarding them as sums of power-law drifts the first-order effects of which on over- or under-rotation of the state vector add linearly. Power-law drifts have the form tp where t is time and the constant p is its power. We show that composite pulses that suppress all power-law drifts with p n are also high-pass filters of filter ordern + 1 [H. Ball and M. J. Biercuk, Walsh-synthesized noise filters for quantum logic, EPJ Quantum Technol. 2, 11 (2015)]. We present sequences that satisfy our proposed power-law amplitude criteria, PLA(n), obtained with this technique, and compare their simulated performance under time-dependent amplitude errors to some traditional composite pulse sequences. We find that there is a range of noise frequencies for which the PLA(n) sequences provide more error suppression than the traditional sequences, but in the low-frequency limit nonlinear effects become more important for gate fidelity than frequency roll-off. As a result, the previously known F1 sequence, which is one of the two solutions to the PLA(1) criteria and furnishes suppression of both linear secular drift and the first-order nonlinear effects, is a sharper noise filter than any of the other PLA(n) sequences in the low-frequency limit.

TI Logical Blocks for Fault-Tolerant Topological Quantum Computation
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Logical gates constitute the building blocks of fault-tolerant quantum computation. While quantum error-corrected memories have been extensively studied in the literature, explicit constructions and detailed analyses of thresholds and resource overheads of universal logical gate sets have so far been limited. In this paper, we present a comprehensive framework for universal fault-tolerant logic motivated by the combined need for (i) platform-independent logical gate definitions, (ii) flexible and scalable tools for numerical analysis, and (iii) exploration of novel schemes for universal logic that improve resource overheads. Central to our framework is the description of logical gates holistically in a way that treats space and time on a similar footing. Focusing on instruments based on surface codes, we introduce explicit, but platform-independent representations of topological logic gates-called logical blocks-and generate new, overhead-efficient methods for universal quantum computation. As a specific example, we propose fault-tolerant schemes based on surface codes concatenated with more general low-density parity check (LDPC) codes, suggesting an alternative path toward LDPC-based quantum computation. The logical blocks framework enables a convenient software-based mapping from an abstract description of the logical gate to a precise set of physical instructions for executing both circuit-based and fusion-based quantum computation (FBQC). Using this, we numerically simulate a surface-code-based universal gate set implemented with FBQC, and verify that the threshold for fault-tolerant gates is consistent with the bulk threshold for memory. We find, however, that boundaries, defects, and twists can significantly impact the logical error rate scaling, with periodic boundary conditions potentially halving resource requirements. Motivated by the favorable logical error rate suppression for boundaryless computation, we introduce a novel computational scheme based on the teleportation of twists that may offer further resource reductions.

TI Classically Computing Performance Bounds on Depolarized Quantum Circuits
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Quantum computers and simulators can potentially outperform classical computers in finding ground states of classical and quantum Hamiltonians. However, if this advantage can persist in the presence of noise without error correction remains unclear. In this paper, by exploiting the principle of Lagrangian duality, we develop a numerical method to classically compute a certifiable lower bound on the minimum energy attainable by the output state of a quantum circuit in the presence of depolarizing noise. We provide theoretical and numerical evidence that this approach can provide circuit-architecture-dependent bounds on the performance of noisy quantum circuits.

TI Decoy state semi-quantum key distribution
SO EPJ QUANTUM TECHNOLOGY
AB Semi-quantum key distribution describes a system in which a fully quantum user and classical user perform key distribution. The main advantage of key distribution is its security. Owing to the bottlenecks of existing technology, highly attenuated lasers and threshold detectors are required for semi-quantum key distribution; however, these components make semi-quantum key distribution susceptible to eavesdroppers. Our previous study presented the first semi-quantum key distribution experiment and verified the feasibility of the mirror protocol in 2021. Herein, we first build a semi-quantum key distribution channel model and use Gottesman-Lo-Lutkenhaus-Preskill theory to evaluate its safety performance in the case of a quasi-single photon source. Moreover, we determine that an eavesdropper can steal all information through the photon-number-splitting attack without being detected. Therefore, we add decoy states to the semi-quantum key distribution to estimate the furthest transmission distance and secure bit rate under asymptotic conditions. Semi-quantum key distribution can still be achieved safely with highly attenuated lasers and threshold detectors in 150 km.

TI Thermal-dephasing-tolerant generation of mesoscopic superposition states
   with Rydberg dressed blockade
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Multipartite entangled states involving nonlocality are one of the most fascinating characteristics of quantum mechanics. In this work we propose a thermal-dephasing-tolerant generation of mesoscopic entangled states with Rydberg dressed atoms. We encode a logical state on dressed states rather than Rydberg states. Such treatment can increase the lifetime of multipartite entanglement coherence to around three times compared to the Rydbergstate-coding one at the same system size and therefore induce solid fidelities of mesoscopic superposition states generation. The current work theoretically verifies the advantages of using Rydberg dressed states in many-body quantum entanglement, which is helpful for large-scale quantum computation and many-body Rydberg quantum simulation.

TI Quantum walks on a programmable two-dimensional 62-qubit superconducting
   processor
SO SCIENCE
AB Quantum walks are the quantum mechanical analog of classical random walks and an extremely powerful tool in quantum simulations, quantum search algorithms, and even for universal quantum computing. In our work, we have designed and fabricated an 8-by-8 two-dimensional square superconducting qubit array composed of 62 functional qubits. We used this device to demonstrate high-fidelity single- and two-particle quantum walks. Furthermore, with the high programmability of the quantum processor, we implemented a Mach-Zehnder interferometer where the quantum walker coherently traverses in two paths before interfering and exiting. By tuning the disorders on the evolution paths, we observed interference fringes with single and double walkers. Our work is a milestone in the field, bringing future larger-scale quantum applications closer to realization for noisy intermediate-scale quantum processors.

TI Parametric longitudinal coupling between a high-impedance
   superconducting resonator and a semiconductor quantum dot
   singlet-triplet spin qubit
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Coupling qubits to a superconducting resonator provides a mechanism to enable long-distance entangling operations in a quantum computer based on spins in semiconducting materials. Here, we demonstrate a controllable spin-photon coupling based on a longitudinal interaction between a spin qubit and a resonator. We show that coupling a singlet-triplet qubit to a high-impedance superconducting resonator can produce the desired longitudinal coupling when the qubit is driven near the resonator's frequency. We measure the energy splitting of the qubit as a function of the drive amplitude and frequency of a microwave signal applied near the resonator antinode, revealing pronounced effects close to the resonator frequency due to longitudinal coupling. By tuning the amplitude of the drive, we reach a regime with longitudinal coupling exceeding 1 MHz. This mechanism for qubit-resonator coupling represents a stepping stone towards producing high-fidelity two-qubit gates mediated by a superconducting resonator.
   It has been predicted that longitudinal coupling between a qubit and a superconducting resonator can mediate efficient interactions among distant qubits. Here the authors implement such a coupling between a singlet-triplet qubit in a semiconductor double quantum dot and a high-impedance superconducting resonator.

TI Nonlocal quantum computing theory and Poincare cycle in spherical states
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Four new fundamental nonlocal quantum computing diagonal operator-state relations are derived which model the interaction between two adjacent atoms of an entangled atomic chain. Each atom possesses four eigen-states. These relations lead to four momentum-space cyclic transformations and are used as the computation states in one-dimensional cellular automaton. Four interacting half-observable periodic planar states appear with the same Poincare cycle. Due to the space-time rotational symmetry of these operator-state relations, a new type of periodic spherical state can be constructed consisting of eight finite space-time quadrants as the special quantum computing result.

TI Efficient and reliable detection of nonlocal quantum correlations in
   continuous-variable and hybrid states via random measurements
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB We investigate the violation of nonlocal realism using various entangled continues- and hybrid-variable states under dichotomic observables. In particular, we consider two cases of dichotomic observables (1) described by a pseudospin operator and (2) given in terms of the Wigner representation of the state in phase space, parity measurement and displacement operation. We address the recently proposed operational measure of nonlocality which describes the probability of local-realism violation under randomly sampled observables. We show the usefulness and limitations of the probability of local-realism violation for the detection of nonlocality. A simple procedure to detect such nonlocal correlations for randomly chosen settings with efficiencies of up to 100% is proposed. The practical advantage of applying random measurements that considerably lowers the experimental requirements is mentioned.

SO QUANTUM
AB We analyse the problem of transmitting a number of unknown quantum states or one composite system in one go. We derive a lower bound on the performance of such process, measured in the entanglement fidelity. The obtained bound is effectively computable and outperforms the explicit values of the entanglement fidelity calculated for the pre-existing variants of the port-based protocols, allowing for teleportation of a much larger amount of quantum information. The comparison with the exact, formulas and similar analysis for the probabilistic scheme is also discussed. In particular, we present the closed-form expressions for the entanglement fidelity and for the probability of success in the probabilistic scheme in the qubit case in the picture of the spin angular momentum.

TI Cryo-compatible opto-mechanical low-voltage phase-modulator integrated

SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Photonic integrated circuits (PICs) have enabled novel functionality in quantum optics, quantum information processing and quantum communication. PICs based on Silicon Nitride (Si3N4) provide low-loss passive components and are compatible with efficient superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors (SNSPDs). For realizing functional quantum photonic systems, the integration with active phase-shifters is needed which is challenging at the cryogenic temperatures needed for operating SNSPDs. Here we demonstrate a cryo-compatible phase shifter using a low-voltage opto-mechanical modulator and show joint operation with SNSPDs at 1.3 K. We achieve a half-wave voltage of 4.6 V, single-photon detection with 88% on-chip detection efficiency (OCDE) and a low timing jitter of 12.2 ps. Our approach allows for operating reconfigurable quantum photonic circuits with low dissipation in a cryogenic setting.

TI Directional detection of dark matter using solid-state quantum sensing
SO AVS QUANTUM SCIENCE
AB Next-generation dark matter (DM) detectors searching for weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs) will be sensitive to coherent scattering from solar neutrinos, demanding an efficient background-signal discrimination tool. Directional detectors improve sensitivity to WIMP DM despite the irreducible neutrino background. Wide-bandgap semiconductors offer a path to directional detection in a high-density target material. A detector of this type operates in a hybrid mode. The WIMP or neutrino-induced nuclear recoil is detected using real-time charge, phonon, or photon collection. The directional signal, however, is imprinted as a durable sub-micron damage track in the lattice structure. This directional signal can be read out by a variety of atomic physics techniques, from point defect quantum sensing to x-ray microscopy. In this Review, we present the detector principle as well as the status of the experimental techniques required for directional readout of nuclear recoil tracks. Specifically, we focus on diamond as a target material; it is both a leading platform for emerging quantum technologies and a promising component of next-generation semiconductor electronics. Based on the development and demonstration of directional readout in diamond over the next decade, a future WIMP detector will leverage or motivate advances in multiple disciplines toward precision dark matter and neutrino physics.

AB It is well known that no quantum error correcting code of rate R can correct adversarial errors on more than a (1-R)/4 fraction of symbols. But what if we only require our codes to approximately recover the message?
   In this work, we construct efficiently-decodable approximate quantum codes against adversarial error rates approaching the quantum Singleton bound of (1-R)/2, for any constant rate R. Specifically, for every R is an element of (0,1) and gamma > 0, we construct codes of rate R, message length k, and alphabet size 2(O(1/gamma 5)), that are efficiently decodable against a (1-R-gamma)/2 fraction of adversarial errors and recover the message up to inverse-exponential error 2(-Omega(k)).
   At a technical level, we use classical robust secret sharing and quantum purity testing to reduce approximate quantum error correction to a suitable notion of quantum list decoding. We then instantiate our notion of quantum list decoding by (i) introducing folded quantum Reed-Solomon codes, and (ii) applying a new, quantum version of distance amplification.

TI Cryogenic operation of NanoBridge at 4 K for controlling qubit
SO JAPANESE JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS
AB A nonvolatile resistive switching of NanoBridge(TM) (NB) at 4 K has been demonstrated for realizing the Quantum-classical interface (QCI), in which the challenging of reset operation at cryogenic temperature is successfully achieved. The set voltage of the NB is increased with decreasing temperature, saturated around 150 K and to be 2.55 V at 4 K. The on-state resistances tuned at 1 k-5 k omega show small temperature dependence down to 4 K due to high residual resistivity. The increased reset current of the NB at 4 K is compensated by the process optimization with thermal engineering and the increased I (dsat) of the select transistor at 4 K, resulting in stable switching. The low-power QCI featuring NBs is a strong candidate for controlling a large number of qubits at cryogenic temperature.

TI Characterizing two-mode-squeezed light from four-wave mixing in rubidium
   vapor for quantum sensing and information processing
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB We present a study of homodyne measurements of two-mode, vacuum-seeded, quadrature-squeezed light generated by four-wave mixing in warm rubidium vapor. Our results reveal that the vacuum squeezing can extend down to measurement frequencies of less than 1 Hz, and the squeezing bandwidth, similar to the seeded intensity-difference squeezing measured in this system, reaches up to approximately 20 MHz for typical pump parameters. By dividing the squeezing bandwidth into smaller frequency bins, we show that different sideband frequencies represent independent sources of two-mode squeezing. These properties are useful for quantum sensing and quantum information processing applications. We also investigate the impact of group velocity delays on the correlations in the system, which allows us to optimize the useful spectrum.

TI FPGA Implementation of Compact Hardware Accelerators for
   Ring-Binary-LWE-based Post-quantum Cryptography
SO ACM TRANSACTIONS ON RECONFIGURABLE TECHNOLOGY AND SYSTEMS
AB Post-quantum cryptography (PQC) has recently drawn substantial attention from various communities owing to the proven vulnerability of existing public-key cryptosystems against the attacks launched from well-established quantum computers. The Ring-Binary-Learning-with-Errors (RBLWE), a variant of Ring-LWE, has been proposed to build PQC for lightweight applications. As more Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) devices are being deployed in lightweight applications like Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices, it would be interesting if the RBLWE-based PQC can be implemented on the FPGA with ultra-low complexity and flexible processing. However, thus far, limited information is available for such implementations. In this article, we propose novel RBLWE-based PQC accelerators on the FPGA with ultra-low implementation complexity and flexible timing. We first present the process of deriving the key operation of the RBLWE-based scheme into the proposed algorithmic operation. The corresponding hardware accelerator is then efficiently mapped from the proposed algorithm with the help of algorithm-to-architecture implementation techniques and extended to obtain higher-throughput designs. The final complexity analysis and implementation results (on a variety of FPGAs) show that the proposed accelerators have significantly smaller area-time complexities than the state-of-the-art designs. Overall, the proposed accelerators feature low implementation complexity and flexible processing, making them desirable for emerging FPGA-based lightweight applications.

TI Constructing Qubit Edge States by Inverse-Designing the Electromagnetic
   Environment
SO ACS PHOTONICS
AB Building on advances in topological photonics and computational optimization, we inverse-design a periodic dielectric structure surrounding a chain of interacting qubits, emulating an extended, dimerized Su-Schrieffer-Heeger excitonic model. Our approach enables precise control over photon-mediated interactions, allowing us to explore the emergence of topological edge states in the qubit chain. By systematically tuning structural parameters to address both coherent evolution and dissipative effects, we demonstrate that edge states remain robust and isolated from the bulk, even in the presence of long-range coupling and disorder, and preserve key topological properties despite deviations from complete chiral symmetry preservation. This work highlights the potential of inverse design in stabilizing topological excitonic states, opening new possibilities for advanced quantum technologies.

TI Cutting-Edge Trajectory Optimization through Quantum Annealing
SO APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
AB This paper introduces an innovative approach to explore the capabilities of Quantum Annealing (QA) for trajectory optimization in dynamic systems. The proposed method involves transforming trajectory optimization problems into equivalent binary optimization problems using Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) representation. The procedure is general and adaptable, making it applicable to a wide range of optimal control problems that entail the satisfaction of dynamic, boundary, and path constraints. Specifically, the trajectory is discretized and approximated using polynomials. In contrast to the conventional approach of determining the polynomial degree (n) solely based on the number of boundary conditions, a specific factor is introduced in our method to augment the polynomial degree. As a result, the ultimate polynomial degree is calculated as a composite of two components: n = l + (m-1), where m denotes the count of boundary conditions and l signifies the number of independent variables. By leveraging inverse dynamics, the control required to follow the approximated trajectory can be determined as a linear function of independent variables l. As a result, the optimization function, which is represented by the integral of the square of the control, can be formulated as a QUBO problem and the QA is employed to find the optimal binary solutions.

TI High performance and tunable optical pump-rejection filter for quantum
   photonic systems
SO OPTICS AND LASER TECHNOLOGY
AB Integrated photonic circuits have become an attractive platform for the quantum information processing, paving the way for quantum information management with scalable device. In this context, silicon photonics represents the most mature technology to implement the quantum system functionalities, due to its large scalability and compatibility with CMOS technology. Efficient photon-pairs sources based on Spontaneous Four-Wave Mixing (SFWM) and high-performance photodetector have been already demonstrated. The efficient detection of photon-pairs requires a pump filter at the photodetector, preserving the signal-idler pair. Thus, filters with high Extinction Ratio (ER), low Insertion Loss (IL) and narrow rejection Bandwidth (BW) are needed. Here, we propose the design of an ultra-high-performance rejection filter, based on a silicon dual-loaded single input/output Mach-Zehnder Interferometer (MZI), with one branch coupled to a Ring Resonator (RR) and the other to three serially coupled RRs forming a Coupled Optical Resonator Waveguide (CROW). Very high performance (ER = 150.55 dB, IL = 0.104 dB, BW = 0.243 nm), within a footprint of 60 mu m = 160 mu m, has been calculated, demonstrating its suitability for an efficient suppression of the pump signal. The filter response is also thermooptically tuneable in a 6 MHz range, with a reconfigurability time of about 8 mu s.

TI Quantum Annealing in the NISQ Era: Railway Conflict Management
SO ENTROPY
AB We are in the noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices' era, in which quantum hardware has become available for application in real-world problems. However, demonstrations of the usefulness of such NISQ devices are still rare. In this work, we consider a practical railway dispatching problem: delay and conflict management on single-track railway lines. We examine the train dispatching consequences of the arrival of an already delayed train to a given network segment. This problem is computationally hard and needs to be solved almost in real time. We introduce a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) model of this problem, which is compatible with the emerging quantum annealing technology. The model's instances can be executed on present-day quantum annealers. As a proof-of-concept, we solve selected real-life problems from the Polish railway network using D-Wave quantum annealers. As a reference, we also provide solutions calculated with classical methods, including the conventional solution of a linear integer version of the model as well as the solution of the QUBO model using a tensor network-based algorithm. Our preliminary results illustrate the degree of difficulty of real-life railway instances for the current quantum annealing technology. Moreover, our analysis shows that the new generation of quantum annealers (the advantage system) does not perform well on those instances, either.

TI Upper Bounds on Device-Independent Quantum Key Distribution Rates in
   Static and Dynamic Scenarios
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB In this work, we develop upper bounds on key rates for device-independent quantum key distribution (DI-QKD) protocols and devices. We study the reduced cc-squashed entanglement and show that it is a convex functional. As a result, we show that the convex hull of the currently known bounds is a tighter upper bound on the device-independent key rates of the standard Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (CHSH)-based protocol. We further provide tighter bounds for DI-QKD key rates achievable by any protocol applied to the CHSH-based device. This bound is based on reduced relative entropy of entanglement optimized over decompositions into local and nonlocal parts. In the dynamical scenario of quantum channels, we obtain upper bounds for device-independent private capacity for the CHSH-based protocols. We show that the device-independent private capacity for the CHSH-based protocols on depolarizing and erasure channels is limited by the secret key capacity of dephasing channels.

TI Improving cold-atom sensors with quantum entanglement: Prospects and

SO APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS
AB Quantum entanglement has been generated and verified in cold-atom experiments and used to make atom-interferometric measurements below the shot-noise limit. However, current state-of-the-art cold-atom devices exploit separable (i.e., unentangled) atomic states. This perspective piece asks the question: can entanglement usefully improve cold-atom sensors, in the sense that it gives new sensing capabilities unachievable with current state-of-the-art devices? We briefly review the state-of-the-art in precision cold-atom sensing, focusing on clocks and inertial sensors, identifying the potential benefits entanglement could bring to these devices, and the challenges that need to be overcome to realize these benefits. We survey demonstrated methods of generating metrologically useful entanglement in cold-atom systems, note their relative strengths and weaknesses, and assess their prospects for near-to-medium term quantum-enhanced cold-atom sensing.

TI The Status of Quantum-Key-Distribution-Based Long-Term Secure Internet
   Communication
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SUSTAINABLE COMPUTING
AB A large amount of sensitive data must remain accessible for decades or even centuries (e.g, electronic health records, governmental documents). Communicating such data over the Internet requires long-term secure communication channels, which, in turn, require robust key distribution protocols. Currently used key distribution protocols, however, are not designed for long-term security. Their security is either threatened by quantum computers, or, in principle, due to their reliance on computational problems. Quantum key distribution (QKD) protocols are information-theoretically secure and thereby offer long-term security against computational attacks. However, significant obstacles to their real-world use remain. This position paper, which is a multidisciplinary effort of computer scientists and physicists, systematizes knowledge about challenges of and strategies for realizing long-term secure Internet communication from QKD. We first analyze the performance and security of existing point-to-point QKD technology. Then, we discuss several approaches to enabling QKD in large-scale multi-user networks. Finally, we list important challenges that need to be addressed in order to make QKD-based long-term secure communication on the Internet practical.

Then, we perform a classical demonstration, dubbed a pseudoquantum simulation, on a GPU simulator. We obtain useful results on this model, which suggest the topological properties of the deconfined phase and help to clarify the phase diagram. It is suggested that the tricitical point, where the second-order critical lines of deconfinement-confinement transition and of deconfinement-Higgs transition meet, seems to be on the first-order critical line of confinement-Higgs transition, at a point other than the end of this critical line.

TI Quantum sensing enhancement through a nuclear spin register in
   nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond
SO APPLIED PHYSICS REVIEWS
AB Quantum sensing has witnessed rapid development and transition from laboratories to practical applications in the past decade. Applications of quantum sensors, ranging from nanotechnologies to biosensing, are expected to benefit from quantum sensors' unprecedented spatial resolution and sensitivity. Solid-state spin systems are particularly attractive platforms for quantum sensing technologies because room temperature operation is viable while reaching the quantum limits of sensitivity. Among various solid-state spin systems, nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond demonstrated high-fidelity initialization, coherent control, and high contrast readout of the electron spin state. However, electron spin coherence due to noise from the surrounding spin bath and this environment effect limits the sensitivity of NV centers. Thus, a critical task in NV center-based quantum sensing is sensitivity enhancement through coherence protection. Several strategies, such as dynamical decoupling techniques, feedback control, and nuclear spin-assisted sensing protocols, have been developed and realized for this task. Among these strategies, nuclear spin-assisted protocols have demonstrated greater enhancement of electron spin coherence. In addition, the electron and nuclear spin pair of an NV center in diamond naturally allows the application of the nuclear spin-assisted sensitivity enhancement protocol. Owing to long nuclear coherence times, further enhancement of sensitivity can be achieved by exploiting active nuclear spins (e.g., 14N, 13C) in the proximity of an NV center as memory ancillas when coupled with the NV center. Here, we review the spin properties of NV centers, mechanisms of the nuclear spin-assisted protocol and its gate variation, and the status of quantum sensing applications in high-resolution nuclear spin spectroscopy, atomic imaging, and magnetic field sensing. We discuss the potential for commercialization, current challenges in sensitivity enhancement, and conclude with future research directions for promoting the development of nuclear spin-assisted protocol and its integration into industrial applications.

TI Universal quantum obfuscation for quantum non-linear functions
SO FRONTIERS IN PHYSICS
AB Research on quantum cryptography has burgeoned in the recent decades and combined quantum mechanics and cryptography theory. Among the existing quantum cryptographic primitives, quantum obfuscation is an emergent force to be reckoned with. Quantum obfuscation means obfuscating a circuit by quantum mechanics to improve security. It is used to hide functionality and prevent the reverse engineering of quantum circuits. However, research studies on the construction of quantum obfuscation are relatively immature due to its difficulty in implementation and application. Also, the obfuscation for quantum non-linear functions has not been suggested yet, although quantum non-linear functions cover a wide range of quantum functions that can be obfuscated. In this paper, we initiate a universal definition of quantum obfuscation which utilizes quantum teleportation to construct an obfuscator and interpreter for quantum non-linear functions. Furthermore, we demonstrate the validity of applying the obfuscation to the quantum asymmetric encryption scheme and rigorously prove that the encryption realized by quantum obfuscation satisfies IND (indistinguishability)-security. This work provides a positive possibility of quantum obfuscation for quantum non-linear functions and will complement the theory of both quantum obfuscation and quantum asymmetric encryption.

AB Quantum entanglement is the core of quantum physics, which is a part of theoretical physics. This theory is once assumed to be the hope of faster-than-light communication. If the technique is achievable, it would be a great breakthrough in the field of physics. I went through the development history of quantum entanglement and conclude it, which is the main stuff I write about in this article, as it involves many differing and sometimes contradictory opinion of physicists. The main part of my research depends on articles about quantum mechanics. I read them first and extracted the relevant contents to form a complete timeline of development. During my exploration, a conclusion of faster-than-light communication is impossible is arose.

TI Effective nonlocal parity-dependent couplings in qubit chains
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB For the efficient implementation of quantum algorithms, practical ways to generate many-body entanglement are a basic requirement. Specifically, coupling multiple qubit pairs at once can be advantageous and may provide multiqubit operations useful in the construction of hardware-tailored algorithms. Here we extend the theory of fractional state transfer and harness the simultaneous coupling of qubits on a chain to engineer a set of nonlocal parity-dependent quantum operations suitable for a wide range of applications. The resulting effective long-range couplings directly implement a parametrizable Trotter-step for Jordan-Wigner fermions, and they can be used for simulations of quantum dynamics, efficient state generation in variational quantum eigensolvers, parity measurements for error-correction schemes, and the generation of efficient multiqubit gates. Moreover, we present numerical simulations of the gate operation in a superconducting quantum circuit architecture, which show a high gate fidelity for realistic experimental parameters.

TI Probing quantum entanglement from quantum correction to newtonian
   potential energy
SO PHYSICA SCRIPTA
AB Inspired by string theory ideas, we probe quantum entanglement from the gravitational potential energy. Concretely, we reconsider the study of quantum corrections to the Newtonian potential energy by treating a massive two-particle system m 1 and m 2 with size dimensions r 1 ad r 2 where the two particles separated by a distance d are under only their mutual classical gravitational interaction Vrr1,r2 . Exploring such a size-dependent gravitational behavior and taking the limit r 1, r 2 MUCH LESS-THAN d, we investigate the associated quantum biparticle state and express its evolution after an interaction time tau. Among others, we show that the two masses cannot be separable due to the induced gravitational entanglement in terms of the accumulated quantum phase delta phi = delta V g tau/PLANCK CONSTANT OVER TWO PI. By analogy with the classical gravity, we derive the expression of the resulting extremely weak entanglement force from the corresponding gravitational entanglement energy. Then, we provide certain entanglement diagnostics.

TI Distributed geometric quantum computation based on the
   optimized-control-technique in a cavity-atom system via exchanging
   virtual photons
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB We propose a scheme for quantum geometric computation on a fiber-cavity-fiber system, in which two atoms are located in two single-mode cavities, respectively, connected with each other by optical fiber. This scheme not only has the feature of virtual excitation of photons in the cavity quantum electrodynamics (CQED) that can reduce the effect of decay effectively but also has the advantage of geometric phase to withstand noises due to its built-in noise-resilience feature and robust merit. Specifically, our proposal combined with optimized-control-technology (OCT) can reduce gate operation error by adjusting the time-dependent amplitude and phase of the resonant field which further enhances the robustness of the quantum operation. The robustness against decoherence is demonstrated numerically and the scheme may be applied in the remote quantum information processing tasks and quantum computation.

TI Structure design and logical CNOT implementation of multi-logical-qubits
   surface code
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB As its parallel processing ability, quantum computing has an exponential acceleration over classical computing. However, quantum systems are fragile and susceptible to noise. Quantum error correction code is an effective means to overcome quantum noise. Quantum surface codes are topologically stable subcodes that have great potential for large-scale fault-tolerant quantum computing because of their structural nearest neighbor characteristics and high fault-tolerance thresholds. The existing boundary-based surface codes can encode one logical qubit. This paper mainly studies how to implement multi-logical-qubits encoding based on the boundary, including designing the structure of the surface code, finding out the corresponding stabilizers and logical operations according to the structure, and further designing the coding circuit based on the stabilizers. After research on the single qubit CNOT implementation principle based on measurement and correcting and the logic CNOT implementation based on fusion and segmentation, we further optimized implementation scheme of the logic CNOT implementation based on fusion and segmentation. The scheme is extended to the designed multi-logical-qubits surface code to realize the CNOT operation between the multi-logical-qubits surface codes, and the correctness of the quantum circuit is verified by simulation. The multi-logical-qubits surface code designed in this paper overcomes the disadvantage that the single-logical-qubit surface code can not be densely embedded in the quantum chip, improves the length of some logical operations, and increases the fault tolerance ability. The idea of joint measurement reduces the requirement for ancilla qubits and reduces the demand for quantum resources in the implementation process.

TI QVM: Quantum Gate Virtualization Machine
SO PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACM ON PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES-PACMPL
AB We present the Quantum Gate Virtualization Machine (QVM), an end-to-end generic system for scalable execution of large quantum circuits with high fidelity on noisy and small quantum processors (QPUs) by leveraging gate virtualization. QVM exposes a virtual circuit intermediate representation (IR) that extends the notion of quantum circuits to incorporate gate virtualization. Based on the virtual circuit as our IR, we propose the QVM compiler-an extensible compiler infrastructure to transpile a virtual circuit through a series of modular optimization passes to produce a set of optimized circuit fragments. Lastly, these transpiled circuit fragments are executed on QPUs using our QVM runtime-a scalable and parallel infrastructure to virtualize and execute circuit fragments on a set of QPUs. We evaluate QVM on IBM's 7-and 27-qubit QPUs. Our evaluation shows that our approach allows for the execution of circuits with up to double the number of qubits compared to the qubit-count of a QPU, while improving fidelity by 4.7x on average compared to larger QPUs and that we can effectively reduce circuit depths to only 40% of the original circuit depths.

TI Quantum gates between distant atoms mediated by a Rydberg excitation
   antiferromagnet
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB We present a novel protocol for implementing quantum gates between distant atomic qubits connected by an array of neutral atoms that play the role of a quantum bus. The protocol is based on adiabatically transferring the atoms in the array to an antiferromagnetic-like state of Rydberg excitations using chirped laser pulses. Upon exciting and deexciting the atoms in the array under the blockage of nearest neighbors, depending on the state of the two qubits, the system acquires a conditional geometric pi-phase, while the dynamical phase cancels exactly, even when the atomic positions are disordered but nearly frozen in time, which requires sufficiently low temperatures. With experimentally relevant parameters, using smooth pulses minimizing the Rydberg-state decay and nonadiabatic errors, we obtain the gate times of 2-3 mu s and gate fidelities of 0.99-0.98 for a pair of atoms separated by L = 20-30 mu m and connected by a quantum bus of several (three to six) atoms. Optimizing the pulses, we can obtain faster gates exhibiting even better fidelities than those with smooth adiabatic pulses.

TI Quantum teleportation by utilizing helical spin chains for sharing
   entanglement
SO QUANTUM INFORMATION PROCESSING
AB We develop a new protocol for sharing entanglement (one ebit) between two parties using the natural dynamics of helical multiferroic spin chains. We introduce a novel kicking scheme of the electric field for enhancing the teleportation fidelity in our protocol that works in the presence of an appropriate choice of parameters. We also investigate the effect of a common spin environment causing decoherence in the entanglement sharing channel. We compare the results to that of XXZ and XX models subject to a similar entanglement sharing protocol and find that the helical multiferroic chain with the kicking scheme provides a better singlet fraction. We show that the kicking scheme in conjugation with the optimized parameters enhances the fidelity of teleportation even in the presence of impurities and/or decoherence. The advantage of the kicking scheme shown in the impurity cases is an important result to be useful in a realizable setup of helical multiferroic spin chain.

TI Natural Evolutionary Gradient Descent Strategy for Variational Quantum
   Algorithms
SO INTELLIGENT COMPUTING
AB Recent research has demonstrated that parametric quantum circuits (PQCs) are affected by gradients that progressively vanish to zero as a function of the number of qubits. We show that using a combination of gradient-free natural evolutionary strategy and gradient descent can mitigate the possibility of optimizing barren plateaus in the landscape. We implemented 2 specific methods: natural evolutionary strategy stochastic gradient descent (NESSGD) and natural evolutionary strategy adapting the step size according to belief in observed gradients (NESAdaBelief) to optimize PQC parameter values. They were compared with standard stochastic gradient descent, adaptive moment estimation, and a version of adaptive moment estimation adapting the step size according to belief in observed gradients in 5 classification tasks. NESSGD and NESAdaBelief demonstrated some superiority in 4 of the tasks. NESAdaBelief showed higher accuracy than AdaBelief in all 5 tasks. In addition, we investigated the applicability of NESSGD under the parameter shift rule and demonstrated that NESSGD can adapt to this rule, which means that our proposed method could also optimize the parameters of PQCs on quantum computers.

TI Randomized benchmarking with leakage errors
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Leakage errors are unwanted transfer of population outside of a defined computational subspace and they occur in almost every platform for quantum computing. While prevalent, leakage is often overlooked when measuring and reporting the fidelity of quantum gates with standard methods. In fact, when leakage is substantial it can cause a large overestimation of fidelity from the typical method used to measure fidelity, randomized benchmarking. We provide several methods for properly estimating fidelity in the presence of leakage errors that are applicable in different error regimes with carefully chosen sequence lengths. Then, we numerically demonstrate the methods for two-qubit randomized benchmarking, which often have the largest errors. Finally, we reanalyze previously shared data from Quantinuum systems with some of the methods provided.

TI Mitigating cosmic-ray-like correlated events with a modular quantum
   processor
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB Quantum processors based on superconducting qubits are being scaled to larger qubit numbers, enabling the implementation of small-scale quantum error-correction codes. However, catastrophic chip-scale correlated errors have been observed in these processors, attributed to, e.g., cosmic ray impacts, which challenge conventional error-correction codes such as the surface code. These events are characterized by a temporary but pronounced suppression of the qubit-energy relaxation times. Here, we explore the potential for modular quantum computing architectures to mitigate such correlated energy decay events. We measure cosmic-ray-like events in a quantum processor comprising a motherboard and two flip-chip bonded daughterboard modules, each module containing two superconducting qubits. We monitor the appearance of correlated qubit decay events within a single module and across the physically separated modules. We find that while decay events within one module are strongly correlated (over 85%), events in separate modules only display approximately 2% correlations. We also report coincident decay events in the motherboard and in either of the two daughterboard modules, providing further insight into the nature of these decay events. These results suggest that modular architectures, combined with bespoke errorcorrection codes, offer a promising approach for protecting future quantum processors from chip-scale correlated errors.

TI Multi-mode global driving of trapped ions for quantum circuit synthesis
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB We study the use of global drives with multiple frequency components to improve the efficiency of trapped ion quantum simulations and computations. We show that such 'multi-mode' global drives, when combined with a linear number of single-qubit rotations, generate universal Ising-type interactions with shorter overall runtimes than corresponding two-qubit gate implementations. Further, we show how this framework may be extended to efficiently generate n-body interactions between any subset n of the ion qubits. Finally, we apply these techniques to encode the Quantum Fourier Transform using quadratically-fewer entangling operations, with quadratically smaller runtime, compared with traditional approaches.

SO CHINESE PHYSICS B
AB Combining a Ti-diffusion periodically poled lithium niobate (PPLN) waveguide with a Sagnac interferometer, two opposite directions type-II spontaneous parametric down conversions (SPDC) occur coherently and yield a high brightness, high stability polarization entanglement source. The source produces degenerate photon pairs at 1540.4 nm with a brightness of B = (1.36 +/- 0.03) x 10(6) pairs/(s.nm .mW). We perform quantum state tomography to reconstruct the density matrix of the output state and obtain a fidelity of F = 0.983 +/- 0.001. The high brightness and phase stability of our waveguide source enable a wide range of quantum information experiments operating at a low pump power as well as hold the advantage in mass production which can promote the practical applications of quantum technologies.

TI Creating quantum correlations in generalized entanglement swapping
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We study how different types of quantum correlations can be established as the consequence of a generalized entanglement swapping protocol where, starting from two Bell pairs (1,2) and (3,4), a general quantum measurement [denoted by a positive operator-valued measure (POVM)] is performed on the pair (2,3), which results in creating quantum correlation in (1,4) shared between two spatially separated observers. Contingent upon using different kinds of POVMs, we show generation or destruction of different quantum correlations in the pairs (1,4), (1,2), and (3,4). This thus reflects nontrivial transfer of quantum correlations from the pairs (1,2) and (3,4) to the pair (1,4). As an offshoot, this paper provides an operational tool to generate different types of single parameter families of quantum correlated states [for example, entangled but not Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) steerable, or EPR steerable but not Bell nonlocal, or Bell nonlocal] by choosing different quantum measurements in the basic entanglement swapping setup. We further extend our paper by taking mixed initial states shared by the pairs (1,2) and (3,4). Finally, we study network nonlocality in our scenario. Here, we find the appropriate POVM measurement for which the generated correlation demonstrates or does not demonstrate network nonlocality for the whole range of the measurement parameter.

TI Research progress of integrated photonic quantum simulation*
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB Quantum simulation is to use a controllable quantum system to simulate other complicated or hard-tocontrol quantum system, and to deal with some complex unknown quantum systems that cannot be simulated on classical computers due to the exponential explosion of the Hilbert space. Among different kinds of physical realizations of quantum simulation, integrated optical systems have emerged as an appropriate platform in recent years due to the advantages of flexible control, weak decoherence, and no interaction in optical systems. In this review, we attempt to introduce some of the basic models used for quantum simulation in integrated photonic systems. This review article is organized as follows. In Section 2, we introduce the commonly used material platforms for integrated quantum simulation, including the silicon-based, lithium niobate-based integrated circuits, and the femtosecond laser direct writing optical waveguides. Several integrated optical platforms such as the coupled waveguide arrays, photonic crystals, coupled resonator arrays, and multiport interferometers are also introduced. In Section 3, we focus on the analog quantum simulations in the integrated photonic platform, including Anderson localization of light in disordered systems, various kinds of topological insulators, nonlinear and non-Hermitian systems. More specifically, in Subsection 3.1, we present the integrated photonic realizations of disordered and quasi-periodic systems. In Subsection 3.2, we review the integrated photonic realizations of the topological insulators with and without time-reversal symmetry, including Floquet topological insulators, quantum spin hall system, anomalous quantum hall system, valley hall system, SuSchrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model, and photonic topological Anderson insulators. Besides, topological insulator lasers and topologically protected quantum photon sources are briefly reviewed. In Subsection 3.3, we review the nonlinear and non-Hermitian integrated optical systems. In Section 4 we present the integrated digital quantum simulations based on the multiport interferometers, including the discrete-time quantum random walk, Boson sampling, and molecular simulation. In Section 5, we summarize the content of the article and present the outlook on the future perspectives of the integrated photonic quantum simulation. We believe that the integrated photonic platforms will continue to provide an excellent platform for quantum simulation. More practical applications will be found based on this system through combining the fields of topological photonics, laser technologies, quantum information, nonlinear and non-Hermitian physics.

TI Latent optical nonclassicality of conditionally prepared states
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB The lack of information obtained from informationally incomplete quantum measurements can prevent the detection of quantum resources, such as optical nonclassicality. We develop a technique that overcomes this limitation for single-mode quantum states conditionally prepared through measurements on another mode of a two-mode state. This task is performed by testing steering of latent nonclassicality-a class of correlations beyond quantum entanglement and quantum discord-for which we introduce a rigorous description.

TI Calibration and cancellation of microwave crosstalk in superconducting
   circuits
SO CHINESE PHYSICS B
AB The precise control and manipulation of the qubit state are vital for quantum simulation and quantum computation. In superconducting circuits, one notorious error comes from the crosstalk of microwave signals applied to different qubit control lines. In this work, we present a method for the calibration and cancellation of the microwave crosstalk and experimentally demonstrate its effectiveness in a superconducting 10-qubit chain. The method is convenient and efficient especially for calibrating the microwave crosstalk with large amplitudes and variations, which can be performed successively to reduce the microwave crosstalk by two to three orders. The qubit chain with microwave driving is governed by one-dimensional (1D) Bose-Hubbard model in transverse field, which is nonintegrable and shows thermalization behaviour during the time evolution from certain initial states. Such thermalization process is observed with excellent agreement between experiment and theory further confirming the effective global cancellation of the microwave crosstalk.

TI Comparing QUBO models for quantum annealing: integer encodings for
   permutation problems
SO INTERNATIONAL TRANSACTIONS IN OPERATIONAL RESEARCH
AB QUBO (quadratic unconstrained binary optimization) has become the modeling language for quantum annealing and quantum-inspired annealing solvers. We present different approaches in QUBO for the magic square problem and the quadratic assignment problem (QAP), which can be modeled by linear equations and a permutation constraint over integer variables. Different ways of encoding integers by Booleans in QUBO amount to models, the implementation of which could have very different performance. Experiments performed on the Fixstars Amplify Annealer Engine, a quantum-inspired annealing solver, show that, compared to the classical one-hot encoding, using unary encoding for integers performs slightly better for the QAP and much better for magic square.

TI Exact electronic states with shallow quantum circuits from global
   optimisation
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Quantum computers promise to revolutionise molecular electronic simulations by overcoming the exponential memory scaling. While electronic wave functions can be represented using a product of fermionic unitary operators, the best ansatz for strongly correlated electronic systems is far from clear. In this contribution, we construct universal wave functions from gate-efficient, spin symmetry-preserving fermionic operators by introducing an algorithm that globally optimises the wave function in the discrete ansatz design and continuous parameter spaces. Our approach maximises the accuracy that can be obtained with near-term quantum circuits and provides a practical route for designing ansatze in the future. Numerical simulations for strongly correlated molecules, including water and molecular nitrogen, and the condensed-matter Hubbard model, demonstrate the improved accuracy of gate-efficient quantum circuits for simulating strongly correlated chemistry.

TI Analysis of a Programmable Quantum Annealer as a Random Number Generator
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION FORENSICS AND SECURITY
AB Quantum devices offer a highly useful function - that is generating random numbers in a non-deterministic way since the measurement of a quantum state is not deterministic. This means that quantum devices can be constructed that generate qubits in a uniform superposition and then measure the state of those qubits. If the preparation of the qubits in a uniform superposition is unbiased, then quantum computers can be used to create high entropy, secure random numbers. Typically, preparing and measuring such quantum systems requires more time compared to classical pseudo random number generators (PRNGs) which are inherently deterministic algorithms. Therefore, the typical use of quantum random number generators (QRNGs) is to provide high entropy secure seeds for PRNGs. Quantum annealing (QA) is a type of analog quantum computation that is a relaxed form of adiabatic quantum computation and uses quantum fluctuations in order to search for ground state solutions of a programmable Ising model. Here we present extensive experimental random number results from a D-Wave 2000Q quantum annealer, totaling over 20 billion bits of QA measurements, which is significantly larger than previous D-Wave QA random number generator studies. Current quantum annealers are susceptible to noise from environmental sources and calibration errors, and are not in general unbiased samplers. Therefore, it is of interest to quantify whether noisy quantum annealers can effectively function as an unbiased QRNG. The amount of data that was collected from the quantum annealer allows a comprehensive analysis of the random bits to be performed using the NIST SP 800-22 Rev 1a testsuite, as well as min-entropy estimates from NIST SP 800-90B. The randomness tests show that the generated random bits from the D-Wave 2000Q are biased, and not unpredictable random bit sequences. With no server-side sampling post-processing, the 1 microsecond annealing time measurements had a min-entropy of 0.824.

AB We developed the previously proposed theoretical framework based on the quantum field theory of open systems applied to neutrinos. Within this framework we have considered the neutrino evolution and neutrino flavour oscillations taking into account for the decay of a heavier neutrino state to a lighter neutrino state and to a massless particle, namely photons, dark photons, axion-like particles and gravitons. We have shown that the neutrino evolution accounting for the decays will be governed by the Lindblad master equation, in which the decoherence parameters are proportional to the neutrino decay rate.

TI High-fidelity storage and on-demand retrieval of quantum states via a
   microwave waveguide
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB On-demand quantum memory is an important step towards practical applications in various quantuminformation tasks such as long-distance entanglement distribution, quantum computation, and quantumnetworks. In this work, based on stimulated Raman adiabatic passage (STIRAP) protocol, we introduce acontrollable delay between the reading pulse and writing pulse so that the quantum state can be stored in thesuperconducting waveguide and finally retrieved on demand with high fidelity. Through systematic numericalsimulations, we find that if the duration of the writing pulse is set to be in a certain range, the readout unit iscapable of retrieving the quantum state stored in the waveguide with high fidelity at any moment after acritical time. Moreover, we also investigate the robustness of our protocol, and find that the fidelity is robust against both the average number of thermal photons in the waveguide and the duration of the reading pulse. The numerical results also show that the pulse area in our protocol is only about one third of that in the original STIRAP protocol. Our protocol provides a practical way to combine the advantages of both on-demand quantum memory and the STIRAP protocol

TI Superdense Coding, Teleportation Algorithms, and Bell's Inequality Test
   in Qiskit and IBM Circuit Composer
SO ELECTRICA
AB Quantum teleportation is a technique of sending information from one place to another place. Distance between two points can be hundreds of thousands of light-years. For quantum teleportation, there is no need for a channel between two points when sending a state vector from one place to another. Since classical information sharing is possible, it is also possible to send a state vector from one place to another place. Teleportation is the transfer of a quantum state from one place to another through classical channels. Superdense coding, a dual to teleportation, uses a single quantum bit to transmit two bits classical information. Superdense coding uses a qubit to transfer two classical bits, while teleportation performs one qubit transfer using two classical bits. In this article, teleportation, superdense coding algorithms, and the Bell's inequality test in which Bell's inequality is violated with quantum mechanics are performed on both Qiskit and International Business Machines circuit composer, and results are compared and presented in detail. The results revealed that whether a faster-than-light signal transfer is possible using quantum mechanics depends on whether a copy of the quantum state is created or not. Finally, Bell's inequality created by classical logic violated by quantum mechanics is shown by experimental results.

TI Low-symmetry vacancy-related spin qubit in hexagonal boron nitride
SO NPJ COMPUTATIONAL MATERIALS
AB Point defect qubits in semiconductors have demonstrated their outstanding capabilities for high spatial resolution sensing generating broad multidisciplinary interest. Hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) hosting point defect qubits have recently opened up new horizons for quantum sensing by implementing sensing foils. The sensitivity of point defect sensors in hBN is currently limited by the linewidth of the magnetic resonance signal, which is broadened due to strong hyperfine couplings. Here, we report on a vacancy-related spin qubit with an inherently low symmetry configuration, the VB2 center, giving rise to a reduced magnetic resonance linewidth at zero magnetic fields. The VB2 center is also equipped with a classical memory that can be utilized for storing population information. Using scanning transmission electron microscopy imaging, we confirm the existence of the VB2 configuration in free-standing monolayer hBN.

AB Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) is a mechanism that allows two entities to agree on a secret key over a quantum channel. Recently, commercially viable QKD technology appeared on the market and the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) established a working group to standardize QKD for commercial applications. Several testbeds and pre-commercial QKD networks are being deployed in the world, all requiring sophisticated control mechanisms to enable key exchanges between non-adjacent nodes for remote applications. In this paper, we implement and evaluate a prototype that realizes the architecture defined by ETSI and uses trusted relay nodes to exchange keys between non-adjacent nodes. In particular, we present the Software-Defined Network (SDN) Controller and the Software-Defined QKD nodes designed to control the QKD experimental testbed in Milan, named PoliQI. We test the proposed prototype in an emulation environment, showing its advantages in inter-datacenter communication scenarios in terms of key delivery time and application acceptance ratio.

TI Simulation of Quantum Discrete Cosine Transform for Grayscale Image
   Compression Using Qiskit
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB The Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) is an integral part of classical image compression, which becomes the basis of the JPEG standard. With advances in quantum computing, there is growing interest in exploring quantum analogues of classical algorithms for such transforms. This paper presents a simulation of the Quantum Discrete Cosine Transform (QDCT) using the Qiskit Python library, applied to standard grayscale images segmented into 8 x 8 and 4 x 4 blocks. The QDCT algorithm is formulated as a unitary operator and evaluated using state-vector simulation. Due to the current constraints of quantum hardware and challenges in circuit synthesis, this study focused on simulation results, as direct quantum circuit measurement leads to amplitude collapse and unusable output. The performance of QDCT is quantitative compared to classical DCT using Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR), Structural Similarity Index (SSIM), and compression ratio metrics. The result of this study reveals the feasibility and current limitations of QDCT-based image compression while providing a reproducible benchmark for future quantum image processing research. This study offers a realistic assessment of the potential and technical limitations of QDCT in the context of emerging quantum technologies.

TI Quantum Optimization for Phase Unwrapping in SAR Interferometry
SO IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE
   SENSING
AB Phase unwrapping is the reconstruction of a phase given its values mod 2 pi. Phase unwrapping is an important image processing technique used in synthetic aperture radar interferometry, in the context of height estimation and ground deformation. By formulating the phase unwrapping problem as a global minimization problem, L(p )norm techniques form the backbone of many established phase unwrapping algorithms. The L-0 norm is commonly agreed to produce the best unwrapping solutions, but the necessary brute-force calculations are infeasible for the phase unwrapping of SAR interferograms. Developments in variational quantum algorithms suggest computational advantages, when compared to classical approaches, for a multitude of applications. We therefore investigate the application of quantum algorithms to the phase unwrapping problem and introduce and derive an approximate L-0 norm optimization solver utilizing the quantum approximate optimisation algorithm. This hybrid algorithm uses classical nonconvex parameter optimization to produce optimal parameters for a quantum circuit encoding the L-0 phase unwrapping. Subsequent execution of this quantum circuit allows for an estimate of the solution of the phase unwrapping problem with advantages compared to brute force approaches. We validate our approach for small topographies, by demonstrating improved results when compared to established L-1 optimization.

TI Hybrid Quantum Deep Learning With Superpixel Encoding for Earth
   Observation Data Classification
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NEURAL NETWORKS AND LEARNING SYSTEMS
AB Earth observation (EO) has inevitably entered the Big Data era. The computational challenge associated with analyzing large EO data using sophisticated deep learning models has become a significant bottleneck. To address this challenge, there has been a growing interest in exploring quantum computing as a potential solution. However, the process of encoding EO data into quantum states for analysis potentially undermines the efficiency advantages gained from quantum computing. This article introduces a hybrid quantum deep learning model that effectively encodes and analyzes EO data for classification tasks. The proposed model uses an efficient encoding approach called superpixel encoding, which reduces the quantum resources required for large image representation by incorporating the concept of superpixels. To validate the effectiveness of our model, we conducted evaluations on multiple EO benchmarks, including Overhead-MNIST, So2Sat LCZ42, and SAT-6 datasets. In addition, we studied the impacts of different interaction gates and measurements on classification performance to guide model optimization. The experimental results suggest the validity of our model for accurate classification of EO data. Our models and code are available on https://github.com/zhu-xlab/SEQNN.

TI Quantum entanglement generation in heterometallic Ni2+4 Gd3+4 complexes
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB We investigate various types of quantum entanglement in the octanuclear heterometallic 3d/4 f complexes denoted as Ni2+ 4 Gd3+ 4 under an external magnetic field, using the exact diagonalization approach. These molecular magnets, which can be effectively described by Heisenberg spin models, consist of two identical {Ni2+ 2 Gd3+ 2 } cubane subunits bridged by acetate and hydroxide ligands. Our analysis reveals that their magnetization exhibits intermediate plateaus at low temperatures, indicating distinct ground states characteristic of Ni-containing compounds. Using negativity as a measure of quantum entanglement, we examine the influence of single-ion anisotropy and magnetic field on tetrapartite, bipartite, 1-3 tangle, and 2-2 tangle entanglements in two families of Ni2+ 4 Gd3+ 4 complexes: (1) without anisotropy and (2) with anisotropy. Complex (1) exhibits strong bipartite entanglement between Ni ions, which persists up to T approximate to 3.0 K and B approximate to 4.0 T, but shows significantly weaker tetrapartite entanglement and vanishing bipartite entanglement between Gd <middle dot> <middle dot> <middle dot> Gd and Ni <middle dot><middle dot> <middle dot> Gd pairs. In contrast, complex (2) displays nonzero and sizable values for all types of entanglement considered. These findings emphasis the crucial role of single-ion anisotropy in generating and shaping the entanglement landscape of heterometallic Ni2+ 4 Gd3+ 4 complexes. Notably, we find that the 1-3 tangle entanglement between a Ni ion and the remaining sites in a cubane unit serves as a reliable indicator of ground-state phase transitions, exhibiting distinct changes across phase boundaries irrespective of the presence of single-ion anisotropy.

TI Speed of evolution in qutrit systems
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB The speed of evolution between perfectly distinguishable states is thoroughly analyzed in a closed three-level (qutrit) quantum system. Considering an evolution under an arbitrary time-independent Hamiltonian, we fully characterize the relevant parameters according to whether the corresponding quantum speed limit is given by the Mandelstam-Tamm, the Margolus-Levitin, or the Ness-Alberti-Sagi (dual) bound, thereby elucidating their hierarchy and relative importance. We revisit the necessary and sufficient conditions that guarantee the evolution of the initial state towards an orthogonal one in a finite time, and pay special attention to the full characterization of the speed of evolution, offering a speed map in parameter space that highlights regions associated with faster or slower dynamics. The general analysis is applied to concrete physical settings, particularly a pair of bosons governed by an extended Bose-Hubbard Hamiltonian, and a single particle in a triple-well potential. Our findings provide a framework to explore how the energetic resources and the initial configurations shape the pace of the dynamics in higher-dimensional systems.

In this method, the time evolution of the system is repeatedly interrupted by interacting an ancilla qubit with the system through a controlled operation, and measuring the ancilla immediately afterward. We discuss the robustness of this method as compared to other ancilla-based interferometric techniques (such as the Hadamard test), and highlight its advantages for near-term quantum simulations of open quantum systems. We implement the method on a quantum computer in order to measure single-particle Green's functions of a driven-dissipative fermionic system. This Letter shows that dynamical correlation functions for drivendissipative systems can be robustly measured with near-term quantum computers.

TI Efficient on-chip platform for coherent light-matter coupling using
   bound states in the continuum
SO SCIENCE ADVANCES
AB Storing and retrieving photonic qubits are key functionalities in future optical quantum networks, and integrating scalable optical-memory units is crucial as these networks expand. However, attempts to combine silicon photonics and erbium ions for telecom memories, without losing the scalable and low-loss properties of silicon chips, face challenges because of limited light-matter interactions and potential extra decoherence. Here, we present an efficient silicon-chip platform using bound states in the continuum to overcome these limitations. In addition to a low propagation loss of 0.5 +/- 0.5 decibels per centimeter, our experiments demonstrate an order-of-magnitude enhancement in light absorption compared to previous traditional silicon hybrid designs. Using these properties, we demonstrated photon echoes in our waveguide structures, revealing a coherence time of 2.6 +/- 0.6 microseconds at zero magnetic field, closely matching that of bulk crystals. These characteristics make the bound state in the continuum platform a promising candidate for realizing integrated optical memories for quantum network applications.

TI Prediction of the relaxation time of a transmon qubit with the
   steepest-entropy-ascent quantum thermodynamics framework
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS A-MATHEMATICAL AND THEORETICAL
AB Decoherence has been observed to be one of the main limitations to build a practical quantum computer. This is because the qubits that conform it rapidly lose the entanglement and correlations existent among them due to interactions with the environment. In this work, the relaxation time of a Transmon qubit interacting with an environment is predicted by using the steepest-entropy-ascent quantum thermodynamics framework and the Lindblad master equation. For the study it is considered that the environment behaves as a thermal bath composed of a collection of harmonic oscillators. Results show that the qubit processes from a non-equilibrium state to a state of stable equilibrium, exchanging energy with the thermal bath during the process. In addition, the prediction of the relaxation time of the qubit is in agreement with experimental results obtained from the literature. The decoherence time is also accurately predicted by the models.

TI On the feasibility of a quantum sensing protocol designed with
   electrically controlled spins in silicon quantum dots
SO RSC ADVANCES
AB Though electron spins in electrically defined silicon (Si) quantum dot systems have been extensively employed for physical realization of quantum processing units, their application to quantum sensing has not been active compared to the case of photonic qubits and nitrogen-vacancy spins in diamonds. This work presents a comprehensive study on the feasibility of Si quantum dot structures as a physical platform for implementation of a sensing protocol for magnetic fields. To examine sensing operations at a systematic level, we adopt in-house device simulations taking a Si double quantum dot (DQD) system as a target device where the confinement of electron spins is controlled with electrical biases in a Si/Si-germanium heterostructure. Simulation results demonstrate the fairly nice utility of the Si DQD platform for detecting externally presented static magnetic fields, and, more notably, reveal that sensing operations are not quite vulnerable to charge noise that is omnipresent in solid materials. As a rare study that presents in-depth discussion on operations of quantum sensing units at a device-level based on computational modeling, this work can deliver practical insights for potential designs of sensing units with electron spins in Si devices.

TI Subspace variational quantum simulator
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Quantum simulation is one of the key applications of quantum computing, which accelerates research and development in the fields such as chemistry and material science. The recent development of noisy intermediate -scale quantum (NISQ) devices urges the exploration of applications without the necessity of quantum error correction. In this paper, we propose an efficient method to simulate quantum dynamics driven by a static Hamiltonian on NISQ devices, named subspace variational quantum simulator (SVQS). SVQS employs the subspace-search variational quantum eigensolver (SSVQE) [Phys. Rev. Res. 1, 033062 (2019)] to find a low-lying eigensubspace and extends it to simulate dynamics within the subspace with lower overhead compared to the existing schemes. We experimentally simulate the time-evolution operator in a low-lying eigensubspace of a hydrogen molecule. We also define the subspace process fidelity as a measure between two quantum processes in a subspace. The subspace time evolution mimicked by SVQS shows the subspace process fidelity of 0.896-0.989.

TI A quantum neural network for multi-classifications by using FRQI with
   extra measurement
SO SCIENTIA SINICA-PHYSICA MECHANICA & ASTRONOMICA
AB Classification is a core application of quantum machine learning. This study aims at the problems existing in current pure quantum classifiers, such as the large number of consumed qubits and the unsatisfactory performance in multi-classification tasks. Based on the flexible representation of quantum images (FRQI), a new quantum circuit model QCCE that can be used for multi-classification tasks is constructed by introducing additional measurement qubits and connecting them to the color qubit bits. This model not only inherits the encoding advantages of FRQI, enabling it to encode high-dimensional image inputs with a relatively small number of qubits, but also has all trainable parameters in the quantum circuit, with classical computing only providing the loss function and optimizer. Experiments on datasets such as MNIST and Fashion MNIST have shown that in multi-classification tasks like three, four, and five-class classifications, the QCCE model demonstrates obvious advantages over similar quantum circuit models such as HEA and MORE in terms of classification accuracy and convergence speed. The research in this study provides new ideas and methods for the application of quantum machine learning in image processing.

TI Protocol for Nonlinear State Discrimination in Rotating Condensate
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB Nonlinear mean field dynamics enables quantum information processing operations that are impossible in linear one-particle quantum mechanics. In this approach, a register of bosonic qubits (such as neutral atoms or polaritons) is initialized into a symmetric product state vertical bar psi >(circle times n) through condensation, then subsequently controlled by varying the qubit-qubit interaction. An experimental implementation of quantum state discrimination, an important subroutine in quantum computation, with a toroidal Bose-Einstein condensate is proposed. The condensed bosons here are atoms, each in the same superposition of angular momenta 0 and h, encoding a qubit. A nice feature of the protocol is that only a readout of individual quantized circulation states (not superpositions) is required.

TI Geometric graph-theoretic aspects of quantum stabilizer codes
SO PHYSICA SCRIPTA
AB We propose a systematic procedure for the construction of graphs associated with binary quantum stabilizer codes. The procedure is characterized by means of the following three step process. First, the stabilizer code is realized as a codeword-stabilized (CWS) quantum code. Second, the canonical form of the CWS code is determined and third, the input vertices are attached to the graphs. In order to verify the effectiveness of the procedure, we implement the Gottesman stabilizer code characterized by multi-qubit encoding operators for the resource-efficient error correction of arbitrary single-qubit errors. Finally, the error-correcting capabilities of the Gottesman eight-qubit quantum stabilizer code is verified in graph-theoretic terms as originally advocated by Schlingemann and Werner.

TI From stochastic Hamiltonian to quantum simulation: exploring memory
   effects in exciton dynamics
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB The unraveling of open quantum system dynamics in terms of stochastic quantum trajectories offers a picture of open system dynamics that consistently considers memory effects stemming from the finite correlation time of environment fluctuations. These fluctuations significantly influence the coherence and energy transport properties of excitonic systems. When their correlation time is comparable to the timescale of the Hamiltonian evolution, it leads to the departure of open system dynamics from the Markovian limit. In this work, we leverage the unraveling of exciton dynamics through stochastic Hamiltonian propagators to design quantum circuits that simulate exciton transport, capturing finite memory effects. In addition to enabling the synthesis of parametrizable quantum circuits, stochastic unitary propagators provide a transparent framework for investigating non-Markovian effects on exciton transport. Our analysis reveals a nuanced relationship between environment correlation time and transport efficiency, identifying a regime of 'memory-assisted' quantum transport where time-correlated fluctuations allow the system to reach higher efficiency. However, this property is not universal and can only be realized in conjunction with specific features of the system Hamiltonian.

TI Long-range cooperative resonances in rare-earth ion arrays inside
   photonic resonators
SO COMMUNICATIONS PHYSICS
AB Engineering arrays of active optical centers to control the interaction Hamiltonian between light and matter has been the subject of intense research recently. Collective interaction of atomic arrays with optical photons can give rise to directionally enhanced absorption or emission, which enables engineering of broadband and strong atom-photon interfaces. Here, we report on the observation of long-range cooperative resonances in an array of rare-earth ions controllably implanted into a solid-state lithium niobate micro-ring resonator. We show that cooperative effects can be observed in an ordered ion array extended far beyond the light's wavelength. We observe enhanced emission from both cavity-induced Purcell enhancement and array-induced collective resonances at cryogenic temperatures. Engineering collective resonances as a paradigm for enhanced light-matter interactions can enable suppression of free-space spontaneous emission. The multi-functionality of lithium niobate hosting rare-earth ions can open possibilities of quantum photonic device engineering for scalable and multiplexed quantum networks.
   Engineering the arrangement of atomic arrays enables their cooperative interaction with optical photons even when individual atom separations are far beyond the light's wavelength. Here, the authors report long-range cooperative resonances in an array of rare-earth ions implanted into a lithium niobate micro-ring resonator.

TI Designing High-Fidelity Zeno Gates for Dissipative Cat Qubits
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Bosonic cat qubits stabilized with a driven two-photon dissipation are systems with exponentially biased noise, opening the door to low-overhead, fault-tolerant, and universal quantum computing. However, current gate proposals for such qubits induce substantial noise of the unprotected type, the poor scaling of which with the relevant experimental parameters limits their practical use. In this work, we provide a new perspective on dissipative cat qubits by reconsidering the reservoir mode used to engineer the tailored two-photon dissipation and showing how it can be leveraged to mitigate gate-induced errors. Doing so, we introduce four new designs of high-fidelity and bias-preserving cat-qubit gates and compare them to the prevalent gate methods. These four designs should give a broad overview of gate engineering for dissipative systems with different and complementary ideas. In particular, we propose both already achievable low-error gate designs and longer-term implementations.

TI Understanding Logical-Shift Error Propagation in Quanvolutional Neural
   Networks
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM ENGINEERING
AB Quanvolutional neural networks (QNNs) have been successful in image classification, exploiting inherent quantum capabilities to improve performance of traditional convolution. Unfortunately, the qubit's reliability can be a significant issue for QNNs inference, since its logical state can be altered by both intrinsic noise and by the interaction with natural radiation. In this article, we aim at investigating the propagation of logical-shift errors (i.e., the unexpected modification of the qubit state) in QNNs. We propose a bottom-up evaluation reporting data from 13 322 547 200 logical-shift injections. We characterize the error propagation in the quantum circuit implementing a single convolution and then in various designs of the same QNN, varying the dataset and the network depth. We track the logical-shift error propagation through the qubits, channels, and subgrids, identifying the faults that are more likely to cause misclassifications. We found that up to 10% of the injections in the quanvolutional layer cause misclassification and even logical-shifts of small magnitude can be sufficient to disturb the network functionality. Our detailed analysis shows that corruptions in the qubits' state that alter their probability amplitude are more critical than the ones altering their phase, that some object classes are more likely than others to be corrupted, that the criticality of subgrids depends on the dataset, and that the control qubits, once corrupted, are more likely to modify the QNN output than the target qubits.

TI The Risk of Ethicalisation in Ethical Engagement with Quantum
   Technologies: Some Brief Considerations
SO NANOETHICS
AB 'Quantum for good' is slowly beginning to emerge as an ambition for quantum technology development. As the ambition begins to percolate down through policy and scientific communities, questions as to what 'quantum for good' means and how it might be operationalised will arise. Fora for discussion will spring up and, at the individual level, actors will be faced with how to respond to the call for 'quantum for good'. What might 'quantum for good' mean in practice, how can 'good' be defined, by whom, etc.? ELSA communities are likely to be involved in these discussions. This contribution warns ELSA scholars of the risks of 'ethicalisation' in pondering these questions with respect to two issues: 1) the nature and framing of ethical discussion in new and emerging science and technologies; and 2) reliance on ethics and ethical expertise. Ethicalisation can lead to a hollowing out of ethical concerns through a downplaying of interests, stakes, and, ultimately, politics. The article offers some suggestions for a 're-politicisation' of ethics within the context of engagement with quantum technology.

TI Scaling adaptive quantum simulation algorithms via operator pool tiling
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Adaptive variational quantum simulation algorithms use information from a quantum computer to dynamically create optimal trial wave functions for a given problem Hamiltonian. A key ingredient in these algorithms is a predefined operator pool from which trial wave functions are constructed. Finding suitable pools is critical for the efficiency of the algorithm as the problem size increases. Here, we present a technique called operator pool tiling that facilitates the construction of problem-tailored pools for arbitrarily large problem instances. By first performing an Adaptive Derivative-Assembled Problem-Tailored Ansatz Variational Quantum Eigensolver (ADAPT-VQE) calculation on a smaller instance of the problem using a large, but computationally inefficient, operator pool, we extract the most relevant operators and use them to design more efficient pools for larger instances. We demonstrate the method here on strongly correlated quantum spin models in one and two dimensions, finding that ADAPT automatically finds a highly effective ansatz for these systems. Given that many problems, such as those arising in condensed matter physics, have a naturally repeating lattice structure, we expect the pool tiling method to be a widely applicable technique apt for such systems.

TI Synchronized resistance of inhomogeneous magnetically induced dephasing
   of an image stored in a cold atomic ensemble
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Long-lived storage of arbitrary transverse multimodes is important for establishing a high-channel-capacity quantum network. Most of the pioneering works focused on atomic diffusion as the dominant impact on the retrieved pattern in an atom-based memory. In this work, we demonstrate that the unsynchronized Larmor precession of atoms in the inhomogeneous magnetic field dominates the distortion of the pattern stored in a cold-atom-based memory. We find that this distortion effect can be eliminated by applying a strong uniform polarization magnetic field. By mapping signal light into a spin wave between a pair of clock states, the destructive interference between different spin-wave components is diminished, and the stored localized patterns are synchronized further in a single spin-wave component; then, an obvious enhancement in preserving patterns for a long time is obtained. The reported results are promising for studying transverse multimode decoherence in optical storage and may find potential applications in the field of high-dimensional quantum networks in the future.

TI Low rank representations for quantum simulation of electronic structure
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB The quantum simulation of quantum chemistry is a promising application of quantum computers. However, for N molecular orbitals, the O(N-4) gate complexity of performing Hamiltonian and unitary Coupled Cluster Trotter steps makes simulation based on such primitives challenging. We substantially reduce the gate complexity of such primitives through a two-step low-rank factorization of the Hamiltonian and cluster operator, accompanied by truncation of small terms. Using truncations that incur errors below chemical accuracy allow one to perform Trotter steps of the arbitrary basis electronic structure Hamiltonian with O(N-3) gate complexity in small simulations, which reduces to O(N-2) gate complexity in the asymptotic regime; and unitary Coupled Cluster Trotter steps with O(N-3) gate complexity as a function of increasing basis size for a given molecule. In the case of the Hamiltonian Trotter step, these circuits have O(N-2) depth on a linearly connected array, an improvement over the O(N-3) scaling assuming no truncation. As a practical example, we show that a chemically accurate Hamiltonian Trotter step for a 50 qubit molecular simulation can be carried out in the molecular orbital basis with as few as 4000 layers of parallel nearest-neighbor two-qubit gates, consisting of fewer than 10(5) non-Clifford rotations. We also apply our algorithm to iron-sulfur clusters relevant for elucidating the mode of action of metalloenzymes.

TI Scalable Full-Stack Benchmarks for Quantum Computers
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM ENGINEERING
AB Quantum processors are now able to run quantum circuits that are infeasible to simulate classically, creating a need for benchmarks that assess a quantum processor's rate of errors when running these circuits. Here, we introduce a general technique for creating efficient benchmarks from any set of quantum computations, specified by unitary circuits. Our benchmarks assess the integrated performance of a quantum processor's classical compilation algorithms and its low-level quantum operations. Unlike existing "full-stack benchmarks," our benchmarks do not require classical simulations of quantum circuits, and they use only efficient classical computations. We use our method to create random circuit benchmarks, including a computationally efficient version of the quantum volume benchmark, and an algorithm-based benchmark that uses Hamiltonian simulation circuits. We perform these benchmarks on IBM Q devices and in simulations, and we compare their results to the results of the existing benchmarking methods.

TI High-rate multiplexed entanglement source based on time-bin qubits for
   advanced quantum networks
SO OPTICA QUANTUM
AB Entanglement distribution based on time-bin qubits is an attractive option for emerging quantum networks. We demonstrate a 4.09-GHz repetition rate source of photon pairs entangled across early and late time bins separated by 80 ps. Simultaneous high rates and high visibilities are achieved through frequency multiplexing the spontaneous parametric down conversion output into eight time-bin entangled channel pairs. We demonstrate entanglement visibilities as high as 99.4%, total entanglement rates up to 3.55x106 coincidences/s, and predict a straightforward path towards achieving up to an order of magnitude improvement in rates without compromising visibility. Finally, we resolve the density matrices of the entangled states for each multiplexed channel and express distillable entanglement rates in ebit/s, thereby quantifying the trade-off between visibility and coincidence rates that contributes to useful entanglement distribution. This source is a fundamental building block for high-rate entanglement-based quantum key distribution systems or advanced quantum networks.

AB Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) will become soon the standard for many systems of the future. With the advent of quantum computers, all encrypted communications based on traditional asymmetric cryptography (e.g., RSA, ECC) will become insecure. The definition the PQC standards is an on going process proceeding at a fast pace, involving new and largely unexplored cryptographic primitives. For this reason, the design of hardware implementations of PQC algorithms is still under study. In this paper, we introduce the fundamentals of PQC, with a focus on lattice-based cryptography and its hardware security issues, namely side-channel and fault-based attacks. Then, we focus on isogeny-based cryptography and the SIKE algorithm. We highlight the importance of fault-tolerant design choices through the presentation of a fault attack, based on the electromagnetic injection of transient faults, targeting this cryptographic primitive. Finally, we show an interesting idea that starts from the observation that some PQC algorithms have an intrinsic probabilistic behavior. We argue that this characteristic is a clear opportunity that paves the way for the application of approximate (or inexact) computing to the implementation of PQC cryptography.

In this scenario, we perform a feasibility study of quantum communications over an industrial 224 km submarine optical fibre link deployed between Southport in the United Kingdom (UK) and Portrane in the Republic of Ireland (IE). With a characterisation of phase drift, polarisation stability and the arrival time of entangled photons, we demonstrate the suitability of the link to enable international UK-IE quantum communications for the first time.

TI Contextuality-based quantum conferencing
SO QUANTUM INFORMATION PROCESSING
AB Nonlocality inequalities for multi-party systems act as contextuality inequalities for single qudit systems of suitable dimensions (Heywood and Redhead in Found Phys 13(5):481-499, 1983; Abramsky and Brandenburger in New J Phys 13(11):113036, 2011). In this paper, we propose the procedure for adaptation of nonlocality-based quantum conferencing protocols (NQCPs) to contextuality-based QCPs (CQCPs). Unlike the NQCPs, the CQCPs do not involve nonlocal states. As an illustration of the procedure, we present a QCP based on Mermin's contextuality inequality. As a significant improvement, we propose a QCP based on CHSH contextuality inequality involving only four-dimensional states irrespective of the number of parties sharing the key. The key generation rate of the latter is twice that of the former. Although CQCPs allow for an eavesdropping attack which has no analog in NQCPs, a way out of this attack is demonstrated. Finally, we examine the feasibility of experimental implementation of these protocols with orbital angular momentum states.

AB Digital micromirror devices (DMDs) have seen recent popularity as spatial light modulators (SLMs) for arbitrary and dynamic potential generation in the manipulation of neutral atom systems for quantum simulation and quantum computing platforms. In enabling the use of a DMD for this purpose, its latency, frame rate, and micromirror movement dynamics must be well characterized for various settings. In this paper, we present our FPGA-based system to control the DMD and the optical setup developed for its verification. Image information and control parameters are generated and configured using a Python user interface and sent to the FPGA using a C++ wrapper and the Cypress FX2 USB protocol. The FPGA design enables the leveraging of the high frame rate capabilities of the DMD as well as ensuring deterministic operation by first storing this USB data on an external DDR memory and updating the micromirror states upon receiving an external trigger pulse. The DMD is imaged onto a scientific camera and two photodiodes as a means of verifying the system behavior and investigating the metrics of interest. Using this framework, the DLP7000 consisting of 768x1024 micromirrors has been shown to refresh at 22 kHz with 45.4 mu s latency. Furthermore, a single block consisting of 48x1024 micromirrors is able to refresh at 140 kHz with 7.1 mu s latency. The loading and clearing behavior of micromirrors has also been characterized for varying refresh rates.

TI Fast and Accurate Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger Encoding Using All-to-All
   Interactions
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB The N-qubit Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) state is an important resource for quantum technologies. We consider the task of GHZ encoding using all-to-all interactions, which prepares the GHZ state in a special case, and is furthermore useful for quantum error correction, interaction-rate enhancement, and transmitting information using power-law interactions. The naive protocol based on parallelizing CNOT gates takes O(1)-time of Hamiltonian evolution. In this work, we propose a fast protocol that achieves GHZ encoding with high accuracy. The evolution time O(log(2)N/N) almost saturates the theoretical limit Omega(log N/N). Moreover, the final state is close to the ideal encoded one with high fidelity >1-10(-3), up to large system sizes N less than or similar to 2000. The protocol only requires a few stages of time-independent Hamiltonian evolution; the key idea is to use the data qubit as control, and to use fast spin-squeezing dynamics generated by e.g., two-axis twisting.

TI Quantum Circuits with Multiterminal Josephson-Andreev Junctions
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB We explore superconducting quantum circuits where several leads are simultaneously connected beyond the tunneling regime, such that the fermionic structure of Andreev bound states in the resulting multiterminal Josephson junction influences the states of the full circuit. Using a simple model of single-channel contacts and a single level in the middle region, we discuss different circuit configurations where the leads are islands with finite capacitance and/or form loops with finite inductance. We find situations of practical interest where the circuits can be used to define noise-protected qubits, which map to the bifluxon and 0 - pi qubits in the tunneling regime. We also point out the subtleties of the gauge choice for a proper description of these quantum circuit dynamics.

TI Stabilizing multiple topological fermions on a quantum computer
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB In classical and single-particle settings, non-trivial band topology always gives rise to robust boundary modes. For quantum many-body systems, however, multiple topological fermions are not always able to coexist, since Pauli exclusion prevents additional fermions from occupying the limited number of available topological modes. In this work, we show, through IBM quantum computers, how one can robustly stabilize more fermions than the number of topological modes through specially designed 2-fermion interactions. Our demonstration hinges on the realization of BDI- and D-class topological Hamiltonians on transmon-based quantum hardware, and relied on a tensor network-aided circuit recompilation approach. We also achieved the full reconstruction of multiple-fermion topological band structures through iterative quantum phase estimation (IQPE). All in all, our work showcases how advances in quantum algorithm implementation enable noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices to be exploited for topological stabilization beyond the context of single-particle topological invariants.

TI Quantum imaging using spatially entangled photon pairs from a nonlinear
   metasurface
SO ELIGHT
AB Nonlinear metasurfaces with subwavelength thickness were recently established as versatile platforms for the enhanced and tailorable generation of entangled photon pairs. The small dimensions and inherent stability of integrated metasurface sources are attractive for free-space applications in quantum communications, sensing, and imaging, yet this remarkable potential remained unexplored. Here, we formulate and experimentally demonstrate the unique benefits and practical potential of nonlinear metasurfaces for quantum imaging at infrared wavelengths, facilitating an efficient protocol combining ghost and all-optical scanning imaging. The metasurface incorporates a subwavelength-scale silica metagrating on a lithium niobate thin film. Its distinguishing feature is the capability to all-optically scan the photon emission angle in the direction across the grating simply by tuning the pump beam wavelength. Simultaneously, the photon emission is broad and anti-correlated along the grating direction, allowing for ghost imaging. Thereby, we reconstruct the images of 2D objects using just a 1D detector array in the idler path and a bucket detector in the signal path, by recording the dependencies of photon coincidences on the pump wavelength. Furthermore, we theoretically demonstrate the quantum imaging of objects with an ultra-large field of view and improved imaging resolution. Remarkably, the corresponding number of resolution cells can exceed the performance of quantum ghost imaging with conventional bulky crystals by over four orders of magnitude. The demonstrated concept can be extended to multi-wavelength operation and other applications such as quantum object tracking, paving the way for advancements in quantum technologies using ultra-compact nanostructured metasurfaces.

TI Tripartite measurement uncertainty in Schwarzschild space-time
SO EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL C
AB The effect of Hawking radiation on tripartite measurement uncertainty in a Schwarzschild black hole background is analyzed in this study. Two scenarios are examined. In the first, quantum memory particles approach a Schwarzschild black hole and are positioned near the event horizon, while the particle being measured remains in the asymptotically flat region. In the second scenario, the measured particle moves toward the black hole, and the quantum memories stay in the asymptotically flat region. This study considers two initial quantum states, namely GHZ and W states. Our findings reveal that in both cases, measurement uncertainty increases steadily with rising Hawking temperature. When comparing the GHZ and W states, the GHZ state initially exhibits lower measurement uncertainty at low Hawking temperatures than the W state, indicating greater resilience to Hawking radiation. Additionally, when the quantum memories remain in the asymptotically flat region while the measured particle falls toward the black hole, the uncertainties for GHZ and W states do not align at high temperatures. The GHZ state consistently demonstrates lower measurement uncertainty, showcasing its superior robustness against Hawking radiation.

TI Quantum Contextual Advantage Depending on Nonzero Prior Probabilities in
   State Discrimination of Mixed Qubit States
SO ENTROPY
AB Recently, Schmid and Spekkens studied the quantum contextuality in terms of state discrimination. By dealing with the minimum error discrimination of two quantum states with identical prior probabilities, they reported that quantum contextual advantage exists. Meanwhile, if one notes a striking observation that the selection of prior probability can affect the quantum properties of the system, it is necessary to verify whether the quantum contextual advantage depends on the prior probabilities of the given states. In this paper, we consider the minimum error discrimination of two states with arbitrary prior probabilities, in which both states are pure or mixed. We show that the quantum contextual advantage in state discrimination may depend on the prior probabilities of the given states. In particular, even though the quantum contextual advantage always exists in the state discrimination of two nonorthogonal pure states with nonzero prior probabilities, the quantum contextual advantage depends on prior probabilities in the state discrimination of two mixed states.

TI Efficient unified architecture for post-quantum cryptography: combining
   Dilithium and Kyber
SO PEERJ COMPUTER SCIENCE
AB As the ongoing standardization process of post-quantum schemes yields initial outcomes, it becomes increasingly important to not only optimize standalone implementations but also explore the potential of combining multiple schemes into a single, unified architecture. In this article, we investigate the combination of two National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)-selected schemes: the Dilithium digital signature scheme and the Kyber key encapsulation mechanism. We propose a novel set of optimization techniques for a unified hardware implementation of these leading post-quantum schemes, achieving a balanced approach between area efficiency and high performance. Our design demonstrates superior resource efficiency and performance compared to previously reported unified architecture (DOI 10.1109/TCSI.2022.3219555), also achieving results that are better than, or comparable, to those of standalone implementations. The efficient and combined implementation of lattice-based digital signatures and key establishment methods can be deployed for establishing secure sessions in high-speed communication networks at servers and gateways. Moreover, the unique and compact design that requires small hardware resources can be directly used in small and cost-effective field programmable gate array (FPGA) platforms that can be used as security co-processors for embedded devices and in the Internet of Things.

TI A community detection-based parallel algorithm for quantum circuit
   simulation using tensor networks
SO JOURNAL OF SUPERCOMPUTING
AB Quantum computing holds significant promise for solving complex problems, but simulating quantum circuits on classical computers remains essential due to the current limitations of quantum hardware. Efficient simulation is crucial for the development and validation of quantum algorithms and quantum computers. This paper explores and compares various strategies to leverage different levels of parallelism to accelerate the contraction of tensor networks representing large quantum circuits. We propose a new parallel multistage algorithm based on communities. The original tensor network is partitioned into several communities, which are then contracted in parallel. The pairs of tensors of the resulting network can be contracted in parallel using a GPU. We use the Girvan-Newman algorithm to obtain the communities and the contraction plans. We compare the new algorithm with two other parallelisation strategies: one based on contracting all the pairs of tensors in the GPU and another one that uses slicing to cut some indexes of the tensor network and then MPI processes to contract the resulting slices in parallel. The new parallel algorithm gets the best results with different well-known quantum circuits with a high degree of entanglement, including random quantum circuits. In conclusion, the results show that the main factor that limits the simulation is the space cost. However, the parallel multistage algorithm manages to reduce the cost of sequential simulation for circuits with a high number of qubits and allows simulating larger circuits.

TI Polarization Attack on Continuous-Variable Quantum Key Distribution with
   a Local Local Oscillator
SO ENTROPY
AB The estimation of phase noise of continuous-variable quantum key distribution protocol with a local local oscillator (LLO CVQKD), as a major process in quantifying the secret key rate, is closely relevant to the intensity of the phase reference. However, the transmission of the phase reference through the insecure quantum channel is prone to be exploited by the eavesdropper (Eve) to mount attacks. Here, we introduce a polarization attack scheme against the phase reference. Presently, in a practical LLO CVQKD system, only part of the phase reference pulses are measured to compensate for the polarization drift of the quantum signal pulses in a compensation cycle due to the limited polarization measurement rate, while the other part of the phase reference pulses are not measured. We show that Eve can control the phase noise by manipulating the polarization direction of the unmeasured phase reference to hide her attack on the quantum signal. Simulations show that Eve can obtain partial or total key rates information shared between Alice and Bob as the transmission distance increases. Improving the polarization measurement rate to 100% or monitoring the phase reference intensity in real-time is of great importance to protect the LLO CVQKD from polarization attack.

TI Quantum machine learning-based electrokinetic mining for the
   identification of nanoparticles and exosomes with minimal training data
SO BIOACTIVE MATERIALS
AB Synthetic and naturally occurring particles, such as nanoparticles (NPs) and exosomes; a type of extracellular vesicles (EVs), have garnered widespread attention across various fields, including biomaterials, oncology, and delivery systems for drugs and vaccines. Traditional methods for identifying NPs and EVs, such as transmission electron microscopy, are often prohibitively expensive and labor-intensive. As an alternative, the assessment of electrokinetic attributes such as zeta potential or electrophoretic mobility, conductance, and mean count rate, offers a more cost-effective, rapid, and reliable means of characterizing these particles. In this context, we introduce the first application of a quantum machine learning (QML)-based electrokinetic mining for the identification of green-synthesized iron- and cobalt-based NPs, as well as exosomes derived from human embryonic stem cells (hESC), human lung cancer (A549) cells, and colorectal cancer (CRC) cells, based solely on their electrokinetic attributes. Comparative analyses involving cross-validation, train-test splits, confusion matrices, and Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves revealed that classical ML techniques could accurately identify the types of NPs and EVs. Notably, QML demonstrated proficiency in differentiating between various NPs and EVs, including the distinction of EVs in the plasma of CRC patients versus those of healthy individuals. Furthermore, QML's application has been extended to the identification of NPs along with EVs in the plasma of CRC patients and experimental mice, achieving higher prediction performance even with a minimal training dataset, demonstrating that QML based electrokinetic mining could identify NPs or EVs with minimal training data, thereby facilitating novel clinical development in the realm of liquid biopsies.

AB We propose the first near-optimal quantum algorithm for estimating in Euclidean norm the mean of a vector-valued random variable with finite mean and covariance. Our result aims at extending the theory of multivariate sub-Gaussian estimators [Lugosi and Mendelson, 2019] to the quantum setting. Unlike classically, where any univariate estimator can be turned into a multivariate estimator with at most a logarithmic overhead in the dimension, no similar result can be proved in the quantum setting. Indeed, [Heinrich, 2004] ruled out the existence of a quantum advantage for the mean estimation problem when the sample complexity is smaller than the dimension. Our main result is to show that, outside this low-precision regime, there does exist a quantum estimator that outperforms any classical estimator. More precisely, we prove that the approximation error can be decreased by a factor of about the square root of the ratio between the dimension and the sample complexity. Our approach is substantially more involved than in the univariate setting, where most quantum estimators rely only on phase estimation. We exploit a variety of additional algorithmic techniques such as linear amplitude amplification, the BernsteinVazirani algorithm, and quantum singular value transformation. Our analysis is also deeply rooted in proving concentration inequalities for multivariate truncated statistics. Finally, we describe several applications of our algorithms, notably in measuring the expectation values of commuting observables and in the field of machine learning.

TI Synchronization using quantum photons for satellite-to-ground quantum
   key distribution
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Time synchronization is crucial for quantum key distribution (QKD) systems. In order to compensate for the time drift caused by the Doppler effect and adapt to the unstable optical link in satellite-to-ground QKD, previous demonstrations generally adopted synchronization methods requiring additional hardware. In this paper, we present a novel synchronization method based on the detected quantum photons, thus simplifying additional hardware and reducing the complexity and cost. This method adopts target frequency scanning to realize fast frequency recovery, utilizes polynomial fitting to compensate for the Doppler effect, and takes use of the vacuum state in the decoy-state BB84 protocol to recover the time offset. This method can avoid the influence of synchronization light jitter, thus improving the synchronization precision and the secure keys as well. Successful satellite-to-ground QKD based on this new synchronization scheme has been conducted to demonstrate its feasibility and performance. The presented scheme provides an effective synchronization solution for quantum communication applications.

TI Weather forecasting using quantum-based LSTM: A comparative analysis
SO RESULTS IN ENGINEERING
AB Forecasting weather is critical in different application sectors and affects decision-making and resource distribution. Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models are popular, but they can be improved even further with the use of quantum computing techniques. This paper discusses a Quantum Long Short-Term Memory (QLSTM) simulated in PennyLane-based simulators. According to the experimental results, the suggested QLSTM model produced a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.009066, a test mean square error (MSE) of 0.000162, and a coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.999846, surpassing both quantum models and classical baselines. These results highlight the potential of quantum-assisted architectures to improve accuracy in weather prediction. The research advances weather forecasting and contributes to quantum computing applications, guiding researchers in developing precise weather prediction models and enhancing decision-making in weather-sensitive domains. The proposed 4-qubit quantum model was tested with noise models, and it demonstrated high learning efficiency and strong robustness against realistic NISQ-level noise, maintaining stable optimization and low error even under moderate perturbations.

TI Multi-objective rescheduling of job shop scheduling problems in
   manufacturing using Quantum Annealing
SO MANUFACTURING LETTERS
AB Unforeseen events in manufacturing necessitate rescheduling to minimize lead times and maintain continuous production. Reducing rescheduling effort is also crucial otherwise additional setup times are incurred. This paper extends a dynamic rescheduling workflow, previously demonstrating success with Quantum Annealing through a multicriterial optimization. It introduces a second objective function considering rescheduling effort alongside makespan. The study addresses job arrivals and machine failures, employing a binary quadratic model for optimization. Results highlight the superiority of Quantum Annealing for larger problems compared to classical metaheuristics. Nevertheless, parameter selection complexities urge further exploration such as exploring deep learning techniques to tackle this challenge. (c) 2024 The Author(s).

TI Field Demonstration of Distributed Quantum Sensing without
   Post-Selection
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW X
AB Distributed quantum sensing can provide quantum-enhanced sensitivity beyond the shot-noise limit (SNL) for sensing spatially distributed parameters. To date, distributed quantum sensing experiments have mostly been accomplished in laboratory environments without a real space separation for the sensors. In addition, the post-selection is normally assumed to demonstrate the sensitivity advantage over the SNL. Here, we demonstrate distributed quantum sensing with discrete variables in field and show the unconditional violation (without post-selection) of SNL up to 0.916 dB for the field distance of 240 m. The achievement is based on a loophole-free Bell test setup with entangled photon pairs at the averaged heralding efficiency of 73.88%. Moreover, to test quantum sensing in real life, we demonstrate the experiment for long distances (with 10-km fiber), together with the sensing of a completely random parameter. The results represent an important step towards a practical quantum sensing network for widespread applications.

AB With the rapid evolution of quantum computers and the emergence of different quantum cloud offerings, use cases from various application areas, such as chemistry or physics, can now be implemented and executed on real quantum computers. Thereby, the applications are typically hybrid, i.e., combine quantum and classical programs. Workflows enable the orchestration of these programs and provide advantages, such as robustness or reproducibility. However, different quantum algorithms require executing the quantum and classical programs in a loop with many iterations, leading to an inefficient orchestration through the workflow. For the efficient execution of such algorithms, hybrid runtimes are offered, combining the quantum and classical programs in a single hybrid program, optimizing the execution. However, this leads to a conceptional gap between the modeling benefits of workflow technologies, e.g., modularization, reuse, and understandability, and the efficiency improvements when using hybrid runtimes. To overcome this issue, we present a method to model all tasks explicitly in the workflow model and analyze the workflow to detect loops that can benefit from hybrid runtimes. Furthermore, corresponding hybrid programs are automatically generated, and the workflow is rewritten to use them. We validate the practical feasibility of our approach by a prototypical implementation.

TI Abrupt transitions in variational quantum circuit training
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Variational quantum algorithms dominate gate-based applications of modern quantum processors. The so-called layerwise trainability conjecture appears in various works throughout the variational quantum computing literature. The conjecture asserts that a quantum circuit can be trained piecewise, e.g., that a few layers can be trained in sequence to minimize an objective function. Here, we prove this conjecture false. Counter-examples are found by considering objective functions that are exponentially close (in the number of qubits) to the identity matrix. In the finite setting, we found abrupt transitions in the ability of quantum circuits to be trained to minimize these objective functions. Specifically, we found that below a critical (target-gate-dependent) threshold, circuit training terminates close to the identity and remains near to the identity for subsequently added blocks trained piecewise. A critical layer depth will abruptly train arbitrarily close to the target, thereby minimizing the objective function. These findings shed light on the divide-and-conquer trainability of variational quantum circuits and apply to a wide collection of contemporary literature.

TI Physical interpretation of nonlocal quantum correlation through local
   description of subsystems
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Characterization and categorization of quantum correlations are both fundamentally and practically important in quantum information science. Although quantum correlations such as non-separability, steerability, and non-locality can be characterized by different theoretical models in different scenarios with either known (trusted) or unknown (untrusted) knowledge of the associated systems, such characterization sometimes lacks unambiguous to experimentalist. In this work, we propose the physical interpretation of nonlocal quantum correlation between two systems. In the absence of complete local description of one of the subsystems quantified by the local uncertainty relation, the correlation between subsystems becomes nonlocal. Remarkably, different nonlocal quantum correlations can be discriminated from a single uncertainty relation derived under local hidden state (LHS)-LHS model only. We experimentally characterize the two-qubit Werner state in different scenarios.

TI Quantum algorithms for open lattice field theory
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Certain aspects of some unitary quantum systems are well described by evolution via a non-Hermitian effective Hamiltonian, as in the Wigner-Weisskopf theory for spontaneous decay. Conversely, any non-Hermitian Hamiltonian evolution can be accommodated in a corresponding unitary system + environment model via a generalization of Wigner-Weisskopf theory. This demonstrates the physical relevance of novel features such as exceptional points in quantum dynamics, and opens up avenues for studying many-body systems in the complex plane of coupling constants. In the case of lattice field theory, sparsity lends these channels the promise of efficient simulation on standardized quantum hardware. We thus consider quantum operations that correspond to Suzuki-Lie-Trotter approximation of lattice field theories undergoing nonunitary time evolution, with potential applicability to studies of spin or gauge models at finite chemical potential, with topological terms, to quantum phase transitions-a range of models with sign problems. We develop non-Hermitian quantum circuits and explore their promise on a benchmark, the quantum one-dimensional Ising model with complex longitudinal magnetic field, showing that observables can probe the Lee-Yang edge singularity. The development of attractors past critical points in the space of complex couplings indicates a potential for study on near-term noisy hardware.

TI Quantum Computing Approach to Fixed-Node Monte Carlo Using Classical
   Shadows
SO JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL THEORY AND COMPUTATION
AB Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) methods are powerful approaches for solving electronic structure problems. Although they often provide high-accuracy solutions, the precision of most QMC methods is ultimately limited by the trial wave function that must be used. Recently, an approach has been demonstrated to allow the use of trial wave functions prepared on a quantum computer [Huggins et al., Unbiasing fermionic quantum Monte Carlo with a quantum computer. Nature 2022, 603, 416] in the auxiliary-field QMC (AFQMC) method using classical shadows to estimate the required overlaps. However, this approach has an exponential post-processing step to construct these overlaps when performing classical shadows obtained using random Clifford circuits. Here, we study an approach to avoid this exponential scaling step by using a fixed-node Monte Carlo method based on full configuration interaction quantum Monte Carlo. This method is applied to the local unitary cluster Jastrow ansatz. We consider H4, ferrocene, and benzene molecules using up to 12 qubits as examples. Circuits are compiled to native gates for typical near-term architectures, and we assess the impact of circuit-level depolarizing noise on the method. We also provide a comparison of AFQMC and fixed-node approaches, demonstrating that AFQMC is more robust to errors, although extrapolations of the fixed-node energy reduce this discrepancy. Although the method can be used to reach chemical accuracy, the sampling cost to achieve this is high even for small active spaces, suggesting caution about the prospect of outperforming conventional QMC approaches.

TI Observation of Quasiparticle Pair Production and Quantum Entanglement in
   Atomic Quantum Gases Quenched to an Attractive Interaction
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB We report observations of quasiparticle pair production by a modulational instability in an atomic superfluid and present a measurement technique that enables direct characterization of quasiparticle quantum entanglement. By quenching the atomic interaction to attractive and then back to weakly repulsive, we produce correlated quasiparticles and monitor their evolution in a superfluid through evaluating the in situ density noise power spectrum, which essentially measures a "homodyne" interference between ground-state atoms and quasiparticles of opposite momenta. We observe large amplitude growth in the power spectrum and subsequent coherent oscillations in a wide spatial frequency band within our resolution limit, demonstrating coherent quasiparticle generation and evolution. The spectrum is observed to oscillate below a quantum limit set by the Peres-Horodecki separability criterion of continuous-variable states, thereby confirming quantum entanglement between interaction quench-induced quasiparticles.

TI An Internet Messenger Using Post-Quantum Cryptography Algorithms Based
   on Isogenies of Elliptic Curves
SO ELECTRONICS
AB This paper presents the design and implementation of an Internet-based instant messaging application that leverages post-quantum cryptographic algorithms founded on isogenies of elliptic curves. The system employs the CSIDH cryptosystem for key exchange and SeaSign for digital signatures, integrating these with the X3DH and Double-Ratchet protocols to enable end-to-end encryption for both text messages and binary file transfers. Key generation is supported for new users upon registration, ensuring robust cryptographic foundations from the outset. The performance of the CSIDH and SeaSign algorithms is evaluated at various security levels using a Python-based prototype, providing practical benchmarks. By combining isogeny-based cryptographic schemes with widely adopted secure messaging protocols, this work presents an illustration of a selected quantum-resistant communication solution and offers insights into the feasibility and practicality of deploying such protocols in real-world applications.

AB Wave-particle duality is one of the most notable and counterintuitive features of quantum mechanics, illustrating that two incompatible observables cannot be measured simultaneously with arbitrary precision. In this work, we experimentally demonstrate the equivalence of wave-particle duality and entropic uncertainty relations using orbital angular momentum (OAM) states of light. Our experiment uses an innovative and reconfigurable platform composed of few-mode optical fibers and photonic lanterns, showcasing the versatility of this technology for quantum information processing. Our results provide fundamental insights into the complementarity principle from an informational perspective, with implications for the broader field of quantum technologies.

AB Hard combinatorial optimization problems, often mapped to Ising models, promise potential solutions with quantum advantage but are constrained by limited qubit counts in near-term devices. We present an innovative quantum-inspired framework that dynamically compresses large Ising models to fit available quantum hardware of different sizes. Thus, we aim to bridge the gap between large-scale optimization and current hardware capabilities. Our method leverages a physics-inspired GNN architecture to capture complex interactions in Ising models and accurately predict alignments among neighboring spins (aka qubits) at ground states. By progressively merging such aligned spins, we can reduce the model size while preserving the underlying optimization structure. It also provides a natural trade-off between the solution quality and size reduction, meeting different hardware constraints of quantum computing devices. Extensive numerical studies on Ising instances of diverse topologies show that our method can reduce instance size at multiple levels with virtually no losses in solution quality on the latest D-wave quantum annealers.

TI Quantum natural language processing and its applications in
   bioinformatics: a comprehensive review of methodologies, concepts, and
   future directions
SO FRONTIERS IN COMPUTER SCIENCE
AB Quantum Natural Language Processing (QNLP) is a relatively new subfield of research that extends the application of principles of natural language processing and quantum computing that has enabled the processing of complex biological information to unprecedented levels. The present comprehensive review analyses the potential of QNLP in influencing many branches of bioinformatics such as genomic sequence analysis, protein structure prediction, and drug discovery and design. To establish a correct background of QNLP techniques, this article is going to explore the basics of quantum computing including qubits, quantum entanglement, and quantum algorithms. The next section is devoted to the application of QNLP in the extraction of material and valuable information and knowledge related to drug discovery and development, prediction and assessment of drug-target interactions. In addition, the paper also explains the application of QNLP in protein structural prediction by quantum embedding, quantum simulation, and quantum optimization for exploring the sequence-structure relationship. However, this study also acknowledges the future of QNLP in bioinformatics in the discussion of the challenges and weaknesses of quantum hardware, data representation, encoding, and the construction and enhancement of the algorithms. This looks into real-life problems solved from industry applications, benchmarking and assessment criteria, and a comparison with other traditional NLP methods. Therefore, the review enunciates the research and application perspectives, as well as the developmental and implementation blueprint for QNLP in bioinformatics. The plan is as follows: its function is to achieve the objectives of precision medicine, new protein design, multi-omics, and green chemistry.

TI A Temperature-Insensitive Optical Fiber Delay for
   Indistinguishability-Preserving Multiplexing of Photons
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB Quantum state purity, namely indistinguishability, of photons having different propagation histories is a prerequisite of multiphoton quantum information processing such as quantum networking and quantum computing. Although photonic multiplexing techniques using optical fiber delays can enhance the scalability of quantum states, the sensitivity of optical fibers to ambient temperature fluctuations deteriorates the indistinguishability of photons. This work demonstrates a novel optical differential delay using polarization-maintaining fibers, which suppresses temperature dependence by balancing thermal expansion with modal dispersion in a fully passive mechanism. Time-multiplexed Hong-Ou-Mandel interferometry under temperature variations from 24 to 50 degrees C verifies the effectiveness of the devised structure in a practical quantum photonics environment.

AB Current quantum computers are especially error prone and require high levels of optimization to reduce operation counts and maximize the probability the compiled program will succeed. These computers only support operations decomposed into one- and two-qubit gates and only two-qubit gates between physically connected pairs of qubits. Typical compilers first decompose operations, then route data to connected qubits. We propose a new compiler structure, Orchestrated Trios, that first decomposes to the three-qubit TAW routes the inputs of the higher-level Toffoli operations to groups of nearby qubits, then finishes decomposition to hardware-supported gates.
   This significantly reduces communication overhead by giving the routing pass access to the higher-level structure of the circuit instead of discarding it. A second benefit is the ability to now select an architecture-tuned Toffoli decomposition such as the 8-CNOT Toffoli for the specific hardware qubits now known after the routing pass. We perform real experiments on IBM Johannesburg showing an average 35% decrease in two-qubit gate count and 23% increase in success rate of a single Toffoli over Qiskit. We additionally compile many near-term benchmark algorithms showing an average 344% increase in (or 4.44x) simulated success rate on the Johannesburg architecture and compare with other architecture types.

We also perform an optimisation of initial system parameters, e.g.,the initial quantum coherence of one of the qubits strongly affects the efficiency of protocols and the system's performance as a battery.

TI Single-emitter quantum key distribution over 175 km of fibre with
   optimised finite key rates
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Quantum key distribution with solid-state single-photon emitters is gaining traction due to their rapidly improving performance and compatibility with future quantum networks. Here we emulate a quantum key distribution scheme with quantum-dot-generated single photons frequency-converted to 1550 nm, achieving count rates of 1.6 MHz with g((2))(0) = 3:6% and asymptotic positive key rates over 175 km of telecom fibre. We show that the commonly used finite-key analysis for non-decoy state QKD drastically overestimates secure key acquisition times due to overly loose bounds on statistical fluctuations. Using the tighter multiplicative Chernoff bound to constrain the estimated finite key parameters, we reduce the required number of received signals by a factor 10(8). The resulting finite key rate approaches the asymptotic limit at all achievable distances in acquisition times of one hour, and at 100 km we generate finite keys at 13 kbps for one minute of acquisition. This result is an important step towards long-distance single-emitter quantum networking.

TI Machine learning for optimal parameter prediction in free space
   continuous-variable quantum key distribution
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB For a practical continuous-variable quantum key distribution (CV-QKD) system, the optimization of modulation variance is crucial for promoting protocol performance. The optimization relies on algorithms like local search in general. But the efficiency of local search methods is limited in low latency and limited computing power scenarios due to their high computational consumption. Hence, this optimization approach is infeasible for satellite-based CV-QKD due to satellites' low power feature. In this paper, a neural network model that directly predicting the optimal modulation variance in nearly real time is proposed for free space gaussian modulated CV-QKD protocols. This work enhances the feasibility of implementing CV-QKD in low-Earth-orbit satellite scenarios, where typical link durations of few seconds demand rapid parameter optimization. Moreover, a simulation platform for free space CV-QKD protocol, which employs the precise orbital model to extract the elevation angle and the transmission length, is designed and developed to generate training sets that make the neural network model more practical. Our work can be used as a foundation to support parameter prediction for future quantum communication satellite missions.

TI Superrobust Geometric Control of a Superconducting Circuit
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB Geometric phases accompanying adiabatic quantum evolutions can be used to construct robust quantum control for quantum information processing due to their noise-resilient feature. A significant development along this line is to construct geometric gates using nonadiabatic quantum evolutions to reduce errors due to decoherence. However, it has been shown that nonadiabatic geometric gates are not necessarily more robust than dynamical ones, in contrast to an intuitive expectation. Here we experimentally investigate this issue for the case of nonadiabatic holonomic quantum computation (NHQC) and show that conventional NHQC schemes cannot guarantee the expected robustness due to a cross-coupling to the states outside the computational space. We implement a different set of constraints for gate construction in order to suppress such cross-coupling to achieve an enhanced robustness. Using a superconducting quantum circuit, we demonstrate high-fidelity holonomic gates whose infidelity against quasistatic transverse errors can be suppressed up to the fourth order, instead of the second order in conventional NHQC and dynamical gates. In addition, we explicitly measure the accumulated dynamical phase due to the abovementioned cross-coupling and verify that it is indeed much reduced in our NHQC scheme. We further demonstrate a protocol for constructing two-qubit NHQC gates also with an enhanced robustness.

AB Simulating nonequilibirum dynamics of a quantum many-body system is one of the promising applications of quantum computing. We simulate the time evolution of one-dimensional Z2 lattice gauge theory on IBM's superconducting 156-qubit device, ibm_fez. We consider the Floquet circuit made of the Trotter decomposition of Hamiltonian evolution and focus on its dynamics toward thermalization. Quantum simulation with the help of error mitigation is successful in running the Floquet circuit made of 38 and 116 qubits up to 10 Trotter steps in the best case. This is enough to reach the early stage of prethermalization. Our work would be a benchmark for the potential power of quantum computing for high-energy physics problems.

TI Coherent control of electron spin qubits in silicon using a global field
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Silicon spin qubits promise to leverage the extraordinary progress in silicon nanoelectronic device fabrication over the past half century to deliver large-scale quantum processors. Despite the scalability advantage of using silicon technology, realising a quantum computer with the millions of qubits required to run some of the most demanding quantum algorithms poses several outstanding challenges, including how to control many qubits simultaneously. Recently, compact 3D microwave dielectric resonators were proposed as a way to deliver the magnetic fields for spin qubit control across an entire quantum chip using only a single microwave source. Although spin resonance of individual electrons in the globally applied microwave field was demonstrated, the spins were controlled incoherently. Here we report coherent Rabi oscillations of single electron spin qubits in a planar SiMOS quantum dot device using a global magnetic field generated off-chip. The observation of coherent qubit control driven by a dielectric resonator establishes a credible pathway to achieving large-scale control in a spin-based quantum computer.

TI Converging Artificial Intelligence and Quantum Technologies: Accelerated
   Growth Effects in Technological Evolution
SO TECHNOLOGIES
AB One of the fundamental problems in the field of technological studies is to clarify the drivers and dynamics of technological evolution for sustaining industrial and economic change. This study confronts the problem by analyzing the converging technologies to explain effects on the evolutionary dynamics over time. This paper focuses on technological interaction between artificial intelligence and quantum technologies using a technometric model of technological evolution based on scientific and technological information (publications and patents). Findings show that quantum technology has a growth rate of 1.07, artificial intelligence technology has a rate of growth of 1.37, whereas the technological interaction of converging quantum and artificial intelligence technologies has an accelerated rate of growth of 1.58, higher than trends of these technologies taken individually. These findings suggest that technological interaction is one of the fundamental determinants in the rapid evolution of path-breaking technologies and disruptive innovations. The deductive implications of results about the effects of converging technologies are: (a) accelerated evolutionary growth; (b) a disproportionate (allometric) growth of patents driven by publications supporting a fast technological evolution. Our results support policy and managerial implications for the decision making of policymakers, technology analysts, and R&D managers that can direct R&D investments towards fruitful inter-relationships between radical technologies to foster scientific and technological change with positive societal and economic impcats.

AB The ability to store large amounts of photonic quantum states is regarded as substantial for future optical quantum computation and communication technologies. However, research for multiplexed quantum memories has been focused on systems that show good performance only after an elaborate preparation of the storage media. This makes it generally more difficult to apply outside a laboratory environment. In this work, we demonstrate a multiplexed random-access memory to store up to four optical pulses using electromagnetically induced transparency in warm cesium vapor. Using a ?-System on the hyperfine transitions of the Cs D1 line, we achieve a mean internal storage efficiency of 36% and a 1/e lifetime of 3.2 mu s. In combination with future improvements, this work facilitates the implementation of multiplexed memories in future quantum communication and computation infrastructures.

TI Exploring complex graphs using three-dimensional quantum walks of
   correlated photons
SO SCIENCE ADVANCES
AB Graph representations are a powerful concept for solving complex problems across natural science, as patterns of connectivity can give rise to a multitude of emergent phenomena. Graph-based approaches have proven particularly fruitful in quantum communication and quantum search algorithms in highly branched quantum networks. Here, we introduce a previously unidentified paradigm for the direct experimental realization of excitation dynamics associated with three-dimensional networks by exploiting the hybrid action of spatial and polarization degrees of freedom of photon pairs in complex waveguide circuits with tailored birefringence. This testbed for the experimental exploration of multiparticle quantum walks on complex, highly connected graphs paves the way toward exploiting the applicative potential of fermionic dynamics in integrated quantum photonics.

TI Implementation of the Projective Quantum Eigensolver on a Quantum
   Computer
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY A
AB We study the performance of our previously proposed projective quantum eigensolver (PQE) on IBM's quantum hardware in conjunction with error mitigation techniques. For a single qubit model of H-2, we find that we are able to obtain energies within 4 millihartree (2.5 kcal/mol) of the exact energy along the entire potential energy curve, with the accuracy limited by both the stochastic error and the inconsistent performance of the IBM devices. We find that an optimization algorithm using direct inversion of the iterative subspace can converge swiftly, even to excited states, but stochastic noise can prompt large parameter updates. For the 4-site transverse-field Ising model at its critical point, PQE with an appropriate application of qubit tapering can recover 99% of the correlation energy, even after discarding several parameters. The large number of CNOT gates needed for the additional parameters introduces a concomitant error that, on the IBM devices, results in a loss of accuracy despite the increased expressivity of the trial state. Error extrapolation techniques and tapering or postselection are recommended to mitigate errors in PQE hardware experiments.

TI Security analysis of satellite-to-ground reference-frame-independent
   quantum key distribution with beam wandering
SO CHINESE PHYSICS B
AB The reference-frame-independent (RFI) quantum key distribution (QKD) is suitable for satellite-based links by removing the active alignment on the reference frames. However, how the beam wandering influences the performance of RFI-QKD remains a pending issue in satellite-to-ground links. In this paper, based on the mathematical model for characterizing beam wandering, we present the security analysis for satellite-to-ground RFI-QKD and analytically derive formulas for calculating the secret key rate with beam wandering. Our simulation results show that the performance of RFI-QKD is better than the Bennett-Brassard 1984 (BB84) QKD with beam wandering in asymptotic case. Furthermore, the degree of influences of beam wandering is specifically presented for satellite-to-ground RFI-QKD when statistical fluctuations are taken into account. Our work can provide theoretical support for the realization of RFI-QKD using satellite-to-ground links and have implications for the construction of large-scale satellite-based quantum networks.

TI Error mitigation for variational quantum algorithms through mid-circuit
   measurements
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Noisy intermediate-scale quantum algorithms require novel paradigms of error mitigation. To obtain noise-robust quantum computers, each logical qubit is equipped with hundreds or thousands of physical qubits. However, it is not possible to use memory-consuming techniques for current quantum devices having at most hundreds or thousands of physical qubits on their own. For specific problems, valid quantum states have a unique structure as in the case of Fock states and W states where the Hamming weight is fixed, and the evolution takes place in a smaller subspace of the full Hilbert space. With this preknowledge, some errors can be detected during the evolution of the circuit, by filtering the states not obeying the pattern through postselection. In this paper, we present mid-circuit postselection schemes for frequently used encodings such as one-hot, binary, gray, and domain-wall encoding. For the particular subspace of one-hot states, we propose a method that works by compressing the full Hilbert space to a smaller subspace, allowing projecting to the desired subspace without using any ancilla qubits. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach for the quantum alternating operator ansatz algorithm. Our method is particularly suitable for the currently available hardware, where measuring and resetting are possible, but classical conditional operators are not.

SO FORUM MATHEMATICUM
AB The group of matrices P-1 of Pauli is a finite 2-group of order 16 and plays a fundamental role in quantum information theory, since it is related to the quantum information on the 1-qubit. Here we show that both P-1 and the Pauli 2-group P-2 of order 64 on 2-qubits, other than in quantum computing, can also appear in dynamical systems which are described by non-self-adjoint Hamiltonians. This will allow us to represent P-1 and P-2 in terms of pseudofermionic operators.

AB Rydberg physics is the most exquisite playground for the exploration of quantum technologies. Therefore, in this spectral investigation based on weakest bound electron potential model theory (WBEPMT). The quantum defects and Rydberg energies of low-lying and high-lying spectral Rydberg energy sequence in the following configurations: 1s2ns2Se1/2 and 1s2np2Po1/2 in Lithium-like ions (Z=4-6) Beryllium (Be II), Boron (B III) and Carbon (C IV) are computed with their radial expected values. Total 43 low-lying energies and quantum defects are computed and compared with 25 low lying radial expected values. The results are in good agreement with the previously published experimental / theoretical results. Based on the good agreement of low-lying data, total 257 new values of high-lying Rydberg energies and quantum defects are computed with 575 radial expected values currently not listed at NIST. The deviation in both sets of data doesn't exceed 1 cm(-1).

TI Estimation of Gaussian random displacement using non-Gaussian states
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB In continuous-variable quantum information processing, quantum error correction of Gaussian errors requires simultaneous estimation of both quadrature components of displacements in phase space. However, quadrature operators x and p are noncommutative conjugate observables, whose simultaneous measurement is prohibited by the uncertainty principle. Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) error correction deals with this problem using complex non-Gaussian states called GKP states. On the other hand, simultaneous estimation of displacement using experimentally feasible non-Gaussian states has not been well studied. In this paper, we consider a multiparameter estimation problem of displacements assuming an isotropic Gaussian prior distribution and allowing postselection of measurement outcomes. We derive a lower bound for the estimation error when only Gaussian operations are used and show that even simple non-Gaussian states such as single-photon states can beat this bound. Based on Ghosh's bound, we also obtain a lower bound for the estimation error when the maximum photon number of the input state is given. Our results reveal the role of non-Gaussianity in the estimation of displacements and pave the way toward the error correction of Gaussian errors using experimentally feasible non-Gaussian states.

TI Simulation of collective neutrino oscillations on a quantum computer
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
AB In astrophysical scenarios with large neutrino density, like supernovae and the early universe, the presence of neutrino-neutrino interactions can give rise to collective flavor oscillations in the out-of-equilibrium collective dynamics of a neutrino cloud. The role of quantum correlations in these phenomena is not yet well understood, in large part due to complications in solving for the real-time evolution of the strongly coupled many-body system. Future fault-tolerant quantum computers hold the promise to overcome much of these limitations and provide direct access to the correlated neutrino dynamic. In this work, we present the first simulation of a small system of interacting neutrinos using current generation quantum devices. We introduce a strategy to overcome limitations in the natural connectivity of the qubits and use it to track the evolution of entanglement in real-time. The results show the critical importance of error-mitigation techniques to extract meaningful results for entanglement measures using noisy, near term, quantum devices.

TI Multipartite entanglement to boost superadditivity of coherent
   information in quantum communication lines with polarization-dependent
   losses
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Coherent information quantifies the achievable rate of the reliable quantum information transmission through a communication channel. Use of the correlated quantum states instead of the factorized ones may result in an increase in the coherent information, a phenomenon known as superadditivity. However, even for simple physical models of channels it is rather difficult to detect the superadditivity and find the advantageous multipartite states. Here we consider the case of polarization-dependent losses and propose some physically motivated multipartite entangled states which outperform all factorized states in a wide range of the channel parameters. We show that, in the asymptotic limit of infinite number of channel uses, the superadditivity phenomenon takes place whenever the channel is neither degradable nor antidegradable. Besides the superadditivity identification, we also provide a method to modify the proposed states and get a higher quantum communication rate by doubling the number of channel uses. The obtained results give a deeper understanding of coherent information in the multishot scenario and may serve as a benchmark for quantum capacity estimations and future approaches toward an optimal strategy to transfer quantum information.

TI Transversal injection for direct encoding of ancilla states for
   non-Clifford gates using stabilizer codes
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Fault-tolerant, error-corrected quantum computation is commonly acknowledged to be crucial to the realization of large-scale quantum algorithms that could lead to extremely impactful scientific or commercial results. Achieving a universal set of quantum gate operations in a fault-tolerant, error-corrected framework suffers from a conservation of unpleasantness. In general, no matter what error-correction technique is employed, there is always one element of a universal gate set that carries a significant resource overhead-either in physical qubits, computational time, or both. Specifically, this is due to the application of non-Clifford gates. A common method for realizing these gates for stabilizer codes such as the surface code is a combination of three protocols: state injection, distillation, and gate teleportation. These protocols contribute to the resource overhead compared with logical operations such as a CNOT gate and contribute to the qubit resources for any error-corrected quantum algorithm. In this paper, we introduce a very simple protocol to potentially reduce this overhead for non-Clifford gates: transversal injection. Transversal injection modifies the initial physical states of all data qubits in a stabilizer code before standard encoding and results in the direct preparation of a large class of single qubit states, including resource states for non-Clifford logic gates. Preliminary results hint at high-quality fidelities at larger distances and motivate further research on this technique.

TI Tapping into Permutation Symmetry for Improved Detection of k-Symmetric
   Extensions
SO ENTROPY
AB Symmetric extensions are essential in quantum mechanics, providing a lens through which to investigate the correlations of entangled quantum systems and to address challenges like the quantum marginal problem. Though semi-definite programming (SDP) is a recognized method for handling symmetric extensions, it struggles with computational constraints, especially due to the large real parameters in generalized qudit systems. In this study, we introduce an approach that adeptly leverages permutation symmetry. By fine-tuning the SDP problem for detecting k-symmetric extensions, our method markedly diminishes the searching space dimensionality and trims the number of parameters essential for positive-definiteness tests. This leads to an algorithmic enhancement, reducing the complexity from O(d(2k)) to O(k(d2)) in the qudit k-symmetric extension scenario. Additionally, our approach streamlines the process of verifying the positive definiteness of the results. These advancements pave the way for deeper insights into quantum correlations, highlighting potential avenues for refined research and innovations in quantum information theory.

TI Low-overhead quantum computing with the color code
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Fault-tolerant quantum computation demands significant resources: large numbers of physical qubits must be checked for errors repeatedly to protect quantum data as logic gates are implemented in the presence of noise. We demonstrate that an approach based on the color code can lead to considerable reductions in the resource overheads compared with conventional methods, while remaining compatible with a two-dimensional layout. We propose a lattice surgery scheme that exploits the rich structure of the color-code phase to perform arbitrary pairs of commuting logical Pauli measurements in parallel while keeping the space cost low. Compared to lattice surgery schemes based on the surface code with the same code distance, and assuming the same amount of time is needed to complete a round of syndrome measurements, our approach yields about a 3x improvement in the space-time overhead, obtained from a combination of a 1.5x improvement in spatial overhead together with a 2x speedup due to the parallelization of commuting logical measurements. Even when taking into account the color code's lower error threshold using current decoders, the overhead is reduced by 10% at a physical error rate of 10-3 and by 50% at 10-4.

TI Quantum Computing in the RAN with Qu4Fec: Closing Gaps Towards
   Quantum-based FEC Processors
SO PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACM ON MEASUREMENT AND ANALYSIS OF COMPUTING SYSTEMS
AB In mobile communication systems, the increasing densification of radio access networks is creating unprecedented computational stress for baseband processing, threatening the industry's sustainability, and new computing paradigms are urgently needed to improve the efficiency of wireless processors. Quantum computing promises to revolutionize many computing-intensive tasks across diverse fields and therefore may be the key to realizing ultra-dense next-generation mobile systems that remain economically and environmentally viable. This paper investigates the potential of Quantum computing to accelerate Forward Error Correction (FEC), the most compute-heavy component of wireless processors. We first propose Qu4Fec, a novel solution for decoding Low-Density Parity Check (LDPC) codes on Quantum Processing Units (QPUs), which we show to outperform state-of-the-art approaches, by reducing the Block Error Rate (BLER) by nearly an order of magnitude in simulation. We then implement Qu4Fec on a real-world QPU platform to study its practical viability and performance. Our experiments reveal that current cutting-edge QPU architectures curb the capabilities of FEC and expose the underlying factors, including long qubit chains, scaling, and quantization. Based on these insights, we suggest original blueprints for future QPUs that can better support Quantum-based wireless processors. Overall, this paper provides a reliable reality check for the feasibility of wireless processing on Quantum annealers: as QPUs start to be considered part of a possible 6G landscape, our work may open new research paths towards the design of FEC methods for Quantum-powered wireless processors.

TI On-chip microwave coherent source with in-situ control of the photon
   number distribution
SO COMMUNICATIONS PHYSICS
AB Coherent photon sources are key elements in different applications, ranging from quantum sensing to quantum computing. The possibility of designing and engineering superconducting circuits behaving like artificial atoms supports the realization of quantum optics protocols, including microwave photons generation. Here we propose and theoretically investigate a design that allows a tunable photon injection directly on-chip. Our approach enables control of the emission via an external knob while preserving, in principle, the stability and linewidth characteristics. This is achieved by replacing the conventional capacitive link between the source and the reservoir with a tunable coupler, with the advantage of avoiding direct dynamical manipulation of the photon source dynamics, providing pulsed control of the emission. We validate the dynamical control of the generated state under the effect of an external flux threading the tunable coupler and discuss the possibility of employing this scheme also in the context of multiple bosonic reservoirs.

TI Practical security of twin-field quantum key distribution with optical
   phase-locked loop under wavelength-switching attack
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB The twin-field class quantum key distribution (TF-class QKD) has experimentally demonstrated the ability to surpass the fundamental rate-distance limit without requiring a quantum repeater, as a revolutional milestone. In TF-class QKD implementation, an optical phase-locked loop (OPLL) structure is commonly employed to generate a reference light with correlated phase, ensuring coherence of optical fields between Alice and Bob. In this configuration, the reference light, typically located in the untrusted station Charlie, solely provides wavelength reference for OPLL and does not participate in quantum-state encoding. However, the reference light may open a door for Eve to enter the source stations that are supposed to be well protected. Here, by identifying vulnerabilities of an acousto-optic modulator (AOM) in the OPLL scheme, we propose and demonstrate a wavelength-switching attack on a TF-class QKD system. This attack involves Eve deliberately manipulating the wavelength of the reference light to increase mean photon number of prepared quantum states, while maintaining stable interference between Alice and Bob as required by TF-class QKD protocols. The maximum observed increase in mean photon number is 8.7%, which has been theoretically proven to compromise the security of a TF-class QKD system. Moreover, we have shown that with well calibration of the modulators, the attack can be eliminated. Through this study, we highlight the importance of system calibration in the practical security in TF-class QKD implementation.

TI Tensor Network Enhanced Dynamic Multiproduct Formulas
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Tensor networks and quantum computation are two of the most powerful tools for the simulation of quantum many-body systems. Rather than viewing them as competing approaches, here we consider how these two methods can work in tandem. We introduce a novel algorithm that combines tensor networks and quantum computation to produce results that are more accurate than what could be achieved by either method used in isolation. Our algorithm is based on multiproduct formulas (MPFs)-a technique that linearly combines Trotter product formulas to reduce algorithmic error. It uses a quantum computer to calculate the expectation values and tensor networks to calculate the coefficients used in the linear combination. We present a detailed error analysis of the algorithm and demonstrate the full workflow on a one-dimensional quantum simulation problem on 50 qubits using two IBM quantum computers, IBM_TORINO and IBM_KYIV.

AB We demonstrate the utility of the Multi-Level Intermediate Representation (MLIR) for quantum computing. Specifically, we extend MLIR with a new quantum dialect that enables the expression and compilation of common quantum assembly languages. The true utility of this dialect is in its ability to be lowered to the LLVM intermediate representation (IR) in a manner that is adherent to the quantum intermediate representation (QIR) specification recently proposed by Microsoft. We leverage a qcor-enabled implementation of the QIR quantum runtime API to enable a retargetable (quantum hardware agnostic) compiler workflow mapping quantum languages to hybrid quantum-classical binary executables and object code. We evaluate and demonstrate this novel compiler workflow with quantum programs written in OpenQASM 2.0. We provide concrete examples detailing the generation of MLIR from OpenQASM source files, the lowering process from MLIR to LLVM IR, and ultimately the generation of executable binaries targeting available quantum processors.

TI A note on uncertainty relations of arbitrary N quantum channels
SO LASER PHYSICS LETTERS
AB Uncertainty principle plays a vital role in quantum physics. The Wigner-Yanase skew information characterizes the uncertainty of an observable with respect to the measured state. We generalize the uncertainty relations for two quantum channels to arbitrary N quantum channels based on Wigner-Yanase skew information. We illustrate that these uncertainty inequalities are tighter than the existing ones by detailed examples. Especially, we also discuss the uncertainty relations for N unitary channels, which could be regarded as variance-based sum uncertainty relations with respect to any pure state.

TI Verifying hierarchical network nonlocality in general quantum networks
SO CHINESE PHYSICS B
AB Recently, a class of innovative notions on quantum network nonlocality (QNN), called full quantum network nonlocality (FQNN), have been proposed in Phys. Rev. Lett. 128 010403 (2022). As the generalization of full network nonlocality (FNN), l-level quantum network nonlocality (l-QNN) was defined in arxiv. 2306.15717 quant-ph (2024). FQNN is a NN that can be generated only from a network with all sources being non-classical. This is beyond the existing standard network nonlocality, which may be generated from a network with only a non-classical source. One of the challenging tasks is to establish corresponding Bell-like inequalities to demonstrate the FQNN or l-QNN. Up to now, the inequality criteria for FQNN and l-QNN have only been established for star and chain networks. In this paper, we devote ourselves to establishing Bell-like inequalities for networks with more complex structures. Note that star and chain networks are special kinds of tree-shaped networks. We first establish the Bell-like inequalities for verifying l-QNN in k-forked tree-shaped networks. Such results generalize the existing inequalities for star and chain networks. Furthermore, we find the Bell-like inequality criteria for l-QNN for general acyclic and cyclic networks. Finally, we discuss the demonstration of l-QNN in the well-known butterfly networks.

TI Passive Continuous Variable Measurement-Device-Independent Quantum Key
   Distribution Predictable with Machine Learning in Oceanic Turbulence
SO ENTROPY
AB Building an underwater quantum network is necessary for various applications such as ocean exploration, environmental monitoring, and national defense. Motivated by characteristics of the oceanic turbulence channel, we suggest a machine learning approach to predicting the channel characteristics of continuous variable (CV) quantum key distribution (QKD) in challenging seawater environments. We consider the passive continuous variable (CV) measurement-device-independent (MDI) QKD in oceanic scenarios, since the passive-state preparation scheme offers simpler linear elements for preparation, resulting in reduced interaction with the practical environment. To provide a practical reference for underwater quantum communications, we suggest a prediction of transmittance for the ocean quantum links with a given neural network as an example of machine learning algorithms. The results have a good consistency with the real data within the allowable error range; this makes the passive CVQKD more promising for commercialization and implementation.

TI Quantum Random Access Memory for Dummies
SO SENSORS
AB Quantum Random Access Memory (QRAM) has the potential to revolutionize the area of quantum computing. QRAM uses quantum computing principles to store and modify quantum or classical data efficiently, greatly accelerating a wide range of computer processes. Despite its importance, there is a lack of comprehensive surveys that cover the entire spectrum of QRAM architectures. We fill this gap by providing a comprehensive review of QRAM, emphasizing its significance and viability in existing noisy quantum computers. By drawing comparisons with conventional RAM for ease of understanding, this survey clarifies the fundamental ideas and actions of QRAM. QRAM provides an exponential time advantage compared to its classical counterpart by reading and writing all data at once, which is achieved owing to storage of data in a superposition of states. Overall, we compare six different QRAM technologies in terms of their structure and workings, circuit width and depth, unique qualities, practical implementation, and drawbacks. In general, with the exception of trainable machine learning-based QRAMs, we observe that QRAM has exponential depth/width requirements in terms of the number of qubits/qudits and that most QRAM implementations are practical for superconducting and trapped-ion qubit systems.

TI Biclustering a dataset using photonic quantum computing
SO FRONTIERS IN COMPUTER SCIENCE
AB Biclustering is a problem in machine learning and data mining that seeks to group together rows and columns of a dataset according to certain criteria. In this work, we highlight the natural relation that quantum computing models like boson and Gaussian boson sampling (GBS) have to this problem. We first explore the use of boson sampling to identify biclusters based on matrix permanents. We then propose a heuristic that finds clusters in a dataset using Gaussian boson sampling by (i) converting the dataset into a bipartite graph and then (ii) running GBS to find the densest sub-graph(s) within the larger bipartite graph. Our simulations for the above proposed heuristics show promising results for future exploration in this area.

TI Robust one-sided self-testing of two-qubit states via quantum steering
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Entangled two-qubit states are the core building blocks for constructing quantum communication networks. Their accurate verification is crucial to the functioning of the networks, especially for untrusted networks. In this work we study the self-testing of two-qubit entangled states via steering inequalities, with robustness analysis against noise. More precisely, steering inequalities are constructed from the tilted Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt inequality and its general form, to verify the general two-qubit entangled states. The study provides a good robustness bound, using both local extraction map and numerical semidefinite-programming methods. In particular, optimal local extraction maps are constructed in the analytical method, which yields the theoretical optimal robustness bound. To further improve the robustness of one-sided self-testing, we propose a family of three measurement settings steering inequalities. The result shows that three-setting steering inequality demonstrates an advantage over two-setting steering inequality on robust self-testing with noise. Moreover, to construct a practical verification protocol, we clarify the sample efficiency of our protocols in the one-sided device-independent scenario.

TI Programmability of covariant quantum channels
SO QUANTUM
AB A programmable quantum processor uses the states of a program register to specify one element of a set of quantum channels which is applied to an input register. It is well-known that such a device is impossible with a finite-dimensional program register for any set that contains infinitely many unitary quantum channels (Nielsen and Chuang's No-Programming Theorem), meaning that a universal programmable quantum processor does not exist. The situation changes if the system has symmetries. Indeed, here we consider group-covariant channels. If the group acts irreducibly on the channel input, these channels can be implemented exactly by a programmable quantum processor with finite program dimension (via teleportation simulation, which uses the Choi-Jamiolkowski state of the channel as a program). Moreover, by leveraging the representation theory of the symmetry group action, we show how to remove redundancy in the program and prove that the resulting program register has minimum Hilbert space dimension. Furthermore, we provide upper and lower bounds on the program register dimension of a processor implementing all group-covariant channels approximately.

AB Quantum state tomography (QST) is a crucial ingredient for almost all aspects of experimental quantum information processing. As an analog of the "imaging" technique in quantum settings, QST is born to be a data science problem, where machine learning techniques, noticeably neural networks, have been applied extensively. We build and demonstrate an optical neural network (ONN) for photonic polarization qubit QST. The ONN is equipped with built-in optical nonlinear activation functions based on electromagnetically induced transparency. The experimental results show that our ONN can determine the phase parameter of the qubit state accurately. As optics are highly desired for quantum interconnections, our ONN-QST may contribute to the realization of optical quantum networks and inspire the ideas combining artificial optical intelligence with quantum information studies.

By extending the unitary coupled cluster (UCC) theory to describe crystals in arbitrary dimensions, for a hydrogen chain, we numerically demonstrate that the UCC ansatz implemented on a quantum circuit can be successfully optimized with a small deviation from the exact diagonalization over the entire range of the potential energy curves. Furthermore, by using the quantum subspace expansion method, in which we truncate the Hilbert space within the linear response regime from the ground state, the quasiparticle band structure is computed as charged excited states. Our work establishes a powerful interface between the rapidly developing quantum technology and modern material science.

TI Quantum advantage in learning from experiments
SO SCIENCE
AB Quantum technology promises to revolutionize how we learn about the physical world. An experiment that processes quantum data with a quantum computer could have substantial advantages over conventional experiments in which quantum states are measured and outcomes are processed with a classical computer. We proved that quantum machines could learn from exponentially fewer experiments than the number required by conventional experiments. This exponential advantage is shown for predicting properties of physical systems, performing quantum principal component analysis, and learning about physical dynamics. Furthermore, the quantum resources needed for achieving an exponential advantage are quite modest in some cases. Conducting experiments with 40 superconducting qubits and 1300 quantum gates, we demonstrated that a substantial quantum advantage is possible with today's quantum processors.

TI Implementation and Realistic Security of Unidimensional Modulation
   Continuous-Variable Quantum Key Distribution in Downstream Access
   Networks
SO PHOTONICS
AB To address the demand for low-cost deployment in quantum key distribution (QKD) networks, this study explores the implementation of unidimensional (UD) modulation continuous-variable quantum key distribution (CV-QKD) protocols within downstream access networks. The UD CV-QKD protocol employs a single modulator for information encoding, offering benefits such as reduced implementation cost and lower random number consumption, which collectively decrease the overall setup expense of QKD systems. Through systematic performance analysis, it is demonstrated that the proposed UD modulation downstream access network scheme exhibits strong scalability and practical applicability. When supporting 32 users, the system maintains secure communication over transmission distances of up to 50 km. As the number of users increases to 64, performance declines slightly; however, the system still achieves a 35 km transmission distance, which remains suitable for many metropolitan access applications. Even in high-density access scenarios involving 128 users, the system sustains a positive key rate within a transmission range of 20 km. Furthermore, this study evaluates the protocol's practical security under source intensity errors and finite-size effects. These results provide meaningful guidance for deploying low-cost, high-security quantum communication access networks and contribute to advancing QKD technologies toward scalable, real-world implementations.

TI Quantum activation functions for quantum neural networks
SO QUANTUM INFORMATION PROCESSING
AB The field of artificial neural networks is expected to strongly benefit from recent developments of quantum computers. In particular, quantum machine learning, a class of quantum algorithms which exploit qubits for creating trainable neural networks, will provide more power to solve problems such as pattern recognition, clustering and machine learning in general. The building block of feed-forward neural networks consists of one layer of neurons connected to an output neuron that is activated according to an arbitrary activation function. The corresponding learning algorithm goes under the name of Rosenblatt perceptron. Quantum perceptrons with specific activation functions are known, but a general method to realize arbitrary activation functions on a quantum computer is still lacking. Here, we fill this gap with a quantum algorithm which is capable to approximate any analytic activation functions to any given order of its power series. Unlike previous proposals providing irreversible measurement-based and simplified activation functions, here we show how to approximate any analytic function to any required accuracy without the need to measure the states encoding the information. Thanks to the generality of this construction, any feed-forward neural network may acquire the universal approximation properties according to Hornik's theorem. Our results recast the science of artificial neural networks in the architecture of gate-model quantum computers.

TI Entanglement assisted training algorithm for supervised quantum
   classifiers
SO QUANTUM INFORMATION PROCESSING
AB We propose a new training algorithm for supervised quantum classifiers. Here, we have harnessed the property of quantum entanglement to build a model that can simultaneously manipulate multiple training samples along with their labels. Subsequently, a Bell-inequality-based cost function is constructed, that can encode errors from multiple samples, simultaneously, in a way that is not possible by any classical means. We show that upon minimizing this cost function one can achieve successful classification in benchmark datasets. The results presented in this paper are for binary classification problems. Nevertheless, the analysis can be extended to multi-class classification problems as well.

AB Quantum control refers to the manipulation of dynamical quantum systems to force them to complete given tasks such as preparing a desired state and tracking a designed trajectory. We consider the state preparation problem of a two-qubit closed quantum system from an initial to a desired state. The aim is to achieve a high fidelity in a given fixed time with limited control resources. The Deep Q-learning (DQL) for solving the quantum state preparation problem is explored in this paper. We propose a novel semi-Markov DQL algorithm based on a modified action selection procedure and improved replay memory to enhance performance of standard DQL algorithm. The proposed algorithm shows high performance for discovering high-fidelity control protocols and for converging to a good policy, compared with standard DQL. The proposed modifications enhance the exploration-exploitation ability for DQL agent and the robustness for solving quantum control problem with high-fidelity at different numbers of control steps. Numerical results on a two-qubit closed system show effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.

TI Efficient post-selection in light cone correlations of monitored quantum
   circuits
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB We consider how to target evolution conditioned on atypical measurement outcomes in monitored quantum circuits, i.e., the post-selection problem. We show that for a simple class of measurement schemes, post-selected light cone dynamical correlation functions can be obtained efficiently from the averaged correlations of a different unitary circuit. This connects rare measurement outcomes in one circuit to typical outcomes in another one. We derive conditions for the existence of this rare-to-typical mapping in brickwork quantum circuits made of XYZ gates. We illustrate these general results with a model system that exhibits a dynamical crossover (a smoothed dynamical transition) in event statistics, and discuss extensions to more general dynamical correlations.

AB Secure Delegated Quantum Computation (SDQC) protocols allow a client to delegate a quantum computation to a powerful remote server while ensuring the privacy and the integrity of its computation. Recent resource-efficient and noiserobust protocols led to experimental proofs of concept. Yet, their physical requirements are still too stringent to be added directly to the roadmap of quantum hardware vendors.
   To address part of this issue, this paper shows how to alleviate the necessity for the client to have a single-photon source. We describe an SDQC protocol, similar in spirit to the decoy state method used in QKD, which requires only a source of weak coherent pulses. It is noise-robust, composable, and has negligible correctness and security errors.
   The simplest instantiation of our protocol with only 2 intensities shows improved scaling at low transmittance and adds verifiability to previous proposals.

TI Loss tolerance quantum key distribution based on the signal extraction
   model and advantage distillation technology
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Compared with traditional networks, quantum key distribution (QKD) offers the ultimate resources, allowing two remote users to share secret symmetric keys regardless of the capabilities of eavesdroppers. However, the widespread application of commercial QKD is still challenging due to the low photon detection efficiency and the extremely high transmission loss. Here we demonstrate a fully commercial phase-encoding QKD system using a signal extraction model and advantage distillation technology to suppress detector noise and perform real-time pre-error correction. 1.89 x 10-10 in the asymptotic case and 7.43 x 10-12 in the nonasymptotic case secret key bits per pulse are achieved with a total loss of 70.05 dB. This method not only increases the transmission loss tolerance but also provides a more realistic deployment of quantum communication.

TI Magnetic field detection using a two-qubit system under noisy Heisenberg
   interaction
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS A-MATHEMATICAL AND THEORETICAL
AB We propose a method to design a magnetic field detector using a noisy two-qubit system. The system evolves under a noisy Heisenberg interaction Hamiltonian, and we investigate its behavior by calculating both the l1-norm of quantum coherence and the return probability in the presence and absence of an external magnetic field. We allow for decoherence modeled by quasi-static charge noise in the exchange coupling of the two-qubit system and find that, while the magnetic field does not significantly influence the decoherence process, it introduces a distinct oscillation in the return probability over time. Importantly, the oscillation frequency is directly proportional to the strength of the applied magnetic field, providing a clear signature that can be used for magnetic field detection. These results point towards the feasibility of realizing a practical quantum-based magnetic field detector, with the ability to operate under noisy conditions while maintaining sensitivity to the field strength.

TI Phase estimation of definite photon number states by using quantum
   circuits
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB We propose a method to map the conventional optical interferometry setup into quantum circuits. The unknown phase shift inside a Mach-Zehnder interferometer in the presence of photon loss is estimated by simulating the quantum circuits. For this aim, we use the Bayesian approach in which the likelihood functions are needed, and they are obtained by simulating the appropriate quantum circuits. The precision of four different definite photon-number states of light, which all possess six photons, is compared. The measurement scheme that we have considered is counting the number of photons detected after the final beam splitter of the interferometer, and photon loss is modeled by using fictitious beam splitters in the arms of the interferometer. Our results indicate that three of the four definite photon-number states considered can have better precision than the standard interferometry limit whenever the photon loss rate is in a specific range. In addition, the Fisher information for the four definite photon-number states in the setup is also estimated to check the optimality of the chosen measurement scheme.

SO APPLIED PHYSICS REVIEWS
AB The continuously growing effort toward developing real-world quantum technological applications has come to demand an increasing amount of flexibility from its respective platforms. This review presents a highly adaptable engineering technique for photonic quantum technologies based on the artificial structuring of the material nonlinearity. This technique, while, in a simple form, already featured across the full breadth of photonic quantum technologies, has undergone significant development over the last decade, now featuring advanced, aperiodic designs. This review gives an introduction to the three-wave-mixing processes lying at the core of this approach and illustrates, on basis of the underlying quantum-mechanical description, how they can artificially be manipulated to engineer the corresponding photon characteristics. It then describes how this technique can be employed to realize a number of very different objectives, which are expected to find application across the full range of photonic quantum technologies, and presents a summary of the research done toward these ends to date.

TI Optimizing fictitious states for Bell inequality violation in bipartite
   qubit systems with applications to the tt <overline> system
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
AB There is a significant interest in testing quantum entanglement and Bell inequality violation in highenergy experiments. Since the analyses in high-energy experiments are performed with events statistically averaged over phase space, the states used to determine observables depend on the choice of coordinates through an event -dependent basis and are thus not genuine quantum states, but rather "fictitious states. " We find that the basis which diagonalizes the spin -spin correlations is optimal for constructing fictitious states to test the violation of Bell 's inequality. This result is applied directly to the bipartite qubit system of a top and antitop produced at a hadron collider. We show that the beam axis is the optimal basis choice near the tt <overline> threshold production for measuring Bell inequality violation, while at high transverse momentum the basis that aligns along the momentum direction of the top is optimal.

TI Self-testing two-qubit maximally entangled states from generalized
   Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt tests
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Device-independent certification, also known as self-testing, aims at guaranteeing the proper functioning of untrusted and uncharacterized devices. For example, the quality of an unknown source expected to produce two-qubit maximally entangled states can be evaluated in a bipartite scenario, each party using two binary measurements. The most robust approach consists in deducing the fidelity of produced states with respect to a two-qubit maximally entangled state from the violation of the CHSH inequality. In this paper, we show how the self-testing of two-qubit maximally entangled states is improved by a refined analysis of measurement statistics. The use of suitably chosen Bell tests, depending on the observed correlations, allows one to conclude higher fidelities than ones previously known. In particular, nontrivial self-testing statements can be obtained from correlations that cannot be exploited by a CHSH-based self-testing strategy. Our results not only provide insight into the set of quantum correlations suited for self-testing, but also facilitate the experimental implementations of device-independent certifications.

TI Doughnut-biting photon capturing scheme for drone-based orbital angular
   momentum quantum key distribution
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Drone-based quantum key distribution (QKD) offers a flexible, cost-effective, and reconfigurable approach to extending the reach of spatial and temporal quantum communication. The rotation-invariant properties of orbital angular momentum (OAM) effectively mitigate issues related to reference frame alignment from the drone platform. Utilizing OAM encoding to achieve high-dimensional quantum key distribution (HD-QKD) exhibits significant advantages in terms of communication capacity and robustness. However, the state-dependent diffraction of OAM requires a single large-aperture receiving telescope, which restricts the communication distance of drone-based QKD. In this paper, we propose a "doughnut-biting" photon-capturing scheme for drone-based OAM-QKD. Firstly, a mobile model for air-to-air OAM-encoded QKD is established based on a drone platform. Secondly, the performance of the system under center-aligned (CA) and center-misaligned (CM) receiving schemes based on the intensity distribution of OAM are compared. Numerical simulations indicate that the CA scheme offers simpler targeting technology and higher information capacity at short distances, while the CM scheme extends the transmission distance and provides advantages in data rate. In conclusion, an efficient "doughnut-biting" scheme is proposed to increase the transmission distance by at least 50.5% in the receiving aperture range of 5-20 cm. The proposed scheme provides a practical framework for implementing long-distance OAM-encoded QKD in free space, contributing to the development of an integrated space-to-ground quantum communication network. We introduce space-time metamaterials as the natural evolution of time-varying metamaterials, highlighting their enhanced properties and potential advantages. These metamaterials offer virtually limitless diversity, driven by their dynamic levels, velocity regimes, and space-time architectures. Notably, it unlocks extensive possibilities for transition engineering-the precise control of classical and quantum state transitions through tuning modulation velocity, potential, or dispersion.

TI Practical Framework for Analyzing High-Dimensional Quantum Key
   Distribution Setups
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB High-dimensional (HD) entanglement promises both enhanced key rates and overcoming obstacles faced by modern-day quantum communication. However, modern convex optimization-based security arguments are limited by computational constraints; thus, accessible dimensions are far exceeded by progress in HD photonics, bringing forth a need for efficient methods to compute key rates for large encoding dimensions. In response to this problem, we present a flexible analytic framework facilitated by the dual of a semidefinite program and diagonalizing operators inspired by entanglement-witness theory, enabling the efficient computation of key rates in high-dimensional systems. To facilitate the latter, we show how matrix completion techniques can be incorporated to effectively yield improved, computable bounds on the key rate in paradigmatic high-dimensional systems of time- or frequency-bin entangled photons and beyond, revealing the potential for very high-dimensions to surpass low dimensional protocols already with existing technology. In our accompanying work, (F. Kanitschar and M. Huber, Composable finite-size security of high-dimensional quantum key distribution protocols), available on arXiv, we show how our findings can be used to establish finite-size security against coherent attacks for general HD-QKD protocols both in the fixed- and variable-length scenario.

TI Dynamics of Dispersive Measurements of Flux-Qubit States: Energy-Level
   Splitting Connected to Quantum Wave Mechanics
SO NANOMATERIALS
AB Superconducting flux qubits have many advantages as a storage of quantum information, such as broad range tunability of frequency, small-size fabricability, and high controllability. In the flux qubit-oscillator, qubits are connected to SQUID resonators for the purpose of performing dispersive non-destructive readouts of qubit signals with high fidelity. In this work, we propose a theoretical model for analyzing quantum characteristics of a flux qubit-oscillator on the basis of quantum solutions obtained using a unitary transformation approach. The energy levels of the combined system (qubit + resonator) are analyzed in detail. Equally spaced each energy level of the resonator splits into two parts depending on qubit states. Besides, coupling of the qubit to the resonator brings about an additional modification in the split energy levels. So long as the coupling strength and the tunnel splitting are not zero but finite values, the energy-level splitting of the resonator does not disappear. We conclude that quantum nondemolition dispersive measurements of the qubit states are possible by inducing bifurcation of the resonator states through the coupling.

SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB This work analyzes quantum correlations of photon pairs initially prepared in a Bell state, where one photon undergoes Compton scattering from a stationary, unpolarized electron. The evolved two-photon density matrix is analytically derived and spectrally decomposed. Concurrence and the Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (CHSH) inequality evaluations identify angular regions demonstrating quantum steering correlations, entanglement without steering, and complete separability. The Peres conjecture is applied to interpret regions of entanglement lacking steering, emphasizing their limited practicality for quantum-information tasks. These results provide details potentially useful for employing Compton-scattered annihilation photons in various quantum protocols.

TI Application of quantum computing in discrete portfolio optimization
SO JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING
AB This study proposes a novel and more efficient quantum algorithm for portfolio optimi-zation using quantum combinatorial optimization (QCO) techniques. A recent construction developed in 2021 has sparked the field of financial portfolio optimization through the Quantum Walk Optimization Algorithm (QWOA). In this study, we investigated the complexity and efficiency of quantum optimization algorithms with a special interest in QWOA. The objective is to minimize investment risk by having a good combination of assets in the portfolio. We also focused on reducing the number of iterations while attaining a high-quality resolution through contraction of the solution space to ease computations. The concept of QWOA was extended by constructing a newly outperforming scheme known as the "Quantum Mix Optimization Algorithm (QMOA)." QMOA algorithm codes were provided for the implementation and simulation of numerical results. In addition, the efficiency of QMOA, which is better than the existing QCO algorithms, was discussed. For instance, the least QWOA number of computations required to execute the initial state equation was p > 2, whereas this value was p = 2 in the proposed QMOA.

TI Automated quantum software engineering
SO AUTOMATED SOFTWARE ENGINEERING
AB As bigger quantum processors with hundreds of qubits become increasingly available, the potential for quantum computing to solve problems intractable for classical computers is becoming more tangible. Designing efficient quantum algorithms and software in tandem is key to achieving quantum advantage. Quantum software engineering is challenging due to the unique counterintuitive nature of quantum logic. Moreover, with larger quantum systems, traditional programming using quantum assembly language and qubit-level reasoning is becoming infeasible. Automated Quantum Software Engineering (AQSE) can help to reduce the barrier to entry, speed up development, reduce errors, and improve the efficiency of quantum software. This article elucidates the motivation to research AQSE (why), a precise description of such a framework (what), and reflections on components that are required for implementing it (how).

TI Opportunities for quantum computing within net-zero power system
   optimization
SO JOULE
AB Optimized power system planning and operation are core to delivering a low-cost and high-reliability transition path to net-zero carbon emissions. The major technological changes associated with net zero, including the rapid adoption of renewables, electrification of transport and heating, and system-wide digitalization, each increase the scope for optimization to create value, but at the cost of greater computational complexity. Although power system optimization problems are now posing challenges for even the largest exa-scale supercomputers, a new avenue for progress has been opened by recent breakthroughs in quantum computing. Quantum computing offers a fundamentally new computational infrastructure with different capabilities and trade-offs and is reaching a level of maturity where, for the first time, a practical advantage over classical computing is available for specific applications. In this review, we identify significant and wide-ranging opportunities for quantum computing to offer value for power system optimization. In addition to reviewing the latest work on quantum computing for simulationbased and combinatorial power system optimization applications, we also review state-of-the-art theoretical work on quantum convex optimization and machine learning and map this to power system optimization applications where quantum computing is underexplored. Based on our review, we analyze challenges for industry implementation and scale-up and propose directions for future research.

TI Effect of high temperature annealing on cryogenic transport properties
   of silicon MOSFETs with a thin SiO2/HfO2 stacked
   dielectric
SO SEMICONDUCTOR SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Quantum computing is expected to break the computing power bottleneck with the help of quantum superposition and quantum entanglement. In order to fabricate fault-tolerant quantum computers for encoding quantum information, it is important to improve the cryogenic mobility of silicon-based metal oxide semiconductor field effect transistors (MOSFETs) with a thin gate dielectric layer as much as possible. Based on a thin SiO2/HfO2 stacked dielectric, we investigate the effect of post-deposition annealing (PDA) temperature on the MOSFET cryogenic transport properties. The results show that silicon atoms will diffuse into the HfO2 to form silicates during PDA, leading to the HfO2 dielectric constant decrease. As the PDA temperature increases, the proportion of monoclinic hafnium oxide decreases and the tetragonal phase increases gradually. The oxygen vacancy content increases gradually, resulting in fixed charge density increases and the mobility decreases. The contribution of the forming gas annealing (FGA) to the mobility enhancement is clarified and the HfO2 recrystallization process is revealed from the perspective of long-time annealing. Finally, the mobility peak of silicon MOSFETs with thin SiO2/HfO2 dielectrics is enhanced to 1387 cm(2)(V.s)(-1) at 1.6 K, which provides a technical pathway for the development of silicon-based quantum computation.

TI Polymorphs of 17O-Implanted ST1 Spin Centers in Diamond and
   Spectroscopy of Strongly Coupled 13C Nuclear Spins
SO ACS PHOTONICS
AB The so-called ST1 center in diamond is one of the very few known systems today that possesses properties similar to the nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center. The ST1 enables spin coherent control at room temperature with even larger readout contrast than NV centers and is therefore promising for quantum information or sensing at 300 K. However, the nature and methods of on-demand creation of the ST1 were still unknown and a large dispersion of the optical, spin properties, and photostability was reported. Here, using two independent methods, we definitely evidence that the ST1 center is made of oxygen. Contrarily to previous studies where the ST1 centers were found scarcely (likely created unintentionally by oxygen-plasma treatments), the centers are created here reproducibly by oxygen implantation in several samples and enable a comprehensive study of their "bulk" optical and spin properties. Electron spin resonance line widths as low as 330 kHz were measured, indicating electron spin coherence time T-2* in the mu s range at 300 K. Further, we report on the hyperfine interaction with O-17 and with nearby C-13 nuclear spins. Twenty different coupling types with C-13 larger than 2.5 MHz are found. This highlights the low symmetry of the ST1, the presence of at least one carbon vacancy in the ST1 structure, and the possibility to address a larger number of discernible C-13 nuclear spins than with the NV center. These results open the way to the creation and use of quantum registers or nuclear spin memories with a long coherence time based on ST1 centers, which also have potential for quantum sensing.

TI Ultranarrow spectral line of the radiation in double qubit-cavity
   ultrastrong coupling system
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB The ultrastrongly coupling (USC) system has very important research significance in quantum simulation and quantum computing. In this paper, the ultranarrow spectrum of a circuit QED system with two qubits ultrastrongly coupled to a single-mode cavity is studied. In the regime of USC, the JC model breaks down and the counter-rotating terms in the quantum Rabi Hamiltonian leads to the level anti-crossing in the energy spectrum. Choosing a single-photon driving field at the point of avoided-level crossing, we can get an equivalent four-level dressed state model, in which the dissipation of the two intermediate states is only related to the qubits decay. Due to the electron shelving of these two metastable states, a narrow peak appears in the cavity emission spectrum. Furthermore, we find that the physical origin for the spectral narrowing is the vacuum-induced quantum interference between two transition pathways. And this interference effect couples the slowly decaying incoherent components of the density matrix into the equations of the sidebands. This result provides a possibility for the study of quantum interference effect in the USC system. (C) 2021 Optical Society of America under the terms of the OSA Open Access Publishing Agreement

TI Quantum spin-flavour memory of ultrahigh-energy neutrino
SO EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL PLUS
AB There are two types of uncertainties related to the measurements done on a quantum system: statistical and those related to non-commuting observables and incompatible measurements. The latter indicates the quantum system's inherent nature and is in the scope of the present study. We explore uncertainties related to the interstellar ultrahigh-energy neutrino and introduce a novel concept: quantum spin-flavour memory. Advanced uncertainty measures are entropic measures, and the effect of the quantum memory reduces the uncertainty. The problem in question corresponds to a real physical event: high-energy Dirac neutrinos emitted by some distant source and propagating towards the earth. The neutrino has a finite magnetic moment and interacts with both deterministic and stochastic interstellar magnetic fields. To describe the effect of a noisy environment, we exploit the Lindblad master equation for the neutrino density matrix. Quantum spin-flavour memory is quantified in terms of the generalized Kraus's trade-off relation. This trade-off relation converts to the equality when quantum memory is absent. We discovered that while most measures of quantum correlations show their irrelevance, the quantum spin-flavour discord is the quantifier of the quantum spin-flavour memory.

TI Petz recovery maps of single-qubit decoherence channels in an ion trap
   quantum processor
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB The Petz recovery map provides a near-optimal reversal of quantum noise, yet proposals for its implementation are only recent. We propose a physical realization of the exact state-specific Petz map in an ion trap for qubit decoherence channels. Our circuit constructions require at most 1 (2) ancilla qubits and 3 (20) CNOT gates for channels with Kraus rank 2 (>2). We analyze typical ion trap errors and construct corresponding Petz maps, simulating their performance under realistic noise modeled by residual spin-motion coupling. Quantum circuits are provided for depolarizing, dephasing, and amplitude damping channels. Focusing on single-shot recovery, suited for present-day devices, we also quantify the precision of prior knowledge required to achieve a recovery error below 0.01 across varying decoherence levels and state purities.

TI How to Simulate Quantum Measurement without Computing Marginals
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB We describe and analyze algorithms for classically simulating measurement of an n-qubit quantum state in the standard basis, that is, sampling a bit string from the probability distribution determined by the Born rule. Our algorithms reduce the sampling task to computing poly(n) amplitudes of n-qubit states; unlike previously known techniques they do not require computation of marginal probabilities. Two classes of quantum states are considered: output states of polynomial-size quantum circuits, and ground states of local Hamiltonians with an inverse polynomial spectral gap. We show that our algorithms can significantly accelerate quantum circuit simulations based on tensor network contraction or low-rank stabilizer decompositions. As another striking consequence we obtain the first efficient classical simulation algorithm for measurement-based quantum computation with the surface code resource state on any planar graph and any schedule of measurements.

TI Super-robust nonadiabatic geometric quantum control
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Nonadiabatic geometric quantum computation (NGQC) and nonadiabatic holonomic quantum computation (NHQC) have been proposed to reduce the run time of geometric quantum gates. However, in terms of robustness against experimental control errors, the existing NGQC and NHQC scenarios have no advantage over standard dynamical gates in most cases. Here, we give the reasons why nonadiabatic geometric gates are sensitive to the control errors and, further, we propose a scheme of super-robust nonadiabatic geometric quantum control, in which the super-robust condition can guarantee both high speed and robustness of the geometric gate. To illustrate the working mechanism of super-robust geometric quantum gates, we give two simple examples of SR-NGQC and SR-NHQC for two- and three-level quantum systems, respectively. Theoretical and numerical results with the experimental parameters indicate that our scheme can significantly improve the gate performance compared to the previous NGQC, NHQC, and standard dynamical schemes. Super-robust geometric quantum computation can be applied to various physical platforms such as superconducting qubits, quantum dots, and trapped ions. All of these sufficiently show that our scheme provides a promising way towards robust geometric quantum computation.

This attack has a success rate of 100% and can be executed in constant time. We name a vulnerable scheme which security is fully broken by our attack and suggest how to improve the scheme to invalidate this attack. The proposed attack highlights the importance of carefully designing quantum encryption schemes to ensure their security against quantum adversaries, even in a black-box setting. We point to the faulty assumption and name a criterion for future quantum cipher design to prevent similar vulnerabilities.

TI Symmetry-Protected Topological Haldane Phase on a Qudit Quantum
   Processor
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Symmetry-protected topological phases have fundamentally changed our understanding of quantum matter. An archetypal example of such a quantum phase of matter is the Haldane phase, containing the spin-1 Heisenberg chain. The intrinsic quantum nature of such phases, however, often makes it challenging to study them using classical means. Here, we use trapped-ion qutrits to natively engineer spin-1 chains within the Haldane phase. Using a scalable deterministic procedure to prepare the Affleck-Kennedy-LiebTasaki (AKLT) state within the Haldane phase, we study the topological features of this system on a qudit quantum processor. Notably, we verify the long-range string order of the state, despite its shortrange correlations, and observe spin fractionalization of the physical spin-1 particles into effective qubits at the chain edges, a defining feature of this system. The native realization of Haldane physics on a qudit quantum processor and the scalable preparation procedures open the door to the efficient exploration of a wide range of systems beyond spin-1/2.

TI Union-Intersection Union-Find for Decoding Depolarizing Errors in
   Topological Codes
SO IEEE JOURNAL ON SELECTED AREAS IN INFORMATION THEORY
AB In this paper, we introduce the Union-Intersection Union-Find (UIUF) algorithm for decoding depolarizing errors in topological codes, combining the strengths of iterative and standard Union-Find (UF) decoding. While iterative UF improves performance at moderate error rates, it lacks an error correction guarantee. To address this, we develop UIUF, which maintains the enhanced performance of iterative UF while ensuring error correction up to half the code distance. Through simulations under code capacity, phenomenological, and biased noise models, we show that UIUF significantly outperforms UF, reducing the logical error rate by over an order of magnitude (at around 10(-5)). Moreover, UIUF achieves lower logical error rates than the Minimum Weight Perfect Matching (MWPM) decoder on rotated surface codes under both the code capacity and phenomenological noise models, while preserving efficient linear-time complexity.

TI Quantum-inspired genetic algorithm for designing planar multilayer
   photonic structure
SO NPJ COMPUTATIONAL MATERIALS
AB Quantum algorithms are emerging tools in the design of functional materials due to their powerful solution space search capability. How to balance the high price of quantum computing resources and the growing computing needs has become an urgent problem to be solved. We propose a novel optimization strategy based on an active learning scheme that combines the Quantum-inspired Genetic Algorithm (QGA) with machine learning surrogate model regression. Using Random Forests as the surrogate model circumvents the time-consuming physical modeling or experiments, thereby improving the optimization efficiency. QGA, a genetic algorithm embedded with quantum mechanics, combines the advantages of quantum computing and genetic algorithms, enabling faster and more robust convergence to the optimum. Using the design of planar multilayer photonic structures for transparent radiative cooling as a testbed, we show superiority of our algorithm over the classical genetic algorithm (CGA). Additionally, we show the precision advantage of the Random Forest (RF) model as a flexible surrogate model, which relaxes the constraints on the type of surrogate model that can be used in other quantum computing optimization algorithms (e.g., quantum annealing needs Ising model as a surrogate).

TI Hierarchies of resources for measurement-based quantum computation
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB For certain restricted computational tasks, quantum mechanics provides a provable advantage over any possible classical implementation. Several of these results have been proven using the framework of measurement-based quantum computation (MBQC), where nonlocality and more generally contextuality have been identified as necessary resources for certain quantum computations. Here, we consider the computational power of MBQC in more detail by refining its resource requirements, both on the allowed operations and the number of accessible qubits. More precisely, we identify which Boolean functions can be computed in non-adaptive MBQC, with local operations contained within a finite level in the Clifford hierarchy. Moreover, for non-adaptive MBQC restricted to certain subtheories such as stabiliser MBQC, we compute the minimal number of qubits required to compute a given Boolean function. Our results point towards hierarchies of resources that more sharply characterise the power of MBQC beyond the binary of contextuality vs non-contextuality.

TI Exploiting anticommutation in Hamiltonian simulation
SO QUANTUM
AB Quantum computing can efficiently simulate Hamiltonian dynamics of many-body quantum physics, a task that is generally intractable with classical computers. The hardness lies at the ubiquitous anticommutative relations of quantum operators, in corresponding with the notorious negative sign problem in classical simulation. Intuitively, Hamiltonians with more commutative terms are also easier to simulate on a quantum computer, and anti-commutative relations generally cause more errors, such as in the product formula method. Here, we theoretically explore the role of anti-commutative relation in Hamiltonian simulation. We find that, contrary to our intuition, anticommutative relations could also reduce the hardness of Hamiltonian simulation. Specifically, Hamiltonians with mutually anti-commutative terms are easy to simulate, as what happens with ones consisting of mutually commutative terms. Such a property is further utilized to reduce the algorithmic error or the gate complexity in the truncated Taylor series quantum algorithm for general problems. Moreover, we propose two modified linear combinations of unitaries methods tailored for Hamiltonians with different degrees of anti-commutation. We numerically verify that the proposed methods exploiting anti-commutative relations could significantly improve the simulation accuracy of electronic Hamiltonians. Our work sheds light on the roles of commutative and anti-commutative relations in simulating quantum systems.

TI Towards Robust Variational Quantum Simulation of Lindblad Dynamics via
   Stochastic Magnus Expansion
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Dedicated to the centenary of quantum mechanics. In this paper, we introduce a novel and general framework for the variational quantum simulation of Lindblad equations. Building on the close relationship between the unraveled Lindblad dynamics, stochastic Magnus integrators, and variational quantum simulation, we propose a high-order scheme for solving the quantum state diffusion equation using exponential integrators. This formulation facilitates the simulation of wavefunction trajectories within the established framework of variational quantum algorithms for time evolution. Our algorithm significantly enhances robustness in two key aspects: the stability of the simulation with large time steps, and the reduction in the number of quantum trajectories required to accurately simulate the Lindblad dynamics in terms of the ensemble average. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm through numerical examples in both classical and quantum implementations, including the transverse-field Ising model (TFIM) with damping, the Fenna-Matthews-Olson (FMO) complex, and the radical pair model (RPM). The simulation accuracy can be systematically improved, and the algorithm remains reliable even in highly oscillatory regimes. These methods are expected to be applicable to a broader class of open quantum systems beyond the specific models considered in this study.

TI Few-photon microwave fields for superconducting transmon-based qudit
   control
SO BEILSTEIN JOURNAL OF NANOTECHNOLOGY
AB Increasing the efficiency of quantum processors is possible by moving from two-level qubits to elements with a larger computa-tional base. An example would be a transmon-based superconducting atom, but the new basic elements require new approaches to control. To solve the control problem, we propose the use of nonclassical fields in which the number of photons is comparable to the number of levels in the computational basis. Using theoretical analysis, we have shown that (i) our approach makes it possible to efficiently populate on demand even relatively high energy levels of the qudit starting from the ground state; (ii) by changing the difference between the characteristic frequencies of the superconducting atom and a single field mode, we can choose which level to populate; and (iii) even the highest levels can be effectively populated on a sub-nanosecond time scale. We also propose the quantum circuit design of a real superconducting system in which the predicted rapid control of the transmon-based qudit can be demonstrated.

TI Non-Kochen-Specker Contextuality
SO ENTROPY
AB Quantum contextuality supports quantum computation and communication. One of its main vehicles is hypergraphs. The most elaborated are the Kochen-Specker ones, but there is also another class of contextual sets that are not of this kind. Their representation has been mostly operator-based and limited to special constructs in three- to six-dim spaces, a notable example of which is the Yu-Oh set. Previously, we showed that hypergraphs underlie all of them, and in this paper, we give general methods-whose complexity does not scale up with the dimension-for generating such non-Kochen-Specker hypergraphs in any dimension and give examples in up to 16-dim spaces. Our automated generation is probabilistic and random, but the statistics of accumulated data enable one to filter out sets with the required size and structure.

TI Application of Quantum Key Distribution to Enhance Data Security in
   Agrotechnical Monitoring Systems Using UAVs
SO APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
AB Ensuring secure data transmission in agrotechnical monitoring systems using unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) is critical due to increasing cyber threats, particularly with the advent of quantum computing. This study proposes the integration of Quantum Key Distribution (QKD), based on the BB84 protocol, as a secure key management mechanism to enhance data security in UAV-based geographic information systems (GIS) for monitoring agricultural fields and forest fires. QKD is not an encryption algorithm but a secure key distribution protocol that provides information-theoretic security by leveraging the principles of quantum mechanics. Rather than replacing traditional encryption methods, QKD complements them by ensuring the secure generation and distribution of encryption keys, while AES-128 is employed for efficient data encryption. The QKD framework is optimized for real-time operations through adaptive key generation and energy-efficient hardware, alongside Lempel-Ziv-Welch (LZW) compression to improve the bandwidth efficiency. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed system achieves secure key generation rates up to 50 Mbps with minimal computational overhead, maintaining reliability even under adverse environmental conditions. This hybrid approach significantly improves data resilience against both quantum and classical cyber-attacks, offering a comprehensive and robust solution for secure agrotechnical data transmission.

TI Robust iSWAP gates for semiconductor spin qubits with local driving
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Scalable quantum computation demands high-fidelity two-qubit gates. However, decoherence and control errors are inevitable, which can decrease the quality of implemented quantum operations. We propose a robust iSWAP gate protocol for semiconductor spin qubits, which is a promising platform for scalable quantum computing. Our scheme uses only local microwave drives on conventional exchange-coupled spin qubits. This approach simultaneously addresses two critical challenges to semiconductor quantum computing: It suppresses low-frequency noise via continuous dynamical decoupling, and it circumvents the control difficulties associated with the ac modulation of the exchange interaction. We further develop a composite pulse sequence to remove drive-strength constraints and a dynamically corrected method to provide first-order immunity to microwave amplitude errors. Numerical simulations confirm that our scheme can achieve fidelity above the fault-tolerance threshold under current experimental conditions, offering a building block for practical quantum processors.

TI Entanglement phases in large-N hybrid Brownian circuits with long-range
   couplings
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB We develop solvable models of large-N hybrid quantum circuits on qubits and fermions with tunable longrange power-law interactions and continuous local monitoring. These models provide analytical access to the entanglement phase diagram and error-correcting properties of many-body entangled nonequilibrium states generated by such dynamics. In one dimension, the long-range couplings are irrelevant for alpha > 3/2, where alpha is the power-law exponent, and the models exhibit a conventional measurement-induced phase transition between volume- and area-law entangled phases. For 1/2 < alpha < 3/2, the long-range couplings become relevant, leading to a nontrivial dynamical exponent at the measurement-induced phase transition. More interestingly, for alpha < 1, the entanglement pattern receives a subvolume correction for both area-law and volume-law phases, indicating that the phase realizes a quantum error correcting code whose code distance scales as L2-2 alpha. While the entanglement phase diagram is the same for both the interacting qubit and fermionic hybrid Brownian circuits, we find that long-range free-fermionic circuits exhibit a distinct phase diagram with two different fractal entangled phases.

TI An Entanglement-Based Protocol for Simultaneous Reciprocal Information
   Exchange between 2 Players
SO ELECTRONICS
AB Let us consider a situation where two information brokers, whose currency is, of course, information, need to reciprocally exchange information. The two brokers, being somewhat distrustful, would like a third, mutually trusted entity to be involved in the exchange process so as to guarantee the successful completion of the transaction and also verify that it indeed took place. Can this be completed in such a way that both brokers receive their information simultaneously and securely, without the trusted intermediary knowing the exchanged information? This work presents and rigorously analyzes a new quantum entanglement-based protocol that provides a solution to the above problem. The proposed protocol is aptly named the entanglement-based reciprocal simultaneous information exchange protocol. Its security is ultimately based on the assumption of the existence of a third, trusted party. Although the reciprocal information flow is between our two information brokers, the third entity plays a crucial role in mediating this process by being a guarantor and a verifier. The phenomenon of quantum entanglement is the cornerstone of this protocol, as it makes its implementation possible even when all entities are spatially separated and ensures that, upon completion, the trusted third party remains oblivious to the actual information that was exchanged.

TI Gate construction of block-encoding for Hamiltonians needed for
   simulating partial differential equations
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB One of the most promising applications of quantum computers is solving partial differential equations (PDEs). By using the Schr & ouml;dingerization technique-which converts nonconservative PDEs into Schr & ouml;dinger equations-the problem can be reduced to Hamiltonian simulations. The particular class of Hamiltonians we consider is shown to be sufficient for simulating almost any linear PDE. In particular, these Hamiltonians consist of discretizations of polynomial products and sums of position and momentum operators. This paper addresses an important gap by efficiently loading these Hamiltonians into the quantum computer through block-encoding. The construction is explicit and efficient in terms of one-and two-qubit operations, forming a fundamental building block for constructing the unitary evolution operator for that class of Hamiltonians. The proposed algorithm demonstrates a squared logarithmic scaling with respect to the spatial partitioning size, offering a polynomial speedup over classical finite-difference methods in the context of spatial partitioning for solving PDEs. Furthermore, the algorithm is extended to the multidimensional case, achieving an exponential acceleration with respect to the number of dimensions, alleviating the curse of dimensionality problem. This work provides an essential foundation for developing explicit and efficient quantum circuits for PDEs, Hamiltonian simulations, and ground state and thermal state preparation.

TI Experimental entanglement generation for quantum key distribution beyond
   1 Gbit/s
SO QUANTUM
AB Top-performance sources of photonic en- tanglement are an indispensable resource for many applications in quantum commu- nication, most notably quantum key distri- bution. However, up to now, no source has been shown to simultaneously exhibit the high pair-creation rate, broad bandwidth, excellent state fidelity, and low intrinsic loss necessary for gigabit secure key rates. In this work, we present for the first time a source of polarization-entangled photon pairs at telecommunication wavelengths that covers all these needs of real-world quantum-cryptographic applications, thus enabling unprecedented quantum-secure key rates of more than 1 Gbit/s. Our source is designed to optimally exploit state-of-the-art telecommunication equip- ment and detection systems. Any techno- logical improvement of the latter would re- sult in an even higher rate without modi- fication of the source. We discuss the used wavelength-multiplexing approach, includ- ing its potential for multi-user quantum networks and its fundamental limitations. Our source paves the way for high-speed quantum encryption approaching present- day internet bandwidth.

TI A variational quantum circuits architecture with multi-head attention
   for chaotic time series prediction
SO COMPLEX & INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS
AB Traditional deep learning approaches that rely on analyzing single-dimensional time sequences face extraordinary challenges in predicting chaotic time sequences due to their primary properties, which include considerable nonlinearity, high sensitivity to initial conditions, and dynamic variability. This paper presents a novel prediction model for Quantum Multi-head attention (QMulti-Attn) for chaotic time sequences. The model combines a variational quantum circuit (VQC) with multi-headed self-attention mechanisms. The model is specifically designed to integrate the diversity and complexity of VQC quantum state space with multi-headed self-attention mechanisms. This enables the model to identify and handle critical dynamic features in chaotic time sequences while improving its predictive accuracy and generalization capabilities. Initially, the data that has been received is transformed into a meta group of a predetermined size. The input for QMulti-Attn consists of a multidimensional array with embedded dimensions and a time delay. The model's capacity for chaotic time series prediction is augmented by the incorporation of the VQC. As a result, the introduction of VQC improved the model's capacity to identify and solve intricate patterns in chaotic time sequence prediction tasks. This enhancement was achieved by maintaining the integrity of the original features and simplifying the deep network's training process through residual connections. The long-term dependency mechanism is employed to replicate the dynamic behavior of the chaotic system. The QMulti-Attn model outperforms the Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), Time-Series Mixer (TSMixer), and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models in two simulated chaotic time sequence datasets (Lorenz and Rossler) and a real chaos time sequencing dataset, Sea Clutter. The model's standardized mean square error on the Sea Clutter test set exhibits a 7.46% relative improvement compared to TSMixer. The QMulti-Attn model synergistically integrates quantum learning with deep learning to achieve remarkable performance in predicting chaotic temporal sequences. The model is anticipated to significantly enhance our comprehension and forecasting of intricate nonlinear dynamic systems in the actual world.

AB Quantum simulations of Hubbard models with ultracold atoms rely on the exceptional control of coherent motion provided by optical lattices. Here we demonstrate enhanced tunability using an optical superlattice in a fermionic quantum gas microscope, evidenced by long-lived coherent double-well oscillations, next-nearest-neighbor quantum walks in a staggered configuration, and correlated quantum walks of two particles initiated through a resonant pair-breaking mechanism. We furthermore demonstrate tunable spin couplings through local offsets and engineer a spin ladder with ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic couplings along the rungs and legs, respectively. Our Letter underscores the high potential of optical superlattices for engineering, simulating, and detecting strongly correlated many-body quantum states, with direct applications ranging from the study of mixed-dimensional systems to fermionic quantum computing.

TI An invitation to distributed quantum neural networks
SO QUANTUM MACHINE INTELLIGENCE
AB Deep neural networks have established themselves as one of the most promising machine learning techniques. Training such models at large scales is often parallelized, giving rise to the concept of distributed deep learning. Distributed techniques are often employed in training large models or large datasets either out of necessity or simply for speed. Quantum machine learning, on the other hand, is the interplay between machine learning and quantum computing. It seeks to understand the advantages of employing quantum devices in developing new learning algorithms as well as improving the existing ones. A set of architectures that are heavily explored in quantum machine learning are quantum neural networks. In this review, we consider ideas from distributed deep learning as they apply to quantum neural networks. We find that the distribution of quantum datasets shares more similarities with its classical counterpart than does the distribution of quantum models, though the unique aspects of quantum data introduce new vulnerabilities to both approaches. We review the current state of the art in distributed quantum neural networks, including recent numerical experiments and the concept of circuit-cutting.

TI A Quantum-Based Signcryption for Supervisory Control and Data
   Acquisition (SCADA) Networks
SO SYMMETRY-BASEL
AB Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems are ubiquitous in industrial control processes, such as power grids, water supply systems, traffic control, oil and natural gas mining, space stations and nuclear plants. However, their security faces the threat of being compromised due to the increasing use of open-access networks. Furthermore, one of the research gaps involves the emergence of quantum computing, which has exposed a new type of risk to SCADA systems. Failure to secure SCADA systems can lead to catastrophic consequences. For example, a malicious attack can take control of the power supply to a city, shut down the water supply system, or cause malfunction of a nuclear reactor. The primary purpose of this paper is to identify the new type of attack based on quantum computing and design a novel security scheme to defend against traditional attacks as well as the quantum attack. The methodology of the proposed signcryption is built on the foundation of the classical Bennett and Brassard 1984 (BB84) cryptographic scheme and does not involve computationally expensive third-party validation. The proposed signcryption scheme provides both encryption and intrusion detection. In particular, it detects the man-in-the-middle attack that can lead to other types of attacks. We have simulated the proposed algorithm using the Quantum Information Toolkit in Python. Furthermore, we have validated and analyzed the proposed design through security verification tools, namely, Scyther and PRISM.

TI Intrinsic decoherence effect on dynamics of a Λ-type qutrit interacting
   nonlinearly with a coherent field
SO ALEXANDRIA ENGINEERING JOURNAL
AB In this paper, an intrinsic decoherence model is solved analytically for a A-type qutrit interacting with a coherent field through intensity-dependent coupling. The effects of the qutritcavity interaction, the intrinsic decoherence and the initial coherent field intensity are examined on some quantum phenomena as: atom population inversion, mixedness, entanglement as well as total correlation. It is found that the increase of the physical parameters, the regular oscillatory behavior of the qutrit-population collapses and revivals are changed remarkably. The interaction between the three-level atom and the coherent cavity field generates a strong mixture, negativity entanglement and total correlation (classical + quantum). The growth, the regularity and the stability of these quantum effects depend on the decoherence and the initial coherent cavity intensity. (C) 2021 THE AUTHORS.

TI Cross-Verification of Independent Quantum Devices
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW X
AB Quantum computers are on the brink of surpassing the capabilities of even the most powerful classical computers, which naturally raises the question of how one can trust the results of a quantum computer when they cannot be compared to classical simulation Here, we present a cross-verification technique that exploits the principles of measurement-based quantum computation to link quantum circuits of different input size, depth, and structure. Our technique enables consistency checks of quantum computations between independent devices, as well as within a single device. We showcase our protocol by applying it to five state-of-the-art quantum processors, based on four distinct physical architectures: nuclear magnetic resonance, superconducting circuits, trapped ions, and photonics, with up to six qubits and up to 200 distinct circuits.

TI An Efficient Algorithmic Way to Construct Boltzmann Machine
   Representations for Arbitrary Stabilizer Code
SO ENTROPY
AB Restricted Boltzmann machines (RBMs) have demonstrated considerable success as variational quantum states; however, their representational power remains incompletely understood. In this work, we present an analytical proof that RBMs can exactly and efficiently represent stabilizer code states-a class of highly entangled quantum states that are central to quantum error correction. Given a set of stabilizer generators, we develop an efficient algorithm to determine both the RBM architecture and the exact values of its parameters. Our findings provide new insights into the expressive power of RBMs, highlighting their capability to encode highly entangled states, and may serve as a useful tool for the classical simulation of quantum error-correcting codes.

TI Exploring Spin-Crossover Cobalt(II) Single-Ion Magnets as
   Multifunctional and Multiresponsive Magnetic Devices: Advancements and
   Prospects in Molecular Spintronics and Quantum Computing Technologies
SO MAGNETOCHEMISTRY
AB Spin-crossover (SCO) and single-ion magnets (SIMs), or their mixed SCO-SIM derivatives, are a convenient solution in the evolution from molecular magnetism toward molecular spintronics and quantum computing. Herein, we report on the current trends and future directions on the use of mononuclear six-coordinate CoII SCO-SIM complexes with potential opto-, electro-, or chemo-active 2,6-pyridinediimine (PDI)- and 2,2 ':6 ',2 '-terpyridine (TERPY)-type ligands as archetypical examples of multifunctional and multiresponsive magnetic devices for applications in molecular spintronics and quantum computing technologies. This unique class of spin-crossover cobalt(II) molecular nanomagnets is particularly well suited for addressing and scaling on different supports, like metal molecular junctions or carbon nanomaterials (CNMs) and metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) or metal-covalent organic frameworks (MCOFs), in order to measure the single-molecule electron transport and quantum coherence properties, which are two major challenges in single-molecule spintronics (SMS) and quantum information processing (QIP).

TI Suppressing measurement uncertainty in an inhomogeneous spin star system
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB The uncertainty principle is known as a foundational element of quantum theory, providing a striking lower bound to quantify our prediction for the measured result of two incompatible observables. In this work, we study the thermal evolution of the entropic uncertainty bound in the presence of quantum memory for an inhomogeneous four-qubit spin-star system that is in the thermal regime. Intriguingly, our results show that the entropic uncertainty bound can be controlled and suppressed by adjusting the inhomogeneity parameter of the system.

TI Recent progress of quantum simulation of non-Hermitian systems*
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB Quantum simulation is one of the main contents of quantum information science, aiming to simulate and investigate poorly controllable or unobtainable quantum systems by using controllable quantum systems. Quantum simulation can be implemented in quantum computers, quantum simulators, and small quantum devices. Non-Hermitian systems have aroused research interest increasingly in recent two decades. On one hand, non-Hermitian quantum theories can be seen as the complex extensions of the conventional quantum mechanics, and are closely related to open systems and dissipative systems. On the other hand, both quantum systems and classical systems can be constructed as non-Hermitian systems with novel properties, which can be used to improve the precision of precise measurements. However, a non-Hermitian system is more difficult to simulate than a Hermitian system in that the time evolution of it is no longer unitary. In this review, we introduce recent research progress of quantum simulations of non-Hermitian systems. We mainly introduce theoretical researches to simulate typical non-Hermitian quantum systems by using the linear combinations of unitaries, briefly showing the advantages and limitations of each proposal, and we briefly mention other theoretical simulation methods, such as quantum random walk, space embedded and dilation. Moreover, we briefly introduce the experimental quantum simulations of non-Hermitian systems and novel phenomena in nuclear magnetic resonance, quantum optics and photonics, classical systems, etc. The recent progress of the combinations of quantum simulation and non-Hermitian physics has promoted the development of the nonHermitian theories, experiments and applications, and expand the scope of application of quantum simulations and quantum computers.

TI Polynomial T-depth quantum solvability of noisy binary linear
   problem: from quantum-sample preparation to main computation
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB The noisy binary linear problem (NBLP) is known as a computationally hard problem, and therefore, it offers primitives for post-quantum cryptography. An efficient quantum NBLP algorithm that exhibits a polynomial quantum sample and time complexities has recently been proposed. However, the algorithm requires a large number of samples to be loaded in a highly entangled state and it is unclear whether such a precondition on the quantum speedup can be obtained efficiently. Here, we present a complete analysis of the quantum solvability of the NBLP by considering the entire algorithm process, namely from the preparation of the quantum sample to the main computation. By assuming that the algorithm runs on 'fault-tolerant' quantum circuitry, we introduce a reasonable measure of the computational time cost. The measure is defined in terms of the overall number of T gate layers, referred to as T-depth complexity. We show that the cost of solving the NBLP can be polynomial in the problem size, at the expense of an exponentially increasing logical qubits.

TI Quantum computing reduces systemic risk in financial networks
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB In highly connected financial networks, the failure of a single institution can cascade into additional bank failures. This systemic risk can be mitigated by adjusting the loans, holding shares, and other liabilities connecting institutions in a way that prevents cascading of failures. We are approaching the systemic risk problem by attempting to optimize the connections between the institutions. In order to provide a more realistic simulation environment, we have incorporated nonlinear/discontinuous losses in the value of the banks. To address scalability challenges, we have developed a two-stage algorithm where the networks are partitioned into modules of highly interconnected banks and then the modules are individually optimized. We developed a new algorithms for classical and quantum partitioning for directed and weighed graphs (first stage) and a new methodology for solving Mixed Integer Linear Programming problems with constraints for the systemic risk context (second stage). We compare classical and quantum algorithms for the partitioning problem. Experimental results demonstrate that our two-stage optimization with quantum partitioning is more resilient to financial shocks, delays the cascade failure phase transition, and reduces the total number of failures at convergence under systemic risks with reduced time complexity.

TI Ultrafast hole spin qubit with gate-tunable spin-orbit switch
   functionality
SO NATURE NANOTECHNOLOGY
AB Quantum computers promise to execute complex tasks exponentially faster than any possible classical computer, and thus spur breakthroughs in quantum chemistry, material science and machine learning. However, quantum computers require fast and selective control of large numbers of individual qubits while maintaining coherence. Qubits based on hole spins in one-dimensional germanium/silicon nanostructures are predicted to experience an exceptionally strong yet electrically tunable spin-orbit interaction, which allows us to optimize qubit performance by switching between distinct modes of ultrafast manipulation, long coherence and individual addressability. Here we used millivolt gate voltage changes to tune the Rabi frequency of a hole spin qubit in a germanium/silicon nanowire from 31 to 219 MHz, its driven coherence time between 7 and 59 ns, and its Lande g-factor from 0.83 to 1.27. We thus demonstrated spin-orbit switch functionality, with on/off ratios of roughly seven, which could be further increased through improved gate design. Finally, we used this control to optimize our qubit further and approach the strong driving regime, with spin-flipping times as short as similar to 1 ns.
   Quantum computing requires fast and selective control of a large number of individual qubits while maintaining coherence, which is hard to achieve concomitantly. All-electrical operation of a hole spin qubit in a Ge/Si nanowire demonstrates the principle of switching from a mode of selective and fast control to idling with increased coherence.

TI Quantum Computing for Photosensitizer Design in Photodynamic Therapy
SO ANNUAL REVIEW OF BIOMEDICAL DATA SCIENCE
AB Use of light in healthcare is evolving with increasing applications of photodynamic therapy (PDT) for treating various cancers. PDT utilizes light-activated molecules called photosensitizers (PSs) that generate reactive oxygen species (ROSs) to induce tumor cell apoptosis and necrosis. However, the use of PDT is limited by the availability of PSs that can be activated by deep tissue-penetrating near-infrared light, exhibit low dark toxicity, and produce ROSs efficiently. Here review the different categories of PS currently used in clinical or preclinical trials and highlight significance of advanced computational methods, including density functional and wave function-based quantum chemistry, for understanding the molecular mechanisms involved in PS activation. Despite advancements in classical computational techniques, the complexities of excited state namics in highly correlated molecular systems demand innovative simulation approaches such quantum computing. We propose that quantum computing holds promise for accurately modeling the excited-state properties of PSs to optimize their design and broaden clinical applications.

TI Time-Resolved Spectral Diffusion of a Multimode Mechanical Memory
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB High-frequency phonons hold great promise as carriers of quantum information on chip and as quantum memories. Because of their coherent interaction with several systems, their compact mode volume, and slow group velocity, multiple experiments have recently demonstrated coherent transport of information on chip using phonon modes, interconnecting distinct quantum devices. Strongly confined phonons in waveguidelike geometries are particularly interesting because of their long lifetime. However, spectral diffusion has been observed to substantially limit their coherence times [S. M. Meenehan et al., Silicon optomechanical crystal resonator at millikelvin temperatures, Phys. Rev. A 90, 011803(R) (2014), A. Wallucks et al., A quantum memory at telecom wavelengths, Nat. Phys. 16, 772 (2020), and G. S. MacCabe et al., Nano-acoustic resonator with ultralong phonon lifetime, Science 370, 840 (2020)]. Coupling to two-level systems is suspected to be a major contributor to the diffusion; however, to date, the origin and underlying mechanisms are still not fully understood. Here, we perform a time-domain study on two adjacent mechanical modes (separated by around 5 MHz) and show that the frequency positions of the two modes are not correlated in time, in agreement with our theoretical model and Monte Carlo simulations. This result is an important step in fully understanding the microscopic mechanisms of dephasing in mechanical quantum buses and memories.

AB Counterdiabatic driving (CD) offers a fast and robust route to manipulate quantum systems, which has widespread applications in quantum technologies. However, for higher-dimensional complex systems, the exact CD term involving the spectral properties of the system is difficult to calculate and generally takes a complicated form, impeding its experimental realization. Recently, many approximate methods have been proposed for designing CD passages in many-body systems. In this topical review, we focus on the CD formalism and briefly introduce several experimental constructions and applications of approximate CD driving in spin-chain models with nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) systems.

   χ(2) nonlinearity
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB In photonic quantum information processing, quantum operations using nonlinear photon-photon interactions are vital for implementing two-qubit gates and enabling faithful entanglement swapping. However, due to the weak interaction between single photons, the all-photonic realization of such quantum operations has remained out of reach so far. Herein, we demonstrate an entanglement swapping using sum-frequency generation between single photons in a chi(2)-nonlinear optical waveguide. We show that a high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), stable sum-frequency-generation-based entanglement heralder with an ultralow-dark-count superconducting single-photon detector can satisfy the unprecedented SNR requirement indispensable for the swapping protocol. Furthermore, the system clock is enhanced by utilizing ultrafast telecom entangled photon-pair sources that operate in the GHz range. Our results confirm a lower bound 0.770(76) for the swapped state's fidelity, surpassing the classical limit of 0.5 successfully. Our findings highlight the strong potential of broadband all-single-photonic nonlinear interactions for further sophistication in long-distance quantum communication and photonic quantum computation.

TI Controlled bidirectional teleportation of unknown single-particle states
   by using an arbitrary high-dimensional entangled state
SO PLOS ONE
AB This study investigates controlled bidirectional transmission of two low-dimensional unknown single-particle quantum states through high-dimensional entangled channels. Initially, complete orthogonal non-symmetric bases in (dxf)-dimensional Hilbert space and five-particle maximally entangled states in d-dimensional Hilbert space are constructed, with (3x2)-dimensional non-symmetric bases and 3-dimensional 5-qutrit entangled states serving as specific instances. We then propose a controlled bidirectional teleportation (CBT) protocol wherein a 3-dimensional 5-qutrit maximally entangled channel enables simultaneous exchange of two 2-dimensional single-qubit states under supervisor authorization, implemented via non-symmetric basis measurements. Subsequent replacement of the maximally entangled channel with a 3-dimensional 5-qutrit non-maximally entangled state facilitates probabilistic reconstruction of the original states through auxiliary particle introduction and appropriate unitary operations, still under supervisory control. The success probabilities are analytically derived, demonstrating that the non-maximally entangled protocol generalizes the former scheme. Furthermore, these protocols admit dual extensions: (i) quantum channel dimensionality scalable from 3-dimensional to arbitrary d dimensions; (ii) transmitted state dimensionality extendable from 2-dimensional to arbitrary f-dimensional Hilbert space (f < d).

TI The quantum sine-Gordon model with quantum circuits
SO NUCLEAR PHYSICS B
AB Analog quantum simulation has the potential to be an indispensable technique in the investigation of complex quantum systems. In this work, we numerically investigate a one-dimensional, faithful, analog, quantum electronic circuit simulator built out of Josephson junctions for one of the paradigmatic models of an integrable quantum field theory: the quantum sine-Gordon (qSG) model in 1+1 space-time dimensions. We analyze the lattice model using the density matrix renormalization group technique and benchmark our numerical results with existing Bethe ansatz computations. Furthermore, we perform analytical form-factor calculations for the two-point correlation function of vertex operators, which closely agree with our numerical computations. Finally, we compute the entanglement spectrum of the qSG model. We compare our results with those obtained using the integrable lattice-regularization based on the quantum XYZ chain and show that the quantum circuit model is less susceptible to corrections to scaling compared to the XYZ chain. We provide numerical evidence that the parameters required to realize the qSG model are accessible with modern-day superconducting circuit technology, thus providing additional credence towards the viability of the latter platform for simulating strongly interacting quantum field theories.

TI Testing Real Quantum Theory in an Optical Quantum Network
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Quantum theory is commonly formulated in complex Hilbert spaces. However, the question of whether complex numbers need to be given a fundamental role in the theory has been debated since its pioneering days. Recently it has been shown that tests in the spirit of a Bell inequality can reveal quantum predictions in entanglement swapping scenarios that cannot be modeled by the natural real-number analog of standard quantum theory. Here, we tailor such tests for implementation in state-of-the-art photonic systems. We experimentally demonstrate quantum correlations in a network of three parties and two independent EPR sources that violate the constraints of real quantum theory by over 4.5 standard deviations, hence disproving real quantum theory as a universal physical theory.

TI Quantum Algorithm for Time-Dependent Hamiltonian Simulation by
   Permutation Expansion
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB We present a quantum algorithm for the dynamical simulation of time-dependent Hamiltonians. Our method involves expanding the interaction-picture Hamiltonian as a sum of generalized permutations, which leads to an integral-free Dyson series of the time-evolution operator. Under this representation, we perform a quantum simulation for the time-evolution operator by means of the linear combination of unitaries technique. We optimize the time steps of the evolution based on the Hamiltonian's dynamical characteristics, leading to a gate count that scales with an L-1-norm-like scaling with respect only to the norm of the interaction Hamiltonian, rather than that of the total Hamiltonian. We demonstrate that the cost of the algorithm is independent of the Hamiltonian's frequencies, implying its advantage for systems with highly oscillating components, and for time-decaying systems the cost does not scale with the total evolution time asymptotically. In addition, our algorithm retains the near optimal log(1/epsilon)/log log(1/epsilon) scaling with simulation error epsilon.

TI Quantum nonlocal nonstabilizerness
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Quantum entanglement and quantum nonstabilizerness are fundamental resources that characterize distinct aspects of a quantum state: Entanglement reflects nonlocal correlations, while nonstabilizerness quantifies the deviation from stabilizer states. A quantum state becomes a valuable resource for applications like universal quantum computation only when both quantities are present. Here, we propose that quantum nonlocal nonstabilizerness (NN) serves as an effective measure of this combined resource, incorporating both entanglement and nonstabilizerness. We demonstrate that NN can be precisely computed for two-qubit pure states, establishing a direct relationship with the entanglement spectrum. We then extend the definition of NN to mixed states and explore its presence in many-body quantum systems. We reveal that the two-point NN decays according to a power law in critical states, indicating that it can serve as an effective quantum information probe for phase transitions. Furthermore, we explore measurement-induced NN and uncover an intriguing phenomenon termed "nonstabilizerness swapping," wherein post-measurement NN decays more slowly than any pre-measurement correlations. The occurrence of this phenomenon provides a sufficient condition for both entanglement swapping and the presence of a nontrivial sign structure. Our results thus represent a pivotal step toward accurately quantifying the "quantumness" of a state and bring insights from multiple perspectives to the property of NN.

TI Universal programmable waveguide arrays
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Implementing arbitrary unitary transformations is crucial for applications in quantum computing, signal processing, and machine learning. Unitaries govern quantum state evolution, enabling reversible transformations critical in quantum tasks like cryptography and simulation and playing key roles in classical domains such as dimensionality reduction and signal compression. Integrated optical waveguide arrays have emerged as a promising platform for these transformations, offering scalability for both quantum and classical systems. However, scalable and efficient methods for implementing arbitrary unitaries remain challenging. Here, we present a theoretical framework for realizing arbitrary unitary matrices through programmable waveguide arrays (PWAs). We provide a mathematical proof demonstrating that cascaded PWAs can implement any unitary matrix within practical constraints, along with a numerical optimization method for customized PWA designs. Our results establish PWAs as a universal and scalable architecture for quantum photonic computing, effectively bridging quantum and classical applications, and positioning PWAs as an enabling technology for advancements in quantum simulation, machine learning, secure communication, and signal processing.

TI Characterization of Defect States in 4H-SiC Nanoplates for Quantum
   Technologies: Density Functional Theory Approach
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY C
AB Silicon carbide has gained significant attention as a promising material for quantum technologies due to its compatibility with complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor technology, robust spin-photon interfaces, and mature fabrication processes. While extensive studies have been conducted on SiC systems, the properties of divacancy defects in nanometer-thin 4H-SiC structures remain largely unexplored. In this study, we employ spin-polarized density functional theory to investigate the electronic, optical, and spin-dependent transport properties of neutral hh and kk divacancy defects in 1-2 nm thick 4H-SiC nanoplate structures, comparing their behavior to bulk SiC counterparts. Our findings reveal that nanoconfinement significantly alters key quantum properties, including the zero-phonon line, zero-field splitting parameters, and spin-state distributions. These modifications influence the optical absorption spectrum and electron transport characteristics. In addition, the study of spin-dependent electron transport characteristics in SiC nanoplates using nonequilibrium Green function formalism reveals significant spin selectivity in electron transmission. Notably, a crossover between spin-up and spin-down currents occurs at distinct bias voltages (0.23 V for hh and 0.27 V for kk defects), which could be harnessed for spintronic applications. These findings provide new insights into the quantum confinement in SiC-based qubit systems and highlight their potential for integration into scalable quantum technologies.

TI Characterization of quantum entanglement via a hypercube of Segre
   embeddings
SO QUANTUM INFORMATION PROCESSING
AB A particularly simple description of separability of quantum states arises naturally in the setting of complex algebraic geometry, via the Segre embedding. This is a map describing how to take products of projective Hilbert spaces. In this paper, we show that for pure states of n particles, the corresponding Segre embedding may be described by means of a directed hypercube of dimension (n - 1), where all edges are bipartite-type Segre maps. Moreover, we describe the image of the original Segre map via the intersections of images of the (n- 1) edges whose target is the last vertex of the hypercube. This purely algebraic result is then transferred to physics. For each of the last edges of the Segre hypercube, we introduce an observable which measures geometric separability and is related to the trace of the squared reduced density matrix. As a consequence, the hypercube approach allows to measure entanglement, naturally relating bipartitions with q-partitions for any q = 1. We test our observables against well-known states, showing that these provide well-behaved and fine measures of entanglement.

TI Solving Flexible Job-Shop Scheduling Problems Based on Quantum Computing
SO ENTROPY
AB Flexible job-shop scheduling problems (FJSPs) represent one of the most complex combinatorial optimization challenges. Modern production systems and control processes demand rapid decision-making in scheduling. To address this challenge, we propose a quantum computing approach for solving FJSPs. We propose a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) model to minimize the makespan of FJSPs, with the scheduling scheme encoded in the ground state of the Hamiltonian operator. The model is solved using a coherent Ising machine (CIM). Numerical experiments are conducted to evaluate and validate the performance and effectiveness of the CIM. The results demonstrate that quantum computing holds significant potential for solving FJSPs more efficiently than traditional computational methods.

TI Quantum Algorithms for Representation-Theoretic Multiplicities
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Kostka, Littlewood-Richardson, Plethysm, and Kronecker coefficients are the multiplicities of irreducible representations in the decomposition of representations of the symmetric group that play an important role in representation theory, geometric complexity, and algebraic combinatorics. We give quantum algorithms for computing these coefficients whenever the ratio of dimensions of the representations is polynomial. We show that there is an efficient classical algorithm for computing the Kostka numbers under this restriction and conjecture the existence of an analogous algorithm for the Littlewood-Richardson coefficients. We argue why such classical algorithm does not straightforwardly work for the Plethysm and Kronecker coefficients and conjecture that our quantum algorithms lead to superpolynomial speedups. The conjecture about Kronecker coefficients was disproved by Panova [Polynomial time classical versus quantum algorithms for representation theoretic multiplicities, arXiv:2502.20253] with a classical algorithm which, if optimal, points to a O(n4+2k) vs Omega (n4k2+1) polynomial gap in quantum vs classical computational complexity for an integer parameter k.

TI Implementation and empirical evaluation of a quantum machine learning
   pipeline for local classification
SO PLOS ONE
AB In the current era, quantum resources are extremely limited, and this makes difficult the usage of quantum machine learning (QML) models. Concerning the supervised tasks, a viable approach is the introduction of a quantum locality technique, which allows the models to focus only on the neighborhood of the considered element. A well-known locality technique is the k-nearest neighbors (k-NN) algorithm, of which several quantum variants have been proposed; nevertheless, they have not been employed yet as a preliminary step of other QML models. Instead, for the classical counterpart, a performance enhancement with respect to the base models has already been proven. In this paper, we propose and evaluate the idea of exploiting a quantum locality technique to reduce the size and improve the performance of QML models. In detail, we provide (i) an implementation in Python of a QML pipeline for local classification and (ii) its extensive empirical evaluation. Regarding the quantum pipeline, it has been developed using Qiskit, and it consists of a quantum k-NN and a quantum binary classifier, both already available in the literature. The results have shown the quantum pipeline's equivalence (in terms of accuracy) to its classical counterpart in the ideal case, the validity of locality's application to the QML realm, but also the strong sensitivity of the chosen quantum k-NN to probability fluctuations and the better performance of classical baseline methods like the random forest.

TI Ansatz optimization of the variational quantum eigensolver tested on the

SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB We present a detailed analysis and optimization of the variational quantum algorithms required to find the ground state of a correlated electron model, using several types of variational ansatz. Specifically, we apply our approach to the atomic limit of the Anderson model, which is widely studied in condensed matter physics since it can simulate fundamental physical phenomena, ranging from magnetism to superconductivity. The method is developed by presenting efficient state preparation circuits that exhibit total spin, spin projection, particle number and time-reversal symmetries. These states contain the minimal number of variational parameters needed to fully span the appropriate symmetry subspace allowing to avoid irrelevant sectors of Hilbert space. Then, we show how to construct quantum circuits, providing explicit decomposition and gate count in terms of standard gate sets. We test these quantum algorithms looking at ideal quantum computer simulations as well as implementing quantum noisy simulations. We finally perform an accurate comparative analysis among the approaches implemented, highlighting their merits and shortcomings.

TI Imaging the Meissner effect in pressurized bilayer nickelate with
   integrated multi-parameter quantum sensor
SO NATIONAL SCIENCE REVIEW
AB Recent reports on the signatures of high-temperature superconductivity with a critical temperature (Tc) close to 80 K have triggered great research interest and extensive follow-up studies. Although zero resistance has been successfully achieved under improved hydrostatic pressure conditions, the Meissner effect of La3Ni2O7-delta under high pressure remains controversial. Here, using shallow nitrogen-vacancy centers implanted on the culet of diamond anvils as in situ quantum sensors, we observe compelling evidence for the Meissner effect in polycrystalline bilayer nickelate samples: magnetic field expulsion during both field-cooling and field-warming processes. In particular, we explore the multi-parameter measurement capacity of the diamond quantum sensors to extract the weak demagnetization signal of La3Ni2O7-delta. The correlated measurements of Raman spectra and magnetic imaging indicate an incomplete structural transformation related to the displacement of oxygen ions emerging in the non-superconducting region. Our work clarifies the controversy about the Meissner effect of La3Ni2O7-delta and contributes to the development of quantum sensing of weak signals under high-pressure conditions.
   Diamond quantum sensing provides compelling evidence for the Meissner effect in nickelate high-temperature superconductors under high pressure.

TI Non-locality and entropic uncertainty relations in neutrino oscillations
SO EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL PLUS
AB Using the wave-packet approach to neutrino oscillations, we analyze quantum-memory-assisted entropic uncertainty relations and show that uncertainty and the non-local advantage of quantum coherence are anti-correlated. Furthermore, we explore the hierarchy among three different definitions of NAQC, those based on l(1)-norm, relative entropy and skew information coherence measures, and we find that the coherence content detected by the l(1) -norm-based NAQC overcomes the other two. The connection between QMA-EUR and NAQC could provide a better understanding of the physical meaning of the results so far obtained and suggest their extension to quantum field theory.

TI Sampling diverse near-optimal solutions via algorithmic quantum
   annealing
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW E
AB Sampling a diverse set of high-quality solutions for hard optimization problems is of great practical relevance in many scientific disciplines and applications, such as artificial intelligence and operations research. One of the main open problems is the lack of ergodicity, or mode collapse, for typical stochastic solvers based on Monte Carlo techniques leading to poor generalization or lack of robustness to uncertainties. Currently, there is no universal metric to quantify such performance deficiencies across various solvers. Here, we introduce a new diversity measure for quantifying the number of independent approximate solutions for NP-hard optimization problems. Among others, it allows benchmarking solver performance by a required time-to-diversity (TTD), a generalization of often used time-to-solution (TTS). We illustrate this metric by comparing the sampling power of various quantum annealing strategies. In particular, we show that the inhomogeneous quantum annealing schedules can redistribute and suppress the emergence of topological defects by controlling space-time separated critical fronts, leading to an advantage over standard quantum annealing schedules with respect to both TTS and TTD for finding rare solutions. Using path-integral Monte Carlo simulations for up to 1600 qubits, we demonstrate that nonequilibrium driving of quantum fluctuations, guided by efficient approximate tensor network contractions, can significantly reduce the fraction of hard instances for random frustrated 2D spin glasses with local fields. Specifically, we observe that by creating a class of algorithmic quantum phase transitions, the diversity of solutions can be enhanced by up to 40% with the fraction of hard-to-sample instances reducing by more than 25%.

TI QUBO formulations for a system of linear equations
SO RESULTS IN CONTROL AND OPTIMIZATION
AB With the advent of quantum computers, many quantum computing algorithms are being developed. Solving linear systems is one of the most fundamental problems in modern science and engineering. The Harrow Hassidim-Lloyd algorithm, a monumental quantum algorithm for solving linear systems on gate model quantum computers, was invented and several advanced variations have been developed. The algorithm was difficult to apply to general linear equations because it required various conditions for the matrix. In this paper, we introduce a new algorithm that can be applied to all linear systems. For a given general square matrix A is an element of R n x n and a vector -> b is an element of R n , we will find quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) models for a vector -> is an element of Rn n that satisfies A x x -> = b -> . To formulate QUBO models for solving linear systems, we made use of a linear least-square problem with binary representation of the solution. We validated those QUBO models on the d-Wave system and discussed the results. For a simple system, we provide a Python code to calculate the matrix characterizing the relationship between the variables, and to print the test code that can be used directly in the d-Wave system.

TI Efficient verification of Boson Sampling
SO QUANTUM
AB The demonstration of quantum speedup, also known as quantum computational supremacy, that is the ability of quantum computers to outperform dramatically their classical counterparts, is an important milestone in the field of quantum computing. While quantum speedup experiments are gradually escaping the regime of classical simulation, they still lack efficient verification protocols and rely on partial validation. Here we derive an efficient protocol for verifying with single-mode Gaussian measurements the output states of a large class of continuous-variable quantum circuits demonstrating quantum speedup, including Boson Sampling experiments, thus enabling a convincing demonstration of quantum speedup with photonic computing. Beyond the quantum speedup milestone, our results also enable the efficient and reliable certification of a large class of intractable continuous-variable multimode quantum states.

TI Robust optimal control for a systematic error in the control amplitude
   of transmon qubits
SO PHYSICA SCRIPTA
AB In the era of Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum computing as well as in error correcting circuits, physical qubits coherence time and high fidelity gates are essential to the functioning of quantum computers. In this paper, we demonstrate theoretically and experimentally, that pulses designed by optimization can be used to counteract the loss of fidelity due to a control amplitude error of the transmon qubit. We analyze the control landscape obtained by robust optimal control and find it to depend on the error range, namely the solutions can get trapped in the basin of attraction of sub-optimal solutions. Robust controls are found for different error values and are compared to an incoherent loss of fidelity mechanism due to a finite relaxation rate. The controls are tested on the IBMQ's qubit and found to demonstrate resilience against significant similar to 10% errors.

TI The "Squeeze Laser"
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM ENGINEERING
AB The level of quantum noise in measurements is bounded from below by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, but it can be unequally distributed between two noncommuting observables: it can be "squeezed." Since 2019, all gravitational-wave observatories have been using squeezed light for increasing the astronomical reach. Squeezed laser light is efficiently produced by degenerate parametric down-conversion in a nonlinear crystal located inside an optical resonator. A spontaneously generated initial pair of indistinguishable photons is amplified to a squeezed vacuum state. Overlapped with bright coherent light, the photo-electric measurement shows a sub-Poissonian photon statistics. Squeezed states have ample applications in nonlocal quantum sensing, device-independent quantum key distribution, and quantum computing. Here, we present our continuous-wave 1550-nm "squeeze laser" with a footprint of 80 x 80 cm. The well-defined output beam has an interference contrast of $\gtrsim 99\%$ with an overlapped 10-mW beam being in an almost perfect TEM00 mode. The interference result shows 13-dB squeezing of the photon shot noise in balanced detection.

TI An Automata-Based Framework for Verification and Bug Hunting in Qantum
   Circuits
SO PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACM ON PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES-PACMPL
AB We introduce a new paradigm for analysing and finding bugs in quantum circuits. In our approach, the problem is given by a triple {P} C {Q} and the question is whether, given a set P of quantum states on the input of a circuit C, the set of quantum states on the output is equal to (or included in) a set Q. While this is not suitable to specify, e.g., functional correctness of a quantum circuit, it is sufficient to detect many bugs in quantum circuits. We propose a technique based on tree automata to compactly represent sets of quantum states and develop transformers to implement the semantics of quantum gates over this representation. Our technique computes with an algebraic representation of quantum states, avoiding the inaccuracy of working with floating-point numbers. We implemented the proposed approach in a prototype tool and evaluated its performance against various benchmarks from the literature. The evaluation shows that our approach is quite scalable, e.g., we managed to verify a large circuit with 40 qubits and 141,527 gates, or catch bugs injected into a circuit with 320 qubits and 1,758 gates, where all tools we compared with failed. In addition, our work establishes a connection between quantum program verification and automata, opening new possibilities to exploit the richness of automata theory and automata-based verification in the world of quantum computing.

TI Source monitoring quantum key distribution protocol based on heralded
   single photon source
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB The security of quantum key distribution (QKD) is based on the basic principles of quantum mechanics, and therefore has unconditional security in theory. In existing quantum key distribution systems, weakly coherent sources (WCSs) are often used as light sources due to a high probability of vacuum pulses in these sources, resulting in limited transmission distances. Besides, there inevitably exist equipment defects in actual QKD systems, such as certain defects in phase modulators and intensity modulators, which lead to distinguishability of quantum states in higher dimensions and result in side-channel vulnerabilities. An eavesdropper can carry out corresponding attacks, thereby threatening the actual security of QKD systems. To overcome the above limitations, we propose an improved protocol on quantum key distribution based on monitoring heralded single-photon sources. Due to the simultaneity of parametric down-conversion photon pairs, we can accurately predict the arrival of one photon by measuring the arrival time of another photon. Through this way, we can greatly reduce the probability of vacuum states in the signal light, and increase the longest transmission distance of the QKD system. Moreover, a light source monitoring module is inserted into the sender's side. By randomly selecting a certain period of time through the source monitoring module to measure the Hong-Ou-Mandel interference between the signal light and the idle light , we can estimate the side-channel information leakage of the source and then obtain the key generation rate. Compared with the QKD protocol based on monitoring weak coherent sources, our present protocol can give a better performance in either the transmission distance or the key generation rate, especially when the interference error is large. In addition, in principle, our present protocol can also be extended to other quantum key distribution protocols, such as the measurement-device-independent protocols, to further improve the security and practicability of QKD systems. Therefore, our present work can provide valuable references for realizing the large-scale application of quantum communication networks in the near future.

TI Hierarchical Verification of Non-Gaussian Coherence in Bosonic Quantum
   States
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Non-Gaussianity, a distinctive characteristic of bosonic quantum states, is pivotal in advancing quantum networks, fault-tolerant quantum computing, and high-precision metrology. Verifying the quantum nature of a state, particularly its non-Gaussian features, is essential for ensuring the reliability and performance of these technologies. However, the specific properties required for each application demand tailored validation thresholds. Here, we introduce a hierarchical framework comprising absolute, relative, and qubit-specific thresholds to assess the non-Gaussianity of local coherences. We illustrate this framework using heralded optical non-Gaussian states with the highest purities available in optical platforms. This comprehensive framework presents the first detailed evaluation of number state coherences and can be extended to a wide range of bosonic states.

TI Hybrid Parallel Ant Colony Optimization for Application to Quantum
   Computing to Solve Large-Scale Combinatorial Optimization Problems
SO APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
AB Quantum computing is a promising technology that may provide breakthrough solutions to today's difficult problems such as breaking encryption and solving large-scale combinatorial optimization problems. An algorithm referred to as Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) has been recently proposed to approximately solve hard problems using a protocol know as bang-bang. The technique is based on unitary evolution using a Hamiltonian encoding of the objective function of the combinatorial optimization problem. The QAOA was explored in the context of several optimization problems such as the Max-Cut problem and the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). Due to the relatively small node-size solution capability of the available quantum computers and simulators, we developed a hybrid approach where sub-graphs of a TSP tour can be executed on a quantum computer, and the results from the quantum optimization are combined for a further optimization of the whole tour. Since the local optimization of a sub-graph is prone to becoming trapped in a local minimum, we overcame this problem by using a parallel Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) algorithm with periodic pheromone exchange between colonies. Our method exceeds existing approaches which have attempted partitioning a graph for small problems (less than 48 nodes) with sub-optimal results. We obtained optimum results for benchmarks with less than 150 nodes and results usually within 1% of the known optimal solution for benchmarks with around 2000 nodes.

TI General Entropic Constraints on Calderbank-Shor-Steane Codes within
   Magic Distillation Protocols
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Magic states are fundamental building blocks on the road to fault-tolerant quantum computing. Calderbank-Shor-Steane (CSS) codes play a crucial role in the construction of magic distillation protocols. Previous work has cast quantum computing with magic states for odd dimension d within a phase-space setting in which universal quantum computing is described by the statistical mechanics of quasiprobability distributions. Here we extend this framework to the important d = 2 qubit case and show that we can exploit common structures in CSS circuits to obtain distillation bounds capable of outperforming previous monotone bounds in regimes of practical interest. Moreover, in the case of CSS-code projections, we arrive at a novel cutoff result on the code length n of the CSS code in terms of parameters characterizing a desired distillation, which implies that for fixed target error rate and acceptance probability, one needs to consider only CSS codes below a threshold number of qubits. These entropic constraints are not due simply to the data-processing inequality but rely explicitly on the stochastic representation of such protocols.

TI Quantum SWAP gate realized with CZ and iSWAP gates in a superconducting
   architecture
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB It is advantageous for any quantum processor to support different classes of two-qubit quantum logic gates when compiling quantum circuits, a property that is typically not present in existing platforms. In particular, access to a gate set that includes support for the CZ-, iSWAP-, and SWAP-type families of gates renders conversions between these gate families unnecessary during compilation, as any two-qubit Clifford gate can be executed using at most one two-qubit gate from this set, plus additional single-qubit gates. We experimentally demonstrate that a SWAP gate can be decomposed into one iSWAP gate followed by one CZ gate, affirming a more efficient compilation strategy over the conventional approach that relies on three iSWAP or three CZ gates to replace a SWAP gate. Our implementation makes use of a superconducting quantum processor design based on fixed-frequency transmon qubits coupled together by a parametrically modulated tunable transmon coupler, extending this platform's native gate set so that any two-qubit Clifford unitary matrix can be realized using no more than two two-qubit gates and single-qubit gates.

TI Reversible Control System for Continuous Variable Light Field
   Polarization State
SO ACTA OPTICA SINICA
AB Objective Quantum teleportation can transfer arbitrary unknown quantum states between two distant users with the help of quantum entanglement, thereby facilitating the construction of quantum networks, implementation of quantum logic operations, and advancement in quantum computing. Continuous variable (CV) polarized light field is an important quantum resource, with advantages such as high efficiency in preparation, transmission, and measurement. It is suitable for long- distance quantum state transmission and can directly interact with atomic nodes. Therefore, it is desired to implement a quantum teleportation network of the CV polarized light field. However, the precise control and transformation of the polarization state of the light field are key to the quantum teleportation of an arbitrary CV polarization state. Quantum teleportation of the CV polarization state requires reversible control, enabling transformation from any arbitrary polarization state to a predetermined state for quantum teleportation, followed by restoration to the initial polarization state. Nevertheless, existing studies on polarization control primarily focus on unidirectional control, which fails to meet these requirements. This scheme intends to realize reversible precise regulation of any polarization state of the light field and achieve effective conversion between the initial polarization state and the predetermined polarization state.
   Methods The amplitude-division polarization measurement method and the wave plate polarization controller are employed in this paper to achieve polarization measurement and reversible control. The field- programmable gate array (FPGA) and host computer are utilized for control optimization and information display. First, a combination of half wave plate ( HWP) and quarter wave plate (QWP) is used to generate incident field polarization states uniformly distributed on the Poincare sphere. Second, an amplitude- division polarization measurement system consisting of the partial polarization beam splitter, polarization beam splitter, HWP, and QWP is employed to spatially modulate the incident polarization state of the light field. Full Stokes parameters are measured in real time through inversion, which are then converted into azimuth and elliptic frequency. Additionally, based on the obtained polarization measurement information, a wave plate polarization controller comprising of HWP and QWP is used to convert arbitrary polarizations into preset polarizations and restore the initial polarizations, thereby enabling reversible control over the polarization state of the light field. Finally, communication between the systems for both polarization measurement and control is realized by combining FPGA with the host computer, while an optimization algorithm designed specifically for controlling errors caused by optical systems enhances control accuracy.
   Results and Discussions The reversible control system for the polarization state of the light field exhibits precise measurement and effective manipulation of polarization. The azimuth is measured by rotating HWP to generate linearly polarized light. The average error between the measured result and the theoretical value is 0.543 degrees. The ellipticity is measured by rotating the QWP to produce different degrees of ellipticity polarization. The average error between the measured results and the theoretical value is 0.432 degrees. The aforementioned results of the polarization azimuth and elliptic ratio measurements demonstrate the precise effectiveness of the polarization measurement system, thereby providing valuable test outcomes for the polarization control component. Through the forward polarization control of the incident polarized light field by QWP 1 and HWP 1, the azimuth of the converted linearly polarized light is close to 90 degrees, and the average error is 0.474 degrees. The forward polarization control successfully achieves precise and efficient conversion from the arbitrary polarization state to the predetermined target polarization state, with the measured value closely approximating the set value. The average error of the azimuth is 0.636 degrees, and the average error of the ellipticity is 0.479 degrees for the inverse polarization control of the incident polarized state by HWP 2 and QWP 2. The reverse polarization control successfully achieves accurate and efficient conversion from the preset polarization state to the initial incident polarization state, resulting in a restored polarization state that closely approximates the initial polarization state.
   Conclusions The measurement and reversible control of the polarization state of the optical field are realized by using the amplitude split polarization measurement method and the wave plate polarization control method. Algorithm optimization and semi-open-loop structure design have been employed to achieve an average measurement error of less than 0.543 degrees for any polarization state. Furthermore, the average preset conversion error is less than 0.474 degrees and the average reduced conversion error is less than 0.636 degrees for any polarization control conversion. The system can realize the effective conversion between the initial and the preset polarization states, which provides key technical support for the efficient quantum teleportation of the CV polarization state. Using an optical fiber system and free space is the main way to realize the longdistance transmission of quantum states. A quantum key distribution of 200 km can be achieved by maintaining a polarization offset in the optical fiber. Free space is not sensitive to polarization, so the polarization state can be easily and directly realized for long-distance quantum communication. This scheme can realize the efficient conversion between the initial and preset polarization state of the light field, so it is of great research significance for the long-distance state transmission in free space or long-distance optical fiber quantum state transmission combined with the bias-preserving controller.

TI Quantum clustering with k-Means: A hybrid approach
SO THEORETICAL COMPUTER SCIENCE
AB Quantum computing, based on quantum theory, holds great promise as an advanced computational paradigm for achieving fast computations. Quantum algorithms are expected to surpass their classical counterparts in terms of computational complexity for certain tasks, including machine learning. In this paper, we design, implement, and evaluate three hybrid quantum k -Means algorithms, exploiting different degrees of parallelism. Indeed, each algorithm incrementally leverages quantum parallelism to reduce the complexity of the cluster assignment step up to a constant cost. In particular, we exploit quantum phenomena to speed up the computation of distances. The core idea is that the computation of distances between records and centroids can be executed simultaneously, thus saving time, especially for big datasets. We show that our hybrid quantum k -Means algorithms are theoretically faster than the classical algorithm, while experiments suggest that it is possible to obtain comparable clustering results.

TI Efficient experimental characterization of quantum processes via
   compressed sensing on an NMR quantum processor
SO QUANTUM INFORMATION PROCESSING
AB We employ the compressed sensing (CS) algorithm and a heavily reduced data set to experimentally perform true quantum process tomography (QPT) on an NMR quantum processor. We obtain the estimate of the process matrix chi corresponding to various two- and three-qubit quantum gates with a high fidelity. The CS algorithm is implemented using two different operator bases, namely the standard Pauli basis and the Pauli-error basis. We experimentally demonstrate that the performance of the CS algorithm is significantly better in the Pauli-error basis, where the constructed chi matrix is maximally sparse. We compare the standard least square (LS) optimization QPT method with the CS-QPT method and observe that, provided an appropriate basis is chosen, the CS-QPT method performs significantly better as compared to the LS-QPT method. In all the cases considered, we obtained experimental fidelities greater than 0.9 from a reduced data set, which was approximately 5-6 times smaller in size than a full data set. We also experimentally characterized the reduced dynamics of a two-qubit subsystem embedded in a three-qubit system and used the CS-QPT method to characterize processes corresponding to the evolution of two-qubit states under various J-coupling interactions.

TI Circular-beam approximation for quantum channels in a turbulent
   atmosphere
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB The evolution of quantum states of light in free-space channels is strongly influenced by atmospheric turbulence, posing a significant challenge for quantum communication. The transmittance in such channels randomly fluctuates. This effect is commonly described by the probability distribution of transmittance (PDT). The elliptic-beam approximation provides an analytical model for the PDT, showing good agreement with experimental and simulation data within a specific range of channel parameters. In this work we introduce the circular-beam approximation-a simplified alternative that offers satisfactory accuracy while significantly reducing computational complexity. Our method naturally leads to a technique for determining the model parameters from the first two moments of the transmittance. This approach eliminates the model misspecification bias inherent in the elliptic-beam approximation and significantly extends the applicability range of the PDT model, providing a practical tool for characterizing atmospheric channels in quantum applications.

TI Preparation of Quantum Superposition Using Partial Negation
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB The preparation of a quantum superposition is the key to the success of many quantum algorithms and quantum machine learning techniques. The preparation of an incomplete or a non-uniform quantum superposition with certain properties is a non-trivial task. In this paper, an n-qubits variational quantum circuit using partial negation and controlled partial negation operators is proposed to prepare a quantum superposition from a given space of probability distributions. The speed of the preparation process and the accuracy of the prepared superposition has special importance to the success of any quantum algorithm. The proposed method can be used to prepare the required quantum superposition in \mathscr {O}(n) steps and with high accuracy when compared with relevant methods in literature.

TI Coherence-Enhanced Single-Qubit Thermometry out of Equilibrium
SO ENTROPY
AB The metrological limits of thermometry operated in nonequilibrium dynamical regimes are analyzed. We consider a finite-dimensional quantum system, employed as a quantum thermometer, in contact with a thermal bath inducing Markovian thermalization dynamics. The quantum thermometer is initialized in a generic quantum state, possibly including quantum coherence with respect to the Hamiltonian basis. We prove that the precision of the thermometer, quantified by the Quantum Fisher Information, is enhanced by the quantum coherence in its initial state. We analytically show this in the specific case of qubit thermometers for which the maximization of the Quantum Fisher Information occurs at a finite time during the transient thermalization dynamics. Such a finite-time precision enhancement can be better than the precision that is achieved asymptotically.

TI Utility of NISQ devices: optimizing experimental parameters for the
   fabrication of Au atomic junction using gate-based quantum computers
SO APPLIED PHYSICS EXPRESS
AB Feedback-controlled electromigration (FCE) enables precise regulation of atomic migration by carefully optimizing multiple experimental parameters. However, manually fine-tuning these parameters poses significant challenges. This study investigated the feasibility of autonomously fabricating Au atomic junctions through gate-based quantum computing using a noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) device, which effectively approximates solutions to combinatorial optimization problems. We compared the computational accuracy of the NISQ device against a previously reported D-Wave quantum annealer. The results indicate that the NISQ device achieved lower residual energies and produced higher-quality approximate solutions for large-scale problems than the quantum annealing system.

TI Probing phase transitions in non-Hermitian systems with quantum
   entanglement
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB We study the quantum entanglement and quantum phase transition of the non-Hermitian anisotropic spin-12 XY model and XXZ model with the staggered imaginary field by analytical methods and numerical exact diagonalization, respectively. Various entanglement measures, including concurrence, negativity, mutual information, and quantum coherence, and both biorthogonal and self-normal quantities are investigated. Both the biorthogonal and self-normal entanglement quantities, except the biorthogonal concurrence, are found to be capable of detecting the first-order and PT transitions in the XXZ model, as well as the Ising and RT transitions in the XY model. In addition, we introduce the unconstrained concurrence and demonstrate its effectiveness in detecting these transitions. On the other hand, the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transition in the XXZ model is revealed through concurrence and negativity at small non-Hermiticity strengths. Notably, the critical points observed in the Hermitian limit evolve into exceptional points as the strength of the non-Hermiticity increases. Furthermore, we find that the first-order transition survives up to a higher non-Hermiticity strength compared to the BKT transition within the PT-symmetric regime of the XXZ model.

The arising measures are the transmission distance between quantum channels and the entropic channel divergence. We investigate their mathematical properties and discuss their physical meaning. Additionally, we establish a chain rule for the entropic channel divergence, which implies the amortization collapse, a relevant result with potential applications in the field of discrimination of quantum channels and converse bounds. Finally, we analyze the distinguishability between two given Pauli channels and study exemplary Hamiltonian dynamics under decoherence.

TI A hybrid quantum ensemble learning model for malicious code detection
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Quantum computing as a new computing model with parallel computing capability and high information carrying capacity, has attracted a lot of attention from researchers. Ensemble learning is an effective strategy often used in machine learning to improve the performance of weak classifiers. Currently, the classification performance of quantum classifiers is not satisfactory enough due to factors such as the depth of quantum circuit, quantum noise, and quantum coding method, etc. For this reason, this paper combined the ensemble learning idea and quantum classifiers to design a novel hybrid quantum machine learning model. Firstly, we run the Stacking method in classical machine learning to realize the dimensionality reduction of high-latitude data while ensuring the validity of data features. Secondly, we used the Bagging method and Bayesian hyperparameter optimization method applied to quantum support vector machine (QSVM), quantum K nearest neighbors (QKNN), variational quantum classifier (VQC). Thirdly, the voting method is used to ensemble the predict results of QSVM, QKNN, VQC as the final result. We applied the hybrid quantum ensemble machine learning model to malicious code detection. The experimental results show that the classification precision (accuracy, F1-score) of this model has been improved to 98.9% (94.5%, 94.24%). Combined with the acceleration of quantum computing and the higher precision rate, it can effectively deal with the growing trend of malicious codes, which is of great significance to cyberspace security.

TI Quantum Differentially Private Sparse Regression Learning
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION THEORY
AB The eligibility of various advanced quantum algorithms will be questioned if they can not guarantee privacy. To fill this knowledge gap, here we devise an efficient quantum differentially private (QDP) Lasso estimator to solve sparse regression tasks. Concretely, given N d-dimensional data points with N << d, we first prove that the optimal classical and quantum non-private Lasso requires Omega(N + d) and Omega(root N + root d) runtime, respectively. We next prove that the runtime cost of QDP Lasso is dimension independent, i.e., O(N-5/2), which implies that the QDP Lasso can be faster than both the optimal classical and quantum non-private Lasso. Last, we exhibit that the QDP Lasso attains a near-optimal utility bound (O) over tilde (N-2/3) with privacy guarantees and discuss the chance to realize it on near-term quantum chips with advantages.

AB Utilizing feedforward to perform adaptive quantum operations on one entangled state according to the measurement result of the other state enables measurement-based quantum information processing (QIP). Until now, the bandwidth of feedforward in optical QIP has been limited to around 100 MHz by measurement with electronics. A potential alternative is the utilization of an optical parametric amplifier (OPA). This optical device eliminates the need for electronic measuring devices and enables all-optical broadband feedforward. In this paper, we demonstrate a variable squeezing gate with an operation bandwidth of 1.3 THz by all-optical measurement-device-free feedforward. We utilize a periodically poled lithium niobate waveguide as a broadband OPA and perform continuous phase locking in our optical system. Experimental results demonstrate that our all-optical QIP operates at a THz clock frequency, representing a major step toward the realization of an ultra-fast quantum computer.

AB Quantum computers hold the potential to solve problems that are intractable for classical computers, thereby driving increased interest in the development of new cryptanalytic ciphers. In NIST's post-quantum standardization process, the security categories are defined by the costs of quantum key search against AES. However, the cost estimates provided by Grassl et al. for the search are high. NIST has acknowledged that these initial classifications should be approached cautiously, since the costs of the most advanced attacks can be significantly reduced. Therefore, accurate resource estimations are crucial for evaluating the security of ciphers against quantum adversaries.
   This paper presents a set of generic techniques for implementing AES quantum oracles, which are essential for quantum attacks such as Grover's algorithms. Firstly, we introduce the mixing-XOR technique to reuse the ancilla qubits. At ASIACRYPT 2022, Huang et al. proposed an S-box structure with 120 ancilla qubits. We are able to reduce the number of ancilla qubits to 83 without increasing the T-depth. Secondly, we propose the combined pipeline architecture with the share technique to combine the S-box and its reverse, which achieves it with only 98 ancilla qubits, resulting in a significant reduction of 59% compared to the independent structure. Thirdly, we use a general algorithm to determine the depth of quantum circuits, searching for the in-place circuit of AES MixColumns with depth 16. Applying these improvements, we achieve the lower quantum depth of AES circuits, obtaining more precise resource estimates for Grover's algorithm. For AES-128, -192, and -256, we only require the depth of 730, 876, and 1,018, respectively. Recently, the community has also focused on the trade-off of the time and space cost of quantum circuits for AES. In this regard, we present quantum implementations of AES circuits with a lower DW-cost on the zig-zag architecture. Compared with the circuit proposed by Huang et al., the DW-cost is reduced by 35%.

TI QKDNetSim plus : Improvement of the quantum network simulator for NS-3

AB The first Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) networks are currently being deployed, but the implementation cost is still prohibitive for most researchers. As such, there is a need for realistic QKD network simulators. The QKDNetSim module for the network simulator NS-3 focuses on the representation of packets and the management of key material in a QKD network at the application layer. Although QKDNetSim's representation of a QKD network is insightful, some its components lack the depth that would allow the simulator to faithfully represent the behaviour of a real quantum network. In this work, we analyse QKDNetSim's architecture to identify its limitations, and we present an enhanced version of QKDNetSim in which some of its components have been modified to provide a more realistic simulation environment.

The extreme flexibility in the synthesis of organic materials provides, at low costs, a wide palette of emission wavelengths and supporting matrices for such single chromophores. In the past few decades, their controlled coupling to photonic structures has led to an optimized interaction efficiency with light. Molecules can hence be operated as single-photon sources and as nonlinear elements with competitive performance in terms of coherence, scalability and compatibility with diverse integrated platforms. Moreover, they can be used as transducers for the optical read-out of fields and material properties, with the promise of single-quanta resolution in the sensing of charges and motion. We show that quantum emitters based on single molecules hold promise to play a key role in the development of quantum science and technologies.
   This Review discusses the photophysical properties and nonlinear behaviour of single molecules, and their use as single-photon sources and in single-molecule sensing and quantum-sensing applications.

TI Time-optimal single-scalar control on a qubit of unitary dynamics
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Optimal control theory is applied to analyze the time-optimal solution with a single scalar control knob in a two-level quantum system without quantum decoherence. Emphasis is placed on the dependence on the maximum control strength umax. General constraints on the optimal protocol are derived and used to rigorously parametrize the time-optimal solution. Two concrete problems are investigated. For generic state preparation problems, both multiple bang-bang and bang-singular-bang are legitimate and should be considered. Generally, the optimal is bang-bang for small umax, and there exists a state-dependent critical amplitude above which singular control emerges. For the X-gate operation of a qubit, the optimal protocol is exclusively multiple bang-bang. The minimum gate time is about 80% of that based on the resonant Rabi pi-pulse over a wide range of control strength; in the umax -> 0 limit, this ratio is derived to be pi /4. To develop practically feasible protocols, we present methods to smooth the abrupt changes in the bang-bang control while preserving perfect gate fidelity. The presence of bang-bang segments in the time-optimal protocol indicates that the high-frequency components and a full calculation (instead of the commonly adopted rotating wave approximation) are essential for the ultimate quantum speed limit.

TI Dependable classical-quantum computing systems engineering
SO FRONTIERS IN COMPUTER SCIENCE
AB Increasing evidence suggests quantum computing (QC) complements traditional High-Performance Computing (HPC) by leveraging its unique capabilities, leading to the emergence of a new, hybrid paradigm, QHPC. However, this integration introduces new challenges, with dependability-defined by reproducibility, resiliency, and security and privacy-emerging as a central concern for building trustworthy systems that provide an advantage to the users. This paper proposes a framework for dependable QHPC system design, organized around these three pillars. We identify integration challenges, anticipate roadblocks, and highlight productive synergies across QC, HPC, cloud platforms, and network security. Drawing from both classical computing principles and quantum-specific insights, we present a roadmap for co-design that supports robust hybrid architectures. Our approach offers concrete metrics for assessing dependability, provides design guidance for engineers working at the QC-HPC interface, and surfaces new engineering questions around complexity, scale, and fault tolerance. Ultimately, designing for dependability is key to realizing practical, scalable QHPC systems and accelerating the broader quantum ecosystem capable of translating quantum promises into actual application delivery.

TI Research Progress on Photon Blockade Effect in Cavity Quantum
   Electrodynamics (Invited)
SO LASER & OPTOELECTRONICS PROGRESS
AB Photon blockade is a fundamental nonlinear phenomenon in cavity quantum electrodynamics, enabling deterministic control over single photon or photon streams by suppressing multiphoton excitations. This effect provides a crucial physical mechanism for advancing quantum information science. Current research primarily focuses on two major mechanisms: conventional photon blockade and unconventional photon blockade. The former relies on strong atom-cavity coupling, which induces anharmonic energy level splitting and inhibits multiphoton transitions via spectral nonuniformity. In contrast, the latter exploits destructive quantum interference between multiple excitation pathways, achieving two-photon excitation suppression even under weak coupling conditions, thereby significantly reducing the requirement for strong nonlinearity. The interplay between these mechanisms can further optimize photon blockade performance and greatly enhance its efficiency. In recent years, research has extended into new directions such as nonreciprocal photon blockade and nonlinear dissipation control. These developments not only provide a richer theoretical framework for understanding nonlinear behaviors in quantum optics but also establish technical foundations for quantum information processing, quantum computing, and quantum precision measurements. Additionally, research on multi-photon blockade and its extended mechanisms offers crucial support for developing multi-photon quantum technologies. This review systematically summarizes the implementation schemes and recent progress of single-photon and multiphoton blockade, as well as their extensions. It also highlights their potential applications in single-photon sources, quantum information processing, and quantum networks. Finally, we discuss prospective research directions in the field of photon blockade, including the exploration of novel unconventional blockade mechanisms and their integration into large-scale quantum information systems.

TI Quantum discriminator for binary classification
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Quantum computers have the unique ability to operate relatively quickly in high-dimensional spaces-this is sought to give them a competitive advantage over classical computers. In this work, we propose a novel quantum machine learning model called the Quantum Discriminator, which leverages the ability of quantum computers to operate in the high-dimensional spaces. The quantum discriminator is trained using a quantum-classical hybrid algorithm in O(N log N) time, and inferencing is performed on a universal quantum computer in O(N) time. The quantum discriminator takes as input the binary features extracted from a given datum along with a prediction qubit, and outputs the predicted label. We analyze its performance on the Iris and Bars and Stripes data sets, and show that it can attain 99% accuracy in simulation.

TI Quantum Annealing with Inequality Constraints: The Set Cover Problem
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB Quantum annealing is a promising method for solving hard optimization problems by transforming them into quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) problems. However, when constraints are involved, particularly multiple inequality constraints, incorporating them into the objective function poses challenges. In this paper, the authors present two novel approaches for solving problems with multiple inequality constraints on a quantum annealer and apply them to the set cover problem (SCP). The first approach uses the augmented Lagrangian method to represent the constraints, while the second approach employs a higher-order binary optimization (HUBO) formulation. The experiments show that both approaches outperform the standard approach for solving the SCP on the D-Wave Advantage quantum annealer. The HUBO formulation performs slightly better than the augmented Lagrangian method in solving the SCP, but its scalability in terms of embeddability in the quantum chip is worse. The results demonstrate that the proposed augmented Lagrangian and HUBO methods can successfully implement a large number of inequality constraints, making them applicable to a broad range of constrained problems beyond the SCP.
   Quantum annealing is a promising method for solving hard optimization problems if they can be formulated as quadratic unconstrained binary optimization problems. Most problems of practical interest do include constraints, however, and this paper proposes two methods for dealing with multiple inequality constraints that are more accurate than the existing ones, and applies them to the set cover problem.image

TI Detecting the dimensionality of genuine multiparticle entanglement
SO SCIENCE ADVANCES
AB Complex forms of quantum entanglement can arise in two qualitatively different ways: either between many qubits or between two particles with higher-than-qubit dimension. While both the many-qubit frontier and the high-dimension frontier are well established, state-of-the-art quantum technology is becoming increasingly able to create and manipulate entangled states that simultaneously feature many particles and high dimension. Here, we investigate generic states that can be considered both genuinely high-dimensional and genuine multiparticle entangled. We consider a natural quantity that characterizes this key property. To detect it, we develop three different classes of criteria. These enable us both to probe the ultimate noise tolerance of this form of entanglement and to make detection schemes using sparse or even minimal measurement resources. The approach provides a simple way of benchmarking entanglement dimensionality in the multiparticle regime and general, platform-independent, detection methods that readily apply to experimental use.

TI Unconditional measurement-based quantum computation with optomechanical
   continuous variables
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Universal quantum computation encoded over continuous variables can be achieved via Gaussian measurements acting on entangled non-Gaussian states. However, due to the weakness of available nonlinearities, generally these states can only be prepared conditionally, potentially with low probability. Here we show how universal quantum computation could be implemented unconditionally using an integrated platform able to sustain both linear and quadratic optomechanical-like interactions. Specifically, considering cavity opto- and electromechanical systems, we propose a realization of a driven-dissipative dynamics that deterministically prepares the required non-Gaussian cluster states-entangled squeezed states of multiple mechanical oscillators suitably interspersed with cubic-phase states. We next demonstrate how arbitrary Gaussian measurements on the cluster nodes can be performed by continuously monitoring the output cavity field. Finally, the feasibility requirements of this approach are analyzed in detail, suggesting that its building blocks are within reach of current technology.

TI Scaling and networking a modular photonic quantum computer
SO NATURE
AB Photonics offers a promising platform for quantum computing1, 2, 3-4, owing to the availability of chip integration for mass-manufacturable modules, fibre optics for networking and room-temperature operation of most components. However, experimental demonstrations are needed of complete integrated systems comprising all basic functionalities for universal and fault-tolerant operation5. Here we construct a (sub-performant) scale model of a quantum computer using 35 photonic chips to demonstrate its functionality and feasibility. This combines all the primitive components as discrete, scalable rack-deployed modules networked over fibre-optic interconnects, including 84 squeezers6 and 36 photon-number-resolving detectors furnishing 12 physical qubit modes at each clock cycle. We use this machine, which we name Aurora, to synthesize a cluster state7 entangled across separate chips with 86.4 billion modes, and demonstrate its capability of implementing the foliated distance-2 repetition code with real-time decoding. The key building blocks needed for universality and fault tolerance are demonstrated: heralded synthesis of single-temporal-mode non-Gaussian resource states, real-time multiplexing actuated on photon-number-resolving detection, spatiotemporal cluster-state formation with fibre buffers, and adaptive measurements implemented using chip-integrated homodyne detectors with real-time single-clock-cycle feedforward. We also present a detailed analysis of our architecture's tolerances for optical loss, which is the dominant and most challenging hurdle to crossing the fault-tolerant threshold. This work lays out the path to cross the fault-tolerant threshold and scale photonic quantum computers to the point of addressing useful applications.

TI Using Differential Evolution to avoid local minima in Variational
   Quantum Algorithms
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQAs) are among the most promising NISQ-era algorithms for harnessing quantum computing in diverse fields. However, the underlying optimization processes within these algorithms usually deal with local minima and barren plateau problems, preventing them from scaling efficiently. Our goal in this paper is to study alternative optimization methods that can avoid or reduce the effect of these problems. To this end, we propose to apply the Differential Evolution (DE) algorithm to VQAs optimizations. Our hypothesis is that DE is resilient to vanishing gradients and local minima for two main reasons: (1) it does not depend on gradients, and (2) its mutation and recombination schemes allow DE to continue evolving even in these cases. To demonstrate the performance of our approach, first, we use a robust local minima problem to compare state-of-the-art local optimizers (SLSQP, COBYLA, L-BFGS-B and SPSA) against DE using the Variational Quantum Eigensolver algorithm. Our results show that DE always outperforms local optimizers. In particular, in exact simulations of a 1D Ising chain with 14 qubits, DE achieves the ground state with a 100% success rate, while local optimizers only exhibit around 40%. We also show that combining DE with local optimizers increases the accuracy of the energy estimation once avoiding local minima. Finally, we demonstrate how our results can be extended to more complex problems by studying DE performance in a 1D Hubbard model.

TI Combined Dissipative and Hamiltonian Confinement of Cat Qubits
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Quantum error correction with biased-noise qubits can drastically reduce the hardware overhead for universal and fault-tolerant quantum computation. Cat qubits are a promising realization of biased-noise qubits as they feature an exponential error bias inherited from their nonlocal encoding in the phase space of a quantum harmonic oscillator. To confine the state of an oscillator to the cat-qubit manifold, two main approaches have been considered so far: a Kerr-based Hamiltonian confinement with high gate performances, and a dissipative confinement with robust protection against a broad range of noise mechanisms. We introduce a new combined dissipative and Hamiltonian confinement scheme based on two-photon dissipation together with a two-photon exchange (TPE) Hamiltonian. The TPE Hamiltonian is similar to Kerr nonlinearity, but unlike the Kerr it induces only a bounded distinction between even- and odd-photon eigenstates, a highly beneficial feature for protecting the cat qubits with dissipative mechanisms. Using this combined confinement scheme, we demonstrate fast and bias-preserving gates with drastically improved performance compared to dissipative or Hamiltonian schemes. In addition, this combined scheme can be implemented experimentally with only minor modifications of existing dissipative cat-qubit experiments.

TI Experimental quantum simulation of dynamic localization on curved
   photonic lattices
SO PHOTONICS RESEARCH
AB Dynamic localization, which originates from the phenomena of particle evolution suppression under an externally applied AC electric field, has been simulated by suppressed light evolution in periodically curved photonic arrays. However, experimental studies on their quantitative dynamic transport properties and application for quantum information processing are rare. Here we fabricate one-dimensional and hexagonal two-dimensional arrays both with sinusoidal curvatures. We successfully observe the suppressed single-photon evolution patterns, and for the first time, to the best of our knowledge, measure the variances to study their transport properties. For one-dimensional arrays, the measured variances match both the analytical electric-field calculation and the quantum walk Hamiltonian engineering approach. For hexagonal arrays as anisotropic effective couplings in four directions are mutually dependent, the analytical approach suffers, whereas quantum walk conveniently incorporates all anisotropic coupling coefficients in the Hamiltonian and solves its exponential as a whole, yielding consistent variances with our experimental results. Furthermore, we implement a nearly complete localization to show that it can preserve both the initial injection and the wave packet after some evolution, acting as a memory of a flexible time scale in integrated photonics. We demonstrate a useful quantum simulation of dynamic localization for studying their anisotropic transport properties and a promising application of dynamic localization as a building block for quantum information processing in integrated photonics.

TI Coherent control of a multi-qubit dark state in waveguide quantum
   electrodynamics
SO NATURE PHYSICS
AB Superconducting qubits in a waveguide have long-range interactions mediated by photons that cause the emergence of collective states. Destructive interference between the qubits decouples the collective dark states from the waveguide environment. Their inability to emit photons into the waveguide render dark states a valuable resource for preparing long-lived quantum many-body states and realizing quantum information protocols in open quantum systems. However, they also decouple from fields that drive the waveguide, making manipulation a challenge. Here we show the coherent control of a collective dark state that is realized by controlling the interactions between four superconducting transmon qubits and local drives. The dark state's protection against decoherence results in decay times that exceed those of the waveguide-limited single qubits by more than two orders of magnitude. Moreover, we perform a phase-sensitive spectroscopy of the two-excitation manifold and reveal bosonic many-body statistics in the transmon array. Our dark-state qubit provides a starting point for implementing quantum information protocols with collective states.
   Dark states of quantum systems do not absorb or emit light, removing a major source of decoherence. Four superconducting qubits in a waveguide can be combined to make a coherently controlled dark-state qubit with a long lifetime.

TI Quantum-Classical Hybrid Architecture for Solving the Muskat-Leverett
   Model
SO IET QUANTUM COMMUNICATION
AB Hybrid quantum-classical architectures demonstrate significant potential for efficiently solving complex physical models. This study focuses on developing and implementing a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm to solve the Muskat-Leverett model by reformulating it as a system of linear equations. By expressing the Muskat-Leverett model in matrix form , we enable the application of quantum algorithms. We leverage classical computational platforms (CPU and GPU) alongside quantum computing to efficiently solve the model, achieving competitive accuracy and demonstrating potential for scalability compared to traditional methods. The Harrow-Hassidim-Lloyd algorithm and the variational quantum linear solver were utilised to design quantum circuits and variational ansatz. The study evaluates quantum solutions with classical optimisation, variational methods, fully classical solutions on graphical processors and purely quantum solutions. Experimental results show that the hybrid architecture, utilising cuQuantum and CUDA-Q, achieves up to 6.42x faster execution compared to CPU implementations and provides a comparable speedup to GPU-based solvers. When applied for large-scale problems, the hybrid approach is also similar to 10x faster than standard quantum simulators. Key factors, such as qubits, optimisers and cost functions, were analysed to determine optimal parameters. These results highlight the advantages of hybrid architecture in accelerating and optimising numerical solutions for complex physical models.

TI Equivalence of quantum barren plateaus to cost concentration and narrow
   gorges
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Optimizing parameterized quantum circuits (PQCs) is the leading approach to make use of near-term quantum computers. However, very little is known about the cost function landscape for PQCs, which hinders progress towards quantum-aware optimizers. In this work, we investigate the connection between three different landscape features that have been observed for PQCs: (1) exponentially vanishing gradients (called barren plateaus (BPs)), (2) exponential cost concentration about the mean, and (3) the exponential narrowness of minima (called narrow gorges). We analytically prove that these three phenomena occur together, i.e., when one occurs then so do the other two. A key implication of this result is that one can numerically diagnose BPs via cost differences rather than via the computationally more expensive gradients. More broadly, our work shows that quantum mechanics rules out certain cost landscapes (which otherwise would be mathematically possible), and hence our results could be interesting from a quantum foundations perspective.

TI Subangstrom ion beam engineering of buried ultrathin oxides for scalable
   quantum computing
SO SCIENCE ADVANCES
AB Multilayer nanoscale systems incorporating ultrathin tunnel barriers, magnetic materials, amorphous oxides, and promising dielectrics are essential for next-generation logics, memory, quantum, and neuro-inspired computing. Still, an ultrathin film control at the atomic scale remains challenging. Here, we introduce a complementary metal-oxide semiconductor-compatible approach using focused ion beam irradiation for buried ultrathin films' engineering with subangstrom thickness control. Molecular dynamics simulations confirm the pivotal role of ion-induced crystal defects. Its performance is exemplified by Josephson junction resistance tuning in the range of 2 to 37% with a 0.86% standard deviation in completed chips. Furthermore, it enables +/- 17-megahertz frequency accuracy (+/- 0.172 angstrom tunnel barrier thickness variation) in superconducting multiqubit processors, as well as qubit energy relaxation and echo coherence times exceeding 0.5 milliseconds.

TI Optimal Thresholds for Fracton Codes and Random Spin Models with
   Subsystem Symmetry
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Fracton models provide examples of novel gapped quantum phases of matter that host intrinsically immobile excitations and therefore lie beyond the conventional notion of topological order. Here, we calculate optimal error thresholds for quantum error correcting codes based on fracton models. By mapping the error-correction process for bit-flip and phase-flip noises into novel statistical models with Ising variables and random multibody couplings, we obtain models that exhibit an unconventional subsystem symmetry instead of a more usual global symmetry. We perform large-scale parallel tempering Monte Carlo simulations to obtain disorder-temperature phase diagrams, which are then used to predict optimal error thresholds for the corresponding fracton code. Remarkably, we found that the X-cube fracton code displays a minimum error threshold (7.5%) that is much higher than 3D topological codes such as the toric code (3.3%), or the color code (1.9%). This result, together with the predicted absence of glass order at the Nishimori line, shows great potential for fracton phases to be used as quantum memory platforms.

TI Composably secure data processing for Gaussian-modulated
   continuous-variable quantum key distribution
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Continuous-variable (CV) quantum key distribution (QKD) employs the quadratures of a bosonic mode to establish a secret key between two remote parties, and this is usually achieved via a Gaussian modulation of coherent states. The resulting secret key rate depends not only on the loss and noise in the communication channel, but also on a series of data processing steps that are needed for transforming shared correlations into a final string of secret bits. Here we consider a Gaussian-modulated coherent-state protocol with homodyne detection in the general setting of composable finite-size security. After simulating the process of quantum communication, the output classical data are postprocessed via procedures of parameter estimation, error correction, and privacy amplification. In particular, we analyze the high signal-to-noise regime, which requires the use of high-rate (nonbinary) low-density parity check codes. We implement all these steps in a PYTHON-based library that allows one to investigate and optimize the protocol parameters to be used in practical experimental implementations of short-range CV-QKD.

TI Genuine quantum networks with superposed tasks and addressing
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB We show how to make quantum networks, both standard and entanglement-based, genuine quantum by providing them with the possibility of handling superposed tasks and superposed addressing. This extension of their functionality relies on a quantum control register, which specifies not only the task of the network, but also the corresponding weights in a coherently superposed fashion. Although adding coherent control to classical tasks, such as sending or measuring-or not doing so-is in general impossible, we introduce protocols that are able to mimick this behavior under certain conditions. We achieve this by always performing the classical task, either on the desired state or a properly chosen dummy state. We provide several examples, and show that externally controlling quantum superposition of tasks offers additional possibilities and advantages over usually considered single functionality. For instance, superpositions of different target state configurations shared among different nodes of the network can be prepared, or quantum information can be sent among a superposition of different paths or to different destinations.

TI Compact implementation of high-dimensional mutually partially unbiased
   bases protocol
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Transverse spatial mode of light is crucial in high-dimensional quantum key distribution (QKD). However, applications in realistic scenarios suffer from mode-dependent loss and the complexity of system, making it impractical to achieve higher-dimensional, longer-distance and low-cost communications. A mutually partially unbiased bases (MPUBs) protocol has been proposed to fundamentally eliminate the effects induced by mode-dependent loss for long propagation distances and limited sizes of apertures. Here, we demonstrate the first implementation of the MPUBs protocol in dimensions of d = 2, 4, 5 and 6. By performing a controlled unitary transformation, we can actively switch the measurement basis and enable a compact measurement system. In consequence, a higher encoding dimension is available under finite system resources, resulting in higher key rates and stronger noise resistance. Our work enhances the practicability of MPUBs protocol, and may promote the applications of high-dimensional QKD in quantum networks.

TI Simulating Floquet scrambling circuits on trapped-ion quantum computers
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Complex quantum many-body dynamics spread initially localized quantum information across the entire system. Information scrambling refers to such a process whose simulation is one of the promising applications of quantum computing. We demonstrate the Hayden-Preskill recovery protocol and the interferometric protocol for calculating out-of-time-ordered correlators to study the scrambling property of a one-dimensional kicked-Ising model on 20-qubit trapped-ion quantum processors. The simulated quantum circuits have a geometrically local structure that exhibits the ballistic growth of entanglement, resulting in the circuit depth being linear in the number of qubits for the entire state to be scrambled. We experimentally confirm the growth of signals in the Hayden-Preskill recovery protocol and the decay of out-of-time-ordered correlators at late times. As an application of the created scrambling circuits, we also experimentally demonstrate the calculation of the microcanonical expectation values of local operators adopting the idea of thermal pure quantum states. Our experiments are made possible by extensively utilizing one of the highest-fidelity quantum processors currently available and, thus, should be considered as a benchmark for the current status of the most advanced quantum computers.

TI Quantum Imaging of Magnetic Phase Transitions and Spin Fluctuations in
   Intrinsic Magnetic Topological Nanoflakes
SO NANO LETTERS
AB Topological materials featuring exotic band structures, unconventional current flow patterns, and emergent organizing principles offer attractive platforms for the development of next-generation transformative quantum electronic technologies. The family of MnBi2Te4 (Bi2Te3)(n) materials is naturally relevant in this context due to their nontrivial band topology, tunable magnetism, and recently discovered extraordinary quantum transport behaviors. Despite numerous pioneering studies to date, the local magnetic properties of MnBi2Te4 (Bi2Te3)(n) remain an open question, hindering a comprehensive understanding of their fundamental material properties. Exploiting nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond, we report nanoscale quantum imaging of the magnetic phase transitions and spin fluctuations in exfoliated MnBi4Te7 flakes, revealing the underlying spin transport physics and magnetic domains at the nanoscale. Our results highlight the unique advantage of NV centers in exploring the magnetic properties of emergent quantum materials, opening new opportunities for investigating the interplay between topology and magnetism.

TI Structural risk minimization for quantum linear classifiers
SO QUANTUM
AB Quantum machine learning (QML) models based on parameterized quantum circuits are often highlighted as candidates for quantum computing's near-term "killer application". However, the understanding of the empirical and generalization performance of these models is still in its infancy. In this paper we study how to balance between training accuracy and generalization performance (also called structural risk minimization) for two prominent QML models introduced by Havlicek et al. [1], and Schuld and Killoran [2]. Firstly, using relationships to well understood classical models, we prove that two model parameters - i.e., the dimension of the sum of the images and the Frobenius norm of the observables used by the model - closely control the models' complexity and therefore its generalization performance. Secondly, using ideas inspired by process tomography, we prove that these model parameters also closely control the models' ability to capture correlations in sets of training examples. In summary, our results give rise to new options for structural risk minimization for QML models.

TI Noise classification in three-level quantum networks by Machine Learning
SO MACHINE LEARNING-SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB We investigate a machine learning based classification of noise acting on a small quantum network with the aim of detecting spatial or multilevel correlations, and the interplay with Markovianity. We control a three-level system by inducing coherent population transfer exploiting different pulse amplitude combinations as inputs to train a feedforward neural network. We show that supervised learning can classify different types of classical dephasing noise affecting the system. Three non-Markovian (quasi-static correlated, anti-correlated and uncorrelated) and Markovian noises are classified with more than 99% accuracy. On the contrary, correlations of Markovian noise cannot be discriminated with our method. Our approach is robust to statistical measurement errors and retains its effectiveness for physical measurements where only a limited number of samples is available making it very experimental-friendly. Our result paves the way for classifying spatial correlations of noise in quantum architectures.

TI The quantum circuit implementation and feasibility analysis of quantum
   public-key cryptosystem based on the QSCDff problem
SO CYBERSECURITY
AB The development of quantum computation enables exponential time complexity problems on classical computers to be solved in polynomial time on quantum computers. However, it also poses a threat to the security of classical cryptographic schemes based on integer factorization and discrete logarithms. In response to this challenge, quantum cryptographic schemes based on quantum computation and quantum communication environments have become a focal point of research. The quantum public-key cryptosystem based on the QSCD(ff) problem stands as one of the influential schemes in the realm of quantum public-key cryptography, yet its feasibility remains unexplored in current literature. Our specific focus lies in the quantum circuit implementations and fault-tolerant construction, which serve as essential prerequisites for the physical feasibility of quantum cryptographic schemes. We provide quantum circuit implementations along with rigorous theoretical proofs for the computation of the permutation product operation and the permutation sign operation in quantum public-key cryptographic schemes. Based on the fault-tolerant quantum computation process of the aforementioned quantum circuit implementations, we propose two error-correction strategies and provide a theoretical feasibility analysis within a specified range in the ion-trap quantum computation environment, adhering to the theoretical limits of quantum computation. Rigorous proofs are presented to demonstrate the correctness and reliability of the proposed methods. Our contribution provides a theoretical foundation for the physical feasibility analysis of quantum cryptographic algorithms, offering insights into the challenges and prospects of implementing these algorithms in quantum computation environments.

TI Optimal readout of superconducting qubits exploiting high-level states
SO FUNDAMENTAL RESEARCH
AB High-fidelity initialization, manipulation, and measurement of qubits are important in quantum computing. For the Google's Sycamore processor, the gate fidelity of single- and two-qubit logic operations has improved to > 99.6%, whereas single-shot measurement fidelity remains at the level of 97%, which severely limits the application of the superconducting approach to large-scale quantum computing. The current measurement scheme relies on the dispersive interaction between the qubit and the readout resonator, which was proposed back in 2004. However, the measurement fidelity is limited by the trade-offbetween the state separation and relaxation time of the two-level system. Recently, an exciting phenomenon was observed experimentally, wherein the separation-decay limit could be alleviated by exploiting the cascade decay nature of the higher levels; however, the mechanism and effectiveness of this phenomenon are still unclear. Herein, we present a theoretical tool to extract different types of errors in high-level states encoding dispersive measurement. For the realistic parameters of Google's Sycamore processor, the use of state |2) is sufficient to suppress 92% of the decay readout error on average, where the total readout error is dominated by the background thermal excitation. We also show counter-intuitively that, the assistance of high-level states is effective in the measurement of logic 0, where there is no decay process.

TI Quantum Correlations on Quantum Spaces
SO INTERNATIONAL MATHEMATICS RESEARCH NOTICES
AB For given quantum (non-commutative) spaces P and O, we study the quantum space of maps M-P,M-O from P to O. In case of finite quantum spaces, these objects turn out to be behind a large class of maps which generalize the classical qc-correlations known from quantum information theory to the setting of quantum input and output sets. We prove various operator algebraic properties of the C*-algebras C(M-P,M-O) such as the lifting property and residual finite dimensionality. Inside C(M-P,M-O) we construct a universal operator system S-P,S-O related to P and O, and show, among other things, that the embedding S-P,S-O subset of C (M-P,M-O) is hyperrigid and has another interesting property, which we call the strong extension property. Furthermore, C(M-P,M-O) is the C*-envelope of S-P,S-O and a large class of non-signalling correlations on the quantum sets P and O arise from states on C(M-P,M-O) circle times(max) C(M-P,M-O) as well as states on the commuting tensor product S-P,S-O circle times(c) S-P,S-O. Finally, we introduce and study the notion of a synchronous correlation with quantum input and output sets and prove several characterizations of such correlations and their relation to traces on C(M-P,M-O).

TI High-precision quantum algorithms for partial differential equations
SO QUANTUM
AB Quantum computers can produce a quantum encoding of the solution of a system of differential equations exponentially faster than a classical algorithm can produce an explicit description. However, while high-precision quantum algorithms for linear ordinary differential equations are well established, the best previous quantum algorithms for linear partial differential equations (PDEs) have complexity poly(1/epsilon), where epsilon is the error tolerance. By developing quantum algorithms based on adaptive-order finite difference methods and spectral methods, we improve the complexity of quantum algorithms for linear PDEs to be poly(d, log( 1/epsilon)), where d is the spatial dimension. Our algorithms apply high-precision quantum linear system algorithms to systems whose condition numbers and approximation errors we bound. We develop a finite difference algorithm for the Poisson equation and a spectral algorithm for more general second-order elliptic equations.

TI Experimental implementation of secure anonymous protocols on an
   eight-user quantum key distribution network
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Anonymity in networked communication is vital for many privacy-preserving tasks. Secure key distribution alone is insufficient for high-security communications. Often, knowing who transmits a message to whom and when must also be kept hidden from an adversary. Here, we experimentally demonstrate five information-theoretically secure anonymity protocols on an eight user city-wide quantum network using polarisation entangled photon pairs. At the heart of these protocols is anonymous broadcasting, which is a cryptographic primitive that allows one user to reveal one bit of information while keeping their identity anonymous. For a network of n users, the protocols retain anonymity for the sender, given that no more than n - 2 users are colluding. This is an implementation of genuine multi-user cryptographic protocols beyond standard QKD. Our anonymous protocols enhance the functionality of any fully-connected Quantum Key Distribution network without trusted nodes.

TI Parallelizable synthesis of arbitrary single-qubit gates with linear
   optics and time-frequency encoding
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We propose methods for the exact synthesis of single-qubit unitaries with high success probability and gate fidelity, considering both time-bin and frequency-bin encodings. The proposed schemes are experimentally implementable with a spectral linear-optical quantum computation (S-LOQC) platform, composed of electro-optic phase modulators and phase-only programmable filters (pulse shapers). We assess the performances in terms of fidelity and probability of the two simplest three-component configurations for arbitrary gate generation in both encodings and give an exact analytical solution for the synthesis of an arbitrary single-qubit unitary in the time-bin encoding, using a single-tone rf driving of the electro-optic modulators. We further investigate the parallelization of arbitrary single-qubit gates over multiple qubits with a compact experimental setup, both for spectral and temporal encodings. We systematically evaluate and discuss the impact of the rf bandwidth, which conditions the number of tones driving the modulators, and of the choice of encoding for different targeted gates. We moreover quantify the number of high-fidelity Hadamard gates that can be synthesized in parallel, with minimal and increasing resources in terms of driving rf tones in a realistic system. Our analysis positions spectral S-LOQC as a promising platform to conduct massively parallel single-qubit operations, with potential applications to quantum metrology and quantum tomography.

TI Decoherence of steerability and coherence dynamics induced by nonlinear
   qubit-cavity interactions
SO OPEN PHYSICS
AB In this study, we have applied the intrinsic decoherence (ID) model of the Milburn equation to investigate the temporal evolution of various quantum resources (steerability, entanglement, and coherence) in the generated dipole-coupled two-qubit states. Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen steering, EOF, and Jensen-Shannon divergence are used to analyze these quantum resources. We consider two dipole-coupled qubit interacting with two spatially separated cavities with nonlinear photonic transitions, filled with a superposition of generalized Barut-Girardello coherent fields. The exploration of steerability, entanglement, and coherence has been carried out by considering the nonlinearity of qubit-cavity interactions, the nonclassicality of the superposition of Barut-Girardello coherent fields, the dipole-dipole coupling, and the ID of qubit-cavity interactions. Our results show that the nonlinearity of qubit-cavity interactions, the initial generalized Barut-Girardello coherent states, and the qubit-cavity detuning significantly enhance the generation of quantum steerability, entanglement, and coherence. The dynamics of entanglement and steerability are consistent with the hierarchy principle. The ID effect reduces the amplitudes and frequencies of the generated quantum resources to their stationary values. It is found that the phenomena of sudden steerability arising and sudden annihilation of entanglement are influenced by the initial non-classicality, dipole coupling, and intrinsic qubit-cavity decoherence. Moreover, the strong decoherence and dipole coupling significantly enhance the steady-state values of steerability, entanglement, and coherence.

TI A sufficient criterion for divisibility of quantum channels
SO JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL PHYSICS
AB We present a simple, dimension-independent criterion which guarantees that some quantum channel Phi is divisible, i.e., that there exists a non-trivial factorization Phi = Phi(1)Phi(2). The idea is to first define an "elementary" channel Phi(2) and then to analyze when Phi Phi(-1)(2) is completely positive. The sufficient criterion obtained this way-which even yields an explicit factorization of Phi-is that one has to find orthogonal unit vectors x, x(perpendicular to) such that < x(perpendicular to)|K Phi K Phi perpendicular to|x >=< x|K Phi K Phi perpendicular to|x >={0} where K-Phi is the Kraus subspace of Phi and K-Phi(perpendicular to) is its orthogonal complement. Of course, using linearity this criterion can be reduced to finitely many equalities. Generically, this division even lowers the Kraus rank which is why repeated application-if possible-results in a factorization of Phi into in some sense "simple" channels. Finally, be aware that our techniques are not limited to the particular elementary channel we chose. (c) 2025 Author(s).

TI Photonic-circuited resonance fluorescence of single molecules with an
   ultrastable lifetime-limited transition
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Resonance fluorescence as the emission of a resonantly-excited two-level quantum system promises indistinguishable single photons and coherent high-fidelity quantum-state manipulation of the matter qubit, which underpin many quantum information processing protocols. Real applications of the protocols demand high degrees of scalability and stability of the experimental platform, and thus favor quantum systems integrated on one chip. However, the on-chip solution confronts several formidable challenges compromising the scalability prospect, such as the randomness, spectral wandering and scattering background of the integrated quantum systems near heterogeneous and nanofabricated material interfaces. Here we report an organic-inorganic hybrid integrated quantum photonic platform that circuits background-free resonance fluorescence of single molecules with an ultrastable lifetime-limited transition. Our platform allows a collective alignment of the dipole orientations of many isolated molecules with the photonic waveguide. We demonstrate on-chip generation, beam splitting and routing of resonance-fluorescence single photons with a signal-to-background ratio over 3000 in the waveguide at the weak excitation limit. Crucially, we show the photonic-circuited single molecules possess a lifetime-limited-linewidth transition and exhibit inhomogeneous spectral broadenings of only about 5% over hours' measurements. These findings and the versatility of our platform pave the way for scalable quantum photonic networks.
   Single molecules can generate high-quality single photons for quantum technologies, but coupling to waveguides is difficult. Here, the authors show on-chip background-free resonance fluorescence generation and routing from single molecules with lifetime-limited transition and waveguide-aligned dipoles.

TI Quantum Annealing Boosts Prediction of Multimolecular Adsorption on
   Solid Surfaces Avoiding Combinatorial Explosion
SO JACS AU
AB Quantum annealing has been used to predict molecular adsorption on solid surfaces. Evaluation of adsorption, which takes place in all solid surface reactions, is a crucially important subject for study in various fields. However, predicting the most stable coordination by theoretical calculations is challenging for multi-molecular adsorption because there are numerous candidates. This report presents a novel method for quick adsorption coordination searches using the quantum annealing principle without combinatorial explosion. This method exhibited much faster search and more stable molecular arrangement findings than conventional methods did, particularly in a high coverage region. We were able to complete a configurational prediction of the adsorption of 16 molecules in 2286 s (including 2154 s for preparation, only required once), whereas previously it has taken 38 601 s. This approach accelerates the tuning of adsorption behavior, especially in composite materials and large-scale modeling, which possess more combinations of molecular configurations.

TI Multiphonon Transitions in a Quantum Electromechanical System
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB Studies of micromechanical and acoustic modes in the quantum regime have shed light on quantum properties of massive objects. Integrating these systems into superconducting circuits shows great promise for applications as quantum memory elements, bosonic codes, or in frequency conversion. To this end, investigation of nonclassical properties of acoustic degrees of freedom is critical also for applications. Here, we investigate a strongly driven system consisting of a transmon qubit interacting with a highovertone bulk acoustic resonator. We observe multiphonon transitions, which enable mapping the energy landscape in the coupled system. At a high driving amplitude comparable to the qubit-oscillator coupling, we observe a shift of the multiphonon spectral lines, reminiscent of Stark shift, which is explained using a simple model. Our work thus also provides insight in multiquanta transitions in other qubit-oscillator systems, not limited to acoustics or circuit quantum electrodynamics.

AB Two decades after their demonstration, superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors (SNSPDs) have become indispensable tools for quantum photonics as well as for many other photon-starved applications. This invention has not only led to a burgeoning academic field with a wide range of applications but also triggered industrial efforts. Current state-of-the-art SNSPDs combine near-unity detection efficiency over a wide spectral range, low dark counts, short dead times, and picosecond time resolution. The present perspective discusses important milestones and progress of SNSPDs research, emerging applications, and future challenges and gives an outlook on technological developments required to bring SNSPDs to the next level: a photon-counting, fast time-tagging imaging, and multi-pixel technology that is also compatible with quantum photonic integrated circuits.

TI High-fidelity control of a nitrogen-vacancy-center spin qubit at room
   temperature using the sinusoidally modulated, always rotating, and
   tailored protocol
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB A practical implementation of a quantum computer requires robust qubits that are protected against their noisy environment. Dynamical decoupling techniques have been successfully used in the past to offer protected high-fidelity gate operations in negatively charged nitrogen-vacancy (NV-) centers in diamond, albeit under specific conditions with the intrinsic nitrogen nuclear spin initialized. In this work, we show how the sinusoidally modulated, always rotating, and tailored (SMART) protocol, an extension of the dressed-qubit concept, can be implemented for continuous protection to offer Clifford gate fidelities compatible with fault-tolerant schemes, whilst prolonging the coherence time of a single NV- qubit at room temperature. We show an improvement in the average Clifford gate fidelity from 0.940 +/- 0.005 for the bare qubit to 0.993 +/- 0.002 for the SMART qubit, with the nitrogen nuclear spin in a random orientation. We further show a greater than or similar to 30 times improvement in the qubit T-2* coherence times compared to the bare qubit.

TI Quantum-Enhanced Machine Learning for Cybersecurity: Evaluating
   Malicious URL Detection
SO ELECTRONICS
AB The constant rise of malicious URLs continues to pose significant threats and challenges in cybersecurity, with attackers increasingly evading classical detection methods like blacklists and heuristic-based systems. While machine learning (ML) techniques such as SVMs and CNNs have improved detection, their accuracy and scalability remain limited for emerging adversarial approaches. Quantum machine learning (QML) is a transformative strategy that relies on quantum computation and high-dimensional feature spaces to potentially overcome classical computational limitations. However, the accuracy of QML models such as QSVM and QCNN for URL detection in comparison to classical models remains unexplored. This study evaluates ML models (SVMs and CNNs) and QML models (QSVMs and QCNNs) on a dataset, employing data preprocessing techniques such as outliers, feature scaling and feature selection with ANOVA and PCA. Quantum models utilized ZZFeatureMap and ZFeatureMap for data encoding, to transfer original data to qubits. The achieved results showed that CNNs outperformed QCNNs and QSVMs outperformed SVMs in the performance evaluation, demonstrating a competitive potential of quantum computing. QML shows promise for cybersecurity, particularly given the QSVM's kernel advantages, but current hardware limits the QCNN's practicality. The significance of this research is to contribute to the growing body of knowledge in cybersecurity by providing a comparative analysis of classical and quantum ML models for classifying malicious URLs.

TI Proof-of-principle experimental demonstration of quantum gate
   verification
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB To employ a quantum device, the performance of the quantum gates in the device needs to be evaluated first. Since the dimensionality of a quantum gate grows exponentially with the number of qubits, evaluating the performance of a quantum gate is a challenging task. Recently, a scheme called quantum gate verification (QGV) has been proposed, which can verifies quantum gates with near-optimal efficiency. In this paper, we implement a proof-of-principle optical experiment to demonstrate this QGV scheme. We show that for a single-qubit quantum gate, only -300 samples are needed to confirm the fidelity of the quantum gate to be, at least, 97% with a 99% confidence level using the QGV method, whereas, at least, -3000 samples are needed to achieve the same result using the standard quantum process tomography method. The QGV method validated by this paper has the potential to be widely used for the evaluation of quantum devices in various quantum information applications.

TI Distant entanglement via photon hopping in a coupled cavity
   magnomechanical system
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB We theoretically propose a scheme to generate distant bipartite entanglement between various subsystems in coupled magnomechanical systems where both the microwave cavities are coupled through single photon hopping coupling strength Gamma. Each cavity contains a magnon mode and phonon mode and this gives six excitation modes in our model Hamiltonian which are cavity-1 photons, cavity-2 photons, magnon and phonon in cavity-1, and magnon and phonon in cavity-2. We found that significant bipartite entanglement exists between indirectly coupled subsystems in coupled microwave cavities for an appropriate set of parameters regime. Moreover, we also obtain suitable cavity and magnon detuning parameters for a significant distant bipartite entanglement in different bipartitions. In addition, it can be seen that a single photon hopping parameter significantly affects both the degree as well as the transfer of quantum entanglement between various bipartitions. Hence, our present study related to coupled microwave cavity magnomechanical configuration will open new perspectives in coherent control of various quantum correlations including quantum state transfer among macroscopic quantum systems.

TI Solving large break minimization problems in a mirrored double
   round-robin tournament using quantum annealing
SO PLOS ONE
AB Quantum annealing has gained considerable attention because it can be applied to combinatorial optimization problems, which have numerous applications in logistics, scheduling, and finance. In recent years, with the technical development of quantum annealers, research on solving practical combinatorial optimization problems using them has accelerated. However, researchers struggle to find practical combinatorial optimization problems, for which quantum annealers outperform mathematical optimization solvers. Moreover, there are only a few studies that compare the performance of quantum annealers with the state-of-the-art solvers, such as Gurobi and CPLEX. This study determines that quantum annealing demonstrates better performance than the solvers in that the solvers take longer to reach the objective function value of the solution obtained by the quantum annealers for the break minimization problem in a mirrored double round-robin tournament. We also explain the desirable performance of quantum annealing for the sparse interaction between variables and a problem without constraints. In this process, we demonstrate that this problem can be expressed as a 4-regular graph. Through computational experiments, we solve this problem using our quantum annealing approach and two-integer programming approaches, which were performed using the latest quantum annealer D-Wave Advantage, and Gurobi, respectively. Further, we compare the quality of the solutions and the computational time. Quantum annealing was able to determine the exact solution in 0.05 seconds for problems with 20 teams, which is a practical size. In the case of 36 teams, it took 84.8 s for the integer programming method to reach the objective function value, which was obtained by the quantum annealer in 0.05 s. These results not only present the break minimization problem in a mirrored double round-robin tournament as an example of applying quantum annealing to practical optimization problems, but also contribute to find problems that can be effectively solved by quantum annealing.

TI Multi-Phase Quantum Resistant Framework for Secure Communication in
   SCADA Systems
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON DEPENDABLE AND SECURE COMPUTING
AB Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems are vulnerable to traditional cyber-attacks, such as man-in-the-middle, denial of service, eavesdropping, and masquerade attacks, as well as future attacks based on Grover's and Shor's algorithm implemented in quantum hardware. This article proposes a quantum-robust scheme based on entanglement and supersingular isogeny-based cryptography. The scheme employs a modified Supersingular Isogeny Key Encapsulation (SIKE) to generate shared secret keys, also authenticating BBM92, a quantum key distribution protocol to generate a symmetric key. The article uses ASCON-128 and SHA-3 to encrypt and authenticate messages, and provides a comparative analysis of two entanglement-based quantum key distribution protocols. The proposed scheme is compared to the current SCADA standard, AGA-12, and is shown to provide confidentiality, integrity, intrusion resistance, message authentication, and scalability. The randomness of key pairs generated by our algorithm and RSA key pairs is 87.5% and 84.37%, respectively, addressing confidentiality and integrity. Using the BBM92 protocol, our proposed algorithm detects the presence of an adversary by generating an average error rate of 26.07% and information leakage of 76.01%. AGA-12 relies on SHA-1 hash function that Google has cracked recently. However, our algorithm includes SHA-3, a collision and quantum-resistant hash that provides message authentication.

Our construction is based on a similar criterion for quantum measurements put forward by H. Zhu. We then study the power of the incompatibility criterion in different scenarios. First, we prove the first analytical conditions for the incompatibility of two Schur channels. Then, we study the incompatibility structure of a tuple of depolarizing channels, comparing the newly introduced criterion with the known results from asymmetric quantum cloning.

TI Reducing CNOT count in quantum Fourier transform for the linear
   nearest-neighbor architecture
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Physical limitations of quantum hardware often necessitate nearest-neighbor (NN) architecture. When synthesizing quantum circuits using the basic gate library, which consists of CNOT and single-qubit gates, CNOT gates are required to convert a quantum circuit into one suitable for an NN architecture. In the basic gate library, CNOT gates are considered the primary cost of quantum circuits due to their higher error rates and longer execution times compared to single-qubit gates. In this paper, we propose a new linear NN (LNN) circuit design for quantum Fourier transform (QFT), one of the most versatile subroutines in quantum algorithms. Our LNN QFT circuit has only about 40% of the number of CNOT gates compared to previously known LNN QFT circuits. Subsequently, we input both our QFT circuits and conventional QFT circuits into the Qiskit transpiler to construct QFTs on IBM quantum computers, which necessitate NN architectures. Consequently, our QFT circuits demonstrate a substantial advantage over conventional QFT circuits in terms of the number of CNOT gates. This outcome implies that the proposed LNN QFT circuit design could serve as a novel foundation for developing QFT circuits implemented in quantum hardware that demands NN architecture.

TI Coupling Nanowire Quantum Dots to Optical Waveguides by
   Microsphere-Induced Photonic Nanojet
SO PHOTONICS
AB Silica-on-silicon is a major optical integration platform, while the emergent class of the integrated laser-written circuits' platform offers additionally high customizability and flexibility for rapid prototyping. However, the inherent waveguides' low core/cladding refractive index contrast characteristic, compared to other photonic platforms in silicon or silicon nitride, sets serious limitations for on-chip efficient coupling with single photon emitters, like semiconductor nanowires with quantum dots, limiting the applications in quantum computing. A new light coupling scheme proposed here overcomes this limitation, providing means for light coupling >50%. The scheme is based on the incorporation of an optical microsphere between the nanowire and the waveguide, which is properly optimized and arranged in terms of size, refractive index, and the distance of the microsphere between the nanowire and waveguide. Upon suitable design of the optical arrangement, the photonic nanojet emitted by the illuminated microsphere excites efficiently the guided eigenmodes of the input channel waveguide, thus launching light with high-coupling efficiency. The method is tolerant in displacements, misalignments, and imperfections and is fabricationally feasible by the current state of art techniques. The proposed method enables the on-chip multiple single photon emitters' integration, thus allowing for the development of highly customizable and scalable quantum photonic-integrated circuits for quantum computing and communications.

TI Petri Net Modeling for Ising Model Formulation in Quantum Annealing
SO APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
AB Quantum annealing is an emerging new platform for combinatorial optimization, requiring an Ising model formulation for optimization problems. The formulation can be an essential obstacle to the permeation of this innovation into broad areas of everyday life. Our research is aimed at the proposal of a Petri net modeling approach for an Ising model formulation. Although the proposed method requires users to model their optimization problems with Petri nets, this process can be carried out in a relatively straightforward manner if we know the target problem and the simple Petri net modeling rules. With our method, the constraints and objective functions in the target optimization problems are represented as fundamental characteristics of Petri net models, extracted systematically from Petri net models, and then converted into binary quadratic nets, equivalent to Ising models. The proposed method can drastically reduce the difficulty of the Ising model formulation.

TI AI and quantum computing ethics- same but different? Towards a new
   sub-field of computing ethics
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB As quantum computing development advances closer toward achieving fault-tolerant error-corrected realisation, debates on applications, impacts, risks, and benefits of quantum computing are timely and due. While there is awareness of the potential power and complexity of quantum computers, there has been relatively little attention on the social impacts and ethical implications of this technology. In grappling with the social impacts of quantum computing, some stakeholders have turned to applied ethics, specifically (classical) computer and Artificial Intelligence (AI) ethics, for guidance. While computer and AI ethics are useful starting points for evaluating the ethical issues posed by quantum computing, uncritically applying existing sets of ethical principles risks overlooking how quantum computing differs from these technologies. We argue that borrowing of ethical principles and guidelines from AI and computing is inappropriate for several reasons: (1) quantum computing, classical computing, and AI are different technologies with significant material differences; (2) unlike AI and classical computers which have become established, quantum computing is an emerging technology, which has implications on the levels of accessibility and immediate impact in society; and (3) there are significant differences in the way AI and quantum computing have been developed and by whom. We also briefly summarise some of the unique risks and societ al impacts posed by quantum computing. We posit that these reasons support the argument for a new sub-field of quantum computing ethics, which would allow a relevant scholarship to develop and provide guidance as quantum computing technology continues to mature.

TI On coherence of quantum operations by using Choi-Jamiolkowski
   isomorphism
SO LASER PHYSICS LETTERS
AB In quantum information, most information processing processes involve quantum channels. One manifestation of a quantum channel is quantum operation acting on quantum states. The coherence of quantum operations can be considered as a quantum resource, which can be exploited to perform certain quantum tasks. From the viewpoint of Choi-Jamiolkowski isomorphism, we study the coherence of quantum operations in the framework of resource theory. We study the phase-out superoperation and give the operation which transforms the Choi-Jamiolkowski state of a quantum operation to the Choi-Jamiolkowski state of the another quantum operation obtained by using the phase-out superoperation to act on the quantum operation. The set of maximally incoherent superoperations, the set of nonactivating coherent superoperations and the set of de-phase incoherent superoperations are investigated and we prove that these sets are closed to compound operation and convex combination of quantum superoperations. Further, we introduce the fidelity coherence measure of quantum operations and obtain the exact form of the fidelity coherence measure of the unitary operations on the single qubit.

TI One-Photon-Interference Quantum Secure Direct Communication
SO ENTROPY
AB Quantum secure direct communication (QSDC) is a quantum communication paradigm that transmits confidential messages directly using quantum states. Measurement-device-independent (MDI) QSDC protocols can eliminate the security loopholes associated with measurement devices. To enhance the practicality and performance of MDI-QSDC protocols, we propose a one-photon-interference MDI QSDC (OPI-QSDC) protocol which transcends the need for quantum memory, ideal single-photon sources, or entangled light sources. The security of our OPI-QSDC protocol has also been analyzed using quantum wiretap channel theory. Furthermore, our protocol could double the distance of usual prepare-and-measure protocols, since quantum states sending from adjacent nodes are connected with single-photon interference, which demonstrates its potential to extend the communication distance for point-to-point QSDC.

TI Spin-Valley Qubit Dynamics in Exchange-Coupled Silicon Quantum Dots
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB The presence of valley states is a significant obstacle to realizing quantum information technologies in silicon quantum dots, as leakage into alternate valley states can introduce errors into the computation. We use a perturbative analytical approach to study the dynamics of exchange-coupled quantum dots with valley degrees of freedom. We show that if the valley splitting is large and electrons are not properly initialized to valley eigenstates, then the time evolution of the system will lead to spin-valley entanglement. Spin-valley entanglement will also occur if the valley splitting is small and electrons are not initialized to the same valley state. Additionally, we show that for small valley splitting, spin-valley entanglement does not affect the measurement probabilities of two-qubit systems; however, systems with more qubits will be affected. This means that two-qubit gate fidelities measured in two-qubit systems may miss the effects of valley degrees of freedom. Our work shows how the existence of valleys may adversely affect multiqubit fidelities even when the system temperature is very low. Although this is not an immediate problem in Si qubits, because the current focus is on controlling individual qubits, our work points to a possible future issue in many-qubit Si circuits.

SO EPJ QUANTUM TECHNOLOGY
AB Quantum technologies and computing are an emerging area which offers a new paradigm to solve complex problems using the principles of quantum mechanics, where classical computing faces limits. Due to the advantages of quantum computers, today, there are several industries focusing on different aspects of quantum technologies based on their physics to explore the most efficient and useful platform for implementing applications. Since the scope of the quantum companies is diverse, it is important to understand the education, skills, and qualifications required for different job roles, as this will aid global educational institutions in constructing concentrated disciplines in this field. This paper provides a detailed critical analysis of different job descriptions for education, skills and qualifications. Most of the qubit modalities, such as superconducting, semiconducting, topological, nitrogen-vacancy centres, ion-traps, neutral atoms, and photonics, have been covered. Additionally, quantum software domains such as quantum machine learning, cryptography and error corrections have been discussed with fields such as quantum sensors and metrology. Finally, based on the patterns, recommendations are given to enable better preparation of skills and infrastructure for educational institutes and individuals who would like to pursue a career in the field of quantum technologies.

TI Crosstalk analysis in single hole-spin qubits within highly
   anisotropic g-tensors
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Spin qubits based on valence band hole states are highly promising for quantum information processing due to their strong spin-orbit coupling and ultrafast operation speed. As these systems scale up, achieving high-fidelity single-qubit operations becomes essential. However, mitigating crosstalk effects from neighboring qubits in larger arrays, particularly for anisotropic qubits with strong spin-orbit coupling, presents a significant challenge. We investigate the impact of crosstalk on qubit fidelities during single-qubit operations and derive an analytical equation that serves as a synchronization condition to eliminate crosstalk in anisotropic media. Our analysis proposes optimized driving field conditions that can robustly synchronize Rabi oscillations and minimize crosstalk, showing a strong dependence on qubit anisotropy and the orientation of the external magnetic field. Taking experimental data into our analysis, we identify a set of parameter values that enable nearly crosstalk-free single-qubit gates, thereby paving the way for scalable quantum computing architectures.

TI Microscopic 3D printed optical tweezers for atomic quantum technology
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Trapping of single ultracold atoms is an important tool for applications ranging from quantum computation and communication to sensing. However, most experimental setups, while very precise and versatile, can only be operated in specialized laboratory environments due to their large size, complexity and high cost. Here, we introduce a new trapping concept for ultracold atoms in optical tweezers based on micrometer-scale lenses that are 3D printed onto the tip of standard optical fibers. The unique properties of these lenses make them suitable for both trapping individual atoms and capturing their fluorescence with high efficiency. In an exploratory experiment, we have established the vacuum compatibility and robustness of the structures, and successfully formed a magneto-optical trap for ultracold atoms in their immediate vicinity. This makes them promising components for portable atomic quantum devices.

TI Quantum computing and machine learning for Arabic language sentiment
   classification in social media
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB With the increasing amount of digital data generated by Arabic speakers, the need for effective and efficient document classification techniques is more important than ever. In recent years, both quantum computing and machine learning have shown great promise in the field of document classification. However, there is a lack of research investigating the performance of these techniques on the Arabic language. This paper presents a comparative study of quantum computing and machine learning for two datasets of Arabic language document classification. In the first dataset of 213,465 Arabic tweets, both classic machine learning (ML) and quantum computing approaches achieve high accuracy in sentiment analysis, with quantum computing slightly outperforming classic ML. Quantum computing completes the task in approximately 59 min, slightly faster than classic ML, which takes around 1 h. The precision, recall, and F1 score metrics indicate the effectiveness of both approaches in predicting sentiment in Arabic tweets. Classic ML achieves precision, recall, and F1 score values of 0.8215, 0.8175, and 0.8121, respectively, while quantum computing achieves values of 0.8239, 0.8199, and 0.8147, respectively. In the second dataset of 44,000 tweets, both classic ML (using the Random Forest algorithm) and quantum computing demonstrate significantly reduced processing times compared to the first dataset, with no substantial difference between them. Classic ML completes the analysis in approximately 2 min, while quantum computing takes approximately 1 min and 53 s. The accuracy of classic ML is higher at 0.9241 compared to 0.9205 for quantum computing. However, both approaches achieve high precision, recall, and F1 scores, indicating their effectiveness in accurately predicting sentiment in the dataset. Classic ML achieves precision, recall, and F1 score values of 0.9286, 0.9241, and 0.9249, respectively, while quantum computing achieves values of 0.92456, 0.9205, and 0.9214, respectively. The analysis of the metrics indicates that quantum computing approaches are effective in identifying positive instances and capturing relevant sentiment information in large datasets. On the other hand, traditional machine learning techniques exhibit faster processing times when dealing with smaller dataset sizes. This study provides valuable insights into the strengths and limitations of quantum computing and machine learning for Arabic document classification, emphasizing the potential of quantum computing in achieving high accuracy, particularly in scenarios where traditional machine learning techniques may encounter difficulties. These findings contribute to the development of more accurate and efficient document classification systems for Arabic data.

TI A Variational Quantum Linear Solver Application to Discrete
   Finite-Element Methods
SO ENTROPY
AB Finite-element methods are industry standards for finding numerical solutions to partial differential equations. However, the application scale remains pivotal to the practical use of these methods, even for modern-day supercomputers. Large, multi-scale applications, for example, can be limited by their requirement of prohibitively large linear system solutions. It is therefore worthwhile to investigate whether near-term quantum algorithms have the potential for offering any kind of advantage over classical linear solvers. In this study, we investigate the recently proposed variational quantum linear solver (VQLS) for discrete solutions to partial differential equations. This method was found to scale polylogarithmically with the linear system size, and the method can be implemented using shallow quantum circuits on noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) computers. Herein, we utilize the hybrid VQLS to solve both the steady Poisson equation and the time-dependent heat and wave equations.

TI Rectangular surface code under biased noise
SO QUANTUM INFORMATION PROCESSING
AB To date, the surface code has become a promising candidate for quantum error correcting codes because it achieves a high threshold and is composed of only the nearest gate operations and low-weight stabilizers. Here, we have exhibited that the logical failure rate can be enhanced by manipulating the lattice size of surface codes that they can show an enormous improvement in the number of physical qubits for a noise model where dephasing errors dominate over relaxation errors. We estimated the logical error rate in terms of the lattice size and physical error rate. When the physical error rate was high, the parameter estimation method was applied, and when it was low, the most frequently occurring logical error cases were considered. By using the minimum weight perfect matching decoding algorithm, we obtained the optimal lattice size by minimizing the number of qubits to achieve the required failure rates when physical error rates and bias are provided .

TI Quantum steering ellipsoids and quantum obesity in critical systems
SO EPL
AB - Quantum obesity (QO) is a novel function introduced to quantify quantum correlations that go beyond traditional measures like entanglement, while also functioning as an entanglement witness. One of the key strengths of QO lies in its analyticity for arbitrary states of bipartite systems, making it a more accessible and versatile tool compared to other measures of quantum correlations, such as quantum discord. In this work, we highlight the importance of QO as a fundamental quantity for identifying signatures of quantum phase transitions, which are critical changes in the ground state of quantum systems driven by quantum fluctuations. We introduce a mechanism based on local filtering operations designed to enhance the critical behavior of QO near phase transition points, providing a deeper understanding of these phenomena. Furthermore, we present a theorem that characterizes how QO transforms under local quantum operations and classical communications (LOCC), which broadens its applicability to a wider range of quantum systems. This opens new avenues for exploring quantum criticality and other novel quantum phenomena by leveraging the analytically computable, pairwise QO, thus offering both theoretical insights and practical applications in quantum information science.

AB We propose a scheme for two-qubit gates between a flying photon and an atom in a cavity. The atom -photon gate setup consists of a cavity and a Mach-Zehnder interferometer with doubly degenerate ground- and excitedstate energy levels mediating the atom -light interaction. We provide an error analysis of the gate and model important errors, including spatial mode mismatch between the photon and the cavity, spontaneous emission, cavity losses, detunings, and random fluctuations of the cavity parameters and frequencies. Error analysis shows that the gate protocol is more robust against experimental errors compared to previous atom -photon gates and achieves higher fidelity.

TI QPU integration in OpenCL for heterogeneous programming
SO JOURNAL OF SUPERCOMPUTING
AB The integration of quantum processing units (QPUs) in a heterogeneous high-performance computing environment requires solutions that facilitate hybrid classical-quantum programming. Standards such as OpenCL facilitate the programming of heterogeneous environments, consisting of CPUs and hardware accelerators. This study presents an innovative method that incorporates QPU functionality into OpenCL, standardizing quantum processes within classical environments. By leveraging QPUs within OpenCL, hybrid quantum-classical computations can be sped up, impacting domains like cryptography, optimization problems, and quantum chemistry simulations. Using Portable Computing Language (Jaaskelainen et al. in Int J Parallel Program 43(5):752-785, 2014. https://doi.org/10.1007/s10766-014-0320-y) and the Qulacs library (Suzuki et al. in Quantum 5:559, 2021. https://doi.org/10.22331/q-2021-10-06-559), results demonstrate, for instance, the successful execution of Shor's algorithm (Nielsen and Chuang in Quantum computation and quantum information, 10th anniversary edn. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, 2010), serving as a proof of concept for extending the approach to larger qubit systems and other hybrid quantum-classical algorithms. This integration approach bridges the gap between quantum and classical computing paradigms, paving the way for further optimization and application to a wide range of computational problems.

TI Parameter optimization method for space channel continuous-variable
   quantum key distribution based on Unet network
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB Continuous-variable quantum key distribution (CV-QKD) has made significant progress in the field of quantum communication, operating under strict conditions such as optical diffraction limit, maximum communication distance, and photoelectric detection limit. The optimization of protocol parameters, particularly the modulation variance (), is crucial for the feasibility of CV-QKD. However, in space-to-VA ground CV-QKD scenarios, the high-speed relative motion between low-earth-orbit satellites and ground stations, coupled with limited on-board computing resources, poses challenges for traditional optimization algorithms to meet the real-time demands of rapidly changing space channels. To cope with these challenges, a novel method of optimizing Gaussian-modulation CV-QKD in space channels using a Unet-based approach is proposed in this work. A comprehensive simulation platform for CV-QKD links, generating a substantial training dataset of 126575 samples by changing parameters such as orbital height and zenith angle, is developed in this work. The Unet network, renowned for its symmetric architecture and powerful feature fusion capabilities, is utilized to achieve near-real-time prediction of modulation variance. Our simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, with the Unet network achieving a remarkable prediction accuracy of 99.25%-99.41% on 6328 datasets, orbital heights between 510 and 710 km, and excess noise levels between 0.01 and 0.03. Compared with the local search algorithm, which takes 14754 s, the Unet-based approach significantly reduces the inference time to just 1.08 s, representing a speed-up ratio of 1.48 x 10(6). These findings provide a solid theoretical foundation for optimizing real-time parameters in future space-channel CV-QKD experiments, and have made significant progress in the field of quantum communication. The proposed method not only enhances the efficiency of parameter optimization but also ensures the security and reliability of CV-QKD in dynamic space environments.

AB In this study, the maze generation using quantum annealing is proposed. We reformulate a standard algorithm to generate a maze into a specific form of a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization problem suitable for the input of the quantum annealer. To generate more difficulty mazes, we introduce an additional cost function Qupdate to increase the difficulty. The difficulty of the mazes was evaluated by the time to solve the maze of 12 human subjects. To check the efficiency of our scheme to create the maze, we investigated the time-to-solution of a quantum processing unit, classical computer, and hybrid solver. The results show that Qupdate generates difficult mazes tailored to the individual. Furthermore, it show that the quantum processing unit is more efficient at generating mazes than other solvers. Finally, we also present applications how our results could be used in the future.

TI Predicting quantum emitter fluctuations with time-series forecasting
   models
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB 2D materials have important fundamental properties allowing for their use in many potential applications, including quantum computing. Various Van der Waals materials, including Tungsten disulfide (WS2), have been employed to showcase attractive device applications such as light emitting diodes, lasers and optical modulators. To maximize the utility and value of integrated quantum photonics, the wavelength, polarization and intensity of the photons from a quantum emission (QE) must be stable. However, random variation of emission energy, caused by the inhomogeneity in the local environment, is a major challenge for all solid-state single photon emitters. In this work, we assess the random nature of the quantum fluctuations, and we present time series forecasting deep learning models to analyse and predict QE fluctuations for the first time. Our trained models can roughly follow the actual trend of the data and, under certain data processing conditions, can predict peaks and dips of the fluctuations. The ability to anticipate these fluctuations will allow physicists to harness quantum fluctuation characteristics to develop novel scientific advances in quantum computing that will greatly benefit quantum technologies.

TI Factors influencing the adoption intent of quantum computing in
   enterprises: An innovation adoption process perspective
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INFORMATION MANAGEMENT
AB With recent advancements in quantum computing technology, companies have begun considering replacing or jointly utilizing their existing classical computing resources with quantum computing. Despite initial research on the examination of the adoption considerations for quantum computing, there is a lack of studies investigating the conditions that influence the adoption of quantum computing technology. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to identify and analyze the key factors that drive or hinder companies' intention to adopt quantum computing technology. Building on the theory of innovation diffusion and integrating insights from the adoption of multiple emerging technologies, this research aims to extend the understanding of quantum computing adoption dynamics. Specifically, drawing on the theory of innovation diffusion and existing literature related to the adoption of multiple emerging technologies, this research proposes the following research questions to identify the factors influencing the adoption intention of quantum computing. The study employed a Sequential Explanatory design, first exploring the topic through literature and interviews with 11 quantum computing experts, then quantifying findings with a questionnaire survey with 250 IT decision-makers within Korean companies, analyzed using PLS-SEM and MGA. Research findings revealed that belief in quantum superiority, quantum advantage, continuous budget allocation, and regulatory support significantly and positively influenced quantum computing adoption, whereas organizational resistance had the most substantial negative impact. Furthermore, firm size and industry significantly moderate these adoption intentions. Interestingly, companies expressed a desire to adopt quantum computing despite uncertainties. Theoretically, this study contributes to innovation diffusion theory by contextualizing its application to the adoption of a highly complex and nascent technology such as quantum computing. Practically, the findings offer actionable implications for policymakers and business leaders by illuminating the key drivers and barriers that must be addressed to promote quantum computing adoption.

TI Channel-induced dynamics of quantum information in mixed state free
   quantum field theories
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
AB We propose a new framework for quantum field theory (QFT) studies that allows us to represent field excitations as quantum channels. We demonstrate the inner workings of the proposed scheme for three universal states: a regularized vacuum state, a thermal state of a one-dimensional QFT system, and the lattice regulated thermofield double state of two identical free QFTs. We investigate the actions of unitary and nonunitary bosonic Gaussian channels (including Petz recovery maps). To evaluate and quantify the character of the channel static action and channel-induced dynamics, we calculate quantum entropies and fidelities.

TI Multicore Quantum Computing
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB Any architecture for practical quantum computing must be scalable. An attractive approach is to create multiple cores, computing regions of fixed size that are well spaced but interlinked with communication channels. This exploded architecture can relax the demands associated with a single monolithic device: the complexity of control, cooling and power infrastructure, as well as the difficulties of crosstalk suppression and near-perfect component yield. Here we explore interlinked multicore architectures through analytic and numerical modeling. While elements of our analysis are relevant to diverse platforms, our focus is on semiconductor electron spin systems in which numerous cores may exist on a single chip within a single fridge. We model shuttling and microwave-based interlinks and estimate the achievable fidelities, finding values that are encouraging but markedly inferior to intracore operations. We therefore introduce optimized entanglement purification to enable high-fidelity communication, finding that 99.5% is a very realistic goal. We then assess the prospects for quantum advantage using such devices in the noisy intermediate-scale quantum era and beyond: we simulate recently proposed exponentially powerful error mitigation schemes in the multicore environment and conclude that these techniques impressively suppress imperfections in both the inter- and intracore operations.

TI Machine Learning Techniques for Detecting Attackers During Quantum Key
   Distribution in IoT Networks With Application to Railway Scenarios
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Internet of Things (IoT) deployments face significant security challenges due to the limited energy and computational power of IoT devices. These challenges are more serious in the quantum communications era, where certain attackers might have quantum computing capabilities, which renders IoT devices more vulnerable. This paper addresses the problem of IoT security by investigating quantum key distribution (QKD) in beyond 5G networks. An algorithm for detecting an attacker between a transmitter and receiver is proposed, with the side effect of interrupting the QKD process while detecting the attacker. Afterwards, Artificial neural network (ANN) and deep learning (DL) techniques are proposed in order to detect the presence of an attacker during QKD without the need to disrupt the key distribution process. An architecture for implementing QKD in beyond 5G IoT networks is proposed, offloading the heavy computational tasks to IoT controllers. In addition, an implementation scenario for securing IoT communications for sensors deployed in railroad networks is described. The results show that the proposed ML techniques can reach 99% accuracy in detecting attackers.

TI Classical Simulation and Theory of Quantum Annealing in a Thermal
   Environment
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB We study quantum annealing in the quantum Ising model coupled to a thermal environment. When the speed of quantum annealing is sufficiently slow, the system evolves following the instantaneous thermal equilibrium. This quasistatic and isothermal evolution, however, fails near the end of annealing because the relaxation time grows infinitely, therefore yielding excess energy from the thermal equilibrium. We develop a phenomenological theory based on this picture and derive a scaling relation of the excess energy after annealing. The theoretical results are numerically confirmed using a novel non-Markovian method that we recently proposed based on a path-integral representation of the reduced density matrix and the infinite time evolving block decimation. In addition, we discuss crossovers from weak to strong coupling as well as from the adiabatic to quasistatic regime, and propose experiments on the D-Wave quantum annealer.

TI Quantum Algorithm for a Stochastic Multicloud Model
SO SOLA
AB Quantum computers have attracted much attention in recent years. This is because the development of the actual quantum machine is accelerating. Research on how to use quantum computers is active in the fields such as quantum chemistry and machine learning, where vast amounts of computation are required. However, in weather and climate simulations, less research has been done despite similar computational demands. In this study, a quantum computing algorithm is applied to a problem of the atmospheric science. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is evaluated using a quantum simulator. The results show that it can achieve the same simulations as a conventional algorithm designed for classical computers. More specifically, the stochastically fluctuating behavior of a multi-cloud model was obtained using classical Monte Carlo method, and comparable results are also achieved by utilizing probabilistic outputs of computed quantum states. Our results show that quantum computers have a potential to be useful for the atmospheric and oceanic science, in which stochasticity is widely inherent.

TI Quantum simulation of excited states from parallel contracted quantum
   eigensolvers
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB Computing excited-state properties of molecules and solids is considered one of the most important near-term applications of quantum computers. While many of the current excited-state quantum algorithms differ in circuit architecture, specific exploitation of quantum advantage, or result quality, one common feature is their rooting in the Schrodinger equation. However, through contracting (or projecting) the eigenvalue equation, more efficient strategies can be designed for near-term quantum devices. Here we demonstrate that when combined with the Rayleigh-Ritz variational principle for mixed quantum states, the ground-state contracted quantum eigensolver (CQE) can be generalized to compute any number of quantum eigenstates simultaneously. We introduce two excited-state (anti-Hermitian) CQEs that perform the excited-state calculation while inheriting many of the remarkable features of the original ground-state version of the algorithm, such as its scalability. To showcase our approach, we study several model and chemical Hamiltonians and investigate the performance of different implementations.

TI Benchmarking the emulation of measurement-based quantum computing
   through the Max K-Cut algorithm
SO QUANTUM INFORMATION PROCESSING
AB The measurement-based quantum computing paradigm relies on entangling the qubits of a register into a graph state and on measuring subsets of such register in order to condition the unmeasured qubits. The computation therefore, instead of being carried on only by one-qubit and two-qubits logic gates, is largely based on entanglement and measurement processes. Compared to the gate model architecture, in MBQC the overhead in terms of computation resources to synthesize logical qubits is higher. While gate model relies on a register of logical qubits whose number is set at the beginning of the computation and remains constant during the computation, in the MBQC the input qubits outnumber the output ones, due to the destructive nature of measurement processes. Still, we analytically prove and experimentally confirm that MBQC can be efficiently emulated on a classical software, reaching equal loads with respect to the gate-based approach in terms of average runtime and storage of memory. The numerical results confirm that despite the potential computational overhead due to the high entanglement of the initial graph state, the MBQC paradigm carries similar computational complexity, both in terms of time and memory, with respect to the gate-based approach.

TI Suppression of Fading Noise in Satellite-Mediated Continuous-Variable
   Quantum Key Distribution via Clusterization
SO MATHEMATICS
AB The satellite-mediated continuous-variable quantum key distribution (CV-QKD) protocol, which relies on off-the-shelf telecommunication components, has the potential for a global quantum communication network with all-day operation. However, the transmittance fluctuation of satellite-mediated links leads to the arriving quantum state showing non-Gaussian property, introducing extra fading noise in security analysis and limiting the secret key rate of the protocol. Here, we consider the clusterization method for data post-processing to suppress the fading noise in both downlink and uplink scenarios, where the measurement data are divided into several clusters, and we perform security analysis separately. In particular, we set the optimal upper and lower bounds of each cluster in terms of the probability distribution of transmittance (PDT), while finding an optimal cluster number for the trade-off between fading noise and the composable finite-size effect. Numerical analysis shows that the proposed method can improve the composable finite-size rate when the fading noise is large enough, even with only two clusters. Moreover, a high-speed CV-QKD system with a higher frequency of signal preparation and detection can extend the proposed method to work in the case of lower fading noise.

TI Inferring quantum network topologies using genetic optimization of
   indirect measurements
SO AVS QUANTUM SCIENCE
AB The characterization of quantum networks is fundamental to understanding how energy and information propagates through complex systems, with applications in control, communication, error mitigation, and energy transfer. In this work, we explore the use of external probes to infer the network topology in the context of continuous-time quantum walks, where a single excitation traverses the network with a pattern strongly influenced by its topology. The probes act as decay channels for the excitation and can be interpreted as performing an indirect measurement on the network dynamics. By making use of a genetic optimization algorithm, we demonstrate that the data collected by the probes can be used to successfully reconstruct the topology of any quantum network with high success rates, where performance is limited only by computational resources for large network sizes. Moreover, we show that increasing the number of probes significantly simplifies the reconstruction task, revealing a trade-off between the number of probes and the required computational power.

TI Broadcasting of NPT entanglement in two qutrit systems
SO PRAMANA-JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB It is known that beyond 2 circle times 2 and 2 circle times 3 dimensional quantum systems, Peres-Hordecki criterion is no longer sufficient as an entanglement detection criterion as there are entangled states with both positive and negative partial transpose (PPT and NPT). Further, it is also true that all PPT entangled states are bound entangled states. However, in the class of NPT states, there exist bound entangled states as well as free entangled states. All free/useful/distillable entanglements are part of the class of NPT entangled states. In this article, we ask the question that given an NPT entangled state in 3 circle times 3 dimensional system as a resource, how much entanglement can we broadcast so that resource still remains NPT. We have chosen 3 circle times 3 system as a first step to understand broadcasting of NPT states in higher dimensional systems. In particular, we find out the range of broadcasting of NPT entanglement for two-parameter class of states (TPCS) and isotropic states (IS). Interestingly, as a derivative of this process we are also able to locate the existence of absolute PPT (ABPPT) states in 3 circle times 3 dimensional system. Here we implement the strategy of broadcasting through approximate cloning operations.

TI Deep neural networks for quantum circuit mapping
SO NEURAL COMPUTING & APPLICATIONS
AB Quantum computers have become reality thanks to the effort of some majors in developing innovative technologies that enable the usage of quantum effects in computation, so as to pave the way towards the design of efficient quantum algorithms to use in different applications domains, from finance and chemistry to artificial and computational intelligence. However, there are still some technological limitations that do not allow a correct design of quantum algorithms, compromising the achievement of the so-called quantum advantage. Specifically, a major limitation in the design of a quantum algorithm is related to its proper mapping to a specific quantum processor so that the underlying physical constraints are satisfied. This hard problem, known as circuit mapping, is a critical task to face in quantum world, and it needs to be efficiently addressed to allow quantum computers to work correctly and productively. In order to bridge above gap, this paper introduces a very first circuit mapping approach based on deep neural networks, which opens a completely new scenario in which the correct execution of quantum algorithms is supported by classical machine learning techniques. As shown in experimental section, the proposed approach speeds up current state-of-the-art mapping algorithms when used on 5-qubits IBM Q processors, maintaining suitable mapping accuracy.

TI Quantum simulation of operator spreading in the chaotic Ising model
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW E
AB There is great interest in using near-term quantum computers to simulate and study foundational problems in quantum mechanics and quantum information science, such as the scrambling measured by an out-of-time ordered correlator (OTOC). Here we use an IBM Q processor, quantum error mitigation, and weaved Trotter simulation to study high-resolution operator spreading in a four-spin Ising model as a function of space, time, and integrability. Reaching four spins while retaining high circuit fidelity is made possible by the use of a physically motivated fixed-node variant of the OTOC, allowing scrambling to be estimated without overhead. We find clear signatures of a ballistic operator spreading in a chaotic regime, as well as operator localization in an integrable regime. The techniques developed and demonstrated here open up the possibility of using cloud-based quantum computers to study and visualize scrambling phenomena, as well as quantum information dynamics more generally.

TI Feasibility of satellite-to-ground continuous-variable quantum key
   distribution
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Establishing secure communication links at a global scale is a major potential application of quantum information science but also extremely challenging for the underlying technology. Although milestone experiments using satellite-to-ground links and exploiting singe-photon encoding for implementing quantum key distribution have shown recently that this goal is achievable, it is still necessary to further investigate practical solutions compatible with classical optical communication systems. Here, we examine the feasibility of establishing secret keys in a satellite-to-ground downlink configuration using continuous-variable encoding, which can be implemented using standard telecommunication components certified for space environment and able to operate at high symbol rates. Considering a realistic channel model and state-of-the-art technology, and exploiting an orbit subdivision technique for mitigating fluctuations in the transmission efficiency, we find positive secret key rates for a low-Earth-orbit scenario, whereas finite-size effects can be a limiting factor for higher orbits. Our analysis determines regions of values for important experimental parameters where secret key exchange is possible and can be used as a guideline for experimental efforts in this direction.

TI Efficient Quantum Circuit Design with a Standard Cell Approach, with an
   Application to Neutral Atom Quantum Computers
SO ACM TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM COMPUTING
AB We design quantum circuits by using the standard cell approach borrowed from classical circuit design, which can speed up the layout of circuits with a regular structure. Our standard cells are general and can be used for all types of quantum circuits: error-corrected or not. The standard cell approach enables the formulation of layout-aware routing algorithms. Our method is directly applicable to neutral atom quantum computers supporting qubit shuttling. Such computers enable zoned architectures for memory, processing and measurement, and we design circuits using qubit storage (memory and measurement zones) and standard cells (processing zones). Herein, we use cubic standard cells for Toffoli gates and, starting from a 3D architecture, we design a multiplication circuit. We present evidence that, when compared with automatic routing methods, our layout-aware routers are significantly faster and achieve shallower 3D circuits (by at least 2.5x), while also reducing routing costs. Additionally, our co-design approach can be used to estimate the resources necessary for a quantum computation without using complex compilation methods. We conclude that standard cells, with the support of layout-aware routing, pave the way to very-large-scale methods for quantum circuit compilation.

AB For quantum computing modules using diamond color centers, we propose an integrated structure of a quantum chip with photonic circuits and an interposer with electric circuits. The chip and interposer are connected via gold stud bumps using flip-chip bonding technology. For evaluating the proposed integrated structure, we bonded a test chip of 15 x 15 mm(2), corresponding to the area that allows the allocation of color center qubits in the order of 102, with an interposer of 20 x 20 mm(2), including test measurement lines. We confirm all connections of 16 lines with two bumps for each line at 10 K. The resistance of the lines with two bumps at 10 K is similar to 3.5 Omega. These resistances are mainly attributed to the gold lines on the interposer, which is confirmed by simulations. The shear strength of the flip-chip bonded structure is similar to 67 g/bump. It is larger than that of previous reports where the chips passed the standard temperature cycle test. Moreover, we integrate the flip-chip bonded structure with a printed circuit board (PCB). We confirm a connection between the connector terminal of the PCB and the test chip at 80 K. It is shown that the integrated structure using gold stud bumps has a potentially highly reliable connection at cryogenic temperature. These results will lead to realizing large-scale diamond spin quantum processors.

Assuming that the system initially is in a coherent state, we discuss the system's dynamics and concentrate on the field's mutual correlations. As a measure of such correlations, we apply the normalized first- and second-order coherence functions. We derive the analytical formulas for such functions showing that their time-evolution strongly depends on the linear coupling parameter.

TI Entangled photon-pair sources based on three-wave mixing in bulk
   crystals
SO REVIEW OF SCIENTIFIC INSTRUMENTS
AB Entangled photon pairs are a critical resource in quantum communication protocols ranging from quantum key distribution to teleportation. The current workhorse technique for producing photon pairs is via spontaneous parametric down conversion (SPDC) in bulk nonlinear crystals. The increased prominence of quantum networks has led to a growing interest in deployable high performance entangled photon-pair sources. This manuscript provides a review of the state-of-the-art bulk-optics-based SPDC sources with continuous wave pump and discusses some of the main considerations when building for deployment.

TI ChaQra: a cellular unit of the Indian quantum network
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Major research interests on quantum key distribution (QKD) are primarily focused on increasing 1. Point-to-point transmission distance (1000 km). 2. Secure key rate (Mbps). 3. Security of quantum layer (device-independence). It is great to push the boundaries in these fronts but these isolated approaches are neither scalable nor cost-effective due to requirements of specialised hardware and different infrastructure. Current and future QKD network requires addressing different set of challenges apart from distance, key rate and quantum security. In this regard, we present ChaQra-a sub quantum network with core features as 1. Crypto agility (integration in the already deployed telecommunication fibres). 2. Software defined networking (SDN paradigm for routing different nodes). 3. reliability (addressing denial-of-service with hybrid quantum safe cryptography). 4. upgradability (modules upgradation based on scientific and technological advancements). 5. Beyond QKD (using QKD network for distributed computing, multi-party computation etc). Our results demonstrate a clear path to create and accelerate quantum secure Indian subcontinent under national quantum mission.

TI Fuzzy-Based Balanced Partitioning Under Capacity and Size-Tolerance
   Constraints in Distributed Quantum Circuits
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM ENGINEERING
AB It is important for the design of a distributed quantum circuit (DQC) to minimize the communication cost in k-way balanced partitioning. In this article, given an original quantum circuit (QC), a partitioning number k, the maximum capacity delta inside each partition, and the maximum size tolerance gamma between two partitions, a new k-way (delta, gamma)-balanced partitioning problem can be formulated as a k-way partitioning problem under the capacity constraint delta and the size-tolerance constraint gamma, and a fuzzy-based partitioning algorithm can be proposed to minimize the communication cost in k-way (delta, gamma)-balanced partitioning for a DQC design. First, an edge-weighted connection graph can be constructed from the gates in a given QC. Furthermore, based on the estimation of the probabilistic connection strength between two vertices in the connection graph and the initial k-way partitioning result in the connection graph, the fuzzy memberships on k clusters can be generated in fuzzy k-means graph clustering. Finally, based on the fuzzy memberships on k clusters in the connection graph, the maximum capacity inside each partition, and the maximum size tolerance between two partitions, all the vertices in the connection graph can be assigned onto k partitions to minimize the communication cost in k-way (delta, gamma)-balanced partitioning. Compared with Daei's recursive Kernighan-Lin-based algorithm in four-way balanced partitioning, the experimental results show that the proposed fuzzy-based partitioning algorithm with three size-tolerance constraints gamma = 1, gamma = 2, and gamma = 3 can use 58.3%, 61.3%, and 64.5% of CPU time to reduce 16.1%, 21.2%, and 24.6% of the communication cost for the eight tested circuits on the average, respectively. Compared with the modified partitioning algorithm from Dadkhah's partitioning algorithm in three-way, four-way, or five-way balanced partitioning, the experimental results show that the proposed fuzzy-based partitioning algorithm with the size-tolerance constraint gamma = 3 can use 35.0% of CPU time to reduce 11.1% of the communication cost for the eight tested circuits on the average, respectively.

TI Entropy Bounds for Multiparty Device-Independent Cryptography
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Multiparty quantum cryptography based on distributed entanglement will find its natural application in the upcoming quantum networks. The security of many multipartite device-independent (DI) protocols, such as DI conference-key agreement, relies on bounding the von Neumann entropy of the parties' outcomes conditioned on the eavesdropper's information, given the violation of a multipartite Bell inequality. We consider three parties testing the Mermin-Ardehali-Belinskii-Klyshko (MABK) inequality and certify the privacy of their outcomes by bounding the conditional entropy of a single party's outcome and the joint conditional entropy of two parties' outcomes. From the former bound, we show that genuine multipartite entanglement is necessary to certify the privacy of a party's outcome, while the latter significantly improves previous results. We obtain the entropy bounds thanks to two general results of independent interest. The first one drastically simplifies the quantum setup of an N-partite Bell scenario. The second one provides an upper bound on the violation of the MABK inequality by an arbitrary N-qubit state, as a function of the state's parameters.

TI Tradeoff Relations Between Intrinsic Concurrence and First-Order
   Coherence of Two-Qubit Cavity System: Qubit-Dipole Coupling and
   Decoherence Effects
SO SYMMETRY-BASEL
AB An analytical exploration of the phase decoherence equation of two qubits interacting with a coherent field with dipole-dipole interaction is introduced. The study examines the tradeoff relationships between intrinsic concurrence and first-order coherence in the qubits-cavity system while considering the impacts of decoherence and the interactions among the qubits. We affirm that the relationship between intrinsic concurrence and first-order coherence is valid. Additionally, we demonstrate that the minimum limit of intrinsic concurrence is universally applicable, although the upper limit is typically not. These connections in Heisenberg models can provide a means by which to investigate how quantum resources are allocated in spins, potentially leading to future applications in quantum information processing. It is partially but not completely possible to control the tradeoff relations between intrinsic concurrence and first-order coherence of the two-qubit cavity system; this control might involve actions that influence the system and are reflected in intrinsic concurrence and first-order coherence.

TI Coherent manipulation of an Andreev spin qubit
SO SCIENCE
AB Two promising architectures for solid-state quantum information processing are based on electron spins electrostatically confined in semiconductor quantum dots and the collective electrodynamic modes of superconducting circuits. Superconducting electrodynamic qubits involve macroscopic numbers of electrons and offer the advantage of larger coupling, whereas semiconductor spin qubits involve individual electrons trapped inmicroscopic volumes but aremore difficult to link. We combined beneficial aspects of both platforms in the Andreev spin qubit: the spin degree of freedom of an electronic quasiparticle trapped in the supercurrent-carrying Andreev levels of a Josephson semiconductor nanowire. We performed coherent spin manipulation by combining single-shot circuit-quantum-electrodynamics readout and spin-flipping Raman transitions and found a spin-flip time T-S = 17microseconds and a spin coherence time T-2E = 52 nanoseconds. These results herald a regime of supercurrent-mediated coherent spin-photon coupling at the single-quantum level.

TI Quantum imaging beyond the standard-quantum limit and phase distillation
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB Quantum sensing using non-linear interferometers (NLIs) offers the possibility of bicolour imaging, using light that never interacted with the object of interest, and provides a way to achieve phase supersensitivity, i.e. a Heisenberg-type scaling of the phase uncertainty. Such a scaling behaviour is extremely susceptible to noise and only arises at specific phases that define the optimal working point (WP) of the device. While phase-shifting algorithms are to some degree robust against the deleterious effects induced by noise they extract an image by tuning the interferometer phase over a broad range, implying an operation beyond the WP. In our theoretical study, we investigate both the spontaneous and the high-gain regime of operation of an NLI. In fact, in the spontaneous regime using a distillation technique and operating at the WP leads to a qualitatively similar behaviour. In the high-gain regime, however, typical distillation techniques inherently forbid a scaling better than the standard-quantum limit, as a consequence of the photon statistics of squeezed vacuum. In contrast, an operation at the WP still may lead to a sensitivity below shot noise, even in the presence of noise. Therefore, this procedure opens the perspective of bicolour imaging with a better than shot-noise phase uncertainty by working in the vicinity of the WP. Our results transfer quantum imaging distillation in a noisy environment to the high-gain regime with the ultimate goal of harnessing its full potential by combining bicolour imaging and phase supersensitivity.

TI Feasibility analysis study of discrete modulation continuous variable
   quantum key distribution for spatial channels
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB Continuous variable quantum key distribution (CV-QKD) has emerged as a promising candidate for quantum-secure communication due to its experimentally demonstrated high key rates in fiber-optic channels. However, the feasibility of discrete modulation CV-QKD in satellite-to-ground downlinks remains an open question due to practical challenges such as high transmission loss, limited communication windows, and atmospheric turbulence. In this work, a comprehensive framework is proposed to evaluate the feasibility of discrete modulation CV-QKD by integrating orbital dynamics and atmospheric channel models, and to comprehensively analyze the influence of the parameter space on free-space discrete modulation CV-QKD. To achieve this, a free-space CV-QKD simulation platform is employed, which calculates the elevation angle and transmission distance based on precise orbital models, thereby providing a more practical assessment of the key rate for discrete modulation CV-QKD. Simulation results verify the feasibility and practicality of discrete modulation CV-QKD in satellite-based quantum communication systems. Furthermore, the critical factors influencing the key rate performance are identified, and parameter optimization strategies are proposed, providing theoretical support for realizing the future satellite-to-ground discrete modulation CV-QKD.

TI Practical approach to extending baselines of telescopes using
   continuous-variable quantum information
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB Interferometric telescopes are instrumental for the imaging of distant astronomical bodies, but optical loss heavily restricts how far telescopes in an array can be placed from one another, leading to a bottleneck in the resolution that can be achieved. An entanglement-assisted approach to this problem has been proposed by (Gottesman et al 2011 Phys. Rev. Lett. 109 070503), as a possible solution to the issue of optical loss if the entangled state can be distributed across long distances by employing a quantum repeater network. In this paper, we propose an alternative entanglement-assisted scheme that interferes a two-mode squeezed vacuum state with the astronomical state and then measures the resulting state by means of homodyne detection. We use a continuous-variable approach and compute the Fisher information with respect to the mutual coherence of the astronomical source. We show that when the Fisher information is observed cumulatively at the rate at which successful measurements can be performed, our proposed scheme does not outperform the traditional direct detection approach or the entanglement-assisted approach of GJC12.

TI Coherent phase transfer for real-world twin-field quantum key
   distribution
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Exploiting technologies derived from the optical clocks community, the authors demonstrate a setup for twin-field QKD which extends the coherence times by three orders of magnitude, overcoming the main challenge towards real-world implementation.
   Quantum mechanics allows distribution of intrinsically secure encryption keys by optical means. Twin-field quantum key distribution is one of the most promising techniques for its implementation on long-distance fiber networks, but requires stabilizing the optical length of the communication channels between parties. In proof-of-principle experiments based on spooled fibers, this was achieved by interleaving the quantum communication with periodical stabilization frames. In this approach, longer duty cycles for the key streaming come at the cost of a looser control of channel length, and a successful key-transfer using this technique in real world remains a significant challenge. Using interferometry techniques derived from frequency metrology, we develop a solution for the simultaneous key streaming and channel length control, and demonstrate it on a 206 km field-deployed fiber with 65 dB loss. Our technique reduces the quantum-bit-error-rate contributed by channel length variations to <1%, representing an effective solution for real-world quantum communications.

TI On-Chip Quantum Information Processing with Distinguishable Photons
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Multiphoton interference is at the heart of photonic quantum technologies. Arrays of integrated cavities can support bright sources of single photons with high purity and small footprint, but the inevitable spectral distinguishability between photons generated from nonidentical cavities is an obstacle to scaling. In principle, this problem can be alleviated by measuring photons with high timing resolution, which erases spectral information through the time-energy uncertainty relation. Here, we experimentally demonstrate that detection can be implemented with a temporal resolution sufficient to interfere photons detuned on the scales necessary for cavity-based integrated photon sources. By increasing the effective timing resolution of the system from 200 to 20 ps, we observe a 20% increase in the visibility of quantum interference between independent photons from integrated microring resonator sources that are detuned by 6.8 GHz. We go on to show how time-resolved detection of nonideal photons can be used to improve the fidelity of an entangling operation and to mitigate the reduction of computational complexity in boson sampling experiments. These results pave the way for photonic quantum information processing with many photon sources without the need for active alignment.

TI Low phase noise cavity transmission self-injection locked diode laser
   system for atomic physics experiments
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Lasers with high spectral purity are indispensable for optical clocks and for the coherent manipulation of atomic and molecular qubits in applications such as quantum computing and quantum simulation. While the stabilization of such lasers to a reference can provide a narrow linewidth, the widely used diode lasers exhibit fast phase noise that prevents high-fidelity qubit manipulation. In this paper, we demonstrate a self-injection locked diode laser system that utilizes a high-finesse cavity. This cavity not only provides a stable resonance frequency, it also acts as a low-pass filter for phase noise beyond the cavity linewidth of around 100 kHz, resulting in low phase noise from dc to the injection lock limit. We model the expected laser performance and benchmark it using a single trapped Ca-40(+)-ion as a spectrum analyzer. We show that the fast phase noise of the laser at relevant Fourier frequencies of 100 kHz to >2 MHz is suppressed to a noise floor of between -110 dBc/Hz and -120 dBc/Hz, an improvement of 20 to 30 dB over state-of-the-art Pound-Drever-Hall-stabilized extended-cavity diode lasers. This strong suppression avoids incoherent (spurious) spin flips during manipulation of optical qubits and improves laser-driven gates when using diode lasers in applications involving quantum logic spectroscopy, quantum simulation, and quantum computation.

AB The work considers a qubit interacting off-resonantly a nonlinear Kerr-like quantum-harmonic-oscillator cavity field through nonlinear intensity-dependent and one-photon interactions. The analytical solution for the master equation is obtained when the qubit starts with an excited pure state while the harmonic-oscillator field starts with a coherent state. The dynamics of the phase space Husimi-distribution and its Wehrl-Husimi entropy entanglement/mixedness is explored under the effects of the atom-field detuning, Kerr-like nonlinearity as well as atomic spontaneous-emission dissipation. For resonant case, the Wehrl-Husimi entropy qubit-oscillator entanglement and atomic mixedness are generated (due to the unitary nonlinear intensity-dependent evolution) with a regular oscillatory behavior. For off-resonant case, the quantum coherence is generated partially with a high-frequency irregular oscillatory behavior. The Kerr-like nonlinearity and the atomic spontaneous dissipation lead to enhancing the generated atomic mixedness Wehrl-Husimi entropy enhances and stabilizing the atomic state in a maximally mixed state. The phase space Husimi-distribution information dynamics of the corresponding the generated atomic mixed states confirms the vital link between the formed interference Husimi-distributions and the generated atomic Wehrl-Husimi entropy mixedness. It is found that the dynamics of the Husimi-distribution information and its Wehrl-Husimi entropy is highly sensitive to the qubit-cavity detuning, Kerr-like nonlinearity as well as the dissipation.

TI Tunable Josephson voltage source for quantum circuits
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB Noisy voltage sources can be a limiting factor for both fundamental physics experiments and device applications in quantum information, mesoscopic circuits, magnetometry, and other fields. The best commercial dc voltage sources can be programmed to approximately six digits and have intrinsic noise in the microvolt range. On the other hand, the noise levels in metrological Josephson-junction-based voltage standards is subfemtovolt. Although such voltage standards can be considered "noiseless," they are generally not designed for continuous tuning of the output voltage nor for supplying current to a load at cryogenic temperatures. We propose a Josephson-effect-based voltage source, as opposed to a voltage standard, operating in the 30 - 160-mu V range, which can supply over 100 nA of current to loads at mK temperatures. We describe the operating principle, the sample design, and the calibration procedure to obtain continuous tunability. We show the current-voltage characteristics of the device, demonstrate how the voltage can be adjusted without dc control connections to room-temperature electronics, and showcase an experiment coupling the source to a mesoscopic load: a small Josephson junction. Finally, we characterize the performance of our source by measuring the voltage noise at the load, 50 pV rms, which is attributed to parasitic resistances in the cabling. This work establishes the use of the Josephson effect for voltage biasing of extremely sensitive quantum devices.

TI Unital Kadison-Schwarz Maps
SO OPEN SYSTEMS & INFORMATION DYNAMICS
AB Quantum entanglement is an important phenomenon in quantum information theory. To detect entanglement theoretically, positive but not completely positive maps are used. The Kadison-Schwarz (KS) inequality interpolates between positivity and complete positivity. KS maps may be key to understanding and detecting entanglement. We provide a description of a subset of KS maps on M2(& Copf;) that are unital. This allows for the classification of a wider class of positive maps than the well known bistochastic maps. We derive the conditions for a unital map to be a KS map, and provide nontrivial examples of such a map.

TI ZZ Freedom in Two-Qubit Gates
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB Superconducting qubits on a circuit exhibit an always-on state-dependent phase error. This error is due to sub-MHz parasitic interaction that repels computational levels from noncomputational ones. We study a general theory to evaluate the "static" repulsion between seemingly idle qubits as well as the "dynamical" repulsion between entangled qubits under microwave driving gate. By combining qubits of either the same or opposite anharmonicity signs we find the characteristics of static and dynamical ZZ freedoms. The latter universally eliminate the parasitic repulsion, leading us to mitigate high-fidelity gate operation. Our theory introduces the opportunities for making perfect entangled and unentangled states, which is extremely useful for quantum technology.

TI Filtering states with total spin on a quantum computer
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Starting from a general wave-function described on a set of spins or qubits, we propose several quantum algorithms to extract the components of this state on eigenstates of total spin S2 and its z component Sz. The method plays the role of total spin projection and gives access to the amplitudes of the initial state on a total spin basis. The different algorithms have various degrees of sophistication depending on the requested tasks. They can either solely project onto the subspace with good total spin or completely uplift the degeneracy in this subspace. In the former case, when the projection on the total spin j is made, we show that the number of operations for the projection can be reduced from a quadratic to a linear dependence in j. After each measurement, the state collapses to one of the spin eigenstates that could be used for postprocessing. For this reason, we call the method total quantum spin filtering.

TI Mutation Testing of Quantum Programs: A Case Study With Qiskit
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM ENGINEERING
AB As quantum computing is still in its infancy, there is an inherent lack of knowledge and technology to test a quantum program properly. In the classical realm, mutation testing has been successfully used to evaluate how well a program's test suite detects seeded faults (i.e., mutants). In this article, building on the definition of syntactically equivalent quantum operations, we propose a novel set of mutation operators to generate mutants based on qubit measurements and quantum gates. To ease the adoption of quantum mutation testing, we further propose QMutPy, an extension of the well-known and fully automated open-source mutation tool MutPy. To evaluate QMutPy's performance, we conducted a case study on 24 real quantum programs written in IBM's Qiskit library. Furthermore, we show how better test suite coverage and improvements to test assertions can increase the test suites' mutation score and quality. QMutPy has proven to be an effective quantum mutation tool, providing insight into the current state of quantum tests and how to improve them.

TI A comparative analysis of classical machine learning models with
   quantum-inspired models for predicting world surface temperature
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB This research paper delves into the realm of quantum machine learning (QML) by conducting a comprehensive study on time-series data. The primary objective is to compare the results and time complexity of classical machine learning algorithms on traditional hardware to their quantum counterparts on quantum computers. As the amount and complexity of time-series data in numerous fields continues to expand, the investigation of advanced computational models becomes critical for efficient analysis and prediction. We employ a time-series dataset that include temperature records from different nations throughout the world spanning the previous half of the century. The study compares the performance of classical machine learning algorithms to quantum algorithms, which use the concepts of superposition and entanglement to handle subtle temporal patterns in time-series data. This study attempts to reveal the different benefits and drawbacks of quantum machine learning in the time-series domain through rigorous empirical analysis. The findings of this study not only help to comprehend the applicability of quantum algorithms in real-world contexts, but they also open the way for future advances in utilizing quantum computing for increased time-series analysis and prediction. This study's findings could have ramifications in industries ranging from finance to healthcare, where precise forecasting using time-series data is critical for informed decision-making.

TI Preparing Precollege Students for the Second Quantum Revolution with
   Core Concepts in Quantum Information Science
SO PHYSICS TEACHER
AB After the passage of the U.S. National Quantum Initiative Act in December 2018, the National Science Foundation (NSF) and the Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) recently assembled an interagency working group and conducted a workshop titled "Key Concepts for Future Quantum Information Science Learners " that focused on identifying core concepts for future curricular and educator activities to help precollege students engage with quantum information science (QIS). Helping precollege students learn these key concepts in QIS is an effective approach to introducing them to the second quantum revolution and inspiring them to become future contributors in the growing field of quantum information science and technology as leaders in areas related to quantum computing, communication, and sensing. This paper is a call to precollege educators to contemplate including QIS concepts into their existing courses at appropriate levels and get involved in the development of curricular materials suitable for their students. Also, research shows that compare-and-contrast activities can provide an effective approach to helping students learn. Therefore, we illustrate a pedagogical approach that contrasts the classical and quantum concepts so that educators can adapt them for their students in their lesson plans to help them learn the differences between key concepts in quantum and classical contexts.

SO APPLIED PHYSICS EXPRESS
AB Quantum entanglement plays a crucial role in quantum information technologies. In the paper, we propose two schemes to convert from two-photon Knill-Laflamme-Milburn (KLM) entangled states to Bell states and three-photon KLM state to Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger states based on error-detected quantum devices (EDQDs), which employ the interaction between a quantum-dot-cavity system and a photon. Moreover, the quantum circuits of EDQDs applied in the conversion processes make our schemes carry out faithfully, as the practical photon-scattering deviations are changed into heralded-failure detections. Analyses show that conversion cases have unity fidelities and high efficiencies, which encourage us to appreciate deeply fundamental properties of entanglement.

TI Control of Solid-State Nuclear Spin Qubits Using an Electron Spin-1/2
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW X
AB Solid-state quantum registers consisting of optically active electron spins with nearby nuclear spins are promising building blocks for future quantum technologies. For electron spin-1 registers, dynamical decoupling (DD) quantum gates have been developed that enable the precise control of multiple nuclear spin qubits. However, for the important class of electron spin-1/2 systems, this control method suffers from intrinsic selectivity limitations, resulting in reduced nuclear spin gate fidelities. Here, we demonstrate improved control of single nuclear spins by an electron spin-1/2 using dynamically decoupled radiofrequency (DDRF) gates. We make use of the electron spin-1/2 of a diamond tin-vacancy center, showing high-fidelity single-qubit gates, single-shot readout, and spin coherence beyond a millisecond. The DD control is used as a benchmark to observe and control a single 13C nuclear spin. Using the DDRF control method, we demonstrate improved control on that spin. In addition, we find and control an additional nuclear spin that is insensitive to the DD control method. Using these DDRF gates, we show entanglement between the electron and the nuclear spin with 72(3)% state fidelity. Our extensive simulations indicate that DDRF gate fidelities well in excess are feasible. Finally, we employ time-resolved photon detection during readout to quantify the hyperfine coupling for the electron's optically excited state. Our work provides key insights into the challenges and opportunities for nuclear spin control in electron spin-1/2 systems, opening the door to multiqubit experiments on these promising qubit platforms.

AB Quantum Computing (QC) is an innovative research field that has gathered the interest of many researchers in the last few years. In fact, it is believed that QC could potentially revolutionize the way we solve very complex problems by dramatically decreasing the time required to solve them. Even though QC is still in its early stages of development, it is already possible to tackle some problems by means of quantum computers and to start catching a glimpse of its potential. Therefore, the aim of the QuantumCLEF lab is to raise awareness about QC and to develop and evaluate new QC algorithms to solve challenges that can be encountered when implementing Information Retrieval (IR) and Recommender Systems (RS) systems. Furthermore, this lab represents a good opportunity to engage with QC technologies which are typically not easily accessible.
   In this work, we present an overview of the first edition of QuantumCLEF, a lab that focuses on the application of Quantum Annealing (QA), a specific QC paradigm, to solve two tasks: Feature Selection for IR and RS systems, and Clustering for IR systems. There have been a total of 26 teams who registered for this lab and eventually 7 teams managed to successfully submit their runs following the lab guidelines. Due to the novelty of the topics, participants have been provided with many examples and comprehensive materials that allowed them to understand how QA works and how to program quantum annealers.

AB The Continuous-Variable Quantum Key Distribution (CV-QKD) is a groundbreaking technology that enables two parties, Alice and Bob, to share secret cryptographic keys with security guaranteed by the fundamental principle of quantum mechanics. The optical signal's amplitude and phase quadratures are transmitted through a quantum channel and measured by the receiver (Bob). Due to channel noise, loss, and other imperfections, error correction is necessary to ensure both parties share identical raw key bits while minimizing information leakage to potential eavesdroppers (Eve). Non-Binary Low-Density Parity-Check (NB-LDPC) codes are well-suited for CV-QKD because they achieve high reconciliation efficiency, particularly in low-SNR scenarios. However, the intensive computational complexity hinders its further deployment in real-world applications. In this paper, we present an HLS-based decoder system, FPT-EMS (Field-Programmable T-EMS), which consists of six submodules aligning with the construction of the base design, Trellis-Based Extended Min-Sum (T-EMS). After the dedicated design of each submodule considering algorithm properties and FPGA characteristics, we ultimately achieved a 9.36x speedup compared with ARM cores of the target platform, RFSoC 4x2, at the throughput of 0.89 Mbps over one iteration.

TI Efficient State Preparation for the Quantum Simulation of Molecules in
   First Quantization
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB The quantum simulation of real molecules and materials is one of the most highly anticipated applications of quantum computing. Algorithms for simulating electronic structure using a first-quantized plane-wave representation are especially promising due to their asymptotic efficiency. However, previous proposals for preparing initial states for these simulation algorithms scale poorly with the size of the basis set. We address this shortcoming by showing how to efficiently map states defined in a Gaussian-type orbital basis to a plane-wave basis with a scaling that is logarithmic in the number of plane waves. Our key technical result is a proof that molecular orbitals constructed from Gaussian-type basis functions can be compactly represented in a plane-wave basis using matrix product states. While we expect that other approaches could achieve the same logarithmic scaling with respect to basis-set size, our proposed state-preparation technique is also highly efficient in practice. For example, in a series of numerical experiments on small molecules, we find that our approach allows us to prepare an approximation to the Hartree-Fock state using orders of magnitude fewer non-Clifford gates than a naive approach. By resolving the issue of state preparation, our work allows for the first quantum simulation of molecular systems the end-to-end complexity of which is truly sublinear in the basis-set size.

TI Continuous-time quantum optimization without the adiabatic principle
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Continuous-time quantum algorithms for combinatorial optimization problems, such as quantum annealing, have previously been motivated by the adiabatic principle. A number of continuous-time approaches exploit dynamics, however, and therefore are no longer physically motivated by the adiabatic principle. In this work, we take Planck's principle as the underlying physical motivation for continuous-time quantum algorithms. Planck's principle states that the energy of an isolated system cannot decrease as the result of a cyclic process. We use this principle to justify monotonic schedules in quantum annealing, which are not adiabatic. This approach also highlights the limitations of reverse quantum annealing in an isolated system.

TI Carbon defect qubit in two-dimensional WS2
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Identifying and fabricating defect qubits in two-dimensional semiconductors are of great interest in exploring candidates for quantum information and sensing applications. A milestone has been recently achieved by demonstrating that single defect, a carbon atom substituting sulphur atom in single layer tungsten disulphide, can be engineered on demand at atomic size level precision, which holds a promise for a scalable and addressable unit. It is an immediate quest to reveal its potential as a qubit. To this end, we determine its electronic structure and optical properties from first principles. We identify the fingerprint of the neutral charge state of the defect in the scanning tunnelling spectrum. In the neutral defect, the giant spin-orbit coupling mixes the singlet and triplet excited states with resulting in phosphorescence at the telecom band that can be used to read out the spin state, and coherent driving with microwave excitation is also viable. Our results establish a scalable qubit in a two-dimensional material with spin-photon interface at the telecom wavelength region.
   Recent work has demonstrated controlled fabrication of single carbon defect spins in the two-dimensional material WS2. Here, the authors use ab initio methods to determine the electronic and optical properties of this defect, establishing it as a viable qubit candidate operating close to the telecom band.

TI Exponential Error Suppression for Near-Term Quantum Devices
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW X
AB Suppressing noise in physical systems is of fundamental importance. As quantum computers mature, quantum error correcting codes (QECs) will be adopted in order to suppress errors to any desired level. However in the noisy, intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) era, the complexity and scale required to adopt even the smallest QEC is prohibitive: a single logical qubit needs to be encoded into many thousands of physical qubits. Here we show that, for the crucial case of estimating expectation values of observables (key to almost all NISQ algorithms) one can indeed achieve an effective exponential suppression. We take n independently prepared circuit outputs to create a state whose symmetries prevent errors from contributing bias to the expected value. The approach is very well suited for current and near-term quantum devices as it is modular in the main computation and requires only a shallow circuit that bridges the n copies immediately prior to measurement. Using no more than four circuit copies, we confirm error suppression below 10(-6) for circuits consisting of several hundred noisy gates (2-qubit gate error 0.5%) in numerical simulations validating our approach.

TI Emergence of X states in a quantum impurity model
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB In the present work, we demonstrate the emergence of X states in the long-time response of a locally perturbed many-body quantum impurity model. The emergence of the double-qubit state is heralded by the lack of decay of the response function as well as the out-of-time order correlator, signifying the trapping of excitations and hence information in edge modes. Surprisingly, after carrying out a quantum information theory characterization, we show that such states exhibit genuine quantum correlations.

TI Quantum computing: current and potential applications in digital
   agriculture
SO PESQUISA AGROPECUARIA BRASILEIRA
AB - Quantum computers use the properties of quantum physics to perform information storage and processing operations. The operation of these computers involves concepts such as entanglement and superposition, which endow them with a great processing power that even surpasses that of the most powerful current supercomputers, while consuming significantly lower amounts of energy. The different studies analyzed in this review article suggest that quantum computing will have a deep impact in areas such as finance, logistics, transportation, space and automotive technology, materials science, energy, pharmaceutical and healthcare industry, cybersecurity, and agriculture. In digital agriculture, several applications that could be executed more efficiently in quantum computers for data processing and understanding of biological processes were identified and exemplified. These applications are grouped here into the following four areas: bioinformatics, remote sensing, climate modeling, and smart farming. This article also explores the strategic importance of mastering quantum computing, highlights some advantages in relation to classical computing, and presents a mapping of the services already available, enabling institutions to undertake strategic planning for the incorporation of quantum computing into their development processes. Finally, the challenges for the implementation of quantum computing are highlighted, along with some ongoing initiatives aimed at furthering research at the forefront of knowledge in this area applied to digital agriculture.

TI Decoherence suppression for N-qubit states via weak measurement and
   environment-assisted measurement
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB All open quantum systems are affected by environmental noises due to their interactions with the external environment and inevitably suffer from decoherence. Hence, it is fundamentally important and necessary to investigate decoherence suppression for open quantum systems via proper control strategies. Inspired by feedforward control in the classical control theory, this paper proposes a novel decoherence suppression scheme via weak measurement and environment-assisted measurement. We first take the single-qubit system as an example to illustrate steps of the proposed scheme. To be specific, the single-qubit system is transferred to a state that is more robust to environmental noises via pre-weak measurement operators and feed-forward control operators before the decoherence channel, a measurement is performed on the environment coupled to the protected qubit during the decoherence channel, and the initial state is recovered via reversed feed-forward control operators and post-weak measurement operators after the decoherence channel. The optimum post-weak measurement strength is derived by setting the normalized final state equal to the initial state. By considering the optimum post-weak measurement strength, analytical formulas of the total success probability and the total fidelity are deduced. The proposed scheme is applicable for protecting quantum states from arbitrary decoherence channels with at least one invertible Kraus operator although only the amplitude damping channel and the phase damping channel are taken into account. Provided that the decay rate of the amplitude or phase damping channel is completely known, one can always achieve unit fidelity even for heavy damping cases, which is the biggest advantage of the proposed scheme. Influences of several parameters including strengths of weak measurements, the initial state and the decay rate of the decoherence channel on the performance of decoherence suppression are analyzed, and detailed procedures of a single-qubit pure and mixed state protection are presented on the Bloch sphere, respectively. Subsequently, the Kronecker product is employed to construct operators of dimension, the proposed scheme is extended to the general N-qubit case, and unified analytical formulas of the total success probability and the total fidelity are deduced. By applying the proposed scheme to the protection of two-qubit entangled states, it is demonstrated that post-weak measurement operators are not necessary sometimes because of the particular structure of two-qubit entangled states. Furthermore, two numerical simulations are designed to enhance the concurrence of two-qubit entangled states and improve the average fidelity of the standard quantum teleportation in a noisy environment. Analytical formulas of the improvement of concurrence and the average teleportation fidelity are deduced, and the superiority of the proposed scheme is highlighted in comparison with unprotected scenarios.

TI Non-Hermitian topology in monitored quantum circuits
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB We demonstrate that genuinely non-Hermitian topological phases and corresponding topological phase tran-sitions can be naturally realized in monitored quantum circuits, exemplified by the paradigmatic non-Hermitian Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model. We emulate this model by a 1D chain of spinless electrons evolving under unitary dynamics and subject to periodic measurements that are stochastically invoked. The non-Hermitian topology is visible in topological invariants adapted to the context of monitored circuits. For instance, the topological phase diagram of the monitored realization of the non-Hermitian Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model is obtained from the biorthogonal polarization computed from an effective Hamiltonian of the monitored system. Importantly, our monitored circuit realization allows direct access to steady-state biorthogonal expectation values of generic observables, and hence, to measure physical properties of a genuine non-Hermitian model. We expect our results to be applicable more generally to a wide range of models that host non-Hermitian topological phases.

TI Quantum computation of phase transition in the massive Schwinger model
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB As pointed out by Coleman, physical quantities in the Schwinger model depend on a parameter theta that determines the background electric field. There is a phase transition for theta = pi only. We develop a momentum space formalism on a lattice and use it to perform a quantum computation of the critical point of this phase transition on the NISQ device IMB Q Lima. After error mitigation, our results give strong indication of the existence of a critical point at m/e similar or equal to 0.32, where m is the bare fermion mass and e is the coupling strength, in good agreement with the classical numerical result m/e similar or equal to 0.3335.

TI Quantum Darwinism in a Composite System: Objectivity versus Classicality
SO ENTROPY
AB We investigate the implications of quantum Darwinism in a composite quantum system with interacting constituents exhibiting a decoherence-free subspace. We consider a two-qubit system coupled to an N-qubit environment via a dephasing interaction. For excitation preserving interactions between the system qubits, an analytical expression for the dynamics is obtained. It demonstrates that part of the system Hilbert space redundantly proliferates its information to the environment, while the remaining subspace is decoupled and preserves clear non-classical signatures. For measurements performed on the system, we establish that a non-zero quantum discord is shared between the composite system and the environment, thus violating the conditions of strong Darwinism. However, due to the asymmetry of quantum discord, the information shared with the environment is completely classical for measurements performed on the environment. Our results imply a dichotomy between objectivity and classicality that emerges when considering composite systems.

TI QUASIM: Quantum Computing Enhanced Service Ecosystem for Simulation in

AB Quantum computing (QC) and machine learning (ML), taken individually or combined into quantum-assisted ML (QML), are ascending computing paradigms whose calculations come with huge potential for speedup, increase in precision, and resource reductions. Likely improvements for numerical simulations in engineering imply the possibility of a strong economic impact on the manufacturing industry. In this project report, we propose a framework for a quantum computing-enhanced service ecosystem for simulation in manufacturing, consisting of various layers ranging from hardware to algorithms to service and organizational layers. In addition, we give insight into the current state of the art of applications research based on QC and QML, both from a scientific and an industrial point of view. We further analyze two high-value use cases with the aim of a quantitative evaluation of these new computing paradigms for industrially relevant settings.

TI Deterministic distribution of multipartite entanglement in a quantum
   network by continuous-variable polarization states
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Quantum network plays a vitally important role in the practical application of quantum information, which requires the deterministic entanglement distribution among multiple remote users. Here, we propose a feasible scheme to deterministically distribute quadripartite entanglement by continuous-variable (CV) polarization states. The quantum server prepares the quadripartite CV polarization entanglement and distributes them to four remote users via optical fiber. In this way, the measurement of CV polarization entanglement is local oscillation free, which makes the long distance entanglement distribution in commercial optical fiber communication networks possible. Furthermore, both the Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger-like (GHZ-like) and cluster-like polarization entangled states can be distributed among four users by controlling the beam splitter network in quantum server, which are confirmed by the extended criteria for polarization entanglement of multipartite optical modes. The protocol provides the direct reference for experimental implementation and can be directly extended to quantum network with more users, which is essential for a metropolitan quantum network.

However, executing quantum algorithms of practical computational advantage requires further improvements in the fidelities of qubit operations, which are currently limited by the energy relaxation and dephasing times of the qubits. Here, we report our measurement results of a high-coherence transmon qubit with energy relaxation and echo dephasing times surpassing those in the existing literature. We measure a qubit frequency of 2.9 GHz, an energy relaxation time T1 with a median of 425 mu s and a maximum of (666 +/- 33)mu s, and an echo dephasing time T2echo\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$${T}_{2}<^>{{{{\rm{echo}}}}}$$\end{document} with a median of 541 mu s and a maximum of (1057 +/- 138)mu s.

TI Exploring the landscape of post quantum cryptography: a bibliometric
   analysis of emerging trends and research impact
SO JOURNAL OF BIG DATA
AB With the emergence of quantum computers, classical cryptography is facing significant challenges. Address this compelling problem, it is the need of hour to develop Post Quantum cryptography (PQC), or quantum-resistant cryptography. PQC is a rapidly evolving field in computer science. The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) posted a call for inviting new generation of PQC algorithms. This paper aims to explore the significance and relevance of PQC in the future. Performing bibliometric analysis is important for gathering the necessary information about this discipline. Performance analysis and science mapping are done to extract valuable insights from the dataset. The dataset includes 14,230 records extracted from the Scopus database. The analysis is done using qualitative as well as quantitative approaches. The quantity approach focuses on the number of publications and document type analysis of the publications, while the quality approach includes the citation analysis of research publications. Bibliographic coupling is also carried out to understand the relationship in a visualisation format between authors, documents, sources, and countries. After performing the analysis, it has been observed that China has made the most significant contribution to the field of PQC. Additionally, the most highly cited author identified is Nicolas Gisin from the University of Geneva. This study provides valuable insights into prominent keywords, emerging trends and key research areas within the PQC domain, offering a comprehensive overview of the current research landscape.

TI Enabling continuous deployment techniques for quantum services
SO SOFTWARE-PRACTICE & EXPERIENCE
AB Early advances in quantum computing have provided new opportunities to tackle intricate problems in diverse areas such as cryptography, optimization, and simulation. However, current methodologies employed in quantum computing often require, among other things, a broad understanding of quantum hardware and low-level programming languages, posing challenges to software developers in effectively creating and implementing quantum services. This study advocates the adoption of software engineering principles in quantum computing, thereby establishing a higher level of hardware abstraction that allows developers to focus on application development. With this proposal, developers can design and deploy quantum services with less effort, which is similar to the facilitation provided by service-oriented computing for the development of conventional software services. This study introduces a continuous deployment strategy adapted to the development of quantum services that covers the creation and deployment of such services. For this purpose, an extension of the OpenAPI specification is proposed, which allows the generation of services that implement quantum algorithms. The proposal was validated through the creation of an application programming interface with diverse quantum algorithm implementations and evaluated through a survey of various developers and students who were introduced to the tool with positive results.

TI Universal Quantum Computation in Globally Driven Rydberg Atom Arrays
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB We develop a model for quantum computation with Rydberg atom arrays, which only relies on global driving, without the need of local addressing of the qubits: any circuit is executed by a sequence of global, resonant laser pulses on a static atomic arrangement. We present two constructions: for the first, the circuit is imprinted in the trap positions of the atoms and executed by the pulses; for the second, the atom arrangement is circuit-independent, and the algorithm is entirely encoded in the global driving sequence. Our results show in particular that a quadratic overhead in atom number is sufficient to eliminate the need for local control to realize a universal quantum processor. We give explicit protocols for all steps of an arbitrary quantum computation, and discuss strategies for error suppression specific to our model. Our scheme is based on dual-species processors with atoms subjected to Rydberg blockade constraints, but it might be transposed to other setups as well.

TI Bohmian Chaos and Entanglement in a Two-Qubit System
SO ENTROPY
AB We study in detail the critical points of Bohmian flow, both in the inertial frame of reference (Y-points) and in the frames centered at the moving nodal points of the guiding wavefunction (X-points), and analyze their role in the onset of chaos in a system of two entangled qubits. We find the distances between these critical points and a moving Bohmian particle at varying levels of entanglement, with particular emphasis on the times at which chaos arises. Then, we find why some trajectories are ordered, without any chaos. Finally, we examine numerically how the Lyapunov Characteristic Number (LCN) depends on the degree of quantum entanglement. Our results indicate that increasing entanglement reduces the convergence time of the finite-time LCN of the chaotic trajectories toward its final positive value.

TI Experimental Mode-Pairing Quantum Key Distribution Surpassing the
   Repeaterless Bound
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW X
AB Quantum key distribution (QKD) provides information-theoretic security for communication. The mode-pairing (MP) protocol emerges as a promising solution for long-distance QKD by eliminating the need for a global phase reference while maintaining the repeaterlike rate-loss scaling. Recent implementations have demonstrated its potential, but they either rely on costly ultrastable lasers or struggle with phase fluctuations from commercial lasers, particularly over long distances. As a result, surpassing the repeaterless bound with a practical system remains a challenge. In this work, we demonstrate a practical high-performance MP-QKD system using commercial lasers. To address phase fluctuations, we propose a frequency-tracking scheme based on fast Fourier transformation, enabling us to extend the pairing length to 2 x 105 pulses (160 mu s). We propose a model to carefully analyze the phase noise and optimize the system parameters. Our system achieves an optimal secret key rate of 47.8 bit=s over 403 km of standard fiber (76.5 dB loss), exceeding the repeaterless bound by a factor of 2.92. Furthermore, we compare MP-QKD and twin-field QKD under various practical conditions and clarify the distinct application scenarios of the two protocols. These results confirm the feasibility of MP-QKD using cost-effective commercial technologies, paving the way for scalable quantum communication networks.

TI The effect of quantum noise on algorithmic perfect quantum state
   transfer on NISQ processors
SO QUANTUM INFORMATION PROCESSING
AB Quantum walks are an analog of classical random walks in quantum systems. Quantum walks have smaller hitting times compared to classical random walks on certain types of graphs, leading to a quantum advantage of quantum-walks-based algorithms. An important feature of quantum walks is that they are accompanied by the excitation transfer from one site to another, and a moment of hitting the destination site is characterized by the maximum probability amplitude of observing the excitation on this site. It is therefore prospective to consider such problems as candidates for quantum advantage demonstration, since gate errors can smear out a peak in the transfer probability as a function of time, nevertheless leaving it distinguishable. We investigate the influence of quantum noise on hitting time and fidelity of a typical quantum walk problem-a perfect state transfer (PST) over a qubit chain. We simulate dynamics of a single excitation over the chain of qubits in the presence of typical noises of a quantum processor (homogeneous and inhomogeneous Pauli noise, crosstalk noise, thermal relaxation, and dephasing noise). We find that Pauli noise mostly smears out a peak in the fidelity of excitation transfer, while crosstalks between qubits mostly affect the hitting time. Knowledge about these noise patterns allows us to propose an error mitigation procedure, which we use to refine the results of running the PST on a simulator of a noisy quantum processor.

TI Characterizing non-Markovian and coherent errors in quantum simulation
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Quantum simulation of many-body systems, particularly using ultracold atoms and trapped ions, presents a unique form of quantum control-it is a direct implementation of a multi-qubit gate generated by the Hamiltonian. As a consequence, it also faces a unique challenge in terms of benchmarking, because the well-established gate benchmarking techniques are unsuitable for this form of quantum control. Here we show that the symmetries of the target many-body Hamiltonian can be used not only to benchmark but to characterize experimental errors in the quantum simulation. We use our results to develop protocols to characterize these errors, which can be implemented using state-of-the-art technology. We consider two forms of errors: (i) unitary errors arising out of systematic errors in the applied Hamiltonian and (ii) canonical non-Markovian errors arising out of random shot-to-shot fluctuations in the applied Hamiltonian. We show that the dynamics of the expectation value of the target Hamiltonian itself, which is ideally constant in time, can be used to characterize these errors. In the presence of errors, the expectation value of the target Hamiltonian shows a characteristic thermalization dynamics, when it satisfies the operator thermalization hypothesis (OTH). That is, an oscillation in the short time followed by relaxation to a steady-state value in the long time limit. We show that while the steady-state value can be used to characterize the coherent errors, the amplitude of the oscillations can be used to estimate the non-Markovian errors. We prove a sandwich theorem to establish a linear relation between the amplitude of the oscillations and the magnitude of the non-Markovian errors. Moreover, by varying the initial state, we show that the steady state values can be used to completely construct the generator of the coherent errors. Using these results, we develop two experimental protocols to characterize the unitary errors based on these results, one of which requires single-qubit addressing and the other one doesn't. We also develop a protocol to characterize non-Markovian errors.

TI Dynamic Quantum Key Distribution for Microgrids With Distributed Error
   Correction
SO IET QUANTUM COMMUNICATION
AB Quantum key distribution (QKD) has often been hailed as a reliable technology for secure communication in cyber-physical microgrids. Even though unauthorised key measurements are not possible in QKD, attempts to read them can disturb quantum states leading to mutations in the transmitted value. Further, inaccurate quantum keys can lead to erroneous decryption producing garbage values, destabilising microgrid operation. QKD can also be vulnerable to node-level manipulations incorporating attack values into measurements before they are encrypted at the communication layer. To address these issues, this paper proposes a secure QKD protocol that can identify errors in keys and/or nodal measurements by observing violations in control dynamics. Additionally, the protocol uses a dynamic adjacency matrix-based formulation strategy enabling the affected nodes to reconstruct a trustworthy signal and replace it with the attacked signal in a multi-hop manner. This enables microgrids to perform nominal operations in the presence of adversaries who try to eavesdrop on the system causing an increase in the quantum bit error rate (QBER). We provide several case studies to showcase the robustness of the proposed strategy against eavesdroppers and node manipulations. The results demonstrate that it can resist unwanted observation and attack vectors that manipulate signals before encryption.

TI Ising Hamiltonian minimization: Gain-based computing with manifold
   reduction of soft spins vs quantum annealing
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB We investigate the minimization of Ising Hamiltonians, comparing the performance of gain-based computing paradigms based on the dynamics of semiclassical soft-spin models with quantum annealing. We systematically analyze how the energy landscape for the circulant couplings of a M & ouml;bius graph evolves with increased annealing parameters. Our findings indicate that these semiclassical models face challenges due to a widening dimensionality landscape. To counteract this issue, we introduce the manifold reduction method, which restricts the soft-spin amplitudes to a defined phase space region. Concurrently, quantum annealing demonstrates a natural capability to navigate the Ising Hamiltonian's energy landscape due to its operation within the comprehensive Hilbert space. Our study indicates that physics-inspired or physics-enhanced optimizers will likely benefit from combining classical and quantum annealing techniques.

TI How to experimentally evaluate the adiabatic condition for quantum
   annealing
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB We propose an experimental method for evaluating the adiabatic condition during quantum annealing (QA), which will be essential for solving practical problems. The adiabatic condition consists of the transition matrix element and the energy gap, and our method simultaneously provides information about these components without diagonalizing the Hamiltonian. The key idea is to measure the power spectrum of a time domain signal by adding an oscillating field during QA, and we can estimate the values of the transition matrix element and energy gap from the measurement output. Our results provides a powerful experimental basis for analyzing the performance of QA.

TI Procrustean entanglement concentration in quantum-classical networking
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB The success of a future quantum internet will rest in part on the ability of quantum and classical signals to coexist in the same optical fiber infrastructure, a challenging endeavor given the orders of magnitude differences in flux of single-photon-level quantum fields and bright classical traffic. We theoretically describe and experimentally implement Procrustean entanglement concentration for polarization-entangled states contaminated with classical light, showing significant mitigation of crosstalk noise in dense wavelengthdivision multiplexing. Our approach leverages a pair of polarization-dependent loss emulators to attenuate highly polarized crosstalk that results from imperfect isolation of conventional signals copropagating on shared fiber links. We demonstrate our technique both on the tabletop and over a deployed quantum local area network, finding a substantial improvement of two-qubit entangled state fidelity from approximately 75% to over 92%. This local filtering technique could be used as a preliminary step to reduce asymmetric errors, potentially improving the overall efficiency when combined with more complex error-mitigation techniques in future quantum repeater networks.

TI Strength of the non-locality of two-qubit entangled states and its
   applications
SO PHYSICA SCRIPTA
AB Non-locality is a feature of quantum mechanics that cannot be explained by local realistic theory. It can be detected by the violation of Bell's inequality. In this work, we have considered the evaluation of Bell's inequality with the help of the XOR game. In the XOR game, a two-qubit entangled state is shared between the two distant players. It may generate a non-local correlation between the players which contributes to the maximum probability of winning of the game. We have aimed to determine the strength of the non-locality through XOR game. Thus, we have defined a quantity S ( NL ) called the strength of non-locality, purely on the basis of the maximum probability of winning of the XOR game. We have also derived the relation between the introduced quantity S ( NL ) and the quantity M introduced in [R Horodecki, P Horodecki, and M Horodecki, (1995) Phys. Lett. A 200, 340.], to study the non-locality of a two-qubit entangled state problem in depth. The quantity M may be defined as the sum of the two largest eigenvalues of the correlation matrix of the given entangled state and it determines whether the given entangled state under probe is non-local. Further, we have explored the non-locality of any two-qubit entangled state, whose non-locality cannot be detected by the CHSH inequality. Interestingly, we have found that the newly defined quantity S ( NL ) fails to detect non-locality for the entangled state, when the witness operator corresponding to CHSH operator cannot detect the entangled state. To overcome this problem, we have modified the definition of the strength of non-locality and have shown that the modified definition may detect the non-locality of such entangled states, which were earlier undetected by S ( NL ). Furthermore, we have provided two applications of the strength S ( NL ) of the non-locality such as (i) establishment of a link between the two-qubit non-locality determined by S ( NL ) and the three-qubit non-locality determined by the Svetlichny operator and (ii) determination of the upper bound of the power of the controller in terms of S ( NL ) in controlled quantum teleportation.

TI Deep Space Network Scheduling Using Quantum Annealing
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM ENGINEERING
AB The National Aeronautics and Space Administration's (NASA) Deep Space Network (DSN) is responsible for communication and navigation for several NASA and international missions. The DSN comprises three complexes located in Goldstone (California, USA), Cambera (Australia), and Madrid (Spain). This distribution in longitude guarantees a full sky coverage. Each complex has one 70-m and several 34-m antennas. The network routinely serves a few dozen missions. The scheduling of the DSN is complex and involves human interventions as well as automated solutions. In order to increase the level of automation, different computing paradigms have been explored. In this article, we report on the quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) formulation of the DSN scheduling, as well as a custom classical solver designed around some of the unique features of this scheduling problem. Thanks to a hybrid framework that extends the size of the problems that can be solved with a quantum annealer, we are able to generate a schedule from the QUBO formulation of the problem for one week's worth of user antenna requests, which represents the time period scheduled during operation. In other words, this work describes a real-world application of quantum annealing using real-world, operational data. We compare the resulting schedules' quality to solutions obtained using a mixed-integer linear programming formulation on a commercial solver. Our custom solver, based on a quantum-inspired optimization technique called substochatic Monte Carlo, while much faster in generating schedules, could only treat a subset of requests, and hence, we report its results independently.

TI Anisotropy with respect to the applied magnetic field of spin qubit
   decoherence times
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Electron spin qubits are a promising platform for quantum computation. Environmental noise impedes coherent operations by limiting the qubit relaxation (T-1) and dephasing (T-phi) times. There are multiple sources of such noise, which makes it important to devise experimental techniques that can detect the spatial locations of these sources and determine the type of source. In this paper, we propose that anisotropy in T-1 and T-phi with respect to the direction of the applied magnetic field can reveal much about these aspects of the noise. We investigate the anisotropy patterns of charge noise, evanescent-wave Johnson noise, and hyperfine noise in hypothetical devices. It is necessary to have a rather well-characterized sample to get the maximum benefit from this technique. The general anisotropy patterns are elucidated. We calculate the expected anisotropy for a particular model of a Si/SiGe quantum dot device.

TI Characterization of broadband Purcell filters with compact footprint for
   fast multiplexed superconducting qubit readout
SO APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS
AB Engineering the admittance of external environments connected to superconducting qubits is essential, as increasing the measurement speed introduces spontaneous emission loss to superconducting qubits, known as Purcell loss. Here, we report a broadband Purcell filter within a small footprint, which effectively suppresses Purcell loss without losing the fast measurement speed. We characterize the filter's frequency response at 4.3 K and also estimate Purcell loss suppression by finite-element-method simulations of superconducting planar circuit layouts with the proposed filter design. The filter is fabricated with 200 nm-thick niobium films and shows the measured bandwidth over 790 MHz within 0.29 mm(2) of compact size owing to densely packed spiral resonators. The estimated lifetime enhancement indicates the effective protection of the qubit from Purcell loss. The presented filter design is expected to be easily integrated on existing superconducting quantum circuits for fast and multiplexed readout without occupying large footprint.

TI Continuous-variable quantum key distribution based on peak-compensation
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB Continuous-variable quantum key distribution (CVQKD) is an important application of quantum technology, which enables long-distance communicating parties to establish a string of unconditionally secure keys in an insecure environment. However, in a practical CVQKD system, the finite sampling bandwidth of the analog-to-digital converter (ADC) at the receiver may create inaccurate sampling results, leading to errors in parameter estimation process and leaving a security loophole for eavesdroppers. In order to eliminate the finite sampling bandwidth effect, we propose a peak-compensation-based CVQKD scheme, which estimates the discrepancy between the maximum sampling value and the peak value of each pulse based on the characteristics of Gaussian pulse. The maximum sampling values are compensated by the estimated discrepancy, so that the legitimate parties can obtain correct sampling results. We analyze the influence of the finite sampling bandwidth on the security of the system, expounding the specific steps of peak-compensation, comparing the estimated excess noise before and after peak-compensation, and discussing the security of the system under Gaussian collective attacks. Simulation results show that this scheme can greatly improve the accuracy of pulse peak sampling and remove the finite sampling bandwidth effect. Moreover, the channel parameters estimated by the communicating parties are also corrected by using the compensated values. Compared with the scheme without peak-compensation, this scheme eliminates the limitation of the system repetition to the secret key bit rate, and has longer secure transmission distance and higher secret key bit rate. In addition, compared with other methods of solving the finite sampling bandwidth effect, the proposed scheme can be directly implemented in data processing stage after sampling without any additional devices, and thus increasing no complexity of the system.

In superconducting qubit architectures, tunable buses have been explored as a means to higher-fidelity gates. However, these buses introduce new pathways for leakage. Here we present a modified tunable bus architecture appropriate for fixed-frequency qubits in which the adiabaticity restrictions on gate speed are reduced. We characterize this coupler on a range of 2-qubit devices, achieving a maximum gate fidelity of 99.85%. We further show the calibration is stable over one day.

AB On superconducting architectures, the state of a qubit is manipulated by using microwave pulses. Typically, the pulses are stored in the waveform memory and then streamed to the Digital-to-Analog Converter (DAC) to synthesize the gate operations. The waveform memory requires tens of Gigabytes per second of bandwidth to manipulate the qubit. Unfortunately, the required memory bandwidth grows linearly with the number of qubits. As a result, the bandwidth demand limits the number of qubits we can control concurrently. For example, on current RFSoCs-based qubit control platforms, we can control less than 40 qubits. In addition, the high memory bandwidth for cryogenic ASIC controllers designed to operate within a tight power budget translates to significant power dissipation, thus limiting scalability.
   In this paper, we show that waveforms are highly compressible, and we leverage this property to enable a scalable and efficient microarchitecture COMPAQT - Compressed Waveform Memory Architecture for Qubit Control. Waveform memory is read-only and COMPAQT leverages this to compress waveforms at compile time and store the compressed waveform in the on-chip memory. To generate the pulse, COMPAQT decompresses the waveform at runtime and then streams the decompressed waveform to the DACs. Using the hardware-efficient discrete cosine transform, COMPAQT can achieve, on average, 5x increase in the waveform memory bandwidth, which can enable 5x increase in the total number of qubits controlled in an RFSoC setup. Moreover, COMPAQT microarchitecture for cryogenic CMOS ASIC controllers can result in a 23x power reduction over uncompressed baseline. We also propose an adaptive compression scheme to further reduce the power consumed by the decompression engine, enabling up to 4x power reduction.
   Qubits are sensitive, and even a slight change in the control waveform can increase the gate error rate. We evaluate the impact of COMPAQT on the gate and circuit fidelity using IBM quantum computers. We see less than 0.1% degradation in fidelity when using COMPAQT.

TI Trade-off relations between two-qubit coherence and intrinsic
   concurrence for Heisenberg XYZ states induced by intrinsic decoherence
   model
SO ALEXANDRIA ENGINEERING JOURNAL
AB This work investigates the trade-off relations between intrinsic concurrence, concurrence, first-order coherence, and total purity for generated two-qubit Heisenberg XYZ states due to spin-spin interactions supported by spin-orbit interactions in the x and y directions with an external inhomogeneous magnetic field in the x direction by using the Milburn model of intrinsic decoherence. We apply the complementary trade-off relations between quantum resource quantifiers when the two-spin Heisenberg XYZ interactions start with a maximally pure state (l1A)(R) l1B)) and a maximally entangled state (,12 [l1A)(R) l1B) + l0A)(R) l0B)]). The results of the trade-off relations provide a reliable theoretical basis for the mutual transformation between quantum resource quantifiers. It is shown that the spin-spin-Heisenberg XYZ and x, y-spin-orbit interactions have a high capability to generate entanglement and degrade coherence with oscillatory evolutions. The amplitudes and frequencies of the oscillations of the information resources depend on the increase of the applied external inhomogeneous magnetic field, the spin-orbit interactions, and the intrinsic two-spin decoherence. It is found that the stationary quantum information resources generated by intrinsic decoherence depend on the spin-spin, spin-orbit interactions as well as on the applied external inhomogeneous magnetic field in the x-direction.

TI Hong-Ou-Mandel interferometry and quantum metrology with multimode
   frequency-bin entangled photons
SO APL PHOTONICS
AB Quantum entanglement is a vital resource in quantum information processing. High-dimensional quantum entanglement offers advantages that classical systems cannot surpass, particularly in enhancing channel capacity, improving system noise resilience, and increasing sensitivity to external environments. The construction of multimode entanglement in the spectral domain is well-suited for fiber-optic systems. Here, we present a straightforward scheme for generating multimode frequency-bin entanglement using a semiconductor chip through a simple mode conversion. A general model for Hong-Ou-Mandel (HOM) interference with a multimode frequency-bin entangled state is presented and applied to the experiments. The multimode entangled photons we produced exhibit HOM interference with a high-visibility beating pattern, demonstrating a strong relationship with the mode number, mode spacing, and the profile of the single mode. Building on the Fisher information analysis, we explore the relationship between the features in multimode entangled state interference traces and the precision of interferometric measurements even in the presence of experimental nonidealities. This work may deepen the understanding of multimode frequency-bin entanglement and advance the application of multimode HOM interference in quantum sensing.

TI Optical frequency generation using fiber Bragg grating filters for
   applications in portable quantum sensing
SO OPTICS LETTERS
AB A method for the agile generation of the optical frequencies required for laser cooling and atom interferometry of rubidium is demonstrated. It relies on fiber Bragg grating technology to filter the output of an electro-optic modulator and was demonstrated in an alignment-free, single-seed, frequency-doubled fiber laser system. The system was capable of frequency switching over a 30 GHz range in less than 40 ns, with similar to 0.5W output power and amplitude modulation with a similar to 15 ns rise/fall time and an extinction ratio exceeding 80 dB. The technology is ideal for enabling highbandwidth, mobile industrial, and space applications of quantum technologies.

TI Efficient Preparation of Solvable Anyons with Adaptive Quantum Circuits
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW X
AB The classification of topological phases of matter is a fundamental challenge in quantum many-body physics, with applications to quantum technology. Recently, this classification has been extended to the setting of adaptive finite-depth local unitary (AFDLU) circuits, which allow global classical communication. In this setting, the trivial phase is the collection of all topological states that can be prepared via AFDLU. Here, we propose a complete classification of the trivial phase by showing how to prepare all solvable anyon theories that admit a gapped boundary via AFDLU, extending recent results on solvable groups. Our construction includes non-Abelian anyons with irrational quantum dimensions, such as Ising anyons, and more general acyclic anyons. Specifically, we introduce a sequential gauging procedure, with an AFDLU implementation, to produce a string-net ground state in any topological phase described by a solvable anyon theory with gapped boundary. In addition, we introduce a sequential ungauging and regauging procedure, with an AFDLU implementation, to apply string operators of arbitrary length for anyons and symmetry twist defects in solvable any on theories. We apply our procedure to the quantum double of the group S3 and to several examples that are beyond solvable groups, including the doubled Ising theory, the Z3Tambara-Yamagami string net, and doubled SU(2)4 anyons.

TI A survey on non-terrestrial quantum networking: Challenges and trends
SO COMPUTER NETWORKS
AB Satellites and aerial platforms can be significant in the development of new telecommunications networks, allowing to deploy networks with extremely high performance even in remote areas. Recently, considering the development of quantum communication technologies, many studies are concentrated on Free Space Optic (FSO) Non-Terrestrial links, also considering that the studies performed so far on Optical Fibers (OFs) have not pointed out significant results, especially in terms of coverage. Moreover, the decrease of launch costs and the use of new satellite technologies such as CubeSats make the deployment of satellite constellations affordable. Thanks to the deployment of Non-Terrestrial Quantum Networks (NTQNs), the novel services offered by the Quantum Internet (QI) could be made easily accessible to all. In particular, Quantum Computers (QCs) can perform beyond the capabilities of any classical processor, and the interconnection of these devices on a global scale makes it possible to achieve extremely high computational capabilities, thus opening the way to new applications, such as Quantum Cloud (QCloud). Therefore, the recent studies in this area motivate this survey, which in addition to providing some base concept of quantum information, describes the current technologies needed to create quantum NT backbones. Specifically, this survey examines some studies over the period 2010-2023, which are related to the realization of quantum communications using satellites and other aerial platforms such as High Altitude Platforms (HAPS) and quantum drones. Some of the architectures that are described in this survey make use of the Software-Defined Networking (SDN) paradigm, which can be envisaged as a key enabler for the management of heterogeneous QNs in general. Furthermore, through the description of various experiments, the paper shows the applications that can be enabled by the future quantum NT backbones. In particular, in addition to improving the security of current systems through the Quantum Key Distribution (QKD), it could be possible to interconnect clusters of QCs over long distances and create extremely reliable positioning systems. Finally, the paper outlines some possible future developments.

TI Quantum Orbital Minimization Method for Excited States Calculation on a
   Quantum Computer
SO JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL THEORY AND COMPUTATION
AB We propose a quantum-classical hybrid variational algorithm, the quantum orbital minimization method (qOMM), for obtaining the ground state and low-lying excited states of a Hermitian operator. Given parametrized ansatz circuits representing eigenstates, qOMM implements quantum circuits to represent the objective function in the orbital minimization method and adopts a classical optimizer to minimize the objective function with respect to the parameters in ansatz circuits. The objective function has an orthogonality constraint implicitly embedded, which allows qOMM to apply a different ansatz circuit to each input reference state. We carry out numerical simulations that seek to find excited states of H-2, LiH, and a toy model consisting of four hydrogen atoms arranged in a square lattice in the STO-3G basis with UCCSD ansatz circuits. Comparing the numerical results with existing excited states methods, qOMM is less prone to getting stuck in local minima and can achieve convergence with more shallow ansatz circuits.

TI Postselection Technique for Optical Quantum Key Distribution with
   Improved de Finetti Reductions
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB The postselection technique is an important proof technique for proving the security of quantum key distribution protocols against coherent attacks via the uplift of any security proof against independent identically distributed collective attacks. In this work, we go through multiple steps to rigorously apply the postselection technique to optical quantum key distribution protocols. First, we place the postselection technique on a rigorous mathematical foundation by fixing a technical flaw in the original postselection paper. Second, we extend the applicability of the postselection technique to prepare-and-measure protocols by using a de Finetti reduction with a fixed marginal. Third, we show how the postselection technique can be used for decoy-state protocols by tagging the source. Finally, we extend the applicability of the postselection technique to realistic optical setups by developing a new variant of the flag-state squasher. We also improve existing de Finetti reductions, which reduce the effect of using the postselection technique on the key rate. These improvements can be more generally applied to other quantum information processing tasks. As an example to demonstrate the applicability of our work, we apply our results to the time-bin-encoded three-state protocol. We observe that the postselection technique performs better than all other known proof techniques against coherent attacks.

TI Generation of polarization entanglement via the quantum Zeno effect
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB The quantum Zeno effect reveals that continuous observation of a quantum system can significantly alter its evolution. Here, we present a method for establishing polarization entanglement between two initially unentangled photons in coupled waveguides via the quantum Zeno effect. We support our analytical investigation with numerical simulations of the underlying Schrodinger equation describing the system. Further, we extend our technique to three coupled waveguides in a planar configuration and determine the parameters required to generate three-qubit W-states. In contrast to existing schemes based on a vacuum and single-photon encoding, the polarization encoding in our approach is compatible with quantum information protocols that remove photon loss through post-selection. Our findings offer a powerful quantum state engineering approach for photonic quantum information technologies.

AB In this paper, we provide a system level perspective on the design of control electronics for large scale quantum systems. Quantum computing systems with high-fidelity control and readout, coherent coupling, calibrated gates, and reconfigurable circuits with low error rates are expected to have superior quantum volumes. Cryogenic CMOS plays a crucial role in the realization of scalable quantum computers, by minimizing the feature size, lowering the cost, power consumption, and implementing low latency error correction. Our approach toward achieving scalable feed-back based control systems includes the design of memory based arbitrary waveform generators (AWG's), wide band radio frequency analog to digital converters, integrated amplifier chain, and state discriminators that can be synchronized with gate sequences. Digitally assisted designs, when implemented in an advanced CMOS node such as 7 nm can reap the benefits of low power due to scaling. A qubit readout chain demands several amplification stages before the digitizer. We propose the co-integration of our in-house developed InP HEMT LNAs with CMOS LNA stages to achieve the required gain at the digitizer input with minimal area. Our approach using high impedance matching between the HEMT LNA and the cryogenic CMOS receiver can relax the design constraints of an inverter-based CMOS LNA, paving the way toward a fully integrated qubit readout chain. The qubit state discriminator consists of a digital signal processor that computes the qubit state from the digitizer output and a pre-determined threshold. The proposed system realizes feedback-based optimal control for error mitigation and reduction of the required data rate through the serial interface to room temperature electronics.

TI Probing Quantum Anomalous Heat Flow Using Mid-Circuit Measurements
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB Gate-based quantum computers are an innovative tool for experimentally studying the core principles of quantum mechanics. This work presents the first observation of quantum anomalous heat flow between two qubits and investigates the role of mid-circuit measurements in this context. Using mid-circuit measurements, we designed quantum circuits that violate the semi-classical heat flow bound, witnessing negativities in the underlying Kirkwood-Dirac quasiprobability distribution, which indicates the presence of quantum correlations between the subsystems. Mid-circuit measurements, crucial for probing qubits during the experiment, enabled these observations but also introduced disturbances, such as energy leakage, leading to deviations from theoretical predictions. These noise effects were modeled, providing insight into the limitations of current mid-circuit measurement techniques.

TI Transmit and Receive Diversity in MIMO Quantum Communication for
   High-Fidelity Video Transmission
SO ALGORITHMS
AB Reliable transmission of high-quality video over wireless channels is challenged by fading and noise, which degrade visual quality and disrupt temporal continuity. To address these issues, this paper proposes a quantum communication framework that integrates quantum superposition with multi-input multi-output (MIMO) spatial diversity techniques to enhance robustness and efficiency in dynamic video transmission. The proposed method converts compressed videos into classical bitstreams, which are then channel-encoded and quantum-encoded into qubit superposition states. These states are transmitted over a 2x2 MIMO system employing varied diversity schemes to mitigate the effects of multipath fading and noise. At the receiver, a quantum decoder reconstructs the classical information, followed by channel decoding to retrieve the video data, and the source decoder reconstructs the final video. Simulation results demonstrate that the quantum MIMO system significantly outperforms equivalent-bandwidth classical MIMO frameworks across diverse signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions, achieving a peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) up to 39.12 dB, structural similarity index (SSIM) up to 0.9471, and video multi-method assessment fusion (VMAF) up to 92.47, with improved error resilience across various group of picture (GOP) formats, highlighting the potential of quantum MIMO communication for enhancing the reliability and quality of video delivery in next-generation wireless networks.

TI Coherence Trapping in Open Two-Qubit Dynamics
SO SYMMETRY-BASEL
AB In this manuscript, we examine the dynamical behavior of the coherence in open quantum systems using the l1 norm. We consider a two-qubit system that evolves in the framework of Kossakowski-type quantum dynamical semigroups (KTQDSs) of completely positive maps (CPMs). We find that the quantum coherence can be asymptotically maintained with respect to the values of the system parameters. Moreover, we show that the quantum coherence can resist the effect of the environment and preserve even in the regime of long times. The obtained results also show that the initially separable states can provide a finite value of the coherence during the time evolution. Because of such properties, several states in this type of environments are good candidates for incorporating quantum information and optics (QIO) schemes. Finally, we compare the dynamical behavior of the coherence with the entire quantum correlation.

TI Efficient Simulation of Open Quantum Systems on NISQ Trapped-Ion
   Hardware
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB Simulating open quantum systems, which interact with external environments, presents significant challenges on noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices due to limited qubit resources and noise. In this study, an efficient framework is proposed for simulating open quantum systems on NISQ hardware by leveraging a time-perturbative Kraus operator representation of the system's dynamics. This approach avoids the computationally expensive Trotterization method and exploits the Lindblad master equation to represent time evolution in a compact form, particularly for systems satisfying specific commutation relations. The efficiency of this method is demonstrated by simulating quantum channels, such as the continuous-time Pauli channel and damped harmonic oscillators, on NISQ trapped-ion hardware, including IonQ Harmony and Quantinuum H1-1. Additionally, hardware-agnostic error mitigation techniques are introduced, including Pauli channel fitting and quantum depolarizing channel inversion, to enhance the fidelity of quantum simulations. These results show strong agreement between the simulations on real quantum hardware and exact solutions, highlighting the potential of Kraus-based methods for scalable and accurate simulation of open quantum systems on NISQ devices. This framework opens pathways for simulating more complex systems under realistic conditions in the near term.

TI Pauli Error Propagation-Based Gate Rescheduling for Quantum Circuit
   Error Mitigation
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM ENGINEERING
AB Noisy intermediate-scale quantum algorithms, which run on noisy quantum computers, should be carefully designed to boost the output state fidelity. While several compilation approaches have been proposed to minimize circuit errors, they often omit the detailed circuit structure information that does not affect the circuit depth or the gate count. In the presence of spatial variation in the error rate of the quantum gates, adjusting the circuit structure can play a major role in mitigating errors. In this article, we exploit the freedom of gate reordering based on the commutation rules to show the impact of gate error propagation paths on the output state fidelity of the quantum circuit, propose advanced predictive techniques to project the success rate of the circuit, and develop a new compilation phase postquantum circuit mapping to improve its reliability. Our proposed approaches have been validated using a variety of quantum circuits with different success metrics, which are executed on IBM quantum computers. Our results show that rescheduling quantum gates based on their error propagation paths can significantly improve the fidelity of the quantum circuit in the presence of variable gate error rates.

Today, advances in quantum computer hardware and the design of simulation frameworks able to run quantum algorithms in classic computers make it possible to extend classic artificial intelligence models to a quantum environment. Despite these achievements, several questions regarding the whole quantum machine learning pipeline remain unanswered, for instance the problem of classical data representation on quantum hardware, or the methodologies for designing and evaluating quantum models for common learning tasks such as classification, function approximation, clustering, etc. These problems become even more difficult to solve in the case of Time Series processing, where the context of past historical data may influence the behavior of the decision-making model. In this piece of research, we address the problem of Time Series classification using quantum models, and propose an efficient and compact representation of time series in quantum data using amplitude embedding. The proposal is capable of representing a time series of length n in log(2)(n) computational units, and experiments conducted on benchmark time series classification problems show that quantum models designed for classification can also outperform the accuracy of classic methods.

TI A co-design framework of neural networks and quantum circuits towards
   quantum advantage
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Despite the pursuit of quantum advantages in various applications, the power of quantum computers in executing neural network has mostly remained unknown, primarily due to a missing tool that effectively designs a neural network suitable for quantum circuit. Here, we present a neural network and quantum circuit co-design framework, namely QuantumFlow, to address the issue. In QuantumFlow, we represent data as unitary matrices to exploit quantum power by encoding n=2(k) inputs into k qubits and representing data as random variables to seamlessly connect layers without measurement. Coupled with a novel algorithm, the cost complexity of the unitary matrices-based neural computation can be reduced from O(n) in classical computing to O(polylog(n)) in quantum computing. Results show that on MNIST dataset, QuantumFlow can achieve an accuracy of 94.09% with a cost reduction of 10.85xagainst the classical computer. All these results demonstrate the potential for QuantumFlow to achieve the quantum advantage. The advantages coming from involving quantum systems in machine learning are still not fully clear. Here, the authors propose a software/hardware co-design framework towards quantum-friendly neural networks showing quantum advantage, representing data as either random variables or numbers in unitary matrices.

TI Heuristics for Quantum Computing Dealing with 3-SAT

AB The SAT problem is maybe one of the most famous NP-complete problems. This paper deals with the 3-SAT problem. We follow a sort of incremental strategy to save computational costs with respect to the classical quantum computing approach. We present an heuristics that leads this strategy, improving the performance of the purely random incremental scheme. We finally validate our approach by means of a thorough empirical study.

TI Solving Multiple Discretization Portfolio Optimization Problem with
   Quantum-Classical Hybrid Algorithms
SO COMPUTATIONAL ECONOMICS
AB Portfolio optimization (PO) plays a central role in finance, encompassing both resource allocation and risk management. While numerous algorithms have been developed for continuous-variable PO, the inclusion of large, indivisible assets such as real estate transforms the task into a combinatorial optimization problem, which is NP-hard for classical computers. This study explores using quantum-classical hybrid algorithms for multi-discretized portfolio optimization, addressing the needs of real-world applications. We propose a flexible theoretical model that can solve PO problems with various types of discrete assets and constraints, which is compatible with both quantum and classical computing paradigms. Then, we use the D-Wave quantum processor and classical solver to determine optimal investment strategies. Experimental results indicate that the hybrid quantum algorithm outperforms both classical computing methods and quantum annealing algorithms in terms of return and risk management. This research enhances quantum computing applications in finance and provides insights into future algorithm design.

TI Understanding instance hardness for optimisation algorithms:
   Methodologies, open challenges and post-quantum implications
SO APPLIED MATHEMATICAL MODELLING
AB This paper reviews efforts to characterise the hardness of optimisation problem instances, and to develop improved methodologies for empirical testing of the strengths and weaknesses of algorithms, based on comprehensive and unbiased sets of test instances whose hardness can be understood. Using the Travelling Salesperson Problem (TSP) as an illustrative example throughout the paper, efforts during the 20th century to solve optimisation problems with both exact and heuristic algorithms are briefly reviewed. From the early 21st century however, with a growing number of available algorithms (from nature-inspired to quantum), the focus has naturally shifted to exploring how the characteristics of particular problem instances impact algorithm performance, and whether empirical testing is rigorous, unbiased, conclusive and trustworthy based on the choice of test instances. Instance Space Analysis (ISA) was pioneered by the author as a methodology to visualize explainable strengths and weaknesses of algorithms across the broadest set of test instances, and to scrutinize the diversity and suitability of test instances chosen for empirical testing of algorithms. The ISA methodology is reviewed and illustrated using the TSP to show how insights into instance hardness for particular algorithms can be obtained. The paper then turns attention to quantum algorithms for optimisation, and argues that key lessons learned about testing optimisation algorithms over recent decades are highly relevant to current efforts to explore quantum advantage for optimisation. The implications of these lessons for quantum optimisation, including applications such as machine learning, are summarised. Given the difficulties faced by quantum algorithms for solving the TSP, the idea of designing extremely hard TSP instances as the basis for new post-quantum cryptography protocols is discussed. Finally, ten open research challenges are posed to provide fruitful directions for future research.

TI Tensorized Pauli decomposition algorithm

In a detailed complexity analysis, we show that the algorithm admits the best known worst-case scaling and more favorable runtimes for many practical examples. Numerical experiments are provided to validate the asymptotic speed-up already for small instance sizes, underscoring the algorithm's potential significance in the realm of quantum computing and quantum chemistry simulations.

TI Pauli component erasing quantum channels
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Decoherence of quantum systems is described by quantum channels. However, a complete understanding of such channels, especially in the multiparticle setting, is still an ongoing difficult task. We propose the family of quantum maps that preserve or completely erase the components of a multiqubit system in the basis of Pauli strings, which we call Pauli component erasing maps. For the corresponding channels, it is shown that the preserved components can be interpreted as a finite vector subspace, from which we derive several properties and complete the characterization. Moreover, we show that the obtained family of channels forms a semigroup and derive its generators. We use this simple structure to determine physical implementations and connect the obtained family of channels with Markovian processes.

TI Towards optimization of photonic-crystal surface-emitting lasers via
   quantum annealing
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Photonic-crystal surface-emitting lasers (PCSELs), which utilize a two-dimensional (2D) optical resonance inside a photonic crystal for lasing, feature various outstanding functionalities such as single-mode high-power operation and arbitrary control of beam polarizations. Although most of the previous designs of PCSELs employ spatially uniform photonic crystals, it is expected that lasing performance can be further improved if it becomes possible to optimize the spatial distribution of photonic crystals. In this paper, we investigate the structural optimization of PCSELs via quantum annealing towards high-power, narrow-beam-divergence operation with linear polarization. The optimization of PCSELs is performed by the iteration of the following three steps: (1) time-dependent 3D coupled-wave analysis of lasing performance, (2) formulation of the lasing performance via a factorization machine, and (3) selection of optimal solution(s) via quantum annealing. By using this approach, we discover an advanced PCSEL with a non-uniform spatial distribution of the band-edge frequency and injection current, which simultaneously enables higher output power, a narrower divergence angle, and a higher linear polarization ratio than conventional uniform PCSELs. Our results potentially indicate the universal applicability of quantum annealing, which has been mainly applied to specific types of discrete optimization problems so far, for various physics and engineering problems in the field of smart manufacturing.

TI Reconstructing the spatial structure of quantum correlations in
   materials
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Quantum correlations are a fundamental property of quantum many-body states. Yet they remain experimentally elusive, hindering certification of genuine quantum behavior, especially in quantum materials. Here we show that the momentum-dependent dynamical susceptibility measured via inelastic neutron scattering enables the systematic reconstruction of a general family of quantum correlation functions, which express the degree of quantum coherence in the fluctuations of two spins at an arbitrary mutual distance. Using neutron scattering data for the compound KCuF3-a system of weakly coupled S = 1/2 Heisenberg chains-and numerically exact quantum Monte Carlo data, we show that quantum correlations possess a radically different spatial structure with respect to conventional correlations. Indeed, they exhibit a different emergent length scale-the quantum coherence length-which is finite at any finite temperature (including when long-range magnetic order develops). Moreover, we show theoretically that coupled Heisenberg spin chains exhibit a form of quantum monogamy, with a trade-off between quantum correlations along and transverse to the spin chains. These results highlight real-space quantum correlators as an informative, model-independent means of probing the underlying quantum state of real quantum materials.

TI Encoding control system for twin-field quantum key distribution
SO AIP ADVANCES
AB The Twin-Field Quantum Key Distribution (TF-QKD) protocol has the potential to realize secure key distribution over extremely long distances, which is an important technique for realizing a global quantum network. Compared to the conventional BB84 protocol, practical TF-QKD and its variant protocols require an accurate phase modulation to at least 16 different values with randomized encoding. In this work, we developed an encoding control system for TF-QKD. Optical pulses with five different intensities and 16 different phases can be modulated with a clock frequency of 100 MHz with a field programmable gate array based arbitrary waveform generator (AWG). With the assistance of DDR4 memory, waveforms exceeding 200 ms in length can be output simultaneously on 4 pairs of differential channels, making the random number pairing between two different encoding systems close to the expected ratio when using cyclic random numbers for experimental demonstration. The AWG boasts a long-term amplitude stability better than 0.03% and supports seamless concatenation and cyclic output of waveforms, demonstrating a strong and sustained performance in long-duration experiments. Sending-or-not-sending TF-QKD was demonstrated with the encoding control system, with a secure key rate of 1.33 x 10(-5) per pulse under the total channel loss of similar to 32 dB.

TI Parametrically controlled chiral interface for superconducting quantum
   devices
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB Nonreciprocal microwave routing plays a crucial role in measuring quantum circuits, and allows for realizing cascaded quantum systems for generating and stabilizing entanglement between noninteracting qubits. The most commonly used tools for implementing directionality are ferrite-based circulators. These devices are versatile, but suffer from excess loss, a large footprint, and fixed directionality. For utilizing nonreciprocity in scalable quantum circuits it is desirable to develop efficient integration of low-loss and in-situ controllable directional elements. Here, we report the design and experimental realization of a minimal controllable directional interface that can be directly coupled to superconducting qubits. In the device presented, nonreciprocity is realized through a combination of interference and phase-controlled parametric pumping. We have achieved a maximum directionality of around 30 dB, and the performance of the device is predicted quantitatively from independent calibration measurements. Using the excellent agreement of model and experiment, we predict that the circuit will be useable as a chiral qubit interface with inefficiencies at the 1% level or below. Our work offers a promising route for realizing high-fidelity signal routing and entanglement generation in all-to-all connected microwave quantum networks, and provides a path for isolator-free qubit readout schemes.

TI Theoretical framework for quantum associative memories
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Associative memory (AM) refers to the ability to relate a memory with an input and targets the restoration of corrupted patterns. It has been intensively studied in classical physical systems, as in neural networks where an attractor dynamics settles on stable solutions. Several extensions to the quantum domain have been recently reported, displaying different features. In this work, we develop a comprehensive framework for a quantum AM (QAM) based on open quantum system dynamics, which allows us to compare existing models, identify the theoretical prerequisites for performing AM tasks, and extend it in different forms. The map that achieves an exponential increase in the number of stored patterns with respect to classical systems is derived. We establish the crucial role of symmetries and dissipation in the operation of QAM. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates the feasibility of addressing both quantum and classical patterns, orthogonal and non-orthogonal memories, stationary and metastable operating regimes, and measurement-based outputs. Finally, this opens up new avenues for practical applications in quantum computing and machine learning, such as quantum error correction or quantum memories.

TI Deterministic Fast Scrambling with Neutral Atom Arrays
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Fast scramblers are dynamical quantum systems that produce many-body entanglement on a timescale that grows logarithmically with the system size N. We propose and investigate a family of deterministic, fast scrambling quantum circuits realizable in near-term experiments with arrays of neutral atoms. We show that three experimental tools-nearest-neighbor Rydberg interactions, global single-qubit rotations, and shuffling operations facilitated by an auxiliary tweezer array-are sufficient to generate nonlocal interaction graphs capable of scrambling quantum information using only O(log N) parallel applications of nearest-neighbor gates. These tools enable direct experimental access to fast scrambling dynamics in a highly controlled and programmable way and can be harnessed to produce highly entangled states with varied applications.

TI Device-Independent Dimension Leakage Null Test on Qubits at Low
   Operational Cost
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB A null test of the two-level space of a qubit is constructed, which is both device independent and needs a small number of different experiments. Its feasibility is demonstrated on IBM Quantum, with most qubits failing the test by more than ten standard deviations. The robustness of the test against common technical imperfections, like decoherence and phase shifts, and supposedly negligible leakage, indicates that the origin of deviations is beyond known effects.
   Testing the two-level space of a qubit is critical for the future of quantum computation. A simple setup allows to verify the space by a device independent null witness at extreme precision. Applied to IBM Quantum, most qubits fail the test by more than ten standard deviations, which cannot be explained by a standard model of leakage. image

TI Interactions of Nitrogen-Vacancy Centers in Diamond with Electron Beams:
   Implications for Quantum Sensing and Photoluminescence Stability
SO ADVANCED OPTICAL MATERIALS
AB Nitrogen-vacancy (NV) photoluminescence (PL) in diamond is fundamental to its function as a color center, underpinning advances in sensing science and quantum technologies. The work herein provides critical insights into the atomistic mechanisms of electron beams interacting with NV centers, which are crucial for advancing robust quantum sensing at the nanoscale and controlling the functional properties of nanodiamonds. NV PL and sensing stability of NV-rich fluorescent nanodiamonds (FNDs) under electron beam irradiation is probed, across a range of energies (20, 80, 100, and 200 keV) and fluences (approximate to 10(3) to 10(7) e(-)nm(-2)). PL intensity, NV charge-state ratios, and sensing contrast, as monitored via optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) and magnetic modulation (MM) of PL, are examined. Results reveal complex mechanisms governing interactions between NV-centers and fast electrons, dominated by ionization and direct knock-on (DKO) effects, which allow to establish optimum imaging conditions where FNDs can be imaged with sub-nanometer resolution while preserving their PL and sensing properties (200 keV, <10(5)<bold>e</bold>(-)nm(-2)). This methodology enables controlled, top-down spatial patterning of diamond PL by selectively deactivating NVs, providing novel routes to patterned NV creation.

TI Improved Resource-Tunable Near-Term Quantum Algorithms for Transition
   Probabilities, with Applications in Physics and Variational Quantum
   Linear Algebra
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB Transition amplitudes and transition probabilities are relevant to many areas of physics simulation, including the calculation of response properties and correlation functions. These quantities can also be related to solving linear systems of equations. This study presents three related algorithms for calculating transition probabilities. First, a previously published short-depth algorithm is extended, allowing for the two input states to be non-orthogonal. Building on this first procedure, a higher-depth algorithm based on Trotterization and Richardson extrapolation is derived that requires fewer circuit evaluations. Third, a tunable algorithm that allows for trading off circuit depth and measurement complexity is introduced, yielding an algorithm that can be tailored to specific hardware characteristics. Finally, proof-of-principle numerics are presented for models in physics and chemistry and for a subroutine in variational quantum linear solving (VQLS). The primary benefits of these approaches are that a) arbitrary non-orthogonal states may now be used with small increases in quantum resources, b) they (like another recently proposed method) entirely avoid subroutines such as the Hadamard test that may require three-qubit gates to be decomposed, and c) in some cases fewer quantum circuit evaluations are required as compared to the previous state-of-the-art in NISQ algorithms for transition probabilities.

SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB We report a method for integrating GaAswaveguide circuits containing self-assembled quantum dots on a Si/SiO2 wafer, using die-to-wafer bonding. The large refractive-index contrast between GaAs and SiO2 enables fabricating single-mode waveguides without compromising the photon-emitter coupling. Anti-bunched emission from individual quantum dots is observed, along with a waveguide propagation loss <7 dB/mm, which is comparable with the performance of suspended GaAs circuits. These results enable the integration of quantum emitters with different material platforms, towards the realization of scalable quantum photonic integrated circuits.

TI Deterministic teleportation and universal computation without particle
   exchange
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS COMMUNICATIONS
AB Teleportation is a cornerstone of quantum technologies, and has played a key role in the development of quantum information theory. Pushing the limits of teleportation is therefore of particular importance. Here, we apply a different aspect of quantumness to teleportation-namely exchange-free, or counterfactual, computation at a distance. We propose a universal controlled-phase gate, where no particles are exchanged between control and target. This allows the full repertoire of quantum computation to me made exchange-free, including both complete Bell detection among two remote parties and so teleportation and telecloning. Further, we show that this gate, and the protocols based on it, is experimentally feasible, simulating the fidelity of our exchange-free teleportation and telecloning protocols for realistic bit-errors.

The experimental predictions of the two formulations are identical, but the entanglement predictions are significantly different. The time-symmetric formulation reveals an experimentally testable discrepancy in the original quantum analysis of the Hanbury Brown-Twiss experiment, suggests solutions to some parts of the nonlocality and measurement problems, fixes known time asymmetries in the conventional formulation, and answers Bell's question "How do you convert an 'and' into an 'or'?"

TI Intrinsic and induced quantum quenches for enhancing qubit-based quantum
   noise spectroscopy
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB When trying to characterise a bath coupled to a sensor qubit, one should consider that quantum environments change their properties in response to external perturbations. Here, the authors show how back-action of the qubit on the bath leads to a quench, which can be used to infer the bath spectral function.
   Quantum sensing protocols that exploit the dephasing of a probe qubit are powerful and ubiquitous methods for interrogating an unknown environment. They have a variety of applications, ranging from noise mitigation in quantum processors, to the study of correlated electron states. Here, we discuss a simple strategy for enhancing these methods, based on the fact that they often give rise to an inadvertent quench of the probed system: there is an effective sudden change in the environmental Hamiltonian at the start of the sensing protocol. These quenches are extremely sensitive to the initial environmental state, and lead to observable changes in the sensor qubit evolution. We show how these new features give access to environmental response properties. This enables methods for direct measurement of bath temperature, and for detecting non-thermal equilibrium states. We also discuss how to deliberately control and modulate this quench physics, which enables reconstruction of the bath spectral function. Extensions to non-Gaussian quantum baths are also discussed, as is the application of our ideas to a range of sensing platforms (e.g., nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond, semiconductor quantum dots, and superconducting circuits).

TI Measuring the Loschmidt Amplitude for Finite-Energy Properties of the
   Fermi-Hubbard Model on an Ion-Trap Quantum Computer
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Calculating the equilibrium properties of condensed-matter systems is one of the promising applications of near-term quantum computing. Recently, hybrid quantum-classical time-series algorithms have been proposed to efficiently extract these properties from a measurement of the Loschmidt amplitude (psi e-iHt psi) from initial states psi) and a time evolution under the Hamiltonian H up to short times t. In this work, we study the operation of this algorithm on a present-day quantum computer. Specifically, we measure the Loschmidt amplitude for the Fermi-Hubbard model on a 16-site ladder geometry (32 orbitals) on the Quantinuum H2-1 trapped-ion device. We assess the effect of noise on the Loschmidt amplitude and implement algorithm-specific error-mitigation techniques. By using a thus-motivated error model, we numerically analyze the influence of noise on the full operation of the quantum-classical algorithm by measuring expectation values of local observables at finite energies. Finally, we estimate the resources needed for scaling up the algorithm.

TI Quantum algorithm for collisionless Boltzmann simulation of
   self-gravitating systems
SO COMPUTERS & FLUIDS
AB The collisionless Boltzmann equation (CBE) is a fundamental equation that governs the dynamics of abroad range of astrophysical systems from space plasma to star clusters and galaxies. It is computationally expensive to integrate the CBE directly in a multi-dimensional phase space, and thus the applications to realistic astrophysical problems have been limited so far. Recently, Todorova & Steijl (2020) proposed an efficient quantum algorithm to solve the CBE with significantly reduced computational complexity. We extend the algorithm to perform quantum simulations of self-gravitating systems, incorporating the method to calculate gravity with the major Fourier modes of the density distribution extracted from the solution-encoding quantum state. Our method improves the dependency of time and space complexities on N , the number of grid points in each velocity coordinate, compared to the classical simulation methods. We then conduct some numerical demonstrations of our method. We first run a 1+1 dimensional test calculation of free streaming motion on 64 x 64 grids using 13 simulated qubits and validate our method. We then perform simulations of Jeans collapse, and compare the result with analytic and linear theory calculations. It will thus allow us to perform large-scale CBE simulations on future quantum computers.

TI Advancing hexagonal boron nitride single photon sources: A strategic

SO MATERIALS SCIENCE IN SEMICONDUCTOR PROCESSING
AB Hexagonal boron nitride (hBN), has shown great promise as a single-photon source (SPS). However, progress has been largely confined to early-stage research, focused on identifying various SPSs more than developing specific emitters to work as building blocks of quantum devices. To fully leverage hBN's potential in quantum technologies, there is a need for a comprehensive strategic plan emphasizing its role as a reliable single-photon generator for quantum processes. The novelty of this work is to highlight the need for a clear roadmap to bridge foundational research on the quantum properties of hBN to the development of quantum devices based on this material. While the vision of constructing hBN-based quantum devices holds significant promise, achieving this requires overcoming significant technical challenges.

TI Quantum correlations of localized atomic excitations in a disordered
   atomic chain
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB The atom-waveguide interface mediates significant and long-range light-matter interactions through guided modes. In this one-dimensional system, we theoretically investigate the excitation localization of multiple atomic excitations under strong position disorder. Deep in the localization side, we obtain the time evolutions of quantum correlations via Kubo cumulant expansions, which arise initially and become finite and leveled afterward, overtaking those without disorder. This indicates two distinct regimes in time: before the onset of excitation localization, the disorder engage the disturbance of quantum correlations, which is followed by disorder-assisted buildup of quantum correlations that maintain at a later stage owing to the absence of excitations diffusion. The crossing of distinct regimes is pushed further in time for longer-range correlations, which indicates a characteristic timescale needed for disorder to sustain them. We also explore the effect of directionality of couplings and resonant dipole-dipole interactions, which can drive the system toward the delocalized side when it is under chiral couplings or large dipole-dipole interaction strengths. The time-evolved quantum correlations can give insights into the studies of few-body localization phenomenon and nonequilibrium dynamics in open quantum systems.

TI Quantum Simulation for High-Energy Physics
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB It is for the first time that quantum simulation for high-energy physics (HEP) is studied in the U.S. decadal particle-physics community planning, and in fact until recently, this was not considered a main-stream topic in the community. This fact speaks of a remarkable rate of growth of this subfield over the past few years, stimulated by the impressive advancements in quantum information sciences (QIS) and associ-ated technologies over the past decade, and the significant investment in this area by the government and private sectors in the U.S. and other countries. High-energy physicists have quickly identified problems of importance to our understanding of nature at the most fundamental level, from tiniest distances to cos-mological extents, that are intractable with classical computers but may benefit from quantum advantage. They have initiated, and continue to carry out, a vigorous program in theory, algorithm, and hardware co -design for simulations of relevance to the HEP mission. This Roadmap is an attempt to bring this exciting and yet challenging area of research to the spotlight, and to elaborate on what the promises, requirements, challenges, and potential solutions are over the next decade and beyond.

TI Quantum Control of the Tin-Vacancy Spin Qubit in Diamond
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW X
AB Group-IV color centers in diamond are a promising light-matter interface for quantum networking devices. The negatively charged tin-vacancy center (SnV) is particularly interesting, as its large spin-orbit coupling offers strong protection against phonon dephasing and robust cyclicity of its optical transitions toward spin-photon-entanglement schemes. Here, we demonstrate multiaxis coherent control of the SnV spin qubit via an all-optical stimulated Raman drive between the ground and excited states. We use coherent population trapping and optically driven electronic spin resonance to confirm coherent access to the qubit at 1.7 K and obtain spin Rabi oscillations at a rate of Omega/2 pi = 19.0(1) MHz. All-optical Ramsey interferometry reveals a spin dephasing time of T-2* = 1.3(3) mu s, and four-pulse dynamical decoupling already extends the spin-coherence time to T-2 = 0.30(8) ms. Combined with transform-limited photons and integration into photonic nanostructures, our results make the SnV a competitive spin-photon building block for quantum networks.

TI On-demand reversible switching of the emission mode of individual
   semiconductor quantum emitters using plasmonic metasurfaces
SO APL PHOTONICS
AB The field of quantum technology has been rapidly expanding in the past decades, yielding numerous applications, such as quantum information, quantum communication, and quantum cybersecurity. At the core of these applications lies the quantum emitter (QE), a precisely controllable generator of either single photons or photon pairs. Semiconductor QEs, such as perovskite nanocrystals and semiconductor quantum dots, have shown much promise as emitters of pure single photons, with the potential for generating photon pairs when hybridized with plasmonic nanocavities. In this study, we have developed a system in which individual quantum emitters and their ensembles can be traced before, during, and after the interaction with an external plasmonic metasurface in a controllable way. Upon coupling the external plasmonic metasurface to the QE array, the individual QEs switch from the single-photon emission mode to the multiphoton emission mode. Remarkably, this method preserves the chemical structure and composition of the QEs, allowing them to revert to their initial state after decoupling from the plasmonic metasurface. This significantly expands the potential applications of semiconductor QEs in quantum technologies.

TI Traffic signal optimization on a square lattice with quantum annealing
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB The spread of intelligent transportation systems in urban cities has caused heavy computational loads, requiring a novel architecture for managing large-scale traffic. In this study, we develop a method for globally controlling traffic signals arranged on a square lattice by means of a quantum annealing machine, namely the D-Wave quantum annealer. We first formulate a signal optimization problem that minimizes the imbalance of traffic flows in two orthogonal directions. Then we reformulate this problem as an Ising Hamiltonian, which is compatible with quantum annealers. The new control method is compared with a conventional local control method for a large 50-by-50 city, and the results exhibit the superiority of our global control method in suppressing traffic imbalance over wide parameter ranges. Furthermore, the solutions to the global control method obtained with the quantum annealing machine are better than those obtained with conventional simulated annealing. In addition, we prove analytically that the local and the global control methods converge at the limit where cars have equal probabilities for turning and going straight. These results are verified with numerical experiments.

TI The temporal resolution limit in quantum sensing
SO EPJ QUANTUM TECHNOLOGY
AB Temporal resolution is a critical figure of merit in quantum sensing. This study combines the distinguishable condition of quantum states with quantum speed limits to establish a lower bound on interrogation time. When the interrogation time falls below this bound, the output state becomes statistically indistinguishable from the input state, and the information will inevitably be lost in noise. Without loss of generality, we extend these conclusions to time-dependent signal Hamiltonian. In theory, leveraging certain quantum control techniques allows us to calculate the minimum interrogation time for arbitrary signal Hamiltonian. Finally, we illustrate the impact of quantum speed limits on magnetic field measurements and temporal resolution.

TI Efficient quantum algorithms for some instances of the semidirect
   discrete logarithm problem
SO DESIGNS CODES AND CRYPTOGRAPHY
AB The semidirect discrete logarithm problem (SDLP) is the following analogue of the standard discrete logarithm problem in the semidirect product semigroup G (sic) End(G) for a finite semigroup G. Given g is an element of G, sigma is an element of End(G), and h = Pi(t-1)(i=0) sigma(i) (g) for some integer t, the SDLP(G, sigma), for g and h, asks to determine t. As Shor's algorithm crucially depends on commutativity, it is believed not to be applicable to the SDLP. For generic semigroups, the best known algorithm for the SDLP is based on Kuperberg's subexponential time quantum algorithm. Still, the problem plays a central role in the security of certain proposed cryptosystems in the family of semidirect product key exchange. This includes a recently proposed signature protocol called SPDH-Sign. In this paper, we show that the SDLP is even easier in some important special cases. Specifically, for a finite group G, we describe quantum algorithms for the SDLP in G (sic) Aut(G) for the following two classes of instances: the first one is when G is solvable and the second is when G is amatrix group and a power of sigma with a polynomially small exponent is an inner automorphism of G. We further extend the results to groups composed of factors from these classes. Aconsequence is that SPDH-Sign and similar cryptosystems whose security assumption is based on the presumed hardness of the SDLP in the cases described above are insecure against quantum attacks. The quantum ingredients we rely on are not new: these are Shor's factoring and discrete logarithm algorithms and well-known generalizations.

TI Phase-Matched Design for Efficient Entangled Photon Pair Generation in
   3R-MoS2 Waveguides
SO PHOTONICS
AB Entangled photons are essential for photonic quantum technologies. Their generation typically relies on spontaneous parametric down-conversion, but conventional nonlinear crystals are bulky and hard to integrate on chips. Rhombohedral-stacked MoS2 combines a high refractive index, large second-order nonlinearity, and flexibility for heterogeneous integration, making it a promising platform for integrated quantum photonics. However, the typical thin-film form of 3R-MoS2 restricts the effective nonlinear interaction length, limiting entanglement generation efficiency in practical devices. To overcome this, phase-matching strategies in integrated waveguides are required but have so far remained undeveloped. Here, we introduce a waveguide-integrated 3R-MoS2 platform with periodic grooves to achieve quasi-phase matching, enhancing down-conversion efficiency. Leveraging chi((2)) tensor symmetries and orthogonal waveguide modes, the design efficiently generates entangled photons, providing a compact, scalable route toward 2D-material-based integrated quantum photonic circuits.

TI Coupler-Assisted Controlled-Phase Gate with Enhanced Adiabaticity
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB High-fidelity two-qubit entangling gates are essential building blocks for fault-tolerant quantum computers. Over the past decade, tremendous efforts have been made to develop scalable high-fidelity two-qubit gates with superconducting quantum circuits. Recently, an easy-to-scale controlled-phase gate scheme that utilizes the tunable-coupling architecture with fixed-frequency qubits [Phys. Rev. Lett. 125, 240502 (2020); Phys. Rev. Lett. 125, 240503 (2020)] has been demonstrated with high fidelity and attracted broad interest. However, in-depth understanding of the underlying mechanism is still missing, preventing us from fully exploiting its potential. Here we present a comprehensive theoretical study, explaining the origin of the high-contrast ZZ interaction. Based on improved understanding, we develop a general yet convenient method for shaping an adiabatic pulse in a multilevel system, and identify how to optimize the gate performance from design. Given state-of-the-art coherence properties, we expect the scheme to potentially achieve a two-qubit gate error rate near 10(-5), which would drastically speed up the progress towards fault-tolerant quantum computation.

TI Universal-dephasing-noise injection via Schrodinger-wave autoregressive
   moving-average models
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB We present and validate a method for noise injection of arbitrary spectra in quantum circuits that can be applied to any system capable of executing arbitrary single qubit rotations, including cloud-based quantum processors. As the consequences of temporally correlated noise on the performance of quantum algorithms are not well understood, the capability to engineer and inject such noise in quantum systems is paramount. To date, noise injection capabilities have been limited and highly platform specific, requiring low-level access to control hardware. We experimentally validate our method by comparing to a direct hardware-based noise-injection scheme. Using a combination of quantum noise spectroscopy and classical signal analysis, we show that the two approaches agree. These results showcase a highly versatile method for noise injection that can be utilized by theoretical and experimental researchers to verify, evaluate, and improve quantum characterization protocols and quantum algorithms for sensing and computing.

TI Computing partition functions in the one-clean-qubit model
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We present a method to approximate partition functions of quantum systems using mixed-state quantum computation. For positive-semidefinite Hamiltonians, our method has an expected running-time that is almost linear in [M/(epsilon(rel)Z)](2), where M is the dimension of the quantum system, Z is the partition function, and epsilon(rel) is the relative precision. It is based on approximations of the exponential operator as linear combinations of certain operators related to block-encoding of Hamiltonians or Hamiltonian evolutions. The trace of each operator is estimated using a standard algorithm in the one-clean-qubit model. For large values of Z, our method may run faster than exact classical methods, whose complexities are polynomial in M. We also prove that a version of the partition function estimation problem within additive error is complete for the so-called DQC1 complexity class, suggesting that our method provides a superpolynomial speedup for certain parameter values. To attain a desired relative precision, we develop a classical procedure based on a sequence of approximations within predetermined additive errors that may be of independent interest.

TI Power and Energy Applications Based on Quantum Computing: The Possible
   Potentials of Grover's Algorithm
SO ELECTRONICS
AB In quantum computing, calculations are achieved using quantum mechanics. Typically, two main phenomena of quantum mechanics (i.e., superposition and entanglement) allow quantum computing to solve some problems more efficiently than classical algorithms. The most well-known advantage of quantum computing is the speedup of some of the calculations, which have been performed before by classical applications. Scientists and engineers are attempting to use quantum computing in different fields of science, e.g., drug discovery, chemistry, computer science, etc. However, there are few attempts to use quantum computing in power and energy applications. This paper tries to highlight this gap by discussing one of the most famous quantum computing algorithms (i.e., Grover's algorithm) and discussing the potential applications of this algorithm in power and energy systems, which can serve as one of the starting points for using Grover's algorithm in power and energy systems.

TI Hardware Acceleration for High-Volume Operations of CRYSTALS-Kyber and

SO ACM TRANSACTIONS ON RECONFIGURABLE TECHNOLOGY AND SYSTEMS
AB Many high-demand digital services need to perform several cryptographic operations, such as key exchange or security credentialing, in a concise amount of time. In turn, the security of some of these cryptographic schemes is threatened by advances in quantum computing, as quantum computer could break their security in the near future. Post-quantum cryptography (PQC) is an emerging field that studies cryptographic algorithms that resist such attacks. The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has selected the CRYSTALSKyber Key Encapsulation Mechanism and the CRYSTALS-Dilithium Digital Signature algorithm as primary PQC standards. In this article, we present field-programmable gate array (FPGA)-based hardware accelerators for high-volume operations of both schemes. We apply high-level synthesis (HLS) for hardware optimization, leveraging a batch processing approach to maximize the memory throughput and applying custom HLS logic to specific algorithmic components. Using reconfigurable FPGAs, we show that our hardware accelerators achieve speedups between 3x and 9x over software baseline implementations, even over ones leveraging CPU vector architectures. Furthermore, the methods used in this study can also be extended to the new CRYSTALS-based NIST FIPS drafts, ML-KEM and ML-DSA, with similar acceleration results.

In this work, we present atomic-level characterization of cross-sections of a Josephson junction and a spiral resonator to assess the quality of critical interfaces. Employing scanning transmission electron microscopy combined with energy-dispersive x-ray spectroscopy and electron-energy loss spectroscopy, we identify structural imperfections associated with oxide layer formation and carbon-based contamination, and correlate these imperfections to the patterning and etching steps in the fabrication process and environmental exposure. These results suggest that TLS imperfections at critical interfaces significantly contribute to limiting device performance, emphasizing the need for an improved fabrication process.

TI Quantum Channel Extreme Bandgap AlGaN HEMT
SO MICROMACHINES
AB An extreme bandgap Al0.64Ga0.36N quantum channel HEMT with Al0.87Ga0.13N top and back barriers, grown by MOCVD on a bulk AlN substrate, demonstrated a critical breakdown field of 11.37 MV/cm-higher than the 9.8 MV/cm expected for the channel's Al0.64Ga0.36N material. We show that the fraction of this increase is due to the quantization of the 2D electron gas. The polarization field maintains electron quantization in the quantum channel even at low sheet densities, in contrast to conventional HEMT designs. An additional increase in the breakdown field is due to quantum-enabled real space transfer of energetic electrons into high-Al barrier layers in high electric fields. These results show the advantages of the quantum channel design for achieving record-high breakdown voltages and allowing for superior power HEMT devices.

TI Robust twin-field quantum key distribution through sending or not
   sending
SO NATIONAL SCIENCE REVIEW
AB The sending-or-not-sending (SNS) protocol is one of the most major variants of the twin-field (TF) quantum key distribution (QKD) protocol and has been realized in a 511-km field fiber, the farthest field experiment to date. In practice, however, all decoy-state methods have unavoidable source errors, and the source errors may be non-random, which compromises the security condition of the existing TF-QKD protocols. In this study, we present a general approach for efficiently calculating the SNS protocol's secure key rate with source errors, by establishing the equivalent protocols through virtual attenuation and the tagged model. This makes the first result for TF QKD in practice where source intensity cannot be controlled exactly. Our method can be combined with the two-way classical communication method such as active odd-parity pairing to further improve the key rate. The numerical results show that if the intensity error is within a few percent, the key rate and secure distance only decrease marginally. The key rate of the recent SNS experiment in the 511-km field fiber is still positive using our method presented here, even if there is a +/-9.5% intensity fluctuation. This shows that the SNS protocol is robust against source errors.

TI Integrating quantum algorithms into classical frameworks: a
   predictor-corrector approach using HHL
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB The application of quantum algorithms to classical problems is generally accompanied by significant bottlenecks when transferring data between quantum and classical states, often negating any intrinsic quantum advantage. Here we address this challenge for a well-known algorithm for linear systems of equations, originally proposed by Harrow, Hassidim and Lloyd (HHL), by adapting it into a predictor-corrector instead of a direct solver. Rather than seeking the solution at the next time step, the goal now becomes determining the change between time steps. This strategy enables the intelligent omission of computationally costly steps commonly found in many classical algorithms, while simultaneously mitigating the notorious readout problems associated with extracting solutions from a quantum state. Random or regularly performed skips instead lead to simulation failure. We demonstrate that our methodology secures a useful polynomial advantage over a conventional application of the HHL algorithm. The practicality and versatility of the approach are illustrated through applications in various fields such as smoothed particle hydrodynamics, plasma simulations, and reactive flow configurations. Moreover, the proposed algorithm is well suited to run asynchronously on future heterogeneous hardware infrastructures and can effectively leverage the synergistic strengths of classical as well as quantum compute resources.

TI Synchronization of chaotic optomechanical system with plasmonic cavity
   for secured quantum communication
SO AIP ADVANCES
AB Cavity optomechanical systems generate, manipulate, and detect quantum states of light by exploiting the intricate interplay between light confined to optical cavities and mechanical vibrations. However, these systems can be subjected to thermal noise due to the inherent thermal vibrations of the mechanical components, introducing fluctuations that can obscure the delicate quantum states and dynamics of the system. Therefore, in this study, we present a theoretical analysis of the synchronization dynamics in chaotic optomechanical systems comprising two cavity modes: one strongly influenced by a localized surface plasmon field and another exhibiting minimal influence. We investigated the energy transfer efficiency of silicon divacancies, gallium arsenide, and indium phosphide by analyzing their absorption and extinction cross sections. The results indicate that gallium arsenide surpasses both silicon divacancies and indium phosphide in performance. Employing the Hamiltonian notation, we calculated the effect of optical force and damping rates on the optomechanical system over time. In addition, using Lyapunov chaotic attractors, we demonstrated that the localized surface plasmons significantly boost the strength of the electromagnetic field within the strongly influenced cavity mode and effectively synchronize the two modes through a coherent phase relationship with minimal error. Further, we exploited the initial chaotic behavior for quantum key generation, showcasing the system's potential for efficient and secure quantum communication within a time frame of 0.7 mu s. Our findings pave the way for enhanced coherence and reliability in secure quantum communication systems, thus contributing to the advancement of this rapidly evolving field.

TI A Survey on the Quantum Security of Block Cipher-Based Cryptography
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB The development of quantum computers represents an important advancement in computing, using quantum mechanics to address problems that were previously difficult to solve. This technological advancement poses a challenge for cryptographic systems. While some methods are known to be vulnerable, the impact of quantum computing on symmetric cryptography has received less research attention, largely because the common advice is to simply double the key size. This paper explores how quantum computing affects symmetric cryptography, focusing on block cipher-based cryptography. It surveys existing literature on the quantum resilience of symmetric cryptographic primitives based on block ciphers and their security in various scenarios. Not all symmetric cryptographic functionalities are quantum-secure, and their security depends on the specific adversary model being considered. We provide an overview of the research conducted and pinpoint areas where further investigation is needed.

TI Donor-based qubits for quantum computing in silicon
SO APPLIED PHYSICS REVIEWS
AB Spin-qubits based on impurities such as phosphorus in silicon (Si) have attractive attributes for the development of quantum computing devices. Very long coherence times can be achieved for donor-based qubits in Si due to the availability of isotopically pure Si-28 layers where the Si-29 atoms, which otherwise lead to decoherence, are largely absent in the active region of the device. Well-behaved single donor qubits in Si can routinely be formed using ion implantation, and the key performance criteria needed to demonstrate the basis of a viable platform for quantum computing have been achieved. The crucial next stage of development is to demonstrate suitable pathways for scale-up that allow patterned arrays of donor qubits to be controllably coupled and that are robust against the inherent donor placement tolerances and material processing constraints that exist. Here, we review progress on the fabrication and measurement of donor-based qubits in silicon via the ion implantation pathway and discuss the key developmental milestones that have been achieved. We also provide an overview of the key scale-up strategies that are being actively pursued to take donor-based quantum computing in Si to the next stage.

TI Magnetic isotope effects: a potential testing ground for quantum biology
SO FRONTIERS IN PHYSIOLOGY
AB One possible explanation for magnetosensing in biology, such as avian magnetoreception, is based on the spin dynamics of certain chemical reactions that involve radical pairs. Radical pairs have been suggested to also play a role in anesthesia, hyperactivity, neurogenesis, circadian clock rhythm, microtubule assembly, etc. It thus seems critical to probe the credibility of such models. One way to do so is through isotope effects with different nuclear spins. Here we briefly review the papers involving spin-related isotope effects in biology. We suggest studying isotope effects can be an interesting avenue for quantum biology.

TI Quantum Light Source with Long Coherence Time with
   Ultrahigh-Quality-Factor Micro-Rod Resonator (Invited)
SO ACTA OPTICA SINICA
AB Objective Quantum light sources are indispensable resources for various quantum technologies, including quantum communication, quantum computing, and quantum metrology. Among them, narrowband photon-pair sources with long coherence time are particularly crucial for enabling efficient light-matter interactions and building scalable quantum networks, especially those interfaced with atomic quantum memories. To date, the realization of such sources has predominantly relied on cavity-enhanced spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) or spontaneous four-wave mixing (SFWM) in cold atomic ensembles, both of which pose significant challenges in terms of operational complexity and integration scalability. Although recent progress in integrated photonic platforms has led to notable improvements, achieving photon-pair coherence times beyond several tens of nanoseconds remains difficult, primarily due to limitations in cavity quality factors (Q) and intrinsic device losses. In this work, we address these challenges by developing a quantum-correlated photon-pair source based on a whispering-gallery-mode (WGM) silica micro-rod resonator with an ultrahigh Q factor, operating in the telecom C-band. Our objective is to demonstrate the generation of long-coherence-time photon pairs at room temperature, thereby advancing the development of practical and scalable quantum networks. Methods The silica micro-rod resonator is fabricated from commercial-grade fused silica rods via a CO 2 laser ablation process. The fabrication procedure involves sequential grinding, polishing, laser melting, and annealing steps to precisely control the resonator geometry and ensure an ultrasmooth surface finish. Optical coupling to the resonator is achieved using a tapered fiber, which enables efficient evanescent coupling with low insertion loss. To ensure long-term operational stability and precise control of the coupling condition, the resonator is integrated with a piezoelectric transducer for sub-micron tuning of the fiber - cavity distance, and a thermoelectric cooler (TEC) for active temperature stabilization. The temperature fluctuations of the system are maintained within +/- 10 mK during operation. For optical characterization, a tunable narrow-linewidth continuous-wave (CW) laser is used to measure the transmission of the resonator. The transmitted signal is detected by a photodetector and recorded using a digital oscilloscope to extract the resonance linewidth, from which the cavity Q factor is derived. In the photon-pair generation experiment, the pump laser is tuned to the cavity resonance at 1550.17 nm, where the correlated signal and idler photons are generated through the SFWM process. The residual pump light is suppressed using cascaded dense wavelength division multiplexers (DWDMs) with a total extinction ratio exceeding 120 dB. The signal and idler photons are spectrally separated and filtered using a programmable optical filter (WaveShaper) with a bandwidth of 20 GHz, centered at 1552.52 nm and 1547.72 nm, respectively. The filtered photons are then detected by superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors (SNSPDs) featuring a detection efficiency of 75% and timing jitter of 60 ps. Coincidence events between the signal and idler photons are recorded using a time-to-digital converter (TDC), enabling time-correlation analysis and extraction of the photon-pair coherence time. Results and Discussions The fabricated micro-rod resonator exhibits a measured free spectral range (FSR) of 22 GHz (Fig.
   4), in agreement with theoretical predictions based on the device geometry. The resonance linewidth is determined to be 2.72 MHz, corresponding to a loaded Q factor of 7.1x 107(Fig. 5). The single-side count rates of both signal and idler photons increase linearly with pump power (Fig. 7), indicating that the detected photons are primarily due to spontaneous Raman scattering noise. Coincidence measurements reveal strong temporal correlations between the generated photon pairs. The full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the coincidence peak is measured to be 83 ns (Fig. 8). The signal-to-noise performance of the photon-pair source is characterized by the coincidence-to-accidental ratio (CAR). An average CAR of 11 is obtained over a 10 s integration window, clearly demonstrating quantum correlations (Fig. 9). These results demonstrate the capability of the ultrahigh-Q WGM micro-rod resonator to serve as a viable platform for generating narrowband, long-coherence-time photon pairs. Conclusions We demonstrate a quantum light source with a long coherence time of 83 ns, enabled by a silica WGM micro-rod resonator featuring an ultrahigh Q factor of 7.1x107 and an FSR of 22 GHz. The photon-pair bandwidth of 2.72 MHz significantly improves upon existing integrated SFWM platforms and approaches the linewidths of atomic transitions, making the source highly suitable for interfacing with quantum memories. This work offers a practical and scalable route toward long-distance quantum communication and quantum networks.

TI Application of quantum entanglement induced polarization for
   dual-positron and prompt gamma imaging
SO BIO-ALGORITHMS AND MED-SYSTEMS
AB The intrinsic resolution of Positron Emission Tomography (PET) imaging is bound by positron range effects, wherein the radioactive decay of the imaging tracer occurs at a disjoint location from positron annihilation. Compounding this issue are the variable ranges positrons achieve, depending on tracer species (the energy they are emitted with) and the medium they travel in (bone vs soft tissue, for example) - causing the range to span more than an order of magnitude across various study scenarios (similar to 0.19 mm to similar to 6.4 mm). Radioisotopes, such as Zr-89, exhibit dual emissions of positron and prompt gammas, offering an opportunity for accurate tracer positioning as prompt gammas originate from the tracer location. These multi-emission radiotracers have historically suffered from increased noise corresponding to the third gamma interfering in annihilation gamma coincidence pairing. Recent advancements, however, have brought to light the unique property of annihilation gammas having scattering kinematics distinct from random gamma pairs. These properties are born from the singular quantum entanglement state available to the gamma pair following para-positronium decay which prescribes linearly orthogonal polarization. Such coherent polarization is not shared by prompt gamma emissions, offering an opportunity for their discrimination. We present an investigation into this technique, comparing the distribution of relevant scattering kinematics of entangled annihilation gammas and corresponding prompt gammas via a Monte Carlo simulation.

TI Active learning on a programmable photonic quantum processor
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Training a quantum machine learning model generally requires a large labeled dataset, which incurs high labeling and computational costs. To reduce such costs, a selective training strategy, called active learning (AL), chooses only a subset of the original dataset to learn while maintaining the trained model's performance. Here, we design and implement two AL-enpowered variational quantum classifiers to investigate the potential applications and effectiveness of AL in quantum machine learning. Firstly, we build a programmable free-space photonic quantum processor, which enables the programmed implementation of various hybrid quantum-classical computing algorithms. Then, we code the designed variational quantum classifier with AL into the quantum processor, and execute comparative tests for the classifiers with and without the AL strategy. The results validate the great advantage of AL in quantum machine learning, as it saves at most 85% labeling efforts and 91.6% percent computational efforts compared to the training without AL on a data classification task. Our results inspire AL's further applications in large-scale quantum machine learning to drastically reduce training data and speed up training, underpinning the exploration of practical quantum advantages in quantum physics or real-world applications.

TI Digital Simulation of Projective Non-Abelian Anyons with 68
   Superconducting Qubits
SO CHINESE PHYSICS LETTERS
AB Non-Abelian anyons are exotic quasiparticle excitations hosted by certain topological phases of matter. They break the fermion-boson dichotomy and obey non-Abelian braiding statistics: their interchanges yield unitary operations, rather than merely a phase factor, in a space spanned by topologically degenerate wavefunctions. They are the building blocks of topological quantum computing. However, experimental observation of non-Abelian anyons and their characterizing braiding statistics is notoriously challenging and has remained elusive hitherto, in spite of various theoretical proposals. Here, we report an experimental quantum digital simulation of projective non-Abelian anyons and their braiding statistics with up to 68 programmable superconducting qubits arranged on a two-dimensional lattice. By implementing the ground states of the toric-code model with twists through quantum circuits, we demonstrate that twists exchange electric and magnetic charges and behave as a particular type of non-Abelian anyons, i.e., the Ising anyons. In particular, we show experimentally that these twists follow the fusion rules and non-Abelian braiding statistics of the Ising type, and can be explored to encode topological logical qubits. Furthermore, we demonstrate how to implement both single- and two-qubit logic gates through applying a sequence of elementary Pauli gates on the underlying physical qubits. Our results demonstrate a versatile quantum digital approach for simulating non-Abelian anyons, offering a new lens into the study of such peculiar quasiparticles.

TI Preserving multilevel quantum coherence by dynamical decoupling
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Quantum information processing with multilevel systems (qudits) provides additional features and applications than the two-level systems. However, qudits are more prone to dephasing and dynamical decoupling for qudits has never been experimentally demonstrated. Here, as a proof-of-principle demonstration, we experimentally apply dynamical decoupling to protect superpositions with three levels of a trapped Be-9(+) ion from ambient noisy magnetic field, prolonging coherence by up to approximately an order of magnitude. Our demonstration, straightforwardly scalable to more levels, may open up a path toward long coherence quantum memory, metrology, and information processing with qudits.

TI Quantum advantage beyond entanglement in Bayesian game theory
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS A-MATHEMATICAL AND THEORETICAL
AB Quantum discord has been utilised in order to find quantum advantage in an extension of the Clauser, Horne, Shimony, and Holt game. By writing the game explicitly as a Bayesian game, the resulting game is modified such the payoff's are different. Crucially, restrictions are imposed on the measurements that Alice and Bob can perform. By imposing these restrictions, it is found that there exists quantum advantage beyond entanglement for a given quantum state. This is shown by decomposing the expected payoff into a classical and quantum term. By optimising over the expected payoff, the classical limit is surpassed for the given state in the restricted measurement space. This gives an operational framework in order to witness and determine the quantum discord for specific states, whilst demonstrating the importance of measurement in quantum advantage.

TI Variational Quantum Shot-Based Simulations for Waveguide Modes
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON MICROWAVE THEORY AND TECHNIQUES
AB Current quantum computers (QCs) belong to the noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) class, characterized by noisy qubits, limited qubit capabilities, and limited circuit depth. These limitations have led to the development of hybrid quantum-classical algorithms that split the computational cost between classical and quantum hardware. Among the hybrid algorithms, the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) is mentioned. The VQE is a variational quantum algorithm designed to estimate the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a system on universal-gate quantum architectures. A canonical problem in electromagnetics is the computation of eigenmodes within waveguides. Following the finite difference method, the wave equation can be recast as an eigenvalue problem. This work exploits the quantum superposition and entanglement in quantum computing to solve the square waveguide mode problem. This algorithm is expected to demonstrate exponentially efficiency over classical computational techniques as the qubit count increases. The simulations were performed on IBM's three-qubit quantum simulator, Qasm IBM Simulator. A shot-based simulation was performed considering computationally based measurements of the quantum hardware. The results of the probabilistic read-out, reported in terms of 2-D eigenmode field distributions, are close to ideal values with a few number of qubits, confirming the possibility to exploit the quantum advantage to formulate innovative eigensolvers.

TI Hybrid quantum search with genetic algorithm optimization
SO PEERJ COMPUTER SCIENCE
AB Quantum genetic algorithms (QGA) integrate genetic programming and quantum computing to address search and optimization problems. The standard strategy of the hybrid QGA approach is to add quantum resources to classical genetic algorithms (GA), thus improving their efficacy ( i.e. , quantum optimization of a classical algorithm). However, the extent of such improvements is still unclear. Conversely, Reduced Quantum Genetic Algorithm (RQGA) is a fully quantum algorithm that reduces the GA search for the best fitness in a population of potential solutions to running Grover's algorithm. Unfortunately, RQGA finds the best fitness value and its corresponding chromosome ( i.e. , the solution or one of the solutions of the problem) in exponential runtime, O(2n/2), n/2 ), where n is the number of qubits in the individuals' quantum register. This article introduces a novel QGA optimization strategy, namely a classical optimization of a fully quantum algorithm, to address the RQGA complexity problem. Accordingly, we control the complexity of the RQGA algorithm by selecting a limited number of qubits in the individuals' register and fixing the remaining ones as classical values of '0' and '1' with a genetic algorithm. We also improve the performance of RQGA by discarding unfit solutions and bounding the search only in the area of valid individuals. As a result, our Hybrid Quantum Algorithm with Genetic Optimization (HQAGO) solves search problems in O(2 (n-k)/2 ) oracle queries, where k is the number of fixed classical bits in the individuals' register.

TI Synergistic pretraining of parametrized quantum circuits via tensor
   networks
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Parametrized quantum circuits (PQCs) represent a promising framework for using present-day quantum hardware to solve diverse problems in materials science, quantum chemistry, and machine learning. We introduce a "synergistic" approach that addresses two prominent issues with these models: the prevalence of barren plateaus in PQC optimization landscapes, and the difficulty to outperform state-of-the-art classical algorithms. This framework first uses classical resources to compute a tensor network encoding a high-quality solution, and then converts this classical output into a PQC which can be further improved using quantum resources. We provide numerical evidence that this framework effectively mitigates barren plateaus in systems of up to 100 qubits using only moderate classical resources, with overall performance improving as more classical or quantum resources are employed. We believe our results highlight that classical simulation methods are not an obstacle to overcome in demonstrating practically useful quantum advantage, but rather can help quantum methods find their way.
   Scalable training of parametrised quantum circuit approaches is usually hindered by the barren plateau issue. Here, the authors show how initializing parametrised quantum circuits starting from scalable tensor-network based algorithms could ameliorate the problem.

TI Dynamical cluster-based strategy for improving tensor network algorithms
   in quantum circuit simulations
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB We optimize matrix-product state-based algorithms for simulating quantum circuits with finite fidelity, specifically the time-evolving block decimation (TEBD) and the density-matrix renormalization group (DMRG) algorithms, by exploiting the irregular arrangement of entangling operations in circuits. We introduce a variation of the standard TEBD algorithm, we termed "cluster-TEBD," which dynamically arranges qubits into entanglement clusters, enabling the exact contraction of multiple circuit layers in a single time step. Moreover, we enhance the DMRG algorithm by introducing an adaptive protocol, which analyzes the entanglement distribution within each circuit section to be contracted, dynamically adjusting the qubit grouping at each iteration. We analyze the performances of these enhanced algorithms in simulating both stabilizer and nonstabilizer randomstructured quantum circuits, with up to 1000 qubits and 100 layers of Clifford and non-Clifford gates, and in simulating Shor's quantum algorithm with up to hundreds of thousands of layers. Our findings show that, even with reasonable computational resources per task, cluster-based approaches can significantly speed up simulations of large-sized quantum circuits and improve the fidelity of the final states.

TI Simulating chemical reaction dynamics on quantum computer
SO JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS
AB The electronic energies of molecules have been successfully evaluated on quantum computers. However, more attention is paid to the dynamics simulation of molecules in practical applications. Based on the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) algorithm, Fedorov et al. proposed a correlated sampling (CS) method and demonstrated the vibrational dynamics of H-2 molecules [J. Chem. Phys. 154, 164103 (2021)]. In this study, we have developed a quantum approach by extending the CS method based on the VQE algorithm (labeled eCS-VQE) for simulating chemical reaction dynamics. First, the CS method is extended to the three-dimensional cases for calculation of first-order energy gradients, and then, it is further generalized to calculate the second-order gradients of energies. By calculating atomic forces and vibrational frequencies for H-2, LiH, H+ + H-2, and Cl- + CH3Cl systems, we have seen that the approach has achieved the CCSD level of accuracy. Thus, we have simulated dynamics processes for two typical chemical reactions, hydrogen exchange and chlorine substitution, and obtained high-precision reaction dynamics trajectories consistent with the classical methods. Our eCS-VQE approach, as measurement expectations and ground-state wave functions can be reused, is less demanding in quantum computing resources and is, therefore, a feasible means for the dynamics simulation of chemical reactions on the current noisy intermediate-scale quantum-era quantum devices.

TI Classical Simulation of Quantum Circuits by Half Gauss Sums
SO COMMUNICATIONS IN MATHEMATICAL PHYSICS
AB We give an efficient algorithm to evaluate a certain class of exponential sums, namely the periodic, quadratic, multivariate half Gauss sums. We show that these exponential sums become #P-hard to compute when we omit either the periodicity or quadraticity condition. We apply our results about these exponential sums to the classical simulation of quantum circuits, and give an alternative proof of the Gottesman-Knill theorem. We also explore a connection between these exponential sums and the Holant framework. In particular, we generalize the existing definition of affine signatures to arbitrary dimensions, and use our results about half Gauss sums to show that the Holant problem for the set of affine signatures is tractable.

TI Valley Two-Qubit System in a MoS2-Monolayer Gated Double Quantum dot
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB We explore a two-qubit system defined on valley isospins of two electrons confined in a gate-defined double quantum dot created within a MoS2 monolayer flake. We show how to initialize, control, interact, and read out such valley qubits by only electrical means using voltages applied to the local planar gates, which are layered on the top of the flake. By demonstrating the two-qubit exchange or readout via the Pauli blockade, we prove that valley qubits in the transition-metal-dichalcogenide semiconductor family fulfill the universality criteria and represent a scalable quantum-computing platform. Our numerical experiments are based on the tight-binding model for a MoS2 monolayer, which gives single-electron eigenstates that are then used to construct a basis of Slater determinants for the two-electron configuration space. We express screened electron-electron interactions in this basis by calculating the Coulomb matrix elements using localized Slater-type orbitals. Then we solve the time-dependent Schrodinger equation and obtain an exact time evolution of the two-electron system. During the evolution we simultaneously solve the Poison equation, finding the confinement potential controlled via voltages applied to the gates.

TI Predictive analysis of heart disease using quantum-assisted machine
   learning
SO DISCOVER APPLIED SCIENCES
AB Coronary heart disease (CHD) is a severe cardiac disease, and hence, its early diagnosis is essential as it improves treatment results and saves money on medical care. The prevailing development of quantum computing and machine learning (ML) technologies may bring practical improvement to the performance of CHD diagnosis. Quantum machine learning (QML) is receiving tremendous interest in various disciplines due to its higher performance and capabilities. Techniques for QML have the potential to forecast cardiac disease and help in early detection. To predict the risk of coronary heart disease, a hybrid approach utilising an ensemble machine learning model based on QML classifiers is presented in this paper. Our approach, with its unique ability to address multidimensional healthcare data, reassures the method's robustness by fusing quantum and classical ML algorithms in a multi-step inferential framework. Reducing cardiac morbidity and mortality requires early detection of heart disease. In this research, a hybrid approach utilises techniques with quantum computing capabilities to tackle complex problems that are not amenable to conventional ML algorithms and to minimise computational expenses. The proposed method has been developed in the Raspberry Pi 4B Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) platform and tested on a broad dataset that integrates clinical and imaging data from patients suffering from CHD and healthy controls. The proposed research is developed with a hybrid approach that combines different machine learning algorithms, such as KNN + RF, DT + RF, LR + RF, and Adaboost + RF, for diagnosing coronary illness with higher accuracy through feature selection. The proposed system performance obtained an accuracy of 99%, utilising 20000 datasets with 14 attributes from various datasets collected from the Local Pathology Lab in the Muzaffarnagar District of Uttar Pradesh, India. Compared to classical machine learning models, the accuracy, sensitivity, F1 score, and specificity of the proposed hybrid QML model used with CHD are manifold higher.

TI Dissipative dynamics of quantum correlation quantifiers under
   decoherence channels
SO EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL PLUS
AB In this work,/queryThe manuscript has been substantially edited for English language. Please check and approve. we investigate the dynamics of quantum correlations captured by entropic and geometric measures of discord under the influence of dissipative channels for widely used two qubit X state with maximally mixed marginals. Identifying the phenomena of the preservation, sudden change, and revival of quantum correlation quantifiers, we determine their hierarchy of robustness under memory-less decoherence channels. We find the analytical expressions of decoherence probabilities at which sudden change occurs when the first qubit is subjected to the decoherence channels for multiple times. We deduce the exact analytical expression for the preservation time, the duration for which quantum correlations remain unaffected by noise. We also find the time duration between the two sudden change phenomena of trace distance discord and show its inverse proportionality to the number of times a channel operates on the state. The constraint relations of decoherence probabilities corresponding to the sudden change region and preservation phenomena are obtained when both the qubits are subjected to locally independent quantum channels for multiple times. Our investigation provides physical insights and possible practical implementation of the discord measures in noisy environments.

TI High-Fidelity Spin Qubit Shuttling via Large Spin-Orbit Interactions
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Shuttling spins with high fidelity is a key requirement to scale up semiconducting quantum computers, enabling qubit entanglement over large distances and favoring the integration of control electronics on-chip. To decouple the spin from the unavoidable charge noise, state-of-the-art spin shuttlers try to minimize the inhomogeneity of the Zeeman field. However, this decoupling is challenging in otherwise promising quantum computing platforms such as hole spin qubits in silicon and germanium, characterized by a large spin-orbit interaction and an electrically tunable qubit frequency. In this work, we show that, surprisingly, the large inhomogeneity of the Zeeman field stabilizes the coherence of a moving spin state, thus also enabling high-fidelity shuttling in these systems. We relate this enhancement in fidelity to the deterministic dynamics of the spin that filters out the dominant low-frequency contributions of the charge noise. By simulating several different scenarios and noise sources, we show that this is a robust phenomenon generally occurring at large field inhomogeneity. By appropriately adjusting the motion of the quantum dot, we also design realistic protocols enabling faster and more coherent spin shuttling. Our findings are generally applicable to a wide range of setups and could pave the way toward large-scale quantum processors.

TI Efficient routing algorithm for trusted relay quantum key distribution
   networks via quantum reinforcement learning
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Trusted relay quantum key distribution networks (TR-QKDNs) have emerged as one of the most practical solutions for implementing large-scale QKDNs. The development of efficient routing algorithms is crucial to ensure adaptability to diverse network parameters and topologies. However, current approaches suffer from multiple limitations, including insufficient consideration of key influencing factors, excessive reliance on manually configured parameters, and scalability bottlenecks caused by the exponential complexity of classical algorithms. In this paper, we propose a quantum reinforcement learning-based routing algorithm, named hybrid quantum deep deterministic policy gradient (HQ-DDPG) that integrates a custom-designed quantum neural network (QNN) with the deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG), to intelligently balance multiple influencing factors and dynamically optimize routing decisions in TR-QKDNs. To reduce computational complexity, we further utilize a quantum single-source shortest path (QSSP) algorithm to compute the optimal routing path. Training results demonstrate that the proposed HQ-DDPG outperforms DDPG in terms of performance metrics, achieving nearly double the training convergence speed while reducing resource requirements by approximately 45 times and exhibiting superior network expressiveness. In typical network topology tests, the proposed algorithm consistently maintains a quantum key delivery ratio above 91.35% under high-load demand, significantly surpassing both DDPG and optimized link state routing (OLSR). Finally, leveraging distributed quantum computing, the proposed QNN enables efficient solutions for large-scale TR-QKDN problems with fewer quantum resources.

TI The dihedral hidden subgroup problem
SO JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL CRYPTOLOGY
AB The hidden subgroup problem (HSP) is a cornerstone problem in quantum computing, which captures many problems of interest and provides a standard framework algorithm for their study based on Fourier sampling, one class of techniques known to provide quantum advantage, and which succeeds for some groups but not others. The quantum hardness of the HSP problem for the dihedral group is a critical question for post-quantum cryptosystems based on learning with errors and also appears in subexponential algorithms for constructing isogenies between elliptic curves over a finite field. In this article, we give an updated overview of the dihedral hidden subgroup problem as approached by the "standard" quantum algorithm for HSP on finite groups, detailing the obstructions for strong Fourier sampling to succeed and summarizing other known approaches and results. In our treatment, we "contrast and compare" as much as possible the cyclic and dihedral cases, with a view to determining bounds for the success probability of a quantum algorithm that uses m m coset samples to solve the HSP on these groups. In the last sections, we prove a number of no-go results for the dihedral coset problem (DCP), motivated by a connection between DCP and cloning of quantum states. The proofs of these no-go results are then adapted to give nontrivial upper bounds on the success probability of a quantum algorithm that uses m m coset samples to solve DCP.

TI Efficiency Analysis of NIST-Standardized Post-Quantum Cryptographic
   Algorithms for Digital Signatures in Various Environments
SO ELECTRONICS
AB The advent of quantum computing presents a significant threat to the security of asymmetric cryptographic algorithms, necessitating the adoption of new cryptographic mechanisms resilient to quantum-based attacks. This need is particularly critical for applications that rely exclusively on public-key cryptography, such as digital signatures. This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of the performance of various post-quantum cryptographic algorithms, focusing specifically on NIST-standardized digital signature algorithms-SPHINCS+ and Dilithium-and their practical implementations. The study evaluates these algorithms across different programming languages to identify optimal environments for diverse applications. Comparative analyses with the widely used RSA algorithm reveal that the computational cost of adopting post-quantum cryptographic systems is relatively low. Notably, some post-quantum algorithms demonstrate performance advantages over classical RSA in specific scenarios.

AB The photonic quantum computer (PQC) is an emerging and promising quantum computing paradigm that has gained momentum in recent years. In PQC, computations are executed by performing measurements on photons in graph states (i.e., a collection of entangled photons). The graph state generation process is fulfilled by applying a sequence of quantum gates to quantum emitters, referred to as the "generation sequence". In a generation sequence, i) the time required to complete the generation sequence, ii) the number of quantum emitters used, and iii) the number of CZ gates performed between emitters greatly affect the fidelity of the generated graph state. In this paper, we propose RLGS (Reinforcement Learning-guided Graph State generation), a novel compilation framework to identify optimal generation sequences that optimize the three fidelity metrics. Experimental results show that RLGS achieves an average reduction in generation time of 31.1%, 49.6%, and 57.5% for small, medium, and large graph states compared to the baseline. Additionally, the reductions in the number of quantum emitters are 13.9%, 16.7%, and 17.5%, whereas the reductions in the number of CZ gates are 37.7%, 53.4%, and 57.8%, respectively.

TI Practical Security of Continuous Variable Measurement-
   Device-Independent Quantum Key Distribution with Local Local Oscillator
SO MATHEMATICS
AB Continuous-variable (CV) measurement-device-independent (MDI) quantum key distribution (QKD) can remove the feasible side-channel attacks on detectors based on the accurate Bell-state measurement (BSM), where an optical amplitude modulator (AM) plays a crucial role in managing the intensity of the transmitted light pulse. However, the AM-involved practical security has remained elusive as the operating frequency of the AM usually determines the actual secret key rate of the CV-MDI-QKD system. We find that an imperfect pulse generated from the AM at high speed can lead to a challenge to the practical security as a minor intensity change of the light pulse can bring about a potential information leakage. Taking advantage of this flaw, we suggest an attack strategy targeting the embedded AM in CV-MDI-QKD without sending the local oscillator (LO). This attack can damage the AM and thus decrease the estimated secret key rate of the system even when the orthogonal local LO (LLO) scheme is carried out. To assess the practical security risk resulting from the leaked information from the AM, we conduct numerical simulations to demonstrate the influence of the AM on the CVMDI-QKD system.

TI Parallelized telecom quantum networking with an ytterbium-171 atom array
SO NATURE PHYSICS
AB The integration of quantum computers and sensors into a quantum network enables new capabilities in quantum information science. Most networks with atom-like qubits operate at visible or near-ultraviolet wavelengths and require conversion to the telecom band for long-distance communication, which reduces efficiency and potentially introduces noise. Here we report high-fidelity entanglement between ytterbium-171 atoms and optical photons generated directly in the telecommunication band, where fibre loss is low. The nuclear spin of the atom is entangled with a single photon in the time-bin basis, yielding a high atom-measurement-corrected atom-photon Bell state fidelity. This can be further improved by addressing photon measurement errors. By imaging the atom array onto an optical fibre array, we also implement a parallelized networking protocol that can increase the remote entanglement rate proportionately with the number of channels. We also preserve coherence on a memory qubit during operations on communication qubits. These results support the integration of atomic systems into scalable quantum networks.

TI Countering detector manipulation attacks in quantum communication
   through detector self-testing
SO APL PHOTONICS
AB In practical quantum key distribution systems, imperfect physical devices open security loopholes that challenge the core promise of this technology. Apart from various side channels, a vulnerability of single-photon detectors to blinding attacks has been one of the biggest concerns and has been addressed both by technical means as well as advanced protocols. In this work, we present a countermeasure against such attacks based on self-testing of detectors to confirm their intended operation without relying on specific aspects of their inner working and to reveal any manipulation attempts. We experimentally demonstrate this countermeasure with a typical InGaAs avalanche photodetector, but the scheme can be easily implemented with any single photon detector.

TI Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm for MIMO With Quantized
   b-Bit Beamforming
SO IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN SIGNAL PROCESSING
AB Multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) is critical for 6G communication, offering improved spectral efficiency and reliability. However, conventional fully digital designs face significant challenges due to high hardware complexity and power consumption. Low-bit MIMO architectures, such as those employing b-bit quantized phase shifters, provide a cost-effective alternative but introduce NP-hard combinatorial problems in the pre- and post-coding design. This paper explores the use of the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) and alternating optimization to address the problem of b-bit quantized phase shifters both at the transmitter and the receiver. We demonstrate that the structure of this quantized beamforming problem aligns naturally with hybrid-classical methods like QAOA, as the phase shifts used in beamforming can be directly mapped to rotation gates in a quantum circuit. Notably, this paper is the first to show that theoretical connection. Then, the Hamiltonian derivation analysis for the b-bit case is presented, which could have applications in different fields, such as integrated sensing and communication, and emerging quantum algorithms such as quantum machine learning. In addition, a warm-start QAOA approach is studied which improves computational efficiency. Numerical results highlight the effectiveness of the proposed methods in achieving an improved quantized beamforming gain over their classical optimization benchmarks from the literature.

TI Floquet space exploration for the dual-dressing of a qubit
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB The application of a periodic nonresonant drive to a system allows the Floquet engineering of effective fields described by a broad class of quantum simulated Hamiltonians. The Floquet evolution is based on two different elements. The first one is a time-independent or stroboscopic evolution with an effective Hamiltonian corresponding to the quantum simulation target. The second element is the time evolution at the frequencies of the nonresonant driving and of its harmonics, denoted as micromotion. We examine experimentally and theoretically the harmonic dual-dressing Floquet engineering of a cold atomic two-level sample. Our focus is the dressing operation with small bare energies and large Rabi frequencies, where frequencies and amplitudes of the stroboscopic/micromotion time evolutions are comparable. At the kHz range of our dressed atom oscillations, we probe directly both the stroboscopic and micromotion components of the qubit global time evolution. We develop ad-hoc monitoring tools of the Floquet space evolution. The direct record of the time evolution following a pulsed excitation demonstrates the interplay between the two components of the spin precession in the Floquet space. From the resonant pumping of the dressed system at its evolution frequencies, Floquet eigenenergy spectra up to the fifth order harmonic of the dressing frequency are precisely measured as function of dressing parameters. Dirac points of the Floquet eigenenergies are identified and, correspondingly, a jump in the dynamical phase shift is measured. The stroboscopic Hamiltonian eigenfrequencies are measured also from the probe of the micromotion sidebands.These monitoring tools are appropriate for quantum simulation/computation investigations. Our results evidence that the stroboscopic phase shift of the qubit wavefunction contains an additional information that opens new simulation directions.

TI Accurate and precise quantum computation of valence two-neutron systems
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW C
AB Developing methods to solve nuclear many-body problems with quantum computers is an imperative pursuit within the nuclear physics community. Here, we introduce a quantum algorithm to accurately and precisely compute the ground state of valence two-neutron systems leveraging presently available noisy intermediatescale quantum devices. Our focus lies on the nuclei having a doubly magic core plus two valence neutrons in the p, sd, and pf shells, i.e., 6He, 18O, and 42Ca, respectively. Our ansatz, quantum circuit, is constructed in the pair-wise form, taking into account the symmetries of the system in an explicit manner, and enables us to reduce the number of qubits and the number of CNOT gates required. The results on a real quantum hardware by IBM Quantum Platform show that the proposed method gives very accurate results of the ground-state energies, which are typically within 0.1% error in the energy for 6He and 18O and at most 1% error for 42Ca. Furthermore, our experiments using real quantum devices also show the pivotal role of the circuit layout design, attuned to the connectivity of the qubits, in mitigating errors.

TI Emergence of Navier-Stokes Hydrodynamics in Chaotic Quantum Circuits
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB We construct an ensemble of two-dimensional nonintegrable quantum circuits that are chaotic but have a conserved particle current, and thus a finite Drude weight. The long-wavelength hydrodynamics of such systems is given by the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations. By analyzing circuit-to-circuit fluctuations in the ensemble we argue that these are negligible, so the circuit-averaged value of transport coefficients like the viscosity is also (in the long-time limit) the value in a typical circuit. The circuit-averaged transport coefficients can be mapped onto a classical irreversible Markov process. Therefore, remarkably, our construction allows us to efficiently compute the viscosity of a family of strongly interacting chaotic two-dimensional quantum systems.

TI A Quantum Computational Method for Corrosion Inhibition
SO JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL THEORY AND COMPUTATION
AB We present a hybrid classical-quantum computational pipeline for the determination of adsorption energies of a benzotriazole molecule on an aluminum alloy surface relevant for the transport industry, in particular to address the corrosion problem. The molecular adsorbate and substrate alloy were selected by interrogating molecular and materials databases, in search for desired criteria. The protocol can be generalized to other surfaces with arbitrary orientation and chemical composition, as well as to other molecular adsorbates. It includes three main steps based on mean-field electronic structure calculations, embedding theories and quantum algorithms. The quantum computing step demonstrated here with the variational quantum eigensolver is amenable to any other reliable quantum algorithm for ground-state energy estimation. Excited-state energies can also be taken into account in the quantum computing step, if the target reaction involves excited states.

TI Developing Secure Messaging Software using Post-Quantum Cryptography
SO ENGINEERING TECHNOLOGY & APPLIED SCIENCE RESEARCH
AB In this paper, a technique to develop a secure messaging service utilizing a new post-quantum cryptosystem, termed CryptoMess, is proposed. Commutative Supersingular Isogeny Diffie-Hellman (CSIDH) is utilized to secure key exchange paired with the AES algorithm to protect message content in communication. At the same time, the Rainbow post-quantum digital signature technology is incorporated to assure the integrity and authenticity of communications between the sender and the recipient. As a consequence, the messaging program is able to exchange messages between users, assuring safety, security, integrity, and authenticity. The performance of the program has a transmitting rate of approximately 0.26 s and a receiving rate of approximately 0.22 s. The message signing time is approximately 0.027 s, the message verification speed is approximately 0.22 s, and the key exchange time is approximately 0.0017s.

Activation of steering nonlocality is observed for different classes of mixed entangled states in linear network scenarios. Characterization of arbitrary two qubit states, in ambit of steering activation in network scenarios has been provided in this context. Using the notion of reduced steering, instances of steerability activation are also observed in nonlinear network. Present analysis involves three measurement settings scenario (for both trusted and untrusted parties) where steering nonlocality is distinguishable from Bell nonlocality.

TI Quantum optimization algorithms: Energetic implications
SO CONCURRENCY AND COMPUTATION-PRACTICE & EXPERIENCE
AB Since the dawn of quantum computing (QC), theoretical developments like Shor's algorithm proved the conceptual superiority of QC over traditional computing. However, such quantum supremacy claims are difficult to achieve in practice because of the technical challenges of realizing noiseless qubits. In the near future, QC applications will need to rely on noisy quantum devices that offload part of their work to classical devices. One way to achieve this is by using parameterized quantum circuits in optimization or even in machine learning tasks. The energy requirements of quantum algorithms have not yet been studied extensively. In this article, we explore several optimization algorithms using both theoretical insights and numerical experiments to understand their impact on energy consumption. Specifically, we highlight why and how algorithms like quantum natural gradient descent, simultaneous perturbation stochastic approximations or circuit learning methods, are at least 2x$$ 2\times $$ to 4x$$ 4\times $$ more energy efficient than their classical counterparts; why feedback-based quantum optimization is energy-inefficient; and how techniques like Rosalin can improve the energy efficiency of other algorithms by a factor of >=$$ \ge $$20x$$ \times $$. Finally, we use the NchooseK high-level programming model to run optimization problems on both gate-based quantum computers and quantum annealers. Empirical data indicate that these optimization problems run faster, have better success rates, and consume less energy on quantum annealers than on their gate-based counterparts.

TI Quantum Computing Applications in Supply Chain Information and
   Optimization: Future Scenarios and Opportunities
SO INFORMATION
AB Quantum computing is a groundbreaking innovation that can resolve complex supply chain problems that traditional computing techniques are unable to manage. Given a focus on information flow, optimization, and potential future applications, this study explores how supply chain management could utilize quantum computing. The study used a mixed-methods approach, including scenario modeling, case studies of prominent companies, and literature reviews. The study intends to evaluate the function of quantum computing in dynamic route optimization, investigate how it can enhance supply chain resilience, and examine how it could optimize the flow of information for decision-making processes. Findings demonstrate that quantum computing offers unprecedented computational power for scenario analysis and decision-making and operates exceptionally well in activities like dynamic route optimization, parcel packaging, and reorganization during disruptions. For instance, companies like DHL and FedEx utilize quantum systems to improve efficiency substantially. However, constraints like high implementation costs, cybersecurity weaknesses, and technological infancy prevent widespread acceptance. Further research should investigate hybrid solutions that integrate quantum and classical computing while addressing these obstacles. This paper concludes that although quantum computing has the potential to transform supply chains by improving information flow, resilience, and efficiency, its wider adoption will require overcoming current financial and technological challenges.

TI Path-encoded high-dimensional quantum communication over a 2-km
   multicore fiber
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Quantum key distribution (QKD) protocols based on high-dimensional quantum states have shown the route to increase the key rate generation while benefiting of enhanced error tolerance, thus overcoming the limitations of two-dimensional QKD protocols. Nonetheless, the reliable transmission through fiber links of high-dimensional quantum states remains an open challenge that must be addressed to boost their application. Here, we demonstrate the reliable transmission over a 2-km-long multicore fiber of path-encoded high-dimensional quantum states. Leveraging on a phase-locked loop system, a stable interferometric detection is guaranteed, allowing for low error rates and the generation of 6.3 Mbit/s of a secret key rate.

TI Heterogeneously integrated, superconducting silicon-photonic platform
   for measurement-device-independent quantum key distribution
SO ADVANCED PHOTONICS
AB Integrated photonics provides a route to both miniaturization of quantum key distribution (QKD) devices and enhancing their performance. A key element for achieving discrete-variable QKD is a single-photon detector. It is highly desirable to integrate detectors onto a photonic chip to enable the realization of practical and scalable quantum networks. We realize a heterogeneously integrated, superconducting silicon-photonic chip. Harnessing the unique high-speed feature of our optical waveguide-integrated superconducting detector, we perform the first optimal Bell-state measurement (BSM) of time-bin encoded qubits generated from two independent lasers. The optimal BSM enables an increased key rate of measurement-device-independent QKD (MDI-QKD), which is immune to all attacks against the detection system and hence provides the basis for a QKD network with untrusted relays. Together with the time-multiplexed technique, we have enhanced the sifted key rate by almost one order of magnitude. With a 125-MHz clock rate, we obtain a secure key rate of 6.166 kbps over 24.0 dB loss, which is comparable to the state-of-the-art MDI-QKD experimental results with a GHz clock rate. Combined with integrated QKD transmitters, a scalable, chip-based, and cost-effective QKD network should become realizable in the near future.

TI Mitigating Scattering in a Quantum System Using Only an Integrating
   Sphere
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Strong quantum correlated sources are essential but delicate resources for quantum information science and engineering protocols. Decoherence and loss are the two main disruptive processes that lead to the loss of nonclassical behavior in quantum correlations. In quantum systems, scattering can contribute to both decoherence and loss. In this work, we present an experimental scheme capable of significantly mitigating the adverse impact of scattering in quantum systems. Our quantum system is composed of a two-mode squeezed light generated with the four-wave-mixing process in hot rubidium vapor and a scatterer is introduced to one of the two modes. An integrating sphere is then placed after the scatterer to recollect the scattered photons. We use mutual information between the two modes as the measure of quantum correlations and demonstrate a 47.5% mutual information recovery from scattering, despite an enormous photon loss of greater than 85%. Our scheme is the very first step toward recovering quantum correlations from disruptive random processes and thus has the potential to bridge the gap between proof-of-principle demonstrations and practical real-world implementations of quantum protocols.

TI Modified conjugate quantum natural gradient
SO EPJ QUANTUM TECHNOLOGY
AB The efficient optimization of variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) is critical for their successful application in quantum computing. The Quantum Natural Gradient (QNG) method, which leverages the geometry of quantum state space, has demonstrated improved convergence compared to standard gradient descent (Stokes et al. in Quantum 4:269, 2020). In this work, we introduce the Modified Conjugate Quantum Natural Gradient (CQNG), an optimization algorithm that integrates QNG with principles from the nonlinear conjugate-gradient method. Unlike QNG, which employs a fixed learning rate, CQNG dynamically adjusts its hyperparameters at each step, enhancing both efficiency and flexibility. Numerical simulations show that CQNG achieves faster convergence and reduces quantum-resource requirements compared to QNG across various optimization scenarios, even when strict conjugacy conditions are not fully satisfied-hence the term "Modified Conjugate." These results highlight CQNG as a promising optimization technique for improving the performance of VQAs.

AB Several proposals have been recently introduced to implement Quantum Machine Learning (QML) algorithms for the analysis of classical data sets employing variational learning means. There has been, however, a limited amount of work on the characterization and analysis of quantum data by means of these techniques, so far. This work focuses on one such ambitious goal, namely the potential implementation of quantum algorithms allowing to properly classify quantum states defined over a single register of n qubits, based on their degree of entanglement. This is a notoriously hard task to be performed on classical hardware, due to the exponential scaling of the corresponding Hilbert space as 2(n). We exploit the notion of "entanglement witness", i.e., an operator whose expectation values allow to identify certain specific states as entangled. More in detail, we made use of Quantum Neural Networks (QNNs) in order to successfully learn how to reproduce the action of an entanglement witness. This work may pave the way to an efficient combination of QML algorithms and quantum information protocols, possibly outperforming classical approaches to analyse quantum data. All these topics are discussed and properly demonstrated through a simulation of the related quantum circuit model.

TI Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen steering based on semisupervised machine
   learning
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) steering is a kind of powerful nonlocal quantum resource in quantum information processing such as quantum cryptography and quantum communication. Many criteria have been proposed in the past few years to detect the steerability both analytically and numerically. Supervised machine learning such as support vector machines and neural networks have also been trained to detect the EPR steerability. To implement supervised machine learning, one needs a lot of labeled quantum states by using the semidefinite programming, which is very time consuming. We present a semisupervised support vector machine method which only uses a small portion of labeled quantum states in detecting quantum steering. We show that our approach can significantly improve the accuracies by detailed examples.

TI A Hybrid Quantum Image-Matching Algorithm
SO ENTROPY
AB Image matching is an important research topic in computer vision and image processing. However, existing quantum algorithms mainly focus on accurate matching between template pixels, and are not robust to changes in image location and scale. In addition, the similarity calculation of the matching process is a fundamentally important issue. Therefore, this paper proposes a hybrid quantum algorithm, which uses the robustness of SIFT (scale-invariant feature transform) to extract image features, and combines the advantages of quantum exponential storage and parallel computing to represent data and calculate feature similarity. Finally, the quantum amplitude estimation is used to extract the measurement results and realize the quadratic acceleration of calculation. The experimental results show that the matching effect of this algorithm is better than the existing classical architecture. Our hybrid algorithm broadens the application scope and field of quantum computing in image processing.

TI Probing multipartite entanglement, coherence and quantum information
   preservation under classical Ornstein-Uhlenbeck noise
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS A-MATHEMATICAL AND THEORETICAL
AB We address entanglement, coherence, and information protection in a system of four non-interacting qubits coupled with different classical environments, namely: common, bipartite, tripartite, and independent environments described by Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (ORU) noise. We show that quantum information preserved by the four qubit state is more dependent on the coherence than the entanglement using time-dependent entanglement witness, purity, and Shannon entropy. We find these two quantum phenomena directly interrelated and highly vulnerable in environments with ORU noise, resulting in the pure exponential decay of a considerable amount. The current Markovian dynamical map, as well as suppression of the fluctuating character of the environments, are observed to be entirely attributable to the Gaussian nature of the noise. The increasing number of environments are witnessed to speed up the amount of decay. Unlike other noises, the current noise parameter's flexible range is readily exploitable, ensuring long enough preserved memory properties. The four-qubit GHZ state, besides having a large information storage potential, stands partially entangled and coherent in common environments for an indefinite duration. In addition, we derive computational values for each system-environment interaction, which will help quantum practitioners to optimize the related classical environments.

TI Quantum annealing with pairs of 2E molecules as qubits
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB The rotational and fine structure of open-shell molecules in a E electronic state gives rise to crossings between Zeeman states of different parity. These crossings become avoided in the presence of an electric field. We propose an algorithm that encodes Ising models into qubits defined by pairs of 2E molecules sharing an excitation near these avoided crossings. This can be used to realize a transverse field Ising model tunable by an external electric or magnetic field, suitable for quantum annealing applications. We perform dynamical calculations for several examples with one- and two-dimensional connectivities. Our results demonstrate that the probability of obtaining valid annealing solutions is high and can be optimized by varying the annealing times.

TI Information capacity of quantum communication under natural physical
   assumptions
SO QUANTUM
AB The quantum prepare-and-measure scenario has been studied under various physical assumptions on the emitted states. Here, we first discuss how different assumptions are conceptually and formally related. We then identify one that can serve as a relaxation of all others, corresponding to a limitation on the one-shot accessible information of the state ensemble. This motivates us to study the optimal state discrimination probability of a source subject to these various physical assumptions. We derive general and tight bounds for states restricted by their quantum dimension, their vacuum component, an arbitrary uniform overlap, the magnitude of higher-dimensional signals and the experimenter's trust in their device. Our results constitute a first step towards a more unified picture of semi-device-independent quantum information processing.

TI Four-Dimensional Variational Data Assimilation Using the Second-Order
   Incremental Approach and Quantum Annealing
SO JOURNAL OF THE METEOROLOGICAL SOCIETY OF JAPAN
AB Four-dimensional variational data assimilation (4DVar) has been used as widely as ensemble Kalman filters (EnKFs) in meteorology and oceanography. Unlike EnKFs, 4DVar can be applied to strongly nonlinear regimes in data assimilation. A problem with 4DVar is that the cost function may have multiple minima, and that it can be difficult to find the global minimum using a gradient descent method. Quantum annealing can find the global minimum via quadratic unconstrained binary optimization. This study proposes a method of searching for the global minimum of the 4DVar cost function by combining a second-order incremental approach and quantum annealing, in which the latter provides guidance on where to explore in state space by minimizing an approximated cost function. This approximated cost function is constructed in low-dimensional space by expanding state variables up to the second order around a basic state. If the global minimum cannot be reached after a couple of updates of the basic state, the 4DVar analysis is replaced by an EnKF analysis in assimilation cycles. Data assimilation experiments using the Lorenz-63 model were conducted as a proof of concept of the proposed method. The results revealed that the proposed method significantly reduced the frequency of falling into local minima, and that the benefit of extending the length of the assimilation window was realized even in strongly nonlinear regimes. Data assimilation experiments in which simulated annealing was adopted instead of quantum annealing showed that quantum annealing exhibited comparable or better performance compared to simulated annealing.

SO QUANTUM INFORMATION PROCESSING
AB Counterfactual quantum communication is unique in its own way that allows remote parties to transfer information without sending any message carrier in the channel. Although no message carrier travels in the channel at the time of successful information transmission, it is impossible to transmit information faster than the speed of light, thus without an information carrier. In this paper, we address an important question "What carries the information in counterfactual quantum communication?" and optimize the resource efficiency of the counterfactual quantum communication in terms of the number of channels used, time consumed to transmit 1-bit classical information between two remote parties, and the number of qubits required to accomplish the counterfactual quantum communication.

TI Integration of a Quantum Voting Scheme into Grayscale Images Using the
   Novel Enhanced Quantum Representation and Qiskit Framework
SO MODELLING AND SIMULATION IN ENGINEERING
AB This paper illustrates the way a proposed quantum voting scheme can be designed in combination with a steganography technique called Least Significant Bit (LSB), by modifying a small number of pixels in multiple grayscale images. It combines the voting scheme with the novel enhanced quantum representation (NEQR) of an image, where the LSBs of these pixels represent the vote for each entity that takes part in the voting process. A server is also used, not only to count but also to guarantee the integrity of the votes (which is done inherently, by its design and quantum properties). The superdense coding circuit is part of the design, allowing each voter to use one qubit in order to transmit two classical bits (the vote value). The selected platform for testing this scheme is IBM Quantum Experience, together with the open-source framework called Qiskit (written in Python). This framework allows users to create various quantum circuits, using a wide selection of quantum gates, and then to simulate them, either on a simulator or on a real quantum device. The quantum circuits and the measurement results are also presented in this paper.

TI Multicarrier Multiplexing Continuous-Variable Quantum Key Distribution
   at Terahertz Bands Under Indoor Environment and in Inter-Satellite Links
   Communication
SO IEEE PHOTONICS JOURNAL
AB We propose a continuous-variable quantum key distribution (CVQKD) scheme at terahertz (THz) bands based on multicarrier multiplexing (MCM) technology. In this scheme, multiple Gaussian modulated subcarriers are coupled to transmit multipath superposed thermal Gaussian states. At the receiver, optical discrete Fourier transform (ODFT) is used to demultiplex the received subcarriers, and the keys can be generated in parallel by homodyne detection and past processing. We analyze the security of the scheme against the optimal collective Gaussian attack under indoor environment and in inter-satellite links respectively. Results indicate that by using MCM technology, each subchannel may he affected by crosstalk, resulting in slight shortening of the maximal transmission distance while the total secret key rate can he greatly increased. We also verify the feasibility of higher key rate and longer distance THz-QKD by using MCM technology in inter-satellite links communication. We expect this work will provide an efficient path to build a global quantum communication network.

TI Tower: Data Structures in Quantum Superposition
SO PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACM ON PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES-PACMPL
AB Emerging quantum algorithms for problems such as element distinctness, subset sum, and closest pair demonstrate computational advantages by relying on abstract data structures. Practically realizing such an algorithm as a program for a quantum computer requires an efficient implementation of the data structure whose operations correspond to unitary operators that manipulate quantum superpositions of data.
   To correctly operate in superposition, an implementation must satisfy three properties D reversibility, history independence, and bounded-time execution. Standard implementations, such as the representation of an abstract set as a hash table, fail these properties, calling for tools to develop specialized implementations.
   In this work, we present Core Tower, the first language for quantum programming with random-access memory. Core Tower enables the developer to implement data structures as pointer-based, linked data. It features a reversible semantics enabling every valid program to be translated to a unitary quantum circuit.
   We present Boson, the first memory allocator that supports reversible, history-independent, and constant-time dynamic memory allocation in quantum superposition. We also present Tower, a language for quantum programming with recursively defined data structures. Tower features a type system that bounds all recursion using classical parameters as is necessary for a program to execute on a quantum computer.
   Using Tower, we implement Ground, the first quantum library of data structures, including lists, stacks, queues, strings, and sets. We provide the first executable implementation of sets that satisfies all three mandated properties of reversibility, history independence, and bounded-time execution.

TI Detecting entanglement and nonlocality with minimum observable length
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB Quantum entanglement and nonlocality are foundational to quantum technologies, driving quantum computation, communication, and cryptography innovations. To benchmark the capabilities of these quantum techniques, efficient detection and accurate quantification methods are indispensable. This paper examines the concept 'detection length'-a metric that quantifies the minimum number of simultaneously measured particles required to detect entanglement or nonlocality. We extend the detection length framework to encompass various entanglement categories and nonlocality phenomena, providing a comprehensive analytical model to determine detection lengths for specified forms of entanglement. Furthermore, we exploit semidefinite programming techniques to design entanglement witnesses and Bell's inequalities tailored to specific minimal detection lengths, offering an upper bound for detection lengths in given states. By assessing the noise robustness of these witnesses, we demonstrate that witnesses with shorter detection lengths can exhibit superior performance under certain conditions.

TI Almost device-independent calibration beyond Born's rule: Bell tests for
   cross-talk detection
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB In quantum information, device-independent (DI) protocols offer a new approach to information processing tasks, making minimal assumptions about the devices used. Typically, since these protocols draw conclusions directly from the data collected in a meaningful Bell test, the no-signaling conditions, and often even Born's rule for local measurements, are taken as premises of the protocol. Here, we demonstrate how to test such premises in an (almost) DI setting, i.e. directly from the raw data and with minimal assumptions. In particular, for IBM's quantum computing cloud services, we implement the prediction-based ratio protocol to characterize how well the qubits can be accessed locally and independently. More precisely, by performing a variety of Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt-type experiments on these systems and carrying out rigorous hypothesis tests on the collected data, we provide compelling evidence showing that some of these qubits suffer from measurement cross-talks, i.e. their measurement statistics are affected by the choice of measurement bases on another qubit. Unlike standard randomized benchmarking, our approach does not rely on assumptions such as gate-independent Markovian noise. Moreover, despite the relatively small number of experimental trials, the direction of 'signaling' may also be identified in some cases. Our approach thus serves as a complementary tool for benchmarking the local addressability of quantum computing devices.

TI Two-Particle Scattering on Non-Translation Invariant Line Lattices
SO QUANTUM
AB Quantum walks have been used to develop quantum algorithms since their inception, and can be seen as an alternative to the usual circuit model; combining single-particle quantum walks on sparse graphs with two-particle scattering on a line lattice is sufficient to perform universal quantum computation. In this work we solve the problem of twoparticle scattering on the line lattice for a family of interactions without translation invariance, recovering the Bose-Hubbard interaction as the limiting case. Due to its generality, our systematic approach lays the groundwork to solve the more general problem of multi-particle scattering on general graphs, which in turn can enable design of different or simpler quantum gates and gadgets. As a consequence of this work, we show that a CPHASE gate can be achieved with high fidelity when the interaction acts only on a small portion of the line graph.

TI Clock synchronization with pulsed single photon sources
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Photonic quantum technology requires precise, time-resolved identification of photodetection events. In distributed quantum networks with spatially separated and drifting time references, achieving high precision is particularly challenging. Here we build on recent advances of using single-photons for time transfer and employ and quantify a fast postprocessing scheme designed to pulsed single-photon sources. We achieve an average root mean square synchronization jitter of 3.0 ps. The stability is comparable to systems with Rb vapor cell clocks with 19 ps at 1 s integration time, in terms of Allan time deviation. Remarkably, our stability is even better than classical high-precision time transfer, like the White Rabbit protocol, although we use significantly less signal (single-photon level). Our algorithms allow local processing of the data and do not affect the secure key rate. It compensates substantial clock imperfections from crystal oscillators and we foresee great potential for low signal scenarios. The findings are naturally suited to quantum communication networks and provide simultaneous time transfer without adding hardware or modifying the single-photon sources.

TI End-to-End Portfolio Optimization with Hybrid Quantum Annealing
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB Hybrid quantum-classical optimization has emerged as a promising direction for addressing financial decision problems under current quantum hardware constraints. In this work we present a practical end-to-end portfolio optimization pipeline that combines (i) a continuous mean-variance and Sharpe-ratio formulation, (ii) a QUBO/CQM-based discrete asset selection stage solved using D-Wave's hybrid quantum annealing solver, (iii) classical convex optimization for computing optimal asset weights, and (iv) a quarterly rebalancing mechanism. Rather than claiming quantum advantage, our goal is to evaluate the feasibility and integration of these components within a deployable financial workflow. We empirically compare our hybrid pipeline against a fund manager in real time and indexes used in Indian stock market. The results indicate that the proposed framework can construct diversified portfolios and achieve competitive returns. We also report computational considerations and scalability observations drawn from the hybrid solver behavior. While the experiments are limited to moderate sized portfolios dictated by current annealing hardware and QUBO embedding constraints, the study illustrates how quantum assisted selection and classical allocation can be combined coherently in a real-world setting. This work emphasizes methodological reproducibility and practical applicability, and aims to serve as a step toward larger-scale financial optimization workflows as quantum annealers continue to mature.

TI Magnon-assisted photon-phonon conversion in the presence of structured
   environments
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Quantum conversion or interface is one of the most prominent protocols in quantum information processing and quantum state engineering. We propose a photon-phonon conversion protocol in a hybrid magnomechanical system comprising a microwave optical mode, a driven magnon mode, and a mechanical-vibrating mode, which has attracted much interest and is expected to become a building block of the future quantum information network due to its controllability in coupling strengths. The microwave photons in the optical cavity are coupled to the magnons by the Zeeman interaction, and the latter are coupled to the mechanical phonons by the magnetostrictive interaction. With a strong photon-magnon interaction and a strong driving on the magnon, an effective Hamiltonian is constructed to describe the conversion between photons and phonons near their resonant point. The cavity-magnon system can then play the role of quantum memory. Moreover, the faithfulness of the photon-phonon conversion is estimated in terms of fidelities for state evolution and state-independent transfer. The former is discussed in the Lindblad master equation, taking account of the leakages of photons, phonons, and magnons into consideration. The latter is derived by the Heisenberg-Langevin equation considering the non-Markovian noise from the structured environments for both optical and mechanical modes. The state-evolution fidelity is found to be robust to the weak leakage. The transfer fidelity can be maintained by the Ohmic and sub-Ohmic environments of the photons and is insensitive to the 1/f noise of the phonons. Our work thus provides an interesting application for the magnon system as a photon-phonon converter in the microwave regime.

TI Finite-Size Security for Discrete-Modulated Continuous-Variable Quantum
   Key Distribution Protocols
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Discrete-modulated (DM) continuous-variable quantum key distribution (CV-QKD) protocols are promising candidates for commercial implementations of quantum communication networks due to their experimental simplicity. While tight security analyses in the asymptotic limit exist, proofs in the finitesize regime are still subject to active research. We present a composable finite-size security proof against independently and identically distributed collective attacks for a general DM CV-QKD protocol. We introduce a new energy testing theorem to bound the effective dimension of Bob's system and rigorously prove security within Renner's epsilon-security framework and address the issue of acceptance sets in protocols and their security proof. We want to highlight that our method also allows for nonunique acceptance statistics, which is necessary in practise. Finally, we extend and apply a numerical security proof technique to calculate tight lower bounds on the secure key rate. To demonstrate our method, we apply it to a quadrature phase-shift keying protocol for both untrusted, ideal and trusted, nonideal detectors. The results show that our security proof method yields secure finite-size key rates under experimentally viable conditions up to at least 72 km transmission distance.

TI Assessing the Precision of Quantum Simulation of Many-Body Effects in
   Atomic Systems Using the Variational Quantum Eigensolver Algorithm
SO QUANTUM REPORTS
AB The emerging field of quantum simulation of many-body systems is widely recognized as a very important application of quantum computing. A crucial step towards its realization in the context of many-electron systems requires a rigorous quantum mechanical treatment of the different interactions. In this pilot study, we investigate the physical effects beyond the mean-field approximation, known as electron correlation, in the ground state energies of atomic systems using the classical-quantum hybrid variational quantum eigensolver algorithm. To this end, we consider three isoelectronic species, namely Be, Li-, and B+. This unique choice spans three classes-a neutral atom, an anion, and a cation. We have employed the unitary coupled-cluster ans & auml;tz to perform a rigorous analysis of two very important factors that could affect the precision of the simulations of electron correlation effects within a basis, namely mapping and backend simulator. We carry out our all-electron calculations with four such basis sets. The results obtained are compared with those calculated by using the full configuration interaction, traditional coupled-cluster and the unitary coupled-cluster methods, on a classical computer, to assess the precision of our results. A salient feature of the study involves a detailed analysis to find the number of shots (the number of times a variational quantum eigensolver algorithm is repeated to build statistics) required for calculations with IBM Qiskit's QASM simulator backend, which mimics an ideal quantum computer. When more qubits become available, our study will serve as among the first steps taken towards computing other properties of interest to various applications such as new physics beyond the Standard Model of elementary particles and atomic clocks using the variational quantum eigensolver algorithm.

TI Fast, low-loss, all-optical phase modulation in warm rubidium vapour
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Low-loss high-speed switches are an integral component of future photonic quantum technologies, with applications in state generation, multiplexing, and the implementation of quantum gates. Phase modulation is one method of achieving this switching; however, existing optical phase modulators offer either high bandwidth or low loss-not both. We demonstrate fast (100 MHz bandwidth), low-loss ( 83(2)% transmission) phase shifting ( Delta phi=(0.90(5))pi) in a signal field, induced by a control field, and mediated by the two-photon 5S1/2 -> 5P3/2 -> 5D5/2 transition in 87Rb vapour. The all-optical nature of the scheme circumvents restrictions of electronic phase modulators, where bandwidth and repetition rate can be limited by the requirement to rapidly modulate high voltages. We discuss routes to enhance both performance and scalability for application to a range of quantum and classical technologies.

AB Photonic interconnects between quantum systems will play a central role in both scalable quantum computing and quantum networking. Entanglement of remote qubits via photons has been demonstrated in many platforms; however, improving the rate of entanglement generation will be instrumental for integrating photonic links into modular quantum computers. We present an ion trap system that has the highest reported free-space photon collection efficiency for quantum networking. We use a pair of in-vacuum aspheric lenses, each with a numerical aperture of 0.8, to couple 10(1)% of the 493 nm photons emitted from a Ba-138(+) ion into single-mode fibers. We also demonstrate that proximal effects of the lenses on the ion position and motion can be mitigated.

TI Single-qubit reaped quantum state tomography
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Quantum state tomography is the experimental procedure of determining an unknown state. It is not only essential for the verification of resources and processors of quantum information but is also important in its own right with regard to the foundation of quantum mechanics. Standard methods have been elusive for large systems because of the enormous number of observables to be measured and the exponential complexity of data post-processing. Here, we propose a new scheme of quantum state tomography that requires the measurement of only three observables (acting jointly on the system and pointer) regardless of the size of the system. The system is coupled to a "pointer" of single qubit, and the wavefunction of the system is "reaped" onto the pointer upon the measurement of the system. Subsequently, standard two-state tomography on the pointer and classical post-processing are used to reconstruct the quantum state of the system. We also developed an efficient and scalable iterative maximum likelihood algorithm to estimate states from statistically incomplete data.

AB In this article, we propose a quantum channel as a generative model of directional mid-price movements in a Limit Order Book (LOB). The observable stochastic evolution of the LOB's states is modeled as a time series of measurements of an 'ancilla' or 'emission' quantum system. The emission system is entangled with a second, unobservable quantum system representing the hidden dynamics of the LOB. The model is parameterized in the space of quantum circuits with mid-circuit measurements. While the proposed state process is Markovian, the observation process is generally not, allowing the model to capture both long- and short-term dependencies up to a fixed sequence length. The sequences of mid-price movement observations are formalized as a stochastic process language, defined by a set of finite distributions. A learning model and algorithm for these languages in the space of quantum channels are proposed. The quantum generative model is parsimonious, efficiently learnable, and analytically tractable. It provides analytical expressions of the probabilities of observed and future sequences of events. The implementation and the accuracy of the model are evaluated using historical LOB data. Our results demonstrate the potential of the quantum information processing models as a framework for studying of high frequency financial processes.

TI Constructing qudits from infinite-dimensional oscillators by coupling to
   qubits
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB An infinite-dimensional system such as a quantum harmonic oscillator offers a potentially unbounded Hilbert space for computation, but accessing and manipulating the entire state space requires a physically unrealistic amount of energy. When such a quantum harmonic oscillator is coupled to a qubit, for example via a Jaynes-Cummings interaction, it is well known that the total Hilbert space can be separated into independently accessible subspaces of constant energy, but the number of subspaces is still infinite. Nevertheless, a closed four-dimensional Hilbert space can be analytically constructed from the lowest energy states of the qubit-oscillator system. We extend this idea and show how a d-dimensional Hilbert space can be analytically constructed, which is closed under a finite set of unitary operations resulting solely from manipulating standard Jaynes-Cummings Hamiltonian terms. Moreover, we prove that the first-order sideband pulses and carrier pulses comprise a universal set for quantum operations on the qubit-oscillator qudit. This work suggests that the combination of a qubit and a bosonic system may serve as hardware-efficient quantum resources for quantum information processing.

TI Designing optimal Quantum Key Distribution Networks based on
   Time-Division Multiplexing of QKD transceivers: qTDM-QKDN
SO FUTURE GENERATION COMPUTER SYSTEMS-THE INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ESCIENCE
AB Time-sharing of Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) transceivers with the help of optical switches and a central Software-Defined Networking (SDN) controller is a promising technique to better amortize the large investments required to build a Quantum Key Distribution Network (QKDN). In this work, we investigate the implications of introducing Time-Division Multiplexing (TDM) in trusted-relay QKDNs at the wide-area network scale in terms of performance and cost-saving. To this end, we developed both a Mixed Integer Linear Programming (qTDM-MILP) model and a Heuristic Algorithm (qTDM-HA) to solve the allocation of QKD transceivers and network resources for a novel switched QKDN operating scheme: qTDM-QKDN. Our heuristic method provides a close-to-optimal resource planning for the offline problem that computes the minimum number of QKD transceivers and optical switch ports at each node, as well as the number of quantum channels on each link required to satisfy a target set of end-to-end secret-keyrate demands. Moreover, both the model and the heuristic provide the time fractions that each QKD transceiver needs to peer with each neighbor QKD transceiver. We compared our proposed model and heuristic algorithm for cost minimization with non-time sharing QKD transceivers (nTDM) as baseline. The results show that qTDM can achieve substantial cost-savings in the range of 10%-40% compared to nTDM. Furthermore, this work sheds light on the selection of the value for the working cycle T and its influence on network performance.

TI Zero-Field ODMR and relaxation of Si-vacancy centers in 6H-SiC
SO MATERIALS RESEARCH EXPRESS
AB Silicon vacancies in silicon carbide (SiC) have been proposed as interesting candidates for quantum technology applications such as quantum sensing and quantum repeaters. SiC exists in many polytypes with different plane stacking sequences, and in each polytype, the vacancies can occupy a variety of different lattice sites. In this work, we focus on the three important charged silicon vacancies in the 6H-SiC polytype. We record the photoluminescence and continuous-wave optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) spectra at different radio-frequency power levels and different temperatures. We individually select the zero-phonon lines of the different silicon vacancies at low temperatures and record the corresponding ODMR spectra. ODMR allows us to correlate optical and magnetic resonance spectra and thereby separate signals from V-1 and V-3. The results also explain the observed sign change of the ODMR signal as a function of temperature.

TI Quantum Algorithms for Calculating Determinant and Inverse of Matrix and
   Solving Linear Algebraic Systems
SO QUANTUM INFORMATION & COMPUTATION
AB We propose quantum algorithms, purely quantum in nature, for calculating the determinant and inverse of an (N - 1) x (N - 1) matrix (depth is O(N-2 log N)) which is a simple modification of the algorithm for calculating the determinant of an N x N matrix (depth is O(N log(2)N)). The basic idea is to encode each row of the matrix into a pure state of some quantum system. In addition, we use the representation of the elements of the inverse matrix in terms of algebraic complements. This algorithm together with that for matrix multiplication proposed earlier yields the algorithm for solving systems of linear algebraic equations (depth is O(N log(2)N)). Measurement of the ancilla state with output 1 (probability is similar to 2(-O(N log N))) removes the garbage acquired during calculation. Appropriate circuits for all three algorithms are presented and have the same estimation O(N log N) for the space (number of qubits in the circuit).

TI Exploring Quantum Computing for Metal Cluster Analysis
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY A
AB This study explores the application of quantum computing to metal cluster analysis through the development and implementation of a quantum-DFT embedding workflow. Classical computational methods, while transformative, often face limitations in achieving chemical accuracy and computational efficiency, particularly for nanoscale systems. To address these challenges, we integrate the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) with density functional theory (DFT), leveraging the capabilities of quantum computing aiming to improve the modeling of electronic structures. Aluminum and gold clusters were used as model systems to test the established workflow. The workflow successfully determined electronic properties for aluminum clusters up to Al7 -. Although gold clusters were used as a test case to investigate the potential reduction of nitric oxide (NO), memory limitations, the lack of relativistic corrections, and the inability to handle open-shell systems presented challenges that underscore the need for advancements in quantum hardware and algorithms. This proof-of-concept study demonstrates the potential of quantum DFT embedding to advance materials discovery, including applications in catalysis and nanomaterial design, while providing insights into the current limitations of near-term quantum devices.

TI Artificial intelligence for quantum computing
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Artificial intelligence (AI) advancements over the past few years have had an unprecedented and revolutionary impact across everyday application areas. Its significance also extends to technical challenges within science and engineering, including the nascent field of quantum computing (QC). The counterintuitive nature and high-dimensional mathematics of QC make it a prime candidate for AI's data-driven learning capabilities, and in fact, many of QC's biggest scaling challenges may ultimately rest on developments in AI. However, bringing leading techniques from AI to QC requires drawing on disparate expertise from arguably two of the most advanced and esoteric areas of computer science. Here we aim to encourage this cross-pollination by reviewing how state-of-the-art AI techniques are already advancing challenges across the hardware and software stack needed to develop useful QC - from device design to applications. We then close by examining its future opportunities and obstacles in this space.

TI ADVANCES IN SYSTEMS EVOLUTION THROUGH QUANTUM CORRELATIONS WITHIN
   ENGINEERING APPLICATIONS
SO FRACTALS-COMPLEX GEOMETRY PATTERNS AND SCALING IN NATURE AND SOCIETY
AB In this paper, we explore the dynamics of quantum correlations in an isolated physical quantum under the influence of intrinsic coherence. We characterize the quantum correlations in the hybrid system using the granular model to investigate the amount of coherent-chaotic fractions, and we particularly use the spherical droplets to measure the specific correlations. Likewise, we examine the effect of coherence on the source evolution of these quantifiers within engineering applications. In particular, the behavior of the multiparticle correlations in terms of the system parameters and the coherence rate is investigated and analyzed in detail to explore the source intrinsic dimensions. We found that the correlations with genuine interferences behave slightly unsymmetrical for identical parameters characterizing the considered complex system and that the genuine correlations are more meaningful than primary interference which probed the chaotic peculiarities against the coherence phenomena. Our results also show that the robustness of quantum correlations can be modulated by adjusting the coherent rate, source physical properties and the initial conditions.

TI Reducing T-count and T-depth in approximate quantum Fourier transform
   circuits
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB The quantum Fourier transform (QFT) is a fundamental component in various quantum algorithms, including Shor's factoring algorithm and the Harrow-Hassidim-Lloyd (HHL) algorithm for solving systems of linear equations. Efficient implementation of the QFT is essential for the practical realization of large-scale quantum algorithms, especially in fault-tolerant quantum computing. In fault-tolerant implementations, the Clifford + T gate library is the standard choice for building quantum circuits. As the most resource-intensive component within this framework, the T gate's associated cost poses a significant challenge to the efficient implementation of the QFT and its dependent algorithms. While approximate QFT (AQFT) circuits reduce this cost, state-of-the-art implementations still require a T-count of 8nlog(2)(n/epsilon)-O(log(2)(n/epsilon)) and a T-depth of nlog(2)(n/epsilon)+O(n). Although these results represent a notable achievement, the associated resource cost remains a primary bottleneck for practical, large-scale quantum algorithms, motivating further optimization. To address this bottleneck, this paper introduces two novel n-qubit AQFT circuits with an approximation error of O(epsilon). Our first design, AQFT Circuit 1, halves the T-count to 4nlog(2)(n/epsilon)-O(log(2)(n/epsilon)) by constructing inverse phase gradient transformation (PGT) circuits without using additional non-Clifford gates and by implementing the inverse PGTs using quantum adders. Our second design, AQFT Circuit 2, reduces the T-depth to 1/2nlog(2)(n/epsilon)+O(n) through parallelization of the inverse PGTs that add only O(n) additional T gates. For both AQFT circuits, the state-of-the-art linear-depth quantum adder is employed. We demonstrate that employing the linear-depth quantum adder provides advantages over the currently known logarithmic-depth quantum adder, not only in terms of T-count but also in T-depth optimization for the AQFT, particularly within the range 3<n/epsilon<10(13), which encompasses practical system sizes.

TI Phononic modulation of spin-lattice relaxation in molecular qubit
   frameworks
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB The solid-state integration of molecular electron spin qubits could promote the advancement of molecular quantum information science. With highly ordered structures and rational designability, microporous framework materials offer ideal matrices to host qubits. They exhibit tunable phonon dispersion relations and spin distributions, enabling optimization of essential qubit properties including the spin-lattice relaxation time (T1) and decoherence time. In this study, through spin dynamic and vibrational spectroscopic characterizations of two radical-embedded framework materials, we show that hydrogen-bonded networks give rise to a low Debye temperature of acoustic phonons and generates sub-terahertz optical phonons, both of which facilitate spin-lattice relaxation. Whereas deuterating hydrogen-bonded networks reduces both phonon frequencies and T1, eliminating such flexible structural motifs raises phonon dispersions and improves the T1 by one to two orders of magnitude. The phononic tunability of spin-lattice relaxation in molecular qubit frameworks would facilitate the development of solid-state qubits operating at elevated temperatures.

AB The rapid development of quantum computing poses a significant threat to the security of current cryptographic systems, including those used in User Equipment (UE) for mobile communications. Conventional cryptographic algorithms such as Rivest-Shamir-Adleman (RSA) and Elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) are vulnerable to quantum computing attacks, which could jeopardize the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of sensitive data transmitted by UEs. This demo paper proposes the integration of Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) in TLS for UE Communication to mitigate the risks of quantum attacks. We present our setup and explain each of the components used. We also provide the entire workflow of the demo for other researchers to replicate the same setup. By addressing the implementation of PQC within a 5G network to secure UE-to-UE communication, this research aims to pave the way for developing quantum-resistant mobile devices and securing the future of wireless communications.

TI Toward Axion Signal Extraction in Semiconductor Spin Qubits via Spectral
   Engineering
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM ENGINEERING
AB Recent advances in quantum sensing and computational technologies indicate the possibility of improving the precision of measurements aimed at detecting cosmological particles and weakly interacting massive particles using various qubit platforms. While recent progress has been made, mitigating environmental noise remains a challenge in extracting particle parameters with high fidelity. Addressing these challenges requires efforts on two levels. At the device level, the qubit and its array acting as a probe must be isolated from electrical and magnetic noise through optimized device geometry. At the signal processing level, it is necessary to develop filtering methods targeting specific noise spectra based on different qubit architectures. In this work, we explore the possibility of using semiconductor quantum dot spin qubits as a platform to search for quantum chromodynamics (QCD) axions and, more broadly, axion-like particles. Starting by deriving an effective Hamiltonian for electron-axion interactions, we identify an axion-induced effective magnetic field and determine the characteristic axion oscillation frequency. To suppress charge noise in the devices and environmental noise, we first analyze the charge noise spectrum and then develop a dedicated filtering and noise-reduction protocol, paving the way for exploring feasible axion mass ranges. Our preliminary study holds promise for enhancing the screening of various axion signals using quantum technologies. We expect that our analysis and filtering protocol can help advance the use of semiconductor quantum dot spin qubit arrays in axion detection.

SO OPTICS LETTERS
AB The optical interfacing between a free-space channel and single-photon detectors (SPDs) can greatly impact the inherent performance of a free-space quantum key distribution receiver. Direct coupling to detectors creates engineering challenges, and a single-mode fiber requires adaptive optics. Using a multimode fiber (MMF) is common; however, larger core diameters limit the achievable bandwidth. We demonstrate a prototype multimode fiber-based photonic lantern that allows us to retain the benefits of the large multimode coupling while transitioning to multiple, less multimodal fibers, reducing bandwidth limitation.

TI High-fidelity entangling gates for electron and nuclear spin qubits in
   diamond
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB Motivated by the recent experimental progress in exploring the use of a nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond as a quantum computing platform, we propose schemes for fast and high-fidelity entangling gates on this platform. Using both analytical and numerical calculations, we demonstrate that synchronization effects between resonant and off-resonant transitions may be exploited such that spin-flip errors due to strong driving may be eliminated by adjusting the gate time or the driving field. This allows for fast, high-fidelity entangling operations between the electron spin and one or several nuclear spins. We investigate a two-qubit system where the NV center comprises a N-15 atom and a qubit-qutrit system for the case of a N-14 atom. In both cases, we predict a complete suppression of off-resonant driving errors for two-qubit gates when addressing the NV electron spin conditioned on states of nuclear spins of the nitrogen atom of the defect. Additionally, we predict fidelities >0.99 for multiqubit gates when including the surrounding C-13 atoms in the diamond lattice in the conditioned logic.

TI Optimizing Initial State of Detector Sensors in Quantum Sensor Networks
SO ACM TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM COMPUTING
AB In this article, we consider a network of quantum sensors, where each sensor is a qubit detector that "fires," i.e., its state changes when an event occurs close by. The change in state due to the firing of a detector is given by a unitary operator, which is the same for all sensors in the network. Such a network of detectors can be used to localize an event, using a protocol to determine the firing sensor, presumably the one closest to the event. The determination of the firing sensor can be posed as a Quantum State Discrimination problem, which incurs a probability of error depending on the initial state and the measurement operators used.
   In this article, we address the problem of determining the optimal initial global state of a network of detectors that incur a minimum probability of error in determining the firing sensor. For this problem, we derive necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of an initial state that allows for perfect discrimination, i.e., zero probability of error. Using insights from this result, we derive a conjectured optimal solution for the initial state, provide a pathway to prove the conjecture, and validate the conjecture empirically using multiple search heuristics that seem to perform near-optimally.

TI Three-fold way of entanglement dynamics in monitored quantum circuits
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS A-MATHEMATICAL AND THEORETICAL
AB We investigate the measurement-induced entanglement transition in quantum circuits built upon Dyson's three circular ensembles (circular unitary, orthogonal, and symplectic ensembles; CUE, COE and CSE). We utilise the established model of a one-dimensional circuit evolving under alternating local random unitary gates and projective measurements performed with tunable rate, which for gates drawn from the CUE is known to display a transition from extensive to intensive entanglement scaling as the measurement rate is increased. By contrasting this case to the COE and CSE, we obtain insights into the interplay between the local entanglement generation by the gates and the entanglement reduction by the measurements. For this, we combine exact analytical random-matrix results for the entanglement generated by the individual gates in the different ensembles, and numerical results for the complete quantum circuit. These considerations include an efficient rephrasing of the statistical entangling power in terms of a characteristic entanglement matrix capturing the essence of Cartan's KAK decomposition, and a general result for the eigenvalue statistics of antisymmetric matrices associated with the CSE.

TI Practical Performance Analysis of MDI-QKD with Orbital Angular Momentum
   on UAV Relay Platform
SO ENTROPY
AB The integration of terrestrial- and satellite-based quantum key distribution (QKD) experiments has markedly advanced global-scale quantum networks, showcasing the growing maturity of quantum technologies. Notably, the use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) as relay nodes has emerged as a promising method to overcome the inherent limitations of fiber-based and low-Earth orbit (LEO) satellite connections. This paper introduces a protocol for measurement-device-independent QKD (MDI-QKD) using photon orbital angular momentum (OAM) encoding, with UAVs as relay platforms. Leveraging UAV mobility, the protocol establishes a secure and efficient link, mitigating threats from untrusted UAVs. Photon OAM encoding addresses reference frame alignment issues exacerbated by UAV jitter. A comprehensive analysis of atmospheric turbulence, state-dependent diffraction (SDD), weather visibility, and pointing errors on free-space OAM-state transmission systems was conducted. This analysis elucidates the relationship between the key generation rate and propagation distance for the proposed protocol. Results indicate that considering SDD significantly decreases the key rate, halving previous data results. Furthermore, the study identifies a maximum channel loss capacity of 26 dB for the UAV relay platform. This result is pivotal in setting realistic parameters for the deployment of UAV-based quantum communications and lays the foundation for practical implementation strategies in the field.

Here we show that robust and abundant spin-1/2 species can be created in situ in the solid state from spin-active azafullerene C59N cages supramolecularly hosted in crystals of [10]cycloparaphenylene ([10]CPP) nanohoops. This is achieved via a two-stage thermally-assisted homolysis of the parent diamagnetic [10]CPP superset of(C59N)(2)subset of[10]CPP supramolecular complex. Upon cooling, the otherwise unstable C59N radical is remarkably persistent with a measured radical lifetime of several years. Additionally, pulsed electron paramagnetic resonance measurements show long coherence times, fulfilling a basic condition for any qubit manipulation, and observed Rabi oscillations demonstrate single qubit operation. These findings together with rapid recent advances on the synthesis of carbon nanohoops offer the potential to fabricate tailored cycloparaphenylene networks hosting C59N centers, providing a promising platform for building complex qubit circuits.

TI Finding eigenvectors with a quantum variational algorithm
SO QUANTUM INFORMATION PROCESSING
AB This paper presents a hybrid variational quantum algorithm that finds a random eigenvector of a unitary matrix with a known quantum circuit. The algorithm is based on the SWAP test on trial states generated by a parametrized quantum circuit. The eigenvector is described by a compact set of classical parameters that can be used to reproduce the found approximation to the eigenstate on demand. This variational eigenvector finder can be adapted to solve the generalized eigenvalue problem, to find the eigenvectors of normal matrices and to perform quantum principal component analysis on unknown input mixed states. These algorithms can all be run with low-depth quantum circuits, suitable for an efficient implementation on noisy intermediate-scale quantum computers and, with some restrictions, on linear optical systems. In full-scale quantum computers, where there might be optimization problems due to barren plateaus in larger systems, the proposed algorithms can be used as a primitive to boost known quantum algorithms. Limitations and potential applications are discussed.

TI Quantum decoherence in the Caldeira-Leggett model by the real-time path
   integral on a computer
SO JOURNAL OF HIGH ENERGY PHYSICS
AB We propose first-principle calculations of an open system based on the real-time path integral formalism treating the environment as well as the system of our interest together on a computer. The sign problem that occurs in applying Monte Carlo methods can be overcome in general by using the so-called Lefschetz thimble method, which has been developed over the past decade. Here we focus on the Caldeira-Leggett model, which is well known, in particular, as a model of quantum decoherence. In this case, the calculation simplifies drastically since the path integral becomes Gaussian for typical initial conditions. The relevant saddle point, which is unique and complex, can be determined by solving a linear equation with a huge but sparse coefficient matrix, and the integration over the Lefschetz thimble can be performed analytically. Thus we obtain, without assumptions or approximations, the reduced density matrix after a long-time evolution, tracing out a large number of harmonic oscillators in the environment. In particular, we confirm the dependence of the decoherence time on the coupling constant and the temperature that has been predicted from the master equation in a certain parameter regime.

TI Strong coupling between a microwave photon and a singlet-triplet qubit
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Combining superconducting resonators and quantum dots has triggered tremendous progress in quantum information, however, attempts at coupling a resonator to even charge parity spin qubits have resulted only in weak spin-photon coupling. Here, we integrate a zincblende InAs nanowire double quantum dot with strong spin-orbit interaction in a magnetic-field resilient, high-quality resonator. The quantum confinement in the nanowire is achieved using deterministically grown wurtzite tunnel barriers. Our experiments on even charge parity states and at large magnetic fields, allow us to identify the relevant spin states and to measure the spin decoherence rates and spin-photon coupling strengths. We find an anti-crossing between the resonator mode in the single photon limit and a singlet-triplet qubit with a spin-photon coupling strength of g/2 pi = 139 +/- 4 MHz. This coherent coupling exceeds the resonator decay rate kappa/2 pi = 19.8 +/- 0.2 MHz and the qubit dephasing rate gamma/2 pi = 116 +/- 7 MHz, putting our system in the strong coupling regime.
   By coupling a spin-qubit to a superconducting resonator, remote spin-entanglement becomes feasible. Here, Ungerer et al achieve strong coupling between a superconducting resonator and a singlet-triplet spin qubit, in an InAs nanowire.

TI Fundamental limits for reciprocal and nonreciprocal non-Hermitian
   quantum sensing
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Non-Hermitian dynamics has been widely studied to enhance the precision of quantum sensing; and nonreciprocity can be a powerful resource for non-Hermitian quantum sensing, as nonreciprocity allows to arbitrarily exceed the fundamental bound on the measurement rate of any reciprocal sensors. Here we establish fundamental limits on signal-to-noise ratio for reciprocal and nonreciprocal non-Hermitian quantum sensing. In particular, for two-mode linear systems with two coherent drives, an approximately attainable uniform bound on the best possiblemeasurement rate per photon is derived for both reciprocal and nonreciprocal sensors. This bound is only related to the coupling coefficients and, in principle, can be made arbitrarily large. Our results thus demonstrate that a conventional reciprocal sensor with two drives can simulate any nonreciprocal sensor. This work also demonstrates a clear signature on how the excitation signals affect the signal-to-noise ratio in non-Hermitian quantum sensing.

AB Generating a long-distance quantum state with genuine quantum correlation (GQC) is one of the most essential functions of quantum networks to support quantum communication. Here, we provide a deterministic scheme for generating multimode Gaussian states with certain GQC (including genuine entanglement). Efficient algorithms of generating multimode states are also proposed. Our scheme is useful for resolving the bottleneck in generating some multimode Gaussian states and may pave the way towards real world applications of preparing multipartite quantum states in current quantum technologies.

TI Open quantum system approaches to superconducting qubits
SO QUANTUM INFORMATION PROCESSING
AB Superconducting qubits are currently a leading platform for developing a scalable quantum computer. However, random and uncontrollable noises from the environment during the design and measurement of qubits lead to limitations in qubit coherence time and gate fidelity, which is a major challenge in current state of the art for superconducting quantum computing. To advance superconducting qubits technologies, it is essential to understand and mitigate environmentally-induced errors. This requires modeling superconducting qubits as open quantum systems coupled to their surroundings. The present study aims to provide useful open quantum system approaches to analyze and quantify the interaction between superconducting qubits and their environments. We provide an accessible introduction to open quantum system formalism for newcomers to the field. For experts, we discuss recently developed methods for analyzing superconducting qubit dynamics under realistic noises. We outline how these techniques provide quantitative insights into decoherence mechanisms and how they can guide design improvements to enhance qubit coherence time. This self-contained review of open quantum system approaches can be used to model, understand, and improve superconducting qubit performance in the presence of unavoidable environmental noises.

TI Quantum algorithm for alchemical optimization in material design
SO CHEMICAL SCIENCE
AB The development of tailored materials for specific applications is an active field of research in chemistry, material science and drug discovery. The number of possible molecules obtainable from a set of atomic species grow exponentially with the size of the system, limiting the efficiency of classical sampling algorithms. On the other hand, quantum computers can provide an efficient solution to the sampling of the chemical compound space for the optimization of a given molecular property. In this work, we propose a quantum algorithm for addressing the material design problem with a favourable scaling. The core of this approach is the representation of the space of candidate structures as a linear superposition of all possible atomic compositions. The corresponding 'alchemical' Hamiltonian drives the optimization in both the atomic and electronic spaces leading to the selection of the best fitting molecule, which optimizes a given property of the system, e.g., the interaction with an external potential as in drug design. The quantum advantage resides in the efficient calculation of the electronic structure properties together with the sampling of the exponentially large chemical compound space. We demonstrate both in simulations and with IBM Quantum hardware the efficiency of our scheme and highlight the results in a few test cases. This preliminary study can serve as a basis for the development of further material design quantum algorithms for near-term quantum computers.

TI Universal quantum gate set for Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill logical qubits
SO NATURE PHYSICS
AB Conventional approaches towards creating a large-scale, fault-tolerant quantum computer require an error correction scheme that uses multiple physical qubits to encode one logical qubit of protected quantum information. A key limiting factor in realizing error-corrected quantum information processing is the large ratio of physical-to-logical qubits required by many error correction codes, outstripping the size of near-term devices. The Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) code offers hardware efficiency at the cost of increased encoding complexity by encoding a logical qubit into a single quantum harmonic oscillator. Building on earlier demonstrations of GKP-encoded operations, we realize an entangling gate on GKP logical qubits. Our experiments use an optimal control strategy that deterministically implements a universal set of energy-preserving logical gates on finite-energy GKP states encoded in the mechanical motions of a trapped ion. We also directly generate a GKP Bell state starting from vacuum. Our approach is compatible with existing hardware architectures, demonstrating the potential for optimal control techniques with advanced encoding schemes to accelerate the path towards large-scale fault-tolerant quantum information processing.

AB In a quantum network that successfully creates links-shared Bell states between neighboring repeater nodes-with probability p in each time slot, and performs Bell State Measurements at nodes with success probability q < 1, the end-to-end entanglement generation rate drops exponentially with the distance between consumers, despite multi-path routing. If repeaters can perform multi-qubit projective measurements in the GHZ basis that succeed with probability q, the rate does not change with distance in a certain (p, q) region, but decays exponentially outside. This region where the distance-independent rate occurs is the super-critical region of a new percolation problem. We extend this GHZ protocol to incorporate a time-multiplexing blocklength k, the number of time slots over which a repeater can mix-and-match successful links to perform fusion on. As k increases, the super-critical region expands. For a given (p, q), the entanglement rate initially increases with k, and once inside the super-critical region for a high enough k, it decays as 1/k GHZ states per time slot. When memory coherence time exponentially distributed with mean mu is incorporated, it is seen that increasing k does not indefinitely increase the super-critical region; it has a hard mu-dependent limit. Finally, we find that incorporating space-division multiplexing, i.e., running the above protocol independently in up to d disconnected network regions, where d is the network's node degree, one can go beyond the 1 GHZ state per time slot rate that the above randomized local-link-state protocol cannot surpass. As (p, q) increases, one can approach the ultimate min-cut entanglement-generation capacity of d GHZ states per slot.

SO FUTURE GENERATION COMPUTER SYSTEMS-THE INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ESCIENCE
AB Quantum computing is one of the most enticing computational paradigms with the potential to revolutionize diverse areas of future -generation computational systems. While quantum computing hardware has advanced rapidly, from tiny laboratory experiments to quantum chips that can outperform even the largest supercomputers on specialized computational tasks, these noisy -intermediate scale quantum (NISQ) processors are still too small and non -robust to be directly useful for any real -world applications. In this paper, we describe NASA's work in assessing and advancing the potential of quantum computing. We discuss advances in algorithms, both near- and longer -term, and the results of our explorations on current hardware as well as with simulations, including illustrating the benefits of algorithm -hardware co -design in the NISQ era. This work also includes physics -inspired classical algorithms that can be used at application scale today. We discuss innovative tools supporting the assessment and advancement of quantum computing and describe improved methods for simulating quantum systems of various types on high-performance computing systems that incorporate realistic error models. We provide an overview of recent methods for benchmarking, evaluating, and characterizing quantum hardware for error mitigation, as well as insights into fundamental quantum physics that can be harnessed for computational purposes.

TI Stochastic Simulated Quantum Annealing for Fast Solution of
   Combinatorial Optimization Problems
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Combinatorial optimization problems are frequently classified as NP-hard, which means that the time needed to find the optimal solution generally increases exponentially with the problem size. However, the existing research gap highlights the necessity to develop combinatorial optimization methods capable of scaling to large problems while maintaining low solution latency. In this paper, we introduce stochastic simulated quantum annealing (SSQA) for fast solution of combinatorial optimization problems. SSQA is designed based on stochastic computing, which can simulate quantum annealing (QA) by using multiple replicas of spins (probabilistic bits) in classical computing. The use of stochastic computing leads to an efficient parallel spin-state update algorithm, enabling quick search for a solution around the global minimum energy. Therefore, SSQA realizes quantum-like annealing for large-scale problems and can handle fully connected models in combinatorial optimization, unlike QA. The proposed method is evaluated in MATLAB on graph isomorphism problems, which are typical combinatorial optimization problems. It can handle a 100-times larger problem size compared to QA and a 25-times larger problem size compared to a traditional SA method, respectively, for similar convergence probabilities. The time to solution of SSQA is 11.5 times and 423 times smaller than that of the conventional stochastic simulated annealing method and traditional SA, respectively, when solving a 2,025-node combinatorial optimization problem.

AB We present thermodynamic entropy calculations based on charged particle multiplicity data from proton-proton collisions measured by ALICE at the LHC in comparison to entanglement entropy calculations based on initial state parton distributions. The relative agreement of these distributions can be quantified by studying their higher order cumulants. The commonalities between the initial and final state entropy suggest that entanglement could be a possible source for the seemingly thermal and collective behavior in small systems.

TI Benchmarking Digital Quantum Simulations Above Hundreds of Qubits Using
   Quantum Critical Dynamics
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB The real-time simulation of large many-body quantum systems is a formidable task, that may only be achievable with a genuine quantum computational platform. Currently, quantum hardware with a number of qubits sufficient to make classical emulation challenging is available. This condition is necessary for the pursuit of a so-called quantum advantage, but it also makes verifying the results very difficult. In this paper, we flip the perspective and utilize known theoretical results about many-body quantum critical dynamics to qualitatively benchmark digital quantum hardware and various error mitigation techniques. In particular, we benchmark against known universal scaling laws in the Hamiltonian simulation of a time- dependent transverse-field Ising Hamiltonian of up to 133 qubits. Incorporating only basic error mitigation and suppression methods, our study shows reliable control up to a two-qubit gate depth of 28, featuring a maximum of 1396 two-qubit gates, before noise becomes prevalent. These results are transferable to applications such as Hamiltonian simulation, variational algorithms, optimization, or quantum machine learning. We demonstrate this on the example of digitized quantum annealing for optimization and identify an optimal working point in terms of both circuit depth and time step on a 133-site optimization problem.

TI Detecting the quantum phase transition from the perspective of quantum
   information in the Aubry-André model
SO CHINESE PHYSICS B
AB We investigate the effectiveness of entropic uncertainty, entanglement and steering in discerning quantum phase transitions (QPTs). Specifically, we observe significant fluctuations in entropic uncertainty as the driving parameter traverses the phase transition point. It is observed that the entropic uncertainty, entanglement and quantum steering, based on the electron distribution probability, can serve as indicators for detecting QPTs. Notably, we reveal an intriguing anticorrelation relationship between entropic uncertainty and entanglement in the Aubry-Andr & eacute; model. Moreover, we explore the feasibility of detecting a QPT when the period parameter is a rational number. These observations open up new and efficient avenues for probing QPTs.

TI Research on information lossless teleportation via the W states
SO IET QUANTUM COMMUNICATION
AB In this article, a protocol for information lossless teleportation using W states is proposed. Firstly, the information lossless teleportation of an unknown state with a maximally entangled W-state channel, which protects the original unknown state information even in case of teleportation failure is investigated. Next, we generalise our scheme to non-maximally entangled W-state channels. Finally, the principle of the proposed scheme is validated by performing experiments on the quantum circuit simulator Quirk. Our study shows that W states can be used to teleport any quantum state without information loss through single-qubit measurements and local unitary operations.

TI Quantum Sensing and Control of Spin-State Dynamics in the Radical-Pair
   Mechanism
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB Radical pairs and the dynamics they undergo are prevalent in many chemical and biological systems. Specifically, it has been proposed that the radical-pair mechanism results from a relatively strong hyperfine interaction with its intrinsic nuclear spin environment. While the existence of this mechanism is undisputed, the nanoscale details remain to be experimentally shown. Here, we analyze the role of a quantum sensor in detecting the spin dynamics (non-Markovian) of individual radical pairs in the presence of a weak magnetic field. We show how quantum control methods can be used to set apart the dynamics of the radical-pair mechanism at various stages of the evolution. We expect these findings to have implications to the understanding of the physical mechanism in magnetoreception and other biochemical processes with a microscopic detail.

TI Reconfigurable Silicon Photonic Chip for the Generation Of
   Frequency-Bin-Entangled Qudits
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB Quantum optical microcombs in integrated ring resonators generate entangled photon pairs over many spectral modes, and allow the preparation of high-dimensional qudit states. Ideally, those sources should be programmable and have a high generation rate, with comb lines tightly spaced for the implementation of efficient qudit gates based on electro-optic frequency mixing. While these requirements cannot all be satisfied by a single resonator device, for which there is a trade-off between the high generation rate and tight bin spacing, a promising strategy is the use of multiple resonators, each generating photon pairs in specific frequency bins via spontaneous four-wave mixing. Based on this approach we present a programmable silicon photonics device for the generation of frequency-bin-entangled qudits, in which bin spacing, qudit dimension, and the bipartite quantum state can be reconfigured on chip. Using resonators with a radius of 22 & mu;m, we achieve a high brightness [about MHz/(mW)2] per comb line with a bin spacing of 15 GHz, and fidelities above 85% with maximally entangled Bell states up to a Hilbert space dimension of 16. By individually addressing each spectral mode, we realize states that cannot be generated on chip using a single resonator. We measure the correlation matrices of maximally entangled two-qubit and two-qutrit states on a set of mutually unbiased bases, finding fidelities exceeding 98%, and indicating that the source can find application in high-dimensional secure communication protocols.

AB Multi-Object Tracking (MOT) is most often approached in the tracking-by-detection paradigm, where object detections are associated through time. The association step naturally leads to discrete optimization problems. As these optimization problems are often NP-hard, they can only be solved exactly for small instances on current hardware. Adiabatic quantum computing (AQC) offers a solution for this, as it has the potential to provide a considerable speedup on a range of NP-hard optimization problems in the near future. However, current MOT formulations are unsuitable for quantum computing due to their scaling properties. In this work, we therefore propose the first MOT formulation designed to be solved with AQC. We employ an Ising model that represents the quantum mechanical system implemented on the AQC. We show that our approach is competitive compared with state-of-the-art optimization-based approaches, even when using of-the-shelf integer programming solvers. Finally, we demonstrate that our MOT problem is already solvable on the current generation of real quantum computers for small examples, and analyze the properties of the measured solutions.

TI Enhancing the expressivity of quantum neural networks with residual
   connections
SO COMMUNICATIONS PHYSICS
AB In noisy intermediate-scale quantum era, the research on the combination of artificial intelligence and quantum computing has been greatly developed. Here we propose a quantum circuit-based algorithm to implement quantum residual neural networks, where the residual connection channels are constructed by introducing auxiliary qubits to data-encoding and trainable blocks in quantum neural networks. We prove that when this particular network architecture is applied to a l-layer data-encoding, the number of frequency generation forms extends from one, namely the difference of the sum of generator eigenvalues, to O(l2)\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$${{{{{{{\mathcal{O}}}}}}}}({l}<^>{2})$$\end{document}, and the flexibility in adjusting Fourier coefficients can also be improved. It indicates that residual encoding can achieve better spectral richness and enhance the expressivity of various parameterized quantum circuits. Extensive numerical demonstrations in regression tasks and image classification are offered. Our work lays foundation for the complete quantum implementation of classical residual neural networks and offers a quantum feature map strategy for quantum machine learning.
   The authors introduce a quantum circuit-based algorithm to implement quantum residual neural networks by incorporating auxiliary qubits in the data-encoding and trainable blocks, which leads to an improved expressivity of parameterized quantum circuits. The results are supported by extensive numerical demonstrations and theoretical analysis.

TI Generation of entanglement via squeezing on a tripartite-optomechanical
   system
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We introduce a strategy to regulate the quantum entanglement in a dispersive-hybrid system where a qubit is directly coupled to a cavity and a resonator. A dramatic transition takes place by only tuning the squeezing parameters associated with the vibrational mode. As the squeezing amplitude becomes larger, the maximal entanglement abruptly falls to zero at specific squeezing phases. It is also possible to generate entanglement for bipartitions from the qubit-cavity-resonator system after applying this strategy. Entangled qubit-cavity states are created through squeezing, even though there is no direct interaction between them. We also analyze the effect of atomic, optical, and vibrational losses on the quantum entanglement. Finally, we discuss future realizations to implement all these ideas and promote further studies to generalize the concept of monogamy in tripartite systems outside qubit-composite states, in particular, (2 circle times 2 circle times n)-dimensional systems.

TI Determining absolute neutrino mass using quantum technologies
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB Next generation tritium decay experiments to determine the absolute neutrino mass require high-precision measurements of beta-decay electron energies close to the kinematic end point. To achieve this, the development of high phase-space density sources of atomic tritium is required, along with the implementation of methods to control the motion of these atoms to allow extended observation times. A promising approach to efficiently and accurately measure the kinetic energies of individual beta-decay electrons generated in these dilute atomic gases, is to determine the frequency of the cyclotron radiation they emit in a precisely characterised magnetic field. This cyclotron radiation emission spectroscopy technique can benefit from recent developments in quantum technologies. Absolute static-field magnetometry and electrometry, which is essential for the precise determination of the electron kinetic energies from the frequency of their emitted cyclotron radiation, can be performed using atoms in superpositions of circular Rydberg states. Quantum-limited microwave amplifiers will allow precise cyclotron frequency measurements to be made with maximal signal-to-noise ratios and minimal observation times. Exploiting the opportunities offered by quantum technologies in these key areas, represents the core activity of the Quantum Technologies for Neutrino Mass project. Its goal is to develop a new experimental apparatus that can enable a determination of the absolute neutrino mass with a sensitivity on the order of 10meV/c2.

TI Grid-based methods for chemistry simulations on a quantum computer
SO SCIENCE ADVANCES
AB First-quantized, grid-based methods for chemistry modeling are a natural and elegant fit for quantum computers. However, it is infeasible to use today's quantum prototypes to explore the power of this approach because it requires a substantial number of near-perfect qubits. Here, we use exactly emulated quantum computers with up to 36 qubits to execute deep yet resource-frugal algorithms that model 2D and 3D atoms with single and paired particles. A range of tasks is explored, from ground state preparation and energy estimation to the dynamics of scattering and ionization; we evaluate various methods within the split-operator QFT (SO-QFT) Hamiltonian simulation paradigm, including protocols previously described in theoretical papers and our own techniques. While we identify certain restrictions and caveats, generally, the grid-based method is found to perform very well; our results are consistent with the view that first-quantized paradigms will be dominant from the early fault-tolerant quantum computing era onward.

TI Fast scrambling in classically simulable quantum circuits
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We study operator scrambling in quantum circuits built from "super-Clifford" gates. For such circuits it was established by Blake and Linden [Phys. Rev. Lett. 125, 030502 (2020)] that the time evolution of operator entanglement for a large class of many-body operators can be efficiently simulated on a classical computer, including for operators with volume-law entanglement. Here we extend the scope of this formalism in two key ways. First we provide evidence that these classically simulable circuits include examples of fast scramblers, by constructing a circuit for which operator entanglement is numerically found to saturate in a time t* similar to ln(N) (with N the number of qubits). Second we demonstrate that, in addition to operator entanglement, certain out-of-time-ordered correlation functions (OTOCs) can be classically simulated within the same formalism. As a consequence such OTOCs can be computed numerically in super-Clifford circuits with thousands of qubits and we study several explicit examples in the aforementioned fast scrambling circuits.

TI Universal Quantum Computing with Twist-Free and Temporally Encoded
   Lattice Surgery
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Lattice-surgery protocols allow for the efficient implementation of universal gate sets with two-dimensional topological codes where qubits are constrained to interact with one another locally. In this work, we first introduce a decoder capable of correcting spacelike and timelike errors during lattice-surgery protocols. Subsequently, we compute the logical failure rates of a lattice-surgery protocol for a biased circuit-level noise model. We then provide a protocol for performing twist-free lattice surgery, where we avoid twist defects in the bulk of the lattice. Our twist-free protocol eliminates the extra circuit components and gate-scheduling complexities associated with the measurement of higher weight stabilizers when using twist defects. We also provide a protocol for temporally encoded lattice surgery that can be used to reduce both the run times and the total space-time costs of quantum algorithms. Lastly, we propose a layout for a quantum processor that is more efficient for rectangular surface codes exploiting noise bias and that is compatible with the other techniques mentioned above.

TI Speeding Up Learning Quantum States Through Group Equivariant
   Convolutional Quantum Ansatze
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB We develop a theoretical framework for Sn-equivariant convolutional quantum circuits with SU(d) symmetry, building on and significantly generalizing Jordan's permutational quantum computing formalism based on Schur-Weyl duality connecting both SU(d) and Sn actions on qudits. In particular, we utilize the Okounkov-Vershik approach to prove Harrow's statement on the equivalence between SU(d) and Sn irrep bases and to establish the Sn-equivariant convolutional quantum alternating ansatze (Sn-CQA) using Young-Jucys-Murphy elements. We prove that Sn-CQA is able to generate any unitary in any given Sn irrep sector, which may serve as a universal model for a wide array of quantum machine-learning problems with the presence of SU(d) symmetry. Our method provides another way to prove the universality of the quantum approximate optimization algorithm and verifies that four-local SU(d)-symmetric unitaries are sufficient to build generic SU(d)-symmetric quantum circuits up to relative phase factors. We present numerical simulations to showcase the effectiveness of the ansatze to find the ground-state energy of the ./1-./2 antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model on the rectangular and kagome lattices. Our work provides the first application of the celebrated Okounkov-Vershik Sn representation theory to quantum physics and machine learning, from which to propose quantum variational ansatze that strongly suggests to be classically intractable tailored towards a specific optimization problem.

TI General monogamy and polygamy relations of arbitrary quantum
   correlations for multipartite systems
SO EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL PLUS
AB Monogamy and polygamy of quantum correlations are the fundamental properties of quantum systems. We study the monogamy and polygamy relations satisfied by any quantum correlations in multipartite quantum systems. General monogamy relations are presented for the alpha th (0 <= alpha <= gamma, gamma >= 2) power of quantum correlation, and general polygamy relations are given for the beta th (beta >= delta, 0 <= delta <= 1) power of quantum correlation. We show that these newly derived monogamy and polygamy inequalities are tighter than the existing ones. By applying these results to specific quantum correlations such as concurrence and the square of convex-roof extended negativity of assistance (SCRENoA), the corresponding new classes of monogamy and polygamy relations are obtained, which include the existing ones as special cases. Detailed examples are given to illustrate the advantages of our results.

TI Detection of malicious URLs using machine learning
SO WIRELESS NETWORKS
AB The detection of fraudulent URLs that lead to malicious websites using addresses similar to those of legitimate websites is a key form of defense against phishing attacks. Currently, in the case of Internet of Things devices is especially relevant, because they usually have access to the Internet, although in many cases they are vulnerable to these phishing attacks. This paper offers an overview of the most relevant techniques for the accurate detection of fraudulent URLs, from the most widely used machine learning and deep learning algorithms, to the application, as a proof of concept, of classification models based on quantum machine learning. Starting from an essential data preparation phase, special attention is paid to the initial comparison of several traditional machine learning models, evaluating them with different datasets and obtaining interesting results that achieve true positive rates greater than 90%. After that first approach, the study moves on to the application of quantum machine learning, analysing the specificities of this recent field and assessing the possibilities it offers for the detection of malicious URLs. Given the limited available literature specifically on the detection of malicious URLs and other cybersecurity issues through quantum machine learning, the research presented here represents a relevant novelty on the combination of both concepts in the form of quantum machine learning algorithms for cybersecurity. Indeed, after the analysis of several algorithms, encouraging results have been obtained that open the door to further research on the application of quantum computing in the field of cybersecurity.

TI Variational Quantum Simulation: A Case Study for Understanding Warm
   Starts
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB The barren plateau phenomenon, characterized by loss gradients that vanish exponentially with system size, poses a challenge to scaling variational quantum algorithms. Here we explore the potential of warm starts, whereby one initializes closer to a solution in the hope of enjoying larger loss variances. Focusing on an iterative variational method for learning shorter-depth circuits for quantum real-time evolution we conduct a case study to elucidate the potential and limitations of warm starts. We start by proving that the iterative variational algorithm will exhibit substantial (at worst vanishing polynomially in system size) gradients in a small region around the initializations at each time step. Convexity guarantees for these regions are then established, suggesting trainability for polynomial-size time steps. However, our study highlights scenarios where a good minimum shifts outside the region with trainability guarantees. Our analysis leaves open the question whether such minima jumps necessitate optimization across barren plateau landscapes or whether there exist gradient flows, i.e., fertile valleys away from the plateau with substantial gradients, that allow for training. While our main focus is on this case study of variational quantum simulation, we end by discussing how our results work in other iterative settings.

TI Quantum Computing: Navigating the Future of Computation, Challenges, and
   Technological Breakthroughs
SO QUANTUM REPORTS
AB Quantum computing stands at the precipice of technological revolution, promising unprecedented computational capabilities to tackle some of humanity's most complex problems. The field is highly collaborative and recent developments such as superconducting qubits with increased scaling, reduced error rates, and improved cryogenic infrastructure, trapped-ion qubits with high-fidelity gates and reduced control hardware complexity, and photonic qubits with exploring room-temperature quantum computing are some of the key developments pushing the field closer to demonstrating real-world applications. However, the path to realizing this promise is fraught with significant obstacles across several key platforms, including sensitivity to errors, decoherence, scalability, and the need for new materials and technologies. Through an exploration of various quantum systems, this paper highlights both the potential and the challenges of quantum computing and discusses the essential role of middleware, quantum hardware development, and the strategic investments required to propel the field forward. With a focus on overcoming technical hurdles through innovation and interdisciplinary research, this review underscores the transformative impact quantum computing could have across diverse sectors.

TI Measurement Uncertainty, Purity, and Entanglement Dynamics of Maximally
   Entangled Two Qubits Interacting Spatially with Isolated Cavities:
   Intrinsic Decoherence Effect
SO ENTROPY
AB In a system of two charge-qubits that are initially prepared in a maximally entangled Bell's state, the dynamics of quantum memory-assisted entropic uncertainty, purity, and negative entanglement are investigated. Isolated external cavity fields are considered in two different configurations: coherent-even coherent and even coherent cavity fields. For different initial cavity configurations, the temporal evolution of the final state of qubits and cavities is solved analytically. The effects of intrinsic decoherence and detuning strength on the dynamics of bipartite entropic uncertainty, purity and entanglement are explored. Depending on the field parameters, nonclassical correlations can be preserved. Nonclassical correlations and revival aspects appear to be significantly inhibited when intrinsic decoherence increases. Nonclassical correlations stay longer and have greater revivals due to the high detuning of the two qubits and the coherence strength of the initial cavity fields. Quantum memory-assisted entropic uncertainty and entropy have similar dynamics while the negativity presents fewer revivals in contrast.

TI Continuous measurement of a qudit using dispersively coupled radiation
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We analyze the continuous monitoring of a qudit coupled to a cavity using both phase-preserving and phasesensitive amplification. The quantum trajectories of the system are described by a stochastic master equation, for which we derive the appropriate Lindblad operators. The measurement back-action causes spiraling in the state coordinates during collapse, which increases as the system levels become less distinguishable. We discuss two examples: a two-level system and an N-dimensional system and meter with rotational symmetry in the quadrature space. We also provide a comparison of the effects of phase-preserving and phase-sensitive detection on the master equation and show that the average behavior is the same in both cases, but individual trajectories collapse at different rates depending on the measurement axis in the quadrature plane.

TI Deformations of the symmetric subspace of qubit chains
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS A-MATHEMATICAL AND THEORETICAL
AB The symmetric subspace of multi-qubit systems, that is, the space of states invariant under permutations, is commonly encountered in applications in the context of quantum information and communication theory. It is known that the symmetric subspace can be described in terms of irreducible representations of the group SU(2), whose representation spaces form a basis of symmetric states, the so-called Dicke states. In this work, we present deformations of the symmetric subspace as deformations of this group structure, which are promoted to a quantum group Uq(su(2)). We see that deformations of the symmetric subspace obtained in this manner correspond to local deformations of the inner product of each spin, in such a way that departure from symmetry can be encoded in a position-dependent inner product. The consequences and possible extensions of these results are also discussed.

TI Deterministic generation of multidimensional photonic cluster states
   using time-delay feedback
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Cluster states are useful in many quantum information processing applications. In particular, universal measurement-based quantum computation (MBQC) utilizes two-dimensional cluster states [R. Raussendorf and H. J. Briegel, Phys. Rev. Lett. 86, 5188 (2001)] and topologically fault-tolerant MBQC requires cluster states of dimension 3 or higher [R. Raussendorf et al., New J. Phys. 9, 199 (2007)]. This work proposes a protocol to deterministically generate multidimensional photonic cluster states using a single atom-cavity system and time-delay feedback. The dimensionality of the cluster state increases linearly with the number of time-delay feedbacks. We first give a diagrammatic derivation of the tensor network states, which is valuable in simulating matrix product states and projected entangled pair states generated from sequential photons. Our method also provides a simple way to bridge and analyze the experimental imperfections and the logical errors of the generated states. In this method, we analyze the generated cluster states under realistic experimental conditions and address both one-qubit and two-qubit errors. Through numerical simulation, we observe an optimal atom-cavity cooperativity for the fidelity of the generated states, which is surprising given the prevailing assumption that higher-cooperativity systems are inherently better for photonic applications.

TI Constructing the three-qudit unextendible product bases with strong
   nonlocality
SO CHINESE PHYSICS B
AB Unextendible product bases (UPBs) are interesting members of a family of orthogonal product bases. Here, we investigate the construction of 3-qudit UPBs with strong nonlocality. First, a UPB set in C-3 circle times C-3 circle times C-3 of size 19 is presented based on the shift UPBs. By mapping the system to a Rubik's cube, we provide a general method of constructing UPBs in C-d circle times C-d circle times C-d of size (d- 1)(3) + 2d + 5, whose corresponding Rubik's cube is composed of four parts. Second, for the more general case where the dimensions of parties are different, we extend the classical tile structure to the 3-qudit system and propose the tri-tile structure. By means of this structure, a C-4 circle times C-4 circle times C-5 system of size 38 is obtained based on a C-3 circle times C-3 circle times C-4 system of size 19. Then, we generalize this approach to the C-d1 circle times C-d2 circle times C-d3 system which also consists of four parts. Our research provides a positive answer to the open question raised in by Halder et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 122 040403 (2019)], indicating that there do exist UPBs that can exhibit strong quantum nonlocality without entanglement.

TI End-to-End Post-Quantum Cryptography Encryption Protocol for Video
   Conferencing System Based on Government Public Key Infrastructure
SO APPLIED SYSTEM INNOVATION
AB Owing to the expansion of non-face-to-face activities, security issues in video conferencing systems are becoming more critical. In this paper, we focus on the end-to-end encryption (E2EE) function among the security services of video conferencing systems. First, the E2EE-related protocols of Zoom and Secure Frame (SFrame), which are representative video conferencing systems, are thoroughly investigated, and the two systems are compared and analyzed from the overall viewpoint. Next, the E2EE protocol in a Government Public Key Infrastructure (GPKI)-based video conferencing system, in which the user authentication mechanism is fundamentally different from those used in commercial sector systems such as Zoom and SFrame, is considered. In particular, among E2EE-related protocols, we propose a detailed mechanism in which the post-quantum cryptography (PQC) key encapsulation mechanism (KEM) is applied to the user key exchange process. Since the session key is not disclosed to the central server, even in futuristic quantum computers, the proposed mechanism, which includes the PQC KEM, still satisfies the E2EE security requirements in the quantum environment. Moreover, our GPKI-based mechanism induces the effect of enhancing the security level of the next-generation video conferencing systems up to a quantum-safe level.

AB In Variational Quantum Simulations, the construction of a suitable parametric quantum circuit is subject to two counteracting effects. The number of parameters should be small for the device noise to be manageable, but also large enough for the circuit to be able to represent the solution. Dimensional expressivity analysis can optimize a candidate circuit considering both aspects. In this article, we will first discuss an inductive construction for such candidate circuits. Furthermore, it is sometimes necessary to choose a circuit with fewer parameters than necessary to represent all relevant states. To characterize such circuits, we estimate the best-approximation error using Voronoi diagrams. Moreover, we discuss a hybrid quantumclassical algorithm to estimate the worst-case best-approximation error, its complexity, and its scaling in state space dimensionality. This allows us to identify some obstacles for variational quantum simulations with local optimizers and underparametrized circuits, and we discuss possible remedies.

TI Efficient Trainability of Linear Optical Modules in Quantum Optical
   Neural Networks
SO JOURNAL OF RUSSIAN LASER RESEARCH
AB The existence of "barren plateau landscapes" for generic discrete-variable quantum neural networks, which obstructs efficient gradient-based optimization of cost functions defined by global measurements, would be surprising in the case of generic linear optical modules in quantum optical neural networks due to the tunability of the intensity of continuous variable states and the relevant unitary group having exponentially smaller dimension. We demonstrate that coherent light in m modes can be generically compiled efficiently if the total intensity scales sublinearly with m, and extend this result to cost functions based on homodyne, heterodyne, or photon detection measurement statistics, and to noisy cost functions in the presence of attenuation. We further demonstrate efficient trainability of m mode linear optical quantum circuits for variational mean field energy estimation of positive quadratic Hamiltonians for input states that do not have energy exponentially vanishing with m.

TI Ultrafast Entanglement Dynamics in Monitored Quantum Circuits
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Projective measurement, a basic operation in quantum mechanics, can induce seemingly nonlocal effects. In this work, we analyze such effects in many-body systems by studying the nonequilibrium dynamics of weakly monitored quantum circuits, focusing on entanglement generation and information spreading. We find that, due to measurements, the entanglement dynamics in monitored circuits is indeed "faster" than that of unitary ones in several ways. Specifically, we find that a pair of well-separated regions can become entangled in a time scale e2/3, sublinear in their distance .e. For the case of Clifford monitored circuits, this originates from superballistically growing stabilizer generators of the evolving state. In addition, we find initially local information can spread superlinearly as t3/2. Furthermore, by viewing the dynamics as a dynamical encoding process, we show that the superlinear growing length scale relates to an encoding time that is sublinear in system size. To quantify the information dynamics, we develop a formalism generalizing operator spreading to nonunitary dynamics, which is of independent interest.

TI NuQKD: A Modular Quantum Key Distribution Simulation Framework for
   Engineering Applications
SO ADVANCED PHYSICS RESEARCH
AB An experimental Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) implementation requires advanced costly hardware, unavailable in most research environments, making protocol testing and performance evaluation complicated. This has been a major motivation for the development of QKD simulation frameworks, to allow researchers to obtain insight before proceeding into practical implementations. Several simulators have been introduced over the recent years. However, only four are publicly available, only one of which models equipment imperfections. Currently, no open-source simulator includes all following capabilities: channel attenuation modelling, equipment imperfections and effects on key rates, estimation of elapsed time during classical and quantum- channel processes, use of truly random binary sequences for qubits and measurement bases, shared -bit fraction customization. In this paper, we present NuQKD, an open- source modular, intuitive simulator, featuring all the above capabilities. NuQKD establishes communication between two computer terminals, accepts custom user inputs (iterations, raw key size, attacker interception rate etc.) and evaluates the sifted key, Quantum Bit Error Rate (QBER), elapsed communication time, and more. NuQKD capabilities include optical fiber and free -space simulation, modeling of equipment/channel imperfections, bitstrings from True Random Number Generators, decoy-state protocol support, and automated evaluation of performance metrics. We expect NuQKD to enable convenient and accurate representation of actual experimental conditions.
   QKD experimentation requires advanced, expensive equipment, while most publicly available simulators assume ideal conditions. NuQKD is a novel simulator bridging the gap between theory and practice, offering unique features as real-time truly random number generation, precise modelling of equipment/channel imperfections and advanced input/output user customization. NuQKD is envisioned as a beneficial tool for both experienced researchers and newcomers to the field. image

TI Design, Fabrication, and Performance Evaluation of Surface-Electrode Ion
   Traps for Scalable Quantum Computing (Invited)
SO ACTA OPTICA SINICA
AB Significance Ion trap quantum computing, distinguished by its significant advantages such as long coherence times and high-fidelity quantum gate operations, has emerged as a leading frontier in quantum technology. The core challenge in realizing practical quantum computing lies in the scalable expansion of the system. The quantum charge-coupled device (QCCD) architecture, owing to its benefits including deterministic entanglement and high controllability, is regarded as a highly promising scaling pathway. This scheme necessitates dividing the ion trap system into functional zones such as loading, storage, and interaction regions, with quantum information transferred via precise ion transport. Traditional macroscopic ion traps struggle to meet the scaling demands of QCCD. In this context, the surface-electrode ion trap (SEIT) is developed. SEITs create multiple trapping sites by fabricating micro-electrode arrays on a two-dimensional planar substrate. They offer outstanding advantages including compact size, high scalability, excellent compatibility with modern micro/nano-fabrication processes, and strong structural uniformity. Consequently, SEITs have become the primary technical platform for realizing the QCCD architecture, opening new pathways towards practical quantum computing. Progress This paper systematically reviews the research progress in SEITs concerning design, fabrication, performance evaluation, and on-chip integration, and provides an outlook on future development. In terms of design, starting from the trapping theory of SEITs, the article notes that their pseudopotential distribution is determined by the electrode geometry. It describes methods ranging from analytical approximations to high-precision numerical simulations for accurately characterizing the spatial potential generated by complex electrode structures. This provides a solid theoretical foundation for SEIT optimization. The evolution of one-dimensional (1D) scalable electrode designs is reviewed, tracing the development from 4-wire, 5-wire, and 6-wire to 7-wire traps, alongside approaches to enhance control freedom and flexibility for radial electric fields. To overcome the limitations of 1D scaling, various two-dimensional (2D) scaling schemes have been developed. For instance, Quantinuum's "quasi-2D" racetrack trap achieves the largest fully connected system with 56 qubits; designs utilizing "T", "Y", and "X" junctions to connect different zones address path branching issues, although further optimization of potential barriers and trap depth variations within junction regions is required; the quantum spring array (QSA) architecture, proposed by the University of Innsbruck, achieves coupling by controlling ion spacings within sub-registers, avoiding traditional split-merge operations, and demonstrates advantages like full connectivity, simplified operations, enhanced coupling rates, and potential fault tolerance. Regarding integrated design, incorporating on-chip optical components such as waveguides and microlenses significantly improves fluorescence collection efficiency and addressing capability while reducing the footprint of peripheral optics. Electrical integration encompasses passive filtering capacitors and active devices like complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) technology, offering effective solutions for independent multi-electrode control, reduced signal transmission noise, and minimized overall system size. For fabrication processes, SEITs are primarily manufactured using micro/nano-fabrication techniques.
   Material selection is a critical aspect of the process: substrate materials require balancing low radio-frequency (RF) loss with compatibility for processing complex structures; surface metals must combine low anomalous heating with good oxidation resistance; materials for integrated optical devices must match specific ion transition wavelengths; detector materials need high detection efficiency, low noise, and excellent cryogenic compatibility; materials for electrical integration require compatibility with CMOS processes and long-term stability under cryogenic, vacuum conditions. The standard fabrication sequence typically begins with wafer cleaning, followed by steps such as shielding layer preparation, insulator deposition, surface electrode layer plating and patterning, and critical void dielectric etching. A central objective of the entire process is achieving precise control over ultra-high surface flatness and controlled micro-roughness across all functional layers. This is essential for effectively suppressing various electric field noises originating from surface defects, abnormal grain boundary structures, and patch potential non-uniformity. To mitigate the "anomalous heating" effect caused by the extremely close proximity of ions to the electrodes, several advanced surface treatment solutions have been developed, including pulsed laser cleaning, inert gas ion beam bombardment, and plasma cleaning. Performance evaluation of SEITs focuses on three key dimensions: ion trap heating rate characteristics, chip electric field properties, and ion transport performance. For assessing heating rate characteristics, methods include sideband carrier ratio measurement, blue sideband transition analysis, and Doppler recooling schemes. Among these, deep learning-based phonon number determination methods, capable of distinguishing vibrational modes, show significant promise. In evaluating electric field performance, precise calibration of the electric fields generated by the electrodes and environmental stray fields is vital for ion transport manipulation. Experimental calibration overcomes the limitations of theoretical simulation, and trap potential calibration methods based on multi-parameter optimization enable accurate prediction of trap frequencies and effective control of transport positions. Regarding transport performance, evaluation emphasizes various modes including linear transport, separation/merging, direction-changing transport across junctions, ion position swapping, and inter-chip transport. The core objective is achieving fast operations with minimal heating. Conclusions and Prospects This paper comprehensively reviews the progress in SEITs across key areas: structural design (from 1D to 2D scaling architectures), fabrication processes (materials, micro-fabrication, surface treatment), performance evaluation (heating rate, electric fields, transport), and on-chip manipulation. SEITs, leveraging their excellent scalability and compatibility with modern fabrication techniques, combining with breakthroughs in on-chip photonic and electronic integration, provide a solid technical foundation for building integrated, scalable ion-trap quantum processors.
   As a key technology for large-scale quantum computing, particularly the QCCD architecture, its future development will focus on: developing multi-layer or 3D hybrid ion trap chips with higher integration and reconfigurable electrode layouts to enable fast, low-crosstalk, high-fidelity ion shuttling and stable storage; integrating large-scale, high-density electrode control electronics, utilizing advanced packaging technologies like through-silicon vias (TSVs) to couple thousands of low-noise, high-speed analog control signals in close proximity to the trap chip; implementing on-chip or near-chip integrated photonic networks for efficient, scalable quantum interconnects between different ion chains/modules; and exploring novel electrode materials, structures, and surface treatments to continuously suppress electrode noise, enhance trap depth stability, and extend ion coherence times. Ultimately, system-level integration and co-optimization will be the core challenge, requiring the seamless fusion of high-performance trapping, precise manipulation, efficient readout, fast communication, and powerful classical control. With continued breakthroughs in these key technologies, the SEIT platform is expected to demonstrate QCCD prototypes with hundreds of qubits in the near term, gradually progressing towards practical quantum processors equipped with quantum error correction capabilities, thereby opening the door to quantum advantage applications in specific domains.

TI Performance and Achievable Rates of the Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill Code
   for Pure-Loss and Amplification Channels
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Quantum error-correction codes protect information from realistic noisy channels and lie at the heart of quantum computation and communication tasks. Understanding the optimal performance and other information-theoretic properties, such as the achievable rates, of a given code is crucial, as these factors determine the fundamental limits imposed by the encoding in conjunction with the noise channel. Here, we use the transpose channel to analytically obtain the near-optimal performance of any Gottesman-KitaevPreskill (GKP) code under pure loss and pure amplification. We present rigorous connections between GKP code's near-optimal performance and its dual lattice geometry and average input energy. With no energy constraint, we show that when tau /(1 - tau) is an integer, specific families of GKP codes simultaneously achieve the loss and amplification capacity. tau is the transmissivity (gain) for loss (amplification). Our results establish GKP code as the first structured bosonic code family that achieves the capacity of loss and amplification.

TI Scalable quantum measurement error mitigation via conditional
   independence and transfer learning
SO MACHINE LEARNING-SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Mitigating measurement errors in quantum systems without relying on quantum error correction is of critical importance for the practical development of quantum technology. Deep learning-based quantum measurement error mitigation (QMEM) has exhibited advantages over the linear inversion method due to its capability to correct non-linear noise. However, scalability remains a challenge for both methods. In this study, we propose a scalable QMEM method that leverages the conditional independence (CI) of distant qubits and incorporates transfer learning (TL) techniques. By leveraging the CI assumption, we achieve an exponential reduction in the size of neural networks used for error mitigation. This enhancement also offers the benefit of reducing the number of training data needed for the machine learning model to successfully converge. Additionally, incorporating TL provides a constant speedup. We validate the effectiveness of our approach through experiments conducted on IBM quantum devices with 7 and 13 qubits, demonstrating excellent error mitigation performance and highlighting the efficiency of our method.

TI Two-mode squeezing over deployed fiber coexisting with conventional
   communications
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Squeezed light is a crucial resource for continuous-variable (CV) quantum information science. Distributed multi-mode squeezing is critical for enabling CV quantum networks and distributed quantum sensing. To date, multi-mode squeezing measured by homodyne detection has been limited to single-room experiments without coexisting classical signals, i.e., on "dark" fiber. Here, after distribution through separate fiber spools (5 km), -0.9 & PLUSMN; 0.1-dB coexistent two-mode squeezing is measured. Moreover, after distribution through separate deployed campus fibers (about 250 m and 1.2 km), -0.5 & PLUSMN; 0.1-dB coexistent two-mode squeezing is measured. Prior to distribution, the squeezed modes are each frequency multiplexed with several classical signals-including the local oscillator and conventional network signals-demonstrating that the squeezed modes do not need dedicated dark fiber. After distribution, joint two-mode squeezing is measured and recorded for post-processing using triggered homodyne detection in separate locations. This demonstration enables future applications in quantum networks and quantum sensing that rely on distributed multi-mode squeezing. & COPY; 2023 Optica Publishing Group under the terms of the Optica Open Access Publishing Agreement

TI Nanoplasmonic cavity quantum electrodynamic architectures for
   room-temperature quantum technologies
SO EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL-SPECIAL TOPICS
AB Quantum nanophotonics places nanoscale structuring in direct dialogue with photonic quantum information-compressing functionality to the few-nanometre, few-femtosecond frontier while retaining energy efficiency, speed and room-temperature operation. We highlight nanoplasmonic cavity-QED architectures in which extreme mode confinement delivers strong coupling under ambient conditions, enabling ultrafast single-photon emission and near-field multipartite entanglement using industry-grade near-field transducers that nanofocus guided light at practical efficiencies. We set these advances against the arc from early plasmonic cQED proposals and single-emitter Purcell studies to modern time-domain measurements that resolve sub-picosecond polariton/Rabi dynamics-establishing a clear route from concept to device. In parallel, we point to low-loss, high-index Mie resonators whose spectrally sharp electric and magnetic modes afford narrow-band coherent control, filtering and radiation-pattern engineering, and which naturally co-integrate in hybrid metal-dielectric stacks that combine ultrastrong local coupling with low-loss routing and storage. Finally, we discuss quantum nanoplasmonic coherent perfect absorption (qnCPA)-a waveguide-fed, non-perturbing protocol that selectively prepares and protects plasmon-emitter dressed states via dissipation-assisted, unidirectional feeding. Together with macroscopic QED and quantum quasinormal-mode quantization, which regularize open, lossy resonators and clarify when loss can be a resource, these developments chart robust, chip-scale routes to room-temperature quantum technologies.

TI Broadband merged-element Josephson parametric amplifier
SO APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS
AB Broadband quantum-limited amplifiers are essential for quantum information processing, yet challenges in design and fabrication continue to hinder their widespread applications. Here, we introduce the broadband merged-element Josephson parametric amplifier in which the discrete parallel capacitor is directly integrated with the Josephson junctions. This merged-element design eliminates the shortcomings of discrete capacitors, simplifying the fabrication process, reducing the need for high-precision lithography tools and ensuring compatibility with standard superconducting qubit fabrication procedures. Experimental results demonstrate a gain of 15 dB over a 500 MHz bandwidth, a mean saturation power of -116 dBm, and near-quantum-limited noise performance. This robust readily implemented parametric amplifier holds significant promise for broader applications in superconducting quantum information and the advancement of quantum computation.

TI A Classical Architecture for Digital Quantum Computers
SO ACM TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM COMPUTING
AB Scaling bottlenecks the making of digital quantum computers, posing challenges from both the quantum and the classical components. We present a classical architecture to cope with a comprehensive list of the latter challenges all at once and implement it fully in an end-to-end system by integrating a multi-core RISC-V CPU with our in-house control electronics.
   Our architecture enables scalable, high-precision control of large quantum processors and accommodates evolving requirements of quantum hardware. A central feature is a microarchitecture executing quantum operations in parallel on arbitrary predefined qubit groups. Another key feature is a reconfigurable quantum instruction set that supports easy qubit re-grouping and instructions extensions.
   As a demonstration, we implement the surface code quantum computing workflow. Our design, for the first time, reduces instruction issuing and transmission costs to constants, which do not scale with the number of qubits, without adding any overheads in decoding or dispatching.
   Our system uses a dedicated general-purpose CPU for both qubit control and classical computation, including syndrome decoding. Implementing recent theoretical proposals as decoding firmware that parallelizes general inner decoders, we can achieve unprecedented decoding capabilities of up to distances 47 and 67 with the currently available systems-on-chips for physical error rate p = 0.001 and p = 0.0001, respectively, all in just 1 mu s.

TI Fast Entangling Gates for Rydberg Atoms via Resonant Dipole-Dipole
   Interaction
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB The advent of digital neutral-atom quantum computers relies on the development of fast and robust protocols for high-fidelity quantum operations. In this work, we introduce a novel scheme for entangling gates using four atomic levels per atom: a ground-state qubit and two Rydberg states. A laser field couples the qubit to one of the two Rydberg states, while a microwave field drives transitions between the two Rydberg states, enabling a resonant dipole-dipole interaction between different atoms. We show that controlled-Z gates can be realized in this scheme without requiring optical phase modulation and relying solely on a microwave field with time-dependent phase and amplitude. We demonstrate that such gates are faster and less sensitive to Rydberg decay than state-of-the-art Rydberg gates based on van der Waals interactions. Moreover, we systematically stabilize our protocol against interatomic distance fluctuations and analyze its performance in realistic setups with rubidium or cesium atoms. Our results open up new avenues to the use of microwave-driven dipolar interactions for quantum computation with neutral atoms.

TI Left-deep join order selection with higher-order unconstrained binary
   optimization on quantum computers
SO FRONTIERS IN COMPUTER SCIENCE
AB Join order optimization is among the most crucial query optimization problems, and its central position is also evident in the new research field where quantum computing is applied to database optimization and data management. In this field, join order optimization is the most studied database problem, typically tackled with a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization model, which is solved using various meta-heuristics, such as quantum and digital annealing, the quantum approximate optimization algorithm, or the variational quantum eigensolver. In this study, we continue developing quantum computing techniques for left-deep join order optimization by presenting three novel quantum optimization algorithms. These algorithms are based on a higher-order unconstrained binary optimization model, which is a generalization of the quadratic model and has not previously been applied to database problems. Theoretically, these optimization problems naturally map to universal quantum computers and quantum annealers. Compared to previous studies, two of our algorithms are the first quantum algorithms to model the join order cost function precisely. We prove theoretical bounds by showing that these two methods encode the same plans as the dynamic programming algorithm with respect to the query graph, which provides the optimal result up to cross products. The third algorithm achieves plans at least as good as those of the greedy algorithm with respect to the query graph. These results establish a meaningful theoretical connection between classical and quantum algorithms for selecting left-deep join orders. To demonstrate the practical usability of our algorithms, we have conducted an extensive experimental evaluation on thousands of clique, cycle, star, tree, and chain query graphs using both quantum and classical solvers.

TI 40Gbits-1 Data Transmission in an Installed Optical Link
   Encrypted Using Physical Layer Security Seeded by Quantum Key
   Distribution
SO JOURNAL OF LIGHTWAVE TECHNOLOGY
AB Data security plays an increasingly important role in modern telecommunications. The advent of quantum computational processors presents a significant threat to today's widely employed public key encryption algorithms, necessitating the adoption of new approaches to data encryption. Whilst quantum key distribution guarantees unconditional security for cryptographic key exchange in optical communication networks, the data rate is slow (Mbit/s), especially when compared to conventional optical communication. Here we present a highly secure encryption approach in which the encryption key, generated by quantum key distribution at a rate of up to 2.9 Mbit/s, was used to seed physical layer encryption performed using time domain spectral phase encoding (TDSPE). This allowed us to demonstrate encrypted 40 Gbit/s quadrature phase shift keyed data communications over 52.3 km of installed optical fiber, which cannot be eavesdropped using brute force computational attacks. Any attempt to eavesdrop the encrypted signal in the physical layer is highly time-sensitive - the phase states must be measured and decrypted prior to optical signal attenuation, which means that the attack procedure typically needs to be completed within a few milliseconds. This work represents the first example of quantum-enhanced physical layer encryption at realistic optical data rates that is fully secure from brute force computational attacks and the first demonstration of TDSPE using continuous-wave laser source and quadrature phase shift key modulation.

AB We employ the resource theory of generalized contextuality as a tool for analyzing the structure of prepare-and-measure scenarios. We argue that this framework simplifies proofs of quantum contextuality in complex scenarios and strengthens existing arguments regarding robustness of experimental implementations. As a case study, we demonstrate quantum contextuality associated with any nontrivial noncontextuality inequality for a class of useful scenarios by noticing a connection between the resource theory and measurement simulability. Additionally, we expose a formal composition rule that allows engineering complex scenarios from simpler ones. This approach provides insights into the noncontextual polytope structure for complex scenarios and facilitates the identification of possible quantum violations of noncontextuality inequalities.

TI Quantum Optimization Methods for Satellite Mission Planning
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Satellite mission planning for Earth observation satellites is a combinatorial optimization problem that consists of selecting the optimal subset of imaging requests, subject to constraints, to be fulfilled during an orbit pass of a satellite. The ever-growing amount of satellites in orbit underscores the need to operate them efficiently, which requires solving many instances of the problem in short periods of time. However, current classical algorithms often fail to find the global optimum or take too long to execute. Here, we approach the problem from a quantum computing point of view, which offers a promising alternative that could lead to significant improvements in solution quality or execution speed in the future. To this end, we study a planning problem with a variety of intricate constraints and discuss methods to encode them for quantum computers. Additionally, we experimentally assess the performance of quantum annealing and the quantum approximate optimization algorithm on a realistic and diverse dataset. Our results identify key aspects like graph connectivity and constraint structure that influence the performance of the methods. We explore the limits of today's quantum algorithms and hardware, providing bounds on the problems that can be currently solved successfully and showing how the solution degrades as the complexity grows. This work aims to serve as a baseline for further research in the field and establish realistic expectations on current quantum optimization capabilities.

TI Greedy algorithm based circuit optimization for near-term quantum
   simulation
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Simulating quantum systems is believed to be one of the most important applications of quantum computers. On noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices, the high-level circuit designed by quantum algorithms for Hamiltonian simulation needs to consider hardware limitations such as gate errors and circuit depth before it can be efficiently executed. In this work, we develop a hardware-agnostic circuit optimization algorithm to reduce the overall circuit cost for Hamiltonian simulation problems. Our method employ a novel sub-circuit synthesis in intermediate representation and propose a greedy ordering scheme for gate cancellation to minimize the gate count and circuit depth. To quantify the benefits of this approach, we benchmark proposed algorithm on different Hamiltonian models. Compared with state-of-the-art generic quantum compilers and specific quantum simulation compiler, the benchmarking results of our algorithm show an average reduction in circuit depth by 16.5x (up to 64.1x) and in gate count by 7.8x (up to 23.7x). This significant improvement helps enhance the performance of Hamiltonian simulation in the NISQ era.

TI Feedback-based quantum algorithms for ground state preparation
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB The ground state properties of quantum many-body systems are a subject of interest across chemistry, materials science, and physics. Thus, algorithms for finding ground states can have broad impacts. Variational quantum algorithms are one class of ground state algorithms that has received significant attention in recent years. These algorithms utilize a hybrid quantum-classical computing framework to prepare ground states on quantum computers. However, this requires solving a classical optimization problem that can become prohibitively expensive in high dimensions. Here, we develop formulations of feedback-based quantum algorithms for ground state preparation that can be used to address this challenge for two broad classes of Hamiltonians: Fermi-Hubbard Hamiltonians, and molecular Hamiltonians represented in second quantization. Feedback-based quantum algorithms are optimization-free; in place of classical optimization, quantum circuit parameters are set according to a deterministic feedback law derived from quantum Lyapunov control principles. This feedback law guarantees a monotonic improvement in solution quality with respect to the depth of the quantum circuit. A variety of numerical illustrations are provided that analyze the convergence and robustness of feedback-based quantum algorithms for these problem classes.

TI Adiabatic quantum decoherence in many non-interacting subsystems induced
   by the coupling with a common boson bath
SO ANNALS OF PHYSICS
AB This work addresses adiabatic quantum decoherence of manybody spin systems coupled with a boson field in the framework of open quantum systems theory. We generalize the traditional spin-boson model by considering a system-environment interaction Hamiltonian that represents a partition of non-interacting subsystems and highlights the collective correlation that appears exclusively due to the coupling with a common environment. Remarkably, this simple, exactly solvable model encompasses relevant aspects of a many-body open quantum system and features the subtle quantum effects that arise when the size scales up to a macroscopic level. We derive an analytical expression for the time dependence of the density matrix elements (in the preferred basis) without assuming coarse-graining. The resulting decoherence function is eigen-selective and is a complex exponential whose exponent has a real part that introduces a decay similar to that in the spin-boson model. On the contrary, the imaginary part depends on the quantum numbers and geometry of the whole partition and does not reflect the system temperature. Motivated by decoherence in solid-state NMR, and in search of realistic numerical estimations, we apply the theoretical results to a partition of dipole-coupled spin pairs in contact with a common phonon bath, using typical parameters of hydrated salts. The proposal allows estimatingthe decoherence time scale in terms of the system physical constants: sound velocity and eigenvalue distribution width. As a significant novelty, the decoherence function phase depends on the eigenvalue distribution throughout the sample. It plays the leading role, overshadowing the mechanism associated with the bath thermal state. Finally, we apply the formalism to describe decoherence in the "magic echo"NMR reversal experiment. We find that the system-environment correlation explains the origin of irreversibility, and both the decoherence rate value and its dependence on the dipolar frequency, are remarkably similar to the experiment.

TI Quantum Algorithms for Testing Hamiltonian Symmetry
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Symmetries in a Hamiltonian play an important role in quantum physics because they correspond directly with conserved quantities of the related system. In this Letter, we propose quantum algorithms capable of testing whether a Hamiltonian exhibits symmetry with respect to a group. We demonstrate that familiar expressions of Hamiltonian symmetry in quantum mechanics correspond directly with the acceptance probabilities of our algorithms. We execute one of our symmetry-testing algorithms on existing quantum computers for simple examples of both symmetric and asymmetric cases.

CA KM3NeT Collaboration
TI Search for quantum decoherence in neutrino oscillations with six
   detection units of KM3NeT/ORCA
SO JOURNAL OF COSMOLOGY AND ASTROPARTICLE PHYSICS
AB Neutrinos described as an open quantum system may interact with the environment which introduces stochastic perturbations to their quantum phase. This mechanism leads to a loss of coherence along the propagation of the neutrino - a phenomenon commonly referred to as decoherence - and ultimately, to a modification of the oscillation probabilities. Fluctuations in space-time, as envisaged by various theories of quantum gravity, are a potential candidate for a decoherence-inducing environment. Consequently, the search for decoherence provides a rare opportunity to investigate quantum gravitational effects which are usually beyond the reach of current experiments. In this work, quantum decoherence effects are searched for in neutrino data collected by the KM3NeT/ORCA detector from January 2020 to November 2021. The analysis focuses on atmospheric neutrinos within the energy range of a few GeV to 100 GeV. Adopting the open quantum system framework, decoherence is described in a phenomenological manner with the strength of the effect given by the parameters Gamma(21) and Gamma(31). Following previous studies, a dependence of the type Gamma(ij) alpha (E/E-0)(n) on the neutrino energy is assumed and the cases n = -2,-1 are explored. No significant deviation with respect to the standard oscillation hypothesis is observed. Therefore, 90% CL upper limits are estimated as Gamma(21) < 4.6 center dot 10(-21) GeV and Gamma(31) < 8.4 center dot 10(-21) GeV for n = -2 and Gamma(21) < 1.9 center dot 10(-22) GeV and Gamma 31 < 2.7 center dot 10(-22) GeV for n = -1, respectively.

TI SchWARMA: A model-based approach for time-correlated noise in quantum
   circuits
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Temporal noise correlations are ubiquitous in quantum systems, yet often neglected in the analysis of quantum circuits due to the complexity required to accurately characterize and model them. Autoregressive moving average (ARMA) models are a well-known technique from time series analysis that model time correlations in data. By identifying the space of completely positive trace preserving (CPTP) quantum operations with a particular matrix manifold, we generalize ARMA models to the space of CPTP maps to parametrize and simulate temporally correlated noise in quantum circuits. This approach, denoted Schrodinger wave ARMA (SchWARMA), provides a natural path for generalization of classic techniques from signal processing, control theory, and system identification for which ARMA models and linear systems are essential. This enables the broad theory of classical signal processing to be applied to quantum system simulation, characterization, and noise mitigation.

TI Benchmarking quantum annealing dynamics: The spin-vector Langevin model
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB The classical spin-vector Monte Carlo (SVMC) model is a reference benchmark for the performance of a quantum annealer. Yet, as a Monte Carlo method, SVMC is unsuited for an accurate description of the annealing dynamics in real-time. We introduce the spin-vector Langevin (SVL) model as an alternative benchmark in which the time evolution is described by Langevin dynamics. The SVL model is shown to provide a more stringent test than the SVMC model for the identification of quantum signatures in the performance of quantum annealing devices, as we illustrate by describing the Kibble-Zurek scaling associated with the dynamics of symmetry breaking in the transverse field Ising model, recently probed using D-Wave machines. Specifically, we show that D-Wave data are reproduced by the SVL model.

TI Approximating Many-Body Quantum States with Quantum Circuits and
   Measurements
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB We introduce protocols to prepare many-body quantum states with quantum circuits assisted by local operations and classical communication. We show that by lifting the requirement of exact preparation, one can substantially save resources. In particular, the so-called W and, more generally, Dicke states require a circuit depth and number of ancillas per site that are independent of the system size. As a by-product of our work, we introduce an efficient scheme to implement certain nonlocal, non-Clifford unitary operators. We also discuss how similar ideas may be applied in the preparation of eigenstates of well-known spin models, both free and interacting.

TI Fundamentals of Quantum Fourier Optics
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM ENGINEERING
AB All-quantum signal processing techniques are at the core of the successful advancement of most information-based quantum technologies. This article develops coherent and comprehensive methodologies and mathematical models to describe Fourier optical signal processing in full quantum terms for any input quantum state of light. We begin this article by introducing a spatially 2-D quantum state of a photon, associated with its wavefront and expressible as a 2-D creation operator. Then, by breaking down the Fourier optical processing apparatus into its key components, we strive to acquire the quantum unitary transformation or the input/output quantum relation of the 2-D creation operators. Subsequently, we take advantage of the above results to develop and obtain the quantum analogous of a few essential Fourier optical apparatuses, such as quantum convolution via a 4f-processing system and a quantum 4f-processing system with periodic pupils. Moreover, due to the importance and widespread use of optical pulse shaping in various optical communications and optical sciences fields, we also present an analogous system in full quantum terms, namely quantum pulse shaping with an 8f-processing system. Finally, we apply our results to two extreme examples of the quantum state of light. One is based on a coherent (Glauber) state and the other on a single-photon number (Fock) state for each of the above optical systems. We believe the schemes and mathematical models developed in this article can impact many areas of quantum optical signal processing, quantum holography, quantum communications, quantum radars and multiple-input/multiple-output antennas, and many more applications in quantum imaging, quantum computations, and quantum machine learning algorithms.

TI Constrained quantum optimization for extractive summarization on a
   trapped-ion quantum computer
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Realizing the potential of near-term quantum computers to solve industry-relevant constrained-optimization problems is a promising path to quantum advantage. In this work, we consider the extractive summarization constrained-optimization problem and demonstrate the largest-to-date execution of a quantum optimization algorithm that natively preserves constraints on quantum hardware. We report results with the Quantum Alternating Operator Ansatz algorithm with a Hamming-weight-preserving XY mixer (XY-QAOA) on trapped-ion quantum computer. We successfully execute XY-QAOA circuits that restrict the quantum evolution to the in-constraint subspace, using up to 20 qubits and a two-qubit gate depth of up to 159. We demonstrate the necessity of directly encoding the constraints into the quantum circuit by showing the trade-off between the in-constraint probability and the quality of the solution that is implicit if unconstrained quantum optimization methods are used. We show that this trade-off makes choosing good parameters difficult in general. We compare XY-QAOA to the Layer Variational Quantum Eigensolver algorithm, which has a highly expressive constant-depth circuit, and the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm. We discuss the respective trade-offs of the algorithms and implications for their execution on near-term quantum hardware.

TI Tailoring Nuclear Spins Order With Defects: A Quantum Technology CAD
   Study
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB The full design of relevant systems for quantum applications, ranging from quantum simulation to sensing, is presented using a combination of atomistic methods. A prototypical system features a 2D ordered distribution of spins interacting with out-of-plane spin drivers/probes. It could be realized in wide-bandgap semiconductors through open-volume point defects and functionalized surfaces with low Miller indexes. The case of defect electron spins (driver / probe) interacting via hyperfine coupling is studied with S=1/2$S=1/2$ nuclear spins of H atoms chemisorbed onto (001) and (111) 3C-SiC surfaces. The system fabrication processes is stimulated with super lattice kinetic Monte Carlo (SlKMC), demonstrating that epitaxial growth under time-dependent conditions is a viable method for achieving controlled abundance or depletion of near-surface point defects. Quantum features are evaluated by means of extensive numerical analysis at a full quantum mechanical level based on calibrated models of interacting spin systems. This analysis includes both stationary (relative stability of ordered states) and time-dependent (protocols) conditions, achieved varying the model parameters (in our case the atomic structure and the external field). A rich scenario of metastable spin-waves is identified in the quantum simulation setting. The interaction between protocols and variable system configurations could hinder the effectiveness of the preparation/measurement phases.

TI Quantum simulation of lattice gauge theories on superconducting
   circuits: Quantum phase transition and quench dynamics
SO CHINESE PHYSICS B
AB Recently, quantum simulation of low-dimensional lattice gauge theories (LGTs) has attracted many interests, which may improve our understanding of strongly correlated quantum many-body systems. Here, we propose an implementation to approximate DOUBLE-STRUCK CAPITAL Z(2) LGT on superconducting quantum circuits, where the effective theory is a mixture of a LGT and a gauge-broken term. By using matrix product state based methods, both the ground state properties and quench dynamics are systematically investigated. With an increase of the transverse (electric) field, the system displays a quantum phase transition from a disordered phase to a translational symmetry breaking phase. In the ordered phase, an approximate Gauss law of the DOUBLE-STRUCK CAPITAL Z(2) LGT emerges in the ground state. Moreover, to shed light on the experiments, we also study the quench dynamics, where there is a dynamical signature of the spontaneous translational symmetry breaking. The spreading of the single particle of matter degree is diffusive under the weak transverse field, while it is ballistic with small velocity for the strong field. Furthermore, due to the emergent Gauss law under the strong transverse field, the matter degree can also exhibit confinement dynamics which leads to a strong suppression of the nearest-neighbor hopping. Our results pave the way for simulating the LGT on superconducting circuits, including the quantum phase transition and quench dynamics.

TI Variational Quantum Process Tomography of Non-Unitaries
SO ENTROPY
AB Quantum process tomography is a fundamental and critical benchmarking and certification tool that is capable of fully characterizing an unknown quantum process. Standard quantum process tomography suffers from an exponentially scaling number of measurements and complicated data post-processing due to the curse of dimensionality. On the other hand, non-unitary operators are more realistic cases. In this work, we put forward a variational quantum process tomography method based on the supervised quantum machine learning framework. It approximates the unknown non-unitary quantum process utilizing a relatively shallow depth parametric quantum circuit and fewer input states. Numerically, we verified our method by reconstructing the non-unitary quantum mappings up to eight qubits in two cases: the weighted sum of the randomly generated quantum circuits and the imaginary time evolution of the Heisenberg XXZ spin chain Hamiltonian. Results show that those quantum processes could be reconstructed with high fidelities (> 99%) and shallow depth parametric quantum circuits (d <= 8), while the number of input states required is at least two orders of magnitude less than the demands of the standard quantum process tomography. Our work shows the potential of the variational quantum process tomography method in characterizing non-unitary operators.

TI Enhanced Security of Software-defined Network and Network Slice Through
   Hybrid Quantum Key Distribution Protocol
SO INFOCOMMUNICATIONS JOURNAL
AB Software-defined networking (SDN) has revolutionized the world of technology as networks have become more flexible, dynamic and programmable. The ability to conduct network slicing in 5G networks is one of the most crucial features of SDN implementation. Although network programming provides new security solutions of traditional networks, SDN and network slicing also have security issues, an important one being the weaknesses related to openflow channel between the data plane and controller as the network can be attacked via the openflow channel and exploit communications with the control plane. Our work proposes a solution to provide adequate security for openflow messages through using a hybrid key consisting of classical and quantum key distribution protocols to provide double security depending on the computational complexity and physical properties of quantum. To achieve this goal, the hybrid key used with transport layer security protocol to provide confidentiality, integrity and quantum authentication to secure openflow channel. We experimentally based on the SDN-testbed and network slicing to show the workflow of exchanging quantum and classical keys between the control plane and data plane and our results showed the effectiveness of the hybrid key to enhance the security of the transport layer security protocol. Thereby achieving adequate security for openflow channel against classical and quantum computer attacks.

TI A KPI framework to standardize the measurement of a country's progress
   in bringing quantum computing into application
SO EPJ QUANTUM TECHNOLOGY
AB Quantum computing (QC) is a new and disruptive technology with large economic potential especially in application and downstream value creation stages. Hence, it is important for an economy to understand the current implementation state and to know the ecosystem to support the successful industrial application of this technology. Regularly identifying potential areas of improvement and then defining appropriate actions is necessary to ensure a leading position. Therefore, the Quantum Technology and Application Consortium (QUTAC) has developed a Key Performance Indicator (KPI) framework consisting of 24 KPIs that represent a country's performance in applying QC. Detailed measurement guidelines and clear data sources ensure transparency of measurement, reproducibility of KPI values and comparability over time. An aggregation method allows summarizing the results of all KPIs. Thus, it is possible to assess the performance of each stakeholder involved and to calculate a single composite indicator that represents the country's performance. The KPI framework can be adapted to any country and enables the comparison of the performance of different countries. It is a proposal for standardizing the evaluation of QC and its ecosystem on a national level. Thus, strengths and weaknesses can be identified and measurements for improvement derived. The paper highlights the development of the framework, its main features and the application of the framework to Germany. Based on the results, we will discuss the current state of QC application in Germany and make possible suggestions for improvement.

TI Conceptual Framework for Quantum Affective Computing and Its Use in
   Fusion of Multi-Robot Emotions
SO ELECTRONICS
AB This study presents a modest attempt to interpret, formulate, and manipulate the emotion of robots within the precepts of quantum mechanics. Our proposed framework encodes emotion information as a superposition state, whilst unitary operators are used to manipulate the transition of emotion states which are subsequently recovered via appropriate quantum measurement operations. The framework described provides essential steps towards exploiting the potency of quantum mechanics in a quantum affective computing paradigm. Further, the emotions of multi-robots in a specified communication scenario are fused using quantum entanglement, thereby reducing the number of qubits required to capture the emotion states of all the robots in the environment, and therefore fewer quantum gates are needed to transform the emotion of all or part of the robots from one state to another. In addition to the mathematical rigours expected of the proposed framework, we present a few simulation-based demonstrations to illustrate its feasibility and effectiveness. This exposition is an important step in the transition of formulations of emotional intelligence to the quantum era.

TI Image Similarity Quantum Algorithm and Its Application in Image
   Retrieval Systems
SO ENTROPY
AB The measurement of image similarity represents a fundamental task within the domain of image processing, enabling the application of sophisticated computational techniques to ascertain the degree of similarity between two images. To enhance the performance of these similarity measurement algorithms, the academic community has investigated a range of quantum algorithms. Notably, the swap test-based quantum inner product algorithm (ST-QIP) has emerged as a pivotal method for computing image similarity. However, the inherent destructive nature of the swap test necessitates multiple quantum state evolutions and measurements, which leads to consumption of quantum resources and prolonged computational time, ultimately constraining its practical applicability. To address these limitations, this study introduces an advanced quantum inner product algorithm based on amplitude estimation (AE-QIP) designed to compute image similarity. This innovative approach circumvents the repetitive measurement processes associated with the swap test, thereby optimizing the utilization of quantum resources and substantially enhancing the algorithm's performance. We conducted experiments using a quantum simulator to implement the AE-QIP algorithm and evaluate its effectiveness in the image retrieval tasks. It is found that the AE-QIP algorithm achieves comparable precision to the ST-QIP algorithm while exhibiting significant reductions in qubit consumption and average processing time. Additionally, our findings suggest that increasing the number of ancillary qubits can further enhance the accuracy of the AE-QIP algorithm. Overall, within the acceptable error thresholds, the AE-QIP algorithm exhibits enhanced efficiency relative to the ST-QIP algorithm. However, significant further research is needed to address the challenges involved in optimizing the performance of quantum retrieval systems as a whole.

TI Enhancement of Sensitivity Near Exceptional Points in Dissipative
   Qubit-Resonator Systems
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB Dissipation usually plays a negative role in quantum metrological technologies, which aim to improve measurement precision by leveraging quantum effects that are vulnerable to environment-induced decoherence. Recently, it has been demonstrated that dissipation can actually be used as a favorable resource for enhancing the susceptibility of signal detection. However, demonstrations of such enhancement for detecting physical quantities in open quantum systems are still lacking. Here a protocol is proposed and demonstrated for realizing such non-Hermitian quantum sensors for probing the coupling between a qubit and a resonator subjecting to energy dissipations. The excitation-number conversion associated with the no-jump evolution trajectory enables removal of the noisy outcomes with quantum jumps, implementing the exceptional point (EP), where the Rabi splitting exhibits a divergent behavior in response to a tiny variation of the effective coupling. The sensitivity enhancement near the EP is confirmed by both theoretical calculation and experimental measurement.

TI Enhanced optical pumping using mutually orthogonal magnetic fields for
   quantum sensing
SO EPL
AB - The atomic population trapped in irrelevant atomic states is a limiting factor for sensors based on laser-atom interaction. Using a bi-chromatic light field along with a specific combination of magnetic fields, we show a significant increase in the amplitude ( i.e. , more than seven times) of a two-photon coherent population trapping (CPT) resonance, which can be effectively used for atomic magnetometry. This increase in amplitude can be explained through enhanced optical pumping via the transfer of population to the relevant Zeeman states. Our experimental observations are consistent with the theoretical calculations carried out for a realistic three-level atomic system using density matrix formalism. We further discuss the optimum condition for enhanced optical pumping by adjusting the ground-state decoherence rate. Enhanced optical pumping through the manipulation of the magnetic field is quite important and is of great interest in the field of quantum technology.

SO FOUNDATIONS OF PHYSICS
AB The transition from unitary, reversible von Neumann-Everett quantum processes to non-unitary, irreversible processes and measurements is explored through infinite tensor products interpreted as nested, chained, or iterated Wigner's friend scenarios. Infinite tensor products can disrupt unitary equivalence through sectorization and factorization, drawing parallels to concepts from real analysis, recursive mathematics, and statistical physics.

TI Towards the industrialisation of quantum key distribution in
   communication networks: A short survey
SO IET QUANTUM COMMUNICATION
AB Quantum information and communication technology will lead us to the new era of ultrafast and absolute-secure networks. With the emergence of quantum supremacy on the horizon, the security of various classical encryption systems soon may be deemed obsolete. As a remedy, quantum key distribution (QKD) is proposed as a novel quantum-based secret keys exchange, which is developed to solve the problems of legacy encryption. It is anticipated that QKD will provide stronger security for future communication systems even in the presence of malicious quantum attacks. As the QKD research and development is getting mature, the theoretical use cases of QKD in various industries are proliferating. In this treatise, we summarise the potential applications of QKD for future communication technology while highlighting the ongoing standardisation efforts essential for the sustainability and reliability of the near-future deployment. Additionally, we also present the various challenges faced by both discrete variable and continuous variable QKD schemes hindering their widespread implementation into our future communication networks.

TI Diamond NV Centers Based Quantum Sensor Using a VCO Integrated With
   Filtering Antenna
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INSTRUMENTATION AND MEASUREMENT
AB This article presents a diamond nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center-based magnetic field sensor using a voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO) integrated with a filtering antenna. In existing NV-based quantum sensing systems, microwave source and delivery units are implemented by a set of bulky and costly instruments. This limits its practical applications as well as portability. Here, a VCO integrated with the filtering antenna is designed, providing a more uniform, efficient, broadband and lower phase noise microwave field coupling to the NV centers. As a result, the sensitivity and the dynamic range have been improved over the conventional scheme using separate microwave components, such as antennas, transmission lines, and resonators. Moreover, in this work, the optic filter and photodetector are also integrated using the hybrid microwave integrated circuits (HMICs) technique for the first time. This significantly increases the integration level and reduces the cast of the NV-based magnetometers. The experimental results indicate that our VCO integrated filtering antenna achieves a sensitivity of 8.52 mu T/Hz(1/2) and a dynamic range up to 32.73 dB, which are both greatly improved compared to the VCO with a single resonator. This validates the effectiveness of the approach.

TI Almost indistinguishable single photons via multiplexing cascaded
   biphotons with cavity modulation and phase compensation
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB The cascade-emitted biphotons generated from alkali metal atomic ensembles are an excellent entanglement resource which enables long-distance quantum communication. The communication of quantum information between distant locations can be realized by utilizing the low-loss telecom bandwidth in the upper transition of the cascaded photons in a fiber-based quantum network. Meanwhile, the infrared photon from the lower transition of this highly directional and frequency-correlated biphoton can be created using the four-wave mixing process and can be stored locally as a collective spin wave. Here, we theoretically investigate the frequency entanglement of this biphoton and propose two approaches to remove the two photons' mutual correlations in frequency spaces. The first approach applies an optical cavity which modulates the biphoton spectrum into a more symmetric and narrow spectral function by multiplexing multiple atomic ensembles with phase compensation. The purity of the single photons reaches up to 0.999, and the entanglement entropy S of the biphoton is reduced to 0.006, which is 200 times smaller than the one without multiplexing. The other approach employs a symmetric pumping of the laser fields in two atomic ensembles, which leads to a moderate reduction of S similar to 0.3 when nondiscrimination detection devices are used for both photons. An extremely low frequency entanglement implies an almost indistinguishable single-photon source, which offers a potential resource for photonic quantum emulation and computation.

TI Breaking barriers in two-party quantum cryptography via stochastic
   semidefinite programming
SO QUANTUM
AB In the last two decades, there has been much effort in finding secure protocols for two-party cryptographic tasks. It has since been discovered that even with quantum mechanics, many such protocols are limited in their security promises. In this work, we use stochastic selection, an idea from stochastic programming, to circumvent such limitations. For example, we find a way to switch between bit commitment, weak coin flipping, and oblivious transfer protocols to improve their security. We also use stochastic selection to turn trash into treasure yielding the first quantum protocol for Rabin oblivious transfer.

TI Optimal function estimation with photonic quantum sensor networks
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB The problem of optimally measuring an analytic function of unknown local parameters each linearly coupled to a qubit sensor is well understood, with applications ranging from field interpolation to noise characterization. Here we resolve a number of open questions that arise when extending this framework to Mach-Zehnder interferometers and quadrature displacement sensing. In particular, we derive lower bounds on the achievable mean square error in estimating a linear function of either local phase shifts or quadrature displacements. In the case of local phase shifts, these results prove, and somewhat generalize, a conjecture by Proctor et al. [arXiv:1702.04271]. For quadrature displacements, we extend proofs of lower bounds to the case of arbitrary linear functions. We provide optimal protocols achieving these bounds up to small (multiplicative) constants and describe an algebraic approach to deriving new optimal protocols, possibly subject to additional constraints. Using this approach, we prove necessary conditions for the amount of entanglement needed for any optimal protocol for both local phase and displacement sensing.

TI State-dependent misalignment and turbulence effects on high-dimensional
   quantum key distribution with orbital angular momentum
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB High-dimensional quantum key distribution (HD-QKD) is a topic of growing interest in the quantum communication community, not only for its inherent properties but also for its possible applications. As the typical freedom in HD-QKD, orbital angular momentum (OAM) has made significant advancements in experiments recently. However, in the airborne scenario, different states suffer different amounts of misalignment and turbulence. A complete theoretical analysis model for the transmission characteristics of OAM in atmospheric channels is lacking. In this paper, we systematically analyze the extent to which degeneration including channel power loss and mode crosstalk are influenced by misalignment and turbulence effects. Furthermore, the performance of OAM-encoded HD-QKD system in different dimensions is evaluated while incorporating finite-key effects. We demonstrate that the performance of OAM-encoded HD-QKD will be better at short range, which provide a reference to implement QKD based on task requirements. Since OAM is desired to increase the capacity of QKD system and experiments have already been carried out, our work can not only bridge the gap between theory and practice, but also optimize experimental parameters and improve system performance.

TI Quantum-Tailored Machine-Learning Characterization of a Superconducting
   Qubit
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Machine learning (ML) is a promising approach for performing challenging quantum-information tasks such as device characterization, calibration, and control. ML models can train directly on the data produced by a quantum device while remaining agnostic to the quantum nature of the learning task. However, these generic models lack physical interpretability and usually require large datasets in order to learn accurately. Here we incorporate features of quantum mechanics in the design of our ML approach to characterize the dynamics of a quantum device and learn device parameters. This physics-inspired approach outperforms physics-agnostic recurrent neural networks trained on numerically generated and experimental data obtained from continuous weak measurement of a driven superconducting transmon qubit. This demonstration shows how leveraging domain knowledge improves the accuracy and efficiency of this characterization task, thus laying the groundwork for more scalable characterization techniques.

TI Artificial neural network syndrome decoding on IBM quantum processors
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Syndrome decoding is an integral but computationally demanding step in the implementation of quantum error correction for fault-tolerant quantum computing. Here, we report the development and benchmarking of Artificial Neural Network (ANN) decoding on IBM quantum processors. We demonstrate that ANNs can efficiently decode syndrome measurement data from heavy-hexagonal code architecture and apply appropriate corrections to facilitate error protection. The current physical error rates of IBM devices are above the code's threshold and restrict the scope of our ANN decoder for logical error rate suppression. However, our work confirms the applicability of ANN decoding methods of syndrome data retrieved from experimental devices and establishes machine learning as a promising pathway for quantum error correction when quantum devices with below threshold error rates become available in the near future.

TI Triangular quantum photonic devices with integrated detectors in silicon
   carbide
SO MATERIALS FOR QUANTUM TECHNOLOGY
AB Triangular cross-section silicon carbide (SiC) photonic devices have been studied as an efficient and scalable route for integration of color centers into quantum hardware. In this work, we explore efficient collection and detection of color center emission in a triangular cross-section SiC waveguide by introducing a photonic crystal mirror on its one side and a superconducting nanowire single photon detector (SNSPD) on the other. Our modeled triangular cross-section devices with a randomly positioned emitter have a maximum coupling efficiency of 89% into the desired optical mode and a high coupling efficiency ( > 75%) in more than half of the configurations. For the first time, NbTiN thin films were sputtered on 4H-SiC and the electrical and optical properties of the thin films were measured. We found that the transport properties are similar to the case of NbTiN on SiO2 substrates, while the extinction coefficient is up to 50% higher for 1680 nm wavelength. Finally, we performed finite-difference time-domain simulations of triangular cross-section waveguide integrated with an SNSPD to identify optimal nanowire geometries for efficient detection of light from transverse electric and transverse magnetic polarized modes.

TI Decoherence-enabled unconditional strongly sub-Poissonian squeezing
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB It is generally accepted that the role of quantum decoherence is to spoil the quantum superpositions and to yield the emergence of the classical behaviors from quantum mechanics. Contrary to the common knowledge of decoherence, we propose a scheme to generate a steady-state bright source of strongly sub-Poissonian squeezed light using the environmentally induced decoherence. The disappearance of the process of decoherence disables the generation of the squeezed state of the combination modes, while the presence of the decoherence results in the strongly nonclassical light source at the sub-shot-noise level and even near-perfect sub-Poissonian squeezed state of light. This excludes the use of the paradigm that the good insulation of a quantum system from its surrounding environment is highly desirable to explore its quantum property and fuel the growth of quantum information science. The interactions with the atom make no contribution to the preparation of squeezed light. These counterintuitive results are originated from the intrinsic quantum reservoir in the dressed-atom combination mode picture, which may open the door to exploring high levels of squeezing induced by the decoherence in the stationary regime.

TI Performance Improvement for Discretely Modulated Continuous-Variable
   Measurement-Device-Independent Quantum Key Distribution with Imbalanced
   Modulation
SO ENTROPY
AB The modulation mode at the transmitters plays a crucial role in the continuous-variable measurement-device-independent quantum key distribution (CV-MDI-QKD) protocol. However, in practical applications, differences in the modulation schemes between two transmitters can inevitably impact protocol performance, particularly when using discrete modulation with four-state or eight-state formats. This work primarily investigates the effect of imbalanced modulation at the transmitters on the security of the CV-MDI-QKD protocol under both symmetric and asymmetric distance scenarios. By employing imbalanced discrete modulation maps and numerical convex optimization techniques, the proposed CV-MDI-QKD protocol achieves a notably higher secret key rate and outperforms existing protocols in terms of maximum transmission distance. Specifically, simulation results demonstrate that the secret key rate and maximum transmission distance are boosted by approximately 77.77% and 24.3%, respectively, compared to the original protocol. This novel and simplified modulation method can be seamlessly implemented in existing experimental setups without requiring equipment modifications. Furthermore, it provides a practical approach to enhancing protocol performance and enabling cost-effective applications in secure quantum communication networks under real-world environments.

The resulting logic is an extension of Combinatorial Array Logic (CAL) and is motivated by the analysis of quantum circuits: using projection, we can succinctly encode the semantics of quantum gates as quantifier-free formulas and verify the end-to-end correctness of quantum circuits. Since the logic is expressive enough to represent quantum circuits succinctly, it necessarily has a high complexity; as we show, it suffices to encode the k-color problem of a graph under a succinct circuit representation, an NEXPTIME-complete problem. We present an NEXPTIME decision procedure for the logic and report on preliminary experiments with the analysis of quantum circuits using this decision procedure.

TI First Attempts at Cryptanalyzing a (Toy) Block Cipher by Means of
   Quantum Optimization Approaches
SO JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL SCIENCE
AB The discovery of quantum algorithms that may impact cryptography is one of the main reasons for the rise of quantum computing. Currently, all quantum cryptanalysis techniques are purely theoretical and none of them can be executed on quantum devices already existing or available in the near term. So, this paper investigates the capability of presently existing quantum computers to attack a toy block cipher (namely the Heys cipher) using the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) on gate-based quantum computers and a variant of the Quantum Annealing (QA) algorithm on analog quantum computers. Starting from a knownplaintext key recovery problem, we transform it into an instance of the MAX-SAT problem. For the QAOA approach, we propose two ways to implement it in a quantum circuit and try to solve it using publicly available IBM Q Experience quantum computers. For the QA approach, we compare two reductions into a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) instance by solving their output on D-Wave quantum annealers. The results suggest that the limited number of qubits (especially for gate-based quantum computers) requires the use of exponential algorithms to achieve the transformation of our problem into a MAX-SAT instance. Furthermore, despite encouraging simulation results on QAOA, the quantum circuits are too deep to work on nowadays (too-)noisy gate-based quantum computers. Finally, even if the QA algorithm seems better than QAOA on quantum hardware, it needs more complex instance transformations that reduce its scaling abilities. Our results show that the attack is not feasible on real hardware even in very simplified settings, at least as long as there is no significant improvement of quantum processors. This is an extended version of our paper at the International Conference on Computational Science (ICCS) 2022 (Phab et al., 2022) [1] with new results on the application of the QA algorithm to our problem.

TI A Survey on Quantum Computing for Recommendation Systems
SO INFORMATION
AB Recommendation systems play a key role in everyday life; they are used to suggest items that are selected among many candidates that usually belong to huge datasets. The recommendations require a good performance both in terms of speed and the effectiveness of the provided suggestions. At the same time, one of the most challenging approaches in computer science is quantum computing. This computational paradigm can provide significant acceleration for resource-demanding and time-consuming algorithms. It has become very popular in recent years, thanks to the different tools available to the scientific and technical communities. Since performance has great relevance in recommendation systems, many researchers in the scientific community have recently proposed different improvements that exploit quantum approaches to provide better performance in recommendation systems. This paper gives an overview of the current state of the art in the literature, outlining the different proposed methodologies and techniques and highlighting the challenges that arise from this new approach to the recommendation systems domain.

Testing: We give a tolerant testing protocol to decide if a Hamiltonian is epsilon(1)-close to k-local or epsilon(2)-far from k-local in the l(2) norm of the coefficients, with O(1/(epsilon(2)-epsilon(1))(4)) queries, thereby solving two open questions posed in a recent work by Bluhm, Caro and Oufkir (Bluhm, A., Caro, M.C., Oufkir, A.). We give a protocol for testing whether a Hamiltonian is epsilon(1)-close to being s-sparse or epsilon(2)-far from being s-sparse in the l(2) norm of the coefficients, with O(s(6)/(epsilon(2)(2)-epsilon(2)(1))(6)) queries. 2. Learning: We give a protocol to epsilon-learn unstructured Hamiltonian in the l(infinity) norm of the coefficients with O(1/epsilon(4)) queries. Combining this with the non-commutative Bohnenblust-Hille inequality, we obtain an algorithm for learning k-local Hamiltonians in l(2) norm of the coefficients that only uses O(exp(k(2) + k log(1/epsilon))) queries. For Hamiltonians that are s-sparse in the Pauli basis, we can learn them in the l(2) norm with O(s(2)/epsilon(4)) queries. 3. Learning without quantum memory: The learning results stated above have no dependence on the system size n, but require n-qubit quantum memory. We give subroutines that allow us to reproduce all the above learning results without quantum memory; squaring the query complexity and paying a (log n)-factor in the local case and an n-factor in the sparse case. 4. Testing without quantum memory: We give a new subroutine called Pauli hashing, which allows one to tolerantly test s-sparse Hamiltonians in the l(2) norm using O(s(14)/(epsilon(2)(2)-epsilon(2)(1) )(18)) query complexity. A key ingredient is showing that s-sparse Pauli channels can be tested in a tolerant fashion as being epsilon(1)-close to being s-sparse or epsilon(2)-far under the diamond norm, using O(s(2)/(epsilon(2)-epsilon(1))(6)) queries via Pauli hashing. In order to prove these results, we prove new structural theorems for local Hamiltonians, sparse Pauli channels and sparse Hamiltonians. We complement our learning algorithms with lower bounds that are polynomially weaker. Furthermore, our algorithms use short time evolutions and do not assume prior knowledge of the terms on which the Pauli spectrum is supported on, i.e., we do not require prior knowledge of the support of the Hamiltonian.

TI Metasurface- assisted multimodal quantum imaging
SO PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF
   AMERICA
AB Traditional quantum imaging is featured by remarkable sensitivity and signal- to- noise ratio, but limited by bulkiness and static function (either phase contrast imaging or edge detection). Our report synergizes a polarization- entangled source with a metasurface consisting of various sophisticatedly engineered spatial frequency segments. By tuning polarization, we demonstrate multiple "on"- state quantum imaging modes, enabling flexible switching between phase contrast, edge, and arbitrary superimposed imaging mode. Furthermore, the "off"- state, which characterizes the background noise, enables self- calibration of the system by subtracting this noise in "on"- state modes, resulting in self- enhanced edge detection. Our approach performs phase contrast imaging with a phase difference of pi/4 present in the target object, and edge imaging capable of detecting tiny (radius about 2 mu m) defects, maintaining high image contrast (phase contrast of 0.726, and enhanced edge contrast of 0.902). Our results provide insights into constructive duet between quantum imaging and metaoptics.

TI Strain-enabled control of the vanadium qudit in silicon carbide
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW MATERIALS
AB Vanadium in silicon carbide is a promising spin photon interface candidate with optical transitions in the telecom range and a long lived electron spin, hosted in an advanced semiconductor platform. In this detailed investigation of the defect's 16-dimensional ground state spin manifold at millikelvin temperatures, a wide range of previously unreported transitions are observed which are accurately described using a theoretical model that includes strain. Using a superconducting microcoil we achieve Rabi frequencies exceeding 20 MHz and perform the first coherent manipulation of a direct hyperfine transition. These insights further underscore the defect's potential for strain engineering and sensing, as well as for fault-tolerant qudit encoding.

TI Scalable Approach for Grafting Qubit Candidates onto the Surface of
   MOF-808 Framework
SO RUSSIAN JOURNAL OF COORDINATION CHEMISTRY
AB The development of quantum bits (qubits) is crucial for the progress of quantum technologies. Among various approaches, the qubits based on paramagnetic centers have decent advantages, including their diversity and possibilities of regular ordering, for example, within the structure of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs). In the present work a simple and scalable approach to obtain qubit candidates based on stable organic radical 3-carboxy-proxyl and MOF-808 framework has been demonstrated. Investigation of the obtained compounds with different radical amounts using electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) demonstrates the presence of two fractions of radicals, which is supported by simulations. Sufficiently long phase memory time at room temperature for the radicals adsorbed into MOF (0.39 mu s), as well as the observed Rabi nutations, allow considering this material as a platform for qubits design. The developed approach is capable of incorporating various amounts of paramagnetic centers into the MOF structure and can be employed to obtain other spin qubit candidates.

TI Noisy intermediate-scale quantum computers
SO FRONTIERS OF PHYSICS
AB Quantum computers have made extraordinary progress over the past decade, and significant milestones have been achieved along the path of pursuing universal fault-tolerant quantum computers. Quantum advantage, the tipping point heralding the quantum era, has been accomplished along with several waves of breakthroughs. Quantum hardware has become more integrated and architectural compared to its toddler days. The controlling precision of various physical systems is pushed beyond the fault-tolerant threshold. Meanwhile, quantum computation research has established a new norm by embracing industrialization and commercialization. The joint power of governments, private investors, and tech companies has significantly shaped a new vibrant environment that accelerates the development of this field, now at the beginning of the noisy intermediate-scale quantum era. Here, we first discuss the progress achieved in the field of quantum computation by reviewing the most important algorithms and advances in the most promising technical routes, and then summarizing the next-stage challenges. Furthermore, we illustrate our confidence that solid foundations have been built for the fault-tolerant quantum computer and our optimism that the emergence of quantum killer applications essential for human society shall happen in the future.

TI Quantum Misuse Attack on Frodo
SO ENTROPY
AB Research on the security of lattice-based public-key encryption schemes against misuse attacks is an important part of the cryptographic assessment of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) post-quantum cryptography (PQC) standardization process. In particular, many NIST-PQC cryptosystems follow the same meta-cryptosystem. At EUROCRYPT 2019, Waetu et al. mounted a classical key recovery under plaintext checking attacks (KR-PCA) and a quantum key recovery under chosen ciphertext attacks (KR-CCA). They analyzed the security of the weak version of nine submissions to NIST. In this paper, we focus on learning with error (LWE)-based FrodoPKE, whose IND-CPA security is tightly related to the hardness of plain LWE problems. We first review the meta-cryptosystem and quantum algorithm for solving quantum LWE problems. Then, we consider the case where the noise follows a discrete Gaussian distribution and recompute the success probability for quantum LWE by using Hoeffding bound. Finally, we give a quantum key recovery algorithm based on LWE under CCA attack and analyze the security of Frodo. Compared with the existing work of Baetu et al., our method reduces the number of queries from 2(2) to 1 with the same success probability.

TI Exploring quantum entanglement in chiral symmetry partial restoration
   with 1+1 string model
SO PHYSICS LETTERS B
AB Within the confining color flux tube picture, we assess the color electric field generated by quark-antiquark pairs within the framework of the Schwinger model and estimate its impact on the chiral condensate. We observe differences in the distribution of the color flux tube generated by quark-antiquark pairs at different separation distances, leading to discrepancies in the partial restoration of chiral symmetry. Furthermore, we suggest incorporating the color magnetic field in the calculation of chiral condensate, leading to quantum entanglement effects, and proceed to compute the entanglement entropy. We observe that the entanglement entropy increases with the distance of the color source (the separation distance between quark and anti -quark), and the magnitude of the color electric field and chiral condensate restoration after spatial integration also increases with the distance of the color source. Then, we try to provide a qualitative explanation for the existence of these phenomena.

TI Principles of quantum functional testing
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB With the increasing commercial availability of quantum information processing devices the need for testing them efficiently for their specified functionality will arise. Complete quantum channel characterization is out of the question for anything more than the simplest quantum channels for one or two qubits. Quantum functional testing leads to a decision problem with outcomes corresponding to the rejection or acceptance of the claim of the producer that the device parameters are within certain specifications. In this context, we introduce and analyze three ingredients that can speed up this decision problem: the iteration of the channel, efficient decision criteria, and nongreedy adaptive experimental design.

AB Quantum networking holds tremendous promise in transforming computation and communication. Entangled-photon sources are critical for quantum repeaters and networking, while photonic integrated circuits are vital for miniaturization and scalability. In this talk, we focus on generating and manipulating frequency-bin entangled states within integrated platforms. We encode quantum information as a coherent superposition of multiple optical frequencies; this approach is favorable due to its amenability to high-dimensional entanglement and compatibility with fiber transmission. We successfully generate and measure the density matrix of biphoton frequency combs from integrated silicon nitride microrings, fully reconstructing the state in an 8 x 8 two-qudit Hilbert space, the highest so far for frequency bins. Moreover, we employ Vernier electro-optic phase modulation methods to perform time-resolved measurements of biphoton correlation functions. Currently, we are exploring bidirectional pumping of microrings to generate indistinguishable entangled pairs in both directions, aiming to demonstrate key networking operations such as entanglement swapping and Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger state generation in the frequency domain.

TI N-Sum Box: An Abstraction for Linear Computation Over Many-to-One
   Quantum Networks
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION THEORY
AB Linear computations over quantum many-to-one communication networks offer opportunities for communication cost improvements through schemes that exploit quantum entanglement among transmitters to achieve superdense coding gains, combined with classical techniques such as interference alignment. The problem becomes much more broadly accessible if suitable abstractions can be found for the underlying quantum functionality via classical black box models. This work formalizes such an abstraction in the form of an "N-sum box", a black box generalization of a two-sum protocol of Song et al. with recent applications to N-server private information retrieval. The N-sum box has a communication cost of N qudits and classical output of a vector of N similar to q-ary digits linearly dependent (via an N x 2N transfer matrix) on 2N classical inputs distributed among N transmitters. We characterize which transfer matrices are feasible by our construction, both with and without the possibility of additional locally invertible classical operations at the transmitters and receivers. Furthermore, we provide a sample application to Cross-Subspace Alignment (CSA) schemes to obtain efficient instances of Quantum Private Information Retrieval (QPIR) and Quantum Secure Distributed Batch Matrix Multiplication (QSDBMM). We first describe N-sum boxes based on maximal stabilizers and we then consider non-maximal-stabilizer-based constructions to obtain an instance of Quantum Symmetric Private Information Retrieval.

It provides a generalization of a seminal Choi nondecomposable extremal map in M 3. We investigate when generalized Choi maps are optimal, i.e. cannot be represented as a sum of positive and completely positive maps. This property is weaker than extremality, however, it turns out that it plays a key role in detecting quantum entanglement.

TI QUANTUM SPEEDUP FOR GRAPH SPARSIFICATION, CUT APPROXIMATION, AND
   LAPLACIAN SOLVING
SO SIAM JOURNAL ON COMPUTING
AB Graph sparsification underlies a large number of algorithms, ranging from approximation algorithms for cut problems to solvers for linear systems in the graph Laplacian. In its strongest form, ``spectral sparsification"" reduces the number of edges to near-linear in the number of nodes, while approximately preserving the cut and spectral structure of the graph. In this work we demonstrate a polynomial quantum speedup for spectral sparsification and many of its applications. In particular, we give a quantum algorithm that, given a weighted graph with n nodes and m edges, outputs a classical description of an \epsilon -spectral sparsifier in sublinear time Owidetilde \(\surd mn/\epsilon ). This contrasts with the optimal classical complexity Owidetilde \(m). We also prove that our quantum algorithm is optimal up to polylog-factors. The algorithm builds on a string of existing results on sparsification, graph spanners, quantum algorithms for shortest paths, and efficient constructions for k-wise independent random strings. Our algorithm implies a quantum speedup for solving Laplacian systems and for approximating a range of cut problems such as min cut and sparsest cut.

TI Quantum Weighted Fractional Fourier Transform
SO MATHEMATICS
AB Quantum Fourier transform (QFT) is an important part of many quantum algorithms. However, there are few reports on quantum fractional Fourier transform (QFRFT). The main reason is that the definitions of fractional Fourier transform (FRFT) are diverse, while some definitions do not include unitarity, which leads to some studies pointing out that there is no QFRFT. In this paper, we first present a reformulation of the weighted fractional Fourier transform (WFRFT) and prove its unitarity, thereby proposing a quantum weighted fractional Fourier transform (QWFRFT). The proposal of QWFRFT provides the possibility for many quantum implementations of signal processing.

   Measurements for Quantum Algorithms
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Many prominent quantum computing algorithms with applications in fields such as chemistry and materials science require a large number of measurements, which represents an important roadblock for future real-world use cases. We introduce a novel approach to tackle this problem through an adaptive measurement scheme. We present an algorithm that optimizes informationally complete positive operator-valued measurements (POVMs) on the fly in order to minimize the statistical fluctuations in the estimation of relevant cost functions. We show its advantage by improving the efficiency of the variational quantum eigensolver in calculating ground-state energies of molecular Hamiltonians with extensive numerical simulations. Our results indicate that the proposed method is competitive with state-of-the-art measurement-reduction approaches in terms of efficiency. In addition, the informational completeness of the approach offers a crucial advantage, as the measurement data can be reused to infer other quantities of interest. We demonstrate the feasibility of this prospect by reusing ground-state energy-estimation data to perform high-fidelity reduced state tomography.

TI A quantum circuit simulator and its applications on Sunway TaihuLight
   supercomputer
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Classical simulation of quantum computation is vital for verifying quantum devices and assessing quantum algorithms. We present a new quantum circuit simulator developed on the Sunway TaihuLight supercomputer. Compared with other simulators, the present one is distinguished in two aspects. First, our simulator is more versatile. The simulator consists of three mutually independent parts to compute the full, partial and single amplitudes of a quantum state with different methods. It has the function of emulating the effect of noise and support more kinds of quantum operations. Second, our simulator is of high efficiency. The simulator is designed in a two-level parallel structure to be implemented efficiently on the distributed many-core Sunway TaihuLight supercomputer. Random quantum circuits can be simulated with 40, 75 and 200 qubits on the full, partial and single amplitude, respectively. As illustrative applications of the simulator, we present a quantum fast Poisson solver and an algorithm for quantum arithmetic of evaluating transcendental functions. Our simulator is expected to have broader applications in developing quantum algorithms in various fields.

TI Resource-efficient quantum simulation of lattice gauge theories in
   arbitrary dimensions: Solving for Gauss's law and fermion elimination
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Quantum simulation of lattice gauge theories has been proposed and used as a method to overcome theoretical difficulties in dealing with the nonperturbative nature of such models. In this work we focus on two important bottlenecks that make developing such simulators hard: one is the difficulty of simulating fermionic degrees of freedom, and the other is the redundancy of the Hilbert space, which leads to a waste of experimental resources and the need to impose and monitor the local symmetry constraints of gauge theories. This has previously been tackled in one-dimensional settings, using nonlocal methods. Here we show an alternative procedure for dealing with these problems, which removes the matter and the Hilbert space redundancy, and is valid for higher space dimensions. We demonstrate it for a Z2 lattice gauge theory and implement it experimentally via the IBMQ cloud quantum computing platform.

TI Direct Generation and Non-Hermitian Regulation of
   Energy-Time-Polarization-Hyper-Entangled Quadphotons
SO SENSORS
AB Entangled multiphoton is an ideal resource for quantum information technology. Here, narrow-bandwidth hyper-entangled quadphoton is theoretically demonstrated by quantizing degenerate Zeeman sub states through spontaneous eight-wave mixing (EWM) in a hot 85Rb. Polarization-based energy-time entanglement (output) under multiple polarized dressings is presented in detail with uncorrelated photons and Raman scattering suppressed. High-dimensional entanglement is contrived by passive non-Hermitian characteristic, and EWM-based quadphoton is genuine quadphoton with quadripartite entanglement. High quadphoton production rate is achieved from co-action of four strong input fields, and electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) slow light effect. Atomic passive non-Hermitian characteristic provides the system with acute coherent tunability around exceptional points (EPs). The results unveil multiple coherent channels (similar to 8) inducing oscillations with multiple periods (similar to 19) in quantum correlations, and high-dimensional (similar to 8) four-body entangled quantum network (capacity similar to 65536). Coexistent hyper and high-dimensional entanglements facilitate high quantum information capacity. The system can be converted among three working states under regulating passive non-Hermitian characteristic via triple polarized dressing. The research provides a promising approach for applying hyper-entangled multiphoton to tunable quantum networks with high information capacity, whose multi-partite entanglement and multiple-degree-of-freedom properties help optimize the accuracy of quantum sensors.

TI Enhancement of a silicon waveguide single photon source by temporal
   multiplexing
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Efficient generation of single photons is one of the key challenges of building photonic quantum technology, such as quantum computers and long-distance quantum networks. Photon source multiplexing-where successful pair generation is heralded by the detection of one of the photons, and its partner is routed to a single mode output-has long been known to offer a concrete solution, with output probability tending toward unity as loss is reduced. Here, we present a temporally multiplexed integrated single photon source based on a silicon waveguide and a low-loss fibre switch and loop architecture, which achieves enhancement of the single photon output probability of 4.5 +/- 0.5, while retaining g((2)) (0) = 0.01.

TI Fault-Tolerant Quantum Simulation of Generalized Hubbard Models
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Quantum simulations of strongly interacting fermionic systems, such as those described by the Hubbard model, are promising candidates for useful early fault-tolerant quantum computing applications. This paper presents tile Trotterization, a generalization of plaquette Trotterization, which uses a set of tiles to construct Trotter decompositions of arbitrary lattice Hubbard models. The tile Trotterization scheme also enables the simulation of more complex models, including the extended Hubbard model. We improve previous Hubbard-model commutator bounds, further provide tight commutator bounds for periodic extended Hubbard models, and demonstrate the use of tensor network methods for this task. We consider applications of tile Trotterization to simulate hexagonal lattice Hubbard models and compare the resource requirements of tile Trotterization for performing quantum phase estimation to a qubitizationbased approach, demonstrating that tile Trotterization scales more efficiently with system size. These advancements significantly broaden the potential applications of early fault-tolerant quantum computers to models of practical interest in materials research and organic chemistry.

TI Realization of an untrusted intermediate relay architecture using a

SO NATURE PHYSICS
AB To fully exploit the potential of quantum technologies, quantum networks are needed to link different systems, enhancing applications in computing, cryptography and metrology. Central to these networks are quantum relays that can facilitate long-distance entanglement distribution and quantum communication. In this work, we present a modular and scalable quantum relay architecture using a high-quality single-photon source. The proposed network incorporates three untrusted intermediate nodes and is capable of a repetition rate of 304.52 MHz. We use a measurement-device-independent protocol to demonstrate secure key establishment over fibres covering up to 300 km. This study highlights the potential of single-photon sources in quantum relays to enhance information transmission, expand network coverage and improve deployment flexibility, with promising applications in future quantum networks.

TI Quantum communication through devices with indefinite input-output
   direction
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB Certain quantum devices, such as half-wave plates and quarter-wave plates in quantum optics, are bidirectional, meaning that the roles of their input and output ports can be exchanged. Bidirectional devices can be used in a forward mode and a backward mode, corresponding to two opposite choices of the input-output direction. They can also be used in a coherent superposition of the forward and backward modes, giving rise to new operations with indefinite input-output direction. In this work we explore the potential of input-output indefiniteness for the transfer of classical and quantum information through noisy channels. We first formulate a model of communication from a sender to a receiver via a noisy channel used in indefinite input-output direction. Then, we show that indefiniteness of the input-output direction yields advantages over standard communication protocols in which the given noisy channel is used in a fixed input-output direction. These advantages range from a general reduction of noise in bidirectional processes, to heralded noiseless transmission of quantum states, and, in some special cases, to a complete noise removal. The noise reduction due to input-output indefiniteness can be experimentally demonstrated with current photonic technologies, providing a way to investigate the operational consequences of exotic scenarios characterised by coherent quantum superpositions of forward-time and backward-time processes.

TI Experimentally Probing Entropy Reduction via Iterative Quantum
   Information Transfer
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW X
AB Thermodynamic principles governing energy and information are important tools for a deeper understanding and better control of quantum systems. In this work, we experimentally investigate the interplay of the thermodynamic costs and information flow in a quantum system undergoing iterative quantum measurement and feedback. Our study employs a state stabilization protocol involving repeated measurement and feedback on an electronic spin qubit associated with a silicon-vacancy center in diamond, which is strongly coupled to a diamond nanocavity. This setup allows us to verify the fundamental laws of nonequilibrium quantum thermodynamics, including the second law and the fluctuation theorem, both of which incorporate measures of quantum information flow induced by iterative measurement and feedback. We further assess the reducible entropy based on the feedback's causal structure and quantitatively demonstrate the thermodynamic advantages of non-Markovian feedback over Markovian feedback. For that purpose, we extend the theoretical framework of quantum thermodynamics to include the causal structure of the applied feedback protocol. Our work lays the foundation for investigating the entropic and energetic costs of real-time quantum control in various quantum systems.

Here we propose a DLCZ-like scheme based on the noiseless photon echo in rare-earth ion-doped crystals. Correlated photon pairs with a controllable delay can be created by the direct optical rephasing. Theoretical analysis indicates that the protocol is efficient in the low-optical-depth regime. This protocol could be feasibly implemented to establish long-lived quantum correlations between a photon and a spin-wave excitation in rare-earth ion-doped crystals.

TI Public verifiable measurement-only blind quantum computation based on
   entanglement witnesses
SO QUANTUM INFORMATION PROCESSING
AB Recently, Sato et al. proposed an public verifiable blind quantum computation (BQC) protocol by inserting a third-party arbiter. However, it is not true public verifiable in a sense, because the arbiter is determined in advance and participates in the whole process. In this paper, a public verifiable protocol for measurement-only BQC is proposed. The fidelity between arbitrary states and the graph states of 2-colorable graphs is estimated by measuring the entanglement witnesses of the graph states, so as to verify the correctness of the prepared graph states. Compared with the previous protocol, our protocol is public verifiable in the true sense by allowing other random clients to execute the public verification. It also has greater advantages in the efficiency, where the number of local measurements is O(n(3) log n) and graph states' copies is O(n(2) log n).

TI Increasing the Hilbert space dimension using a single coupled molecular
   spin
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Quantum technologies are expected to introduce revolutionary changes in information processing in the near future. Nowadays, one of the main challenges is to be able to handle a large number of quantum bits (qubits), while preserving their quantum properties. Beyond the usual two-level encoding capacity of qubits, multi-level quantum systems are a promising way to extend and increase the amount of information that can be stored in the same number of quantum objects. Recent work (Kues et al. 2017), has shown the possibility to use devices based on photonic integrated circuits to entangle two qudits (with "d" being the number of available states). In the race to develop a mature quantum technology with real-world applications, many possible platforms are being investigated, including those that use photons, trapped ions, superconducting and silicon circuits and molecular magnets. In this work, we present the electronic read-out of a coupled molecular multi-level quantum systems, carried by a single Tb2Pc3 molecular magnet. Owning two magnetic centres, this molecular magnet architecture permits a 16 dimensions Hilbert space, opening the possibility of performing more complex quantum algorithms. Single-molecular magnets (SMM) are promising candidates for quantum technologies given the ease of repeatable manufacture and potential as qudits. Here, Biard et al succeed in electronically reading out a SMM containing two high-spin terbium atoms, allowing for a 16 dimensional Hilbert space.

TI Coherent feed-forward quantum neural network
SO QUANTUM MACHINE INTELLIGENCE
AB Quantum machine learning, focusing on quantum neural networks (QNNs), remains a vastly uncharted field of study. Current QNN models primarily employ variational circuits on an ansatz or a quantum feature map, often requiring multiple entanglement layers. This methodology not only increases the computational cost of the circuit beyond what is practical on near-term quantum devices but also misleadingly labels these models as neural networks, given their divergence from the structure of a typical feed-forward neural network (FFNN). Moreover, the circuit depth and qubit needs of these models scale poorly with the number of data features, resulting in an efficiency challenge for real-world machine learning tasks. We introduce a bona fide QNN model, which seamlessly aligns with the versatility of a traditional FFNN in terms of its adaptable intermediate layers and nodes, absent from intermediate measurements such that our entire model is coherent. This model stands out with its reduced circuit depth and number of requisite CNOT gates, achieving a more than 50% reduction in both compared to prevailing QNN models. Furthermore, the qubit count in our model remains unaffected by the data's feature quantity. We test our proposed model on various benchmarking datasets such as the breast cancer diagnostic (Wisconsin) and credit card fraud detection datasets. Our model achieved an accuracy of 91% on the breast cancer dataset and 85% on the credit card fraud detection dataset, outperforming existing QNN methods by 5-10% while requiring approximately 50% fewer quantum resources. These results showcase the advantageous efficacy of our approach, paving the way for the application of quantum neural networks to relevant real-world machine learning problems.

In this paper, we study a class of special quantum channels named the mixed-permutation channels. The properties of these channels are characterized. The mixed-permutation channels can be applied to give a lower bound of quantum coherence with respect to any coherence measure. In particular, the analytical lower bounds for l(1)-norm coherence and the relative entropy of coherence are shown, respectively. The extension to bipartite systems is presented for the actions of the mixed-permutation channels.

This result can be applied to finite-dimensional spin-glass systems, where the ground state search problem is known to be hard to solve. Consequently, it is strongly suggested that the quantum first-order transition in transverse magnetization is not fatal to the difficulty of combinatorial optimization problems in quantum annealing.

TI Inverse design of high-dimensional quantum optical circuits in a complex
   medium
SO NATURE PHYSICS
AB Programmable optical circuits are an important tool in developing quantum technologies such as transceivers for quantum communication and integrated photonic chips for quantum information processing. Maintaining precise control over every individual component becomes challenging at large scales, leading to a reduction in the quality of operations performed. In parallel, minor imperfections in circuit fabrication are amplified in this regime, dramatically inhibiting their performance. Here we use inverse design techniques to embed optical circuits in the higher-dimensional space of a large, ambient mode mixer such as a commercial multimode fibre. This approach allows us to forgo control over each individual circuit element, and retain a high degree of programmability. We use our circuits as quantum gates to manipulate high-dimensional spatial-mode entanglement in up to seven dimensions. Their programmability allows us to turn a multimode fibre into a generalized multioutcome measurement device, allowing us to both transport and certify entanglement within the transmission channel. With the support of numerical simulations, we show that our method is a scalable approach to obtaining high circuit fidelity with a low circuit depth by harnessing the resource of a high-dimensional mode mixer.
   Light passing through complex media is subject to scattering processes that mix together different photonic modes. This complexity can be harnessed to implement quantum operations.

TI Robust and efficient verification of graph states in blind
   measurement-based quantum computation
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Blind quantum computation (BQC) is a secure quantum computation method that protects the privacy of clients. Measurement-based quantum computation (MBQC) is a promising approach for realizing BQC. To obtain reliable results in blind MBQC, it is crucial to verify whether the resource graph states are accurately prepared in the adversarial scenario. However, previous verification protocols for this task are too resource-consuming or noise-susceptible to be applied in practice. Here, we propose a robust and efficient protocol for verifying arbitrary graph states with any prime local dimension in the adversarial scenario, which leads to a robust and efficient protocol for verifying the resource state in blind MBQC. Our protocol requires only local Pauli measurements and is thus easy to realize with current technologies. Nevertheless, it can achieve optimal scaling behaviors with respect to the system size and the target precision as quantified by the infidelity and significance level, which has never been achieved before. Notably, our protocol can exponentially enhance the scaling behavior with the significance level.

TI Addressing local realism through Bell tests at colliders
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
AB One of the most notable aspects of quantum systems is that their components can exhibit correlations much stronger than those allowed by classical physics. Two examples of quantum correlations are quantum entanglement and Bell nonlocality, but generally there is a hierarchy of many types of quantum correlations. Among these correlations, Bell nonlocality holds a special place because it plays a dual role in distinguishing theories where local realism is a valid description. A Bell test, which is a test of local realism, typically needs to be augmented with assumptions to address possible loopholes in the experimental setup. In this work, we study Bell tests in experiments in which the detector reports the correct outcome with a specified probability. This mirrors the situation at high-energy colliders, where particle spins are not measured directly but inferred from the angular distributions of their decay products. We show that, in this setup, a test of local realism is not possible. Quantum correlations, however, are still present, measurable, and informative in high-energy colliders. These correlations are the building blocks of the interesting, developing quantum information science program at high-energy colliders. The measurements of entanglement by the ATLAS and CMS experiments are the first steps in this initiative.

TI Low temperature decoherence dynamics in molecular spin systems using the
   Lindblad master equation
SO CHEMICAL SCIENCE
AB Understanding the spin dynamics in low-temperature settings is crucial to designing and optimizing molecular spin systems for use in emerging quantum technologies. At low temperatures, irreversible loss occurs due to ensemble dynamics facilitated by electronic-nuclear spin interactions. We develop a combined open quantum systems and electronic structure theory capable of predicting trends in relaxation rates in molecular spin ensembles. We use the Gorini-Kossakowski-Sudarshan-Lindblad master equation and explicitly include electronic structure information in the decoherence channels. We apply this theory to several molecular systems pertinent to contemporary quantum technologies. Our theory provides a framework to describe irreversible relaxation effects in molecular spin systems with applications in quantum information science, quantum sensing, molecular spintronics, and other spin systems dominated by spin-spin relaxation.

TI High-Threshold Codes for Neutral-Atom Qubits with Biased Erasure Errors
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW X
AB The requirements for fault-tolerant quantum error correction can be simplified by leveraging structure in the noise of the underlying hardware. In this work, we identify a new type of structured noise motivated by neutral-atom qubits, biased erasure errors, which arises when qubit errors are dominated by detectable leakage from only one of the computational states of the qubit. We study the performance of this model using gate-level simulations of the XZZX surface code. Using the predicted erasure fraction and bias of metastable 171Yb qubits, we find a threshold of 8.2% for two-qubit gate errors, which is 1.9 times higher than the threshold for unbiased erasures and 7.5 times higher than the threshold for depolarizing errors. Surprisingly, the improved threshold is achieved without bias-preserving controlled-NOT gates and, instead, results from the lower noise entropy in this model. We also introduce an XZZX cluster state construction for measurement-based error correction, hybrid fusion, that is optimized for this noise model. By combining fusion operations and deterministic entangling gates, this construction preserves the intrinsic symmetry of the XZZX code, leading to a higher threshold of 10.3% and enabling the use of rectangular codes with fewer qubits. We discuss a potential physical implementation using a single plane of atoms and movable tweezers.

TI Quantum reservoir computing on random regular graphs
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Quantum reservoir computing (QRC) is a low-complexity learning paradigm that combines the inherent dynamics of input-driven many-body quantum systems with classical learning techniques for nonlinear temporal data processing. Optimizing the QRC process and computing device is a complex task due to the dependence of many-body quantum systems on various factors. To explore this, we introduce a strongly interacting spin model on random regular graphs as the quantum component and investigate the interplay between static disorder, interactions, and graph connectivity, revealing their critical impact on quantum memory capacity and learnability accuracy. We tackle linear quantum and nonlinear classical tasks, and identify optimal learning and memory regimes through studying information localization, dynamical quantum correlations, and the many-body structure of the disordered Hamiltonian. In particular, we uncover the role of previously overlooked network connectivity and demonstrate how the presence of quantum correlations can significantly enhance the learning performance. Our findings thus provide guidelines for the optimal design of disordered analog quantum learning platforms.

TI Two-parameter counter-diabatic driving in quantum annealing
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB We introduce a two-parameter approximate counter-diabatic term into the Hamiltonian of the transverse-field Ising model for quantum annealing to accelerate convergence to the solution, generalizing an existing single-parameter approach. The protocol is equivalent to unconventional diabatic control of the longitudinal and transverse fields in the transverse-field Ising model and thus makes it more feasible for experimental realization than an introduction of new terms such as nonstoquastic catalysts toward the same goal of performance enhancement. We test the idea for the p-spin model with p = 3, which has a first-order quantum phase transition, and show that our two-parameter approach leads to significantly larger ground-state fidelity and lower residual energy than those by traditional quantum annealing and by the single-parameter method. We also find a scaling advantage in terms of the time-to-solution as a function of the system size in a certain range of parameters as compared to the traditional methods in the sense that an exponential time complexity is reduced to another exponential complexity with a smaller coefficient. Although the present method may not always lead to a drastic exponential speedup in difficult optimization problems, it is useful because of its versatility and applicability for any problem after a simple algebraic manipulation, in contrast to some other powerful prescriptions for acceleration such as nonstoquastic catalysts in which one should carefully study in advance if it works in a given problem and should identify a proper way to meticulously control the system parameters to achieve the goal, which is generally highly nontrivial.

TI DPCrypto: Acceleration of Post-Quantum Cryptography Using Dot-Product
   Instructions on GPUs
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON CIRCUITS AND SYSTEMS I-REGULAR PAPERS
AB Modern NVIDIA GPU architectures offer dot-product instructions (DP2A and DP4A), with the aim of accelerating machine learning and scientific computing applications. These dot-product instructions allow the computation of multiply-and-add instructions in a single clock cycle, effectively achieving higher throughput compared to conventional 32-bit integer units. In this paper, we show that the dot-product instruction can also be used to accelerate matrix-multiplication and polynomial convolution operations, which are widely used in post-quantum lattice-based cryptographic schemes. In particular, we propose a highly optimized implementation of FrodoKEM wherein the matrix-multiplication is accelerated by the dot-product instruction. We also present specially designed data structures that allow an efficient implementation of Saber key-encapsulation mechanism, utilizing the dot-product instruction to speed-up the polynomial convolution. The proposed FrodoKEM implementation achieves 4.37x higher throughput than the state-of-the-art implementation on a V100 GPU. This paper also presents the first implementation of Saber on GPU platforms, achieving 124,418, 120,463, and 31,658 key exchanges per second on RTX3080, V100, and T4 GPUs, respectively. Since matrix-multiplication and polynomial convolution operations are the most time-consuming operations in lattice-based cryptographic schemes, we strongly believe that the proposed methods can be beneficial to other KEM and signatures schemes based on lattices.

TI Nonadiabatic geometric quantum computation with cat-state qubits via
   invariant-based reverse engineering
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB We propose a protocol to realize nonadiabatic geometric quantum computation of small-amplitude Schrodinger cat qubits via invariant-based reverse engineering. We consider a system with a two-photon driven Kerr nonlinearity, which can generate a pair of dressed even and odd coherent states (i.e., Schrodinger cat states) for fault-tolerant quantum computations. An additional coherent field is applied to linearly drive a cavity mode, to induce oscillations between dressed cat states. By designing this linear drive with invariant-based reverse engineering, we show how to implement nonadiabatic geometric quantum computation with cat qubits. The performance of the protocol is estimated by taking into account the influence of systematic errors, additive white Gaussian noise, 1/f noise, and decoherence including photon loss and dephasing. Numerical results demonstrate that our protocol is robust against these negative factors. Therefore, this protocol may provide a feasible method for nonadiabatic geometric quantum computation in bosonic systems.

TI Benchmarking Bosonic Modes for Quantum Information with Randomized
   Displacements
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Bosonic modes are prevalent in all aspects of quantum information processing. However, existing tools for characterizing the quality, stability, and noise properties of bosonic modes are limited, especially in a driven setting. Here, we propose, demonstrate, and analyze a randomized bosonic benchmarking (RBB) protocol that uses randomized displacements of the bosonic modes in phase space to determine their quality. We investigate the impact of common analytical error models, such as heating and dephasing, on the distribution of outcomes over randomized displacement trajectories in phase space. We show that analyzing the distinctive behavior of the mean and variance of this distribution-describable as a gamma distribution-enables identification of error processes, and quantitative extraction of error rates and correlations using a minimal number of measurements. We experimentally validate the analytical models by injecting engineered noise into the motional mode of a trapped-ion system and performing the RBB protocol, showing good agreement between experiment and theory. Finally, we investigate the intrinsic error properties in our system, identifying the presence of highly correlated dephasing noise as the dominant process.

TI Long-range qubit entanglement via rolled-up zero-index waveguide
SO NANOPHOTONICS
AB Preservation of an entangled state in a quantum system is one of the major goals in quantum technological applications. However, entanglement can be quickly lost into dissipation when the effective interaction among the qubits becomes smaller compared to the noise-injection from the environment. Thus, a medium that can sustain the entanglement of distantly spaced qubits is essential for practical implementations. This work introduces the fabrication of a rolled-up zero-index waveguide which can serve as a unique reservoir for the long-range qubit-qubit entanglement. We also present the numerical evaluation of the concurrence (entanglement measure) via Ansys Lumer-ical FDTD simulations using the parameters determined experimentally. The calculations demonstrate the feasibil-ity and supremacy of the experimental method. We develop and fabricate this novel structure using cost-effective self-rolling techniques. The results of this study redefine the range of light-matter interactions and show the potential of the rolled-up zero-index waveguides for various classical and quantum applications such as quantum communica-tion, quantum information processing, and superradiance.

SO APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS
AB The negatively charged tin-vacancy (SnV-) center in diamond has emerged as a promising platform for quantum computing and quantum networks. To connect SnV- qubits in large networks, in situ tuning and stabilization of their optical transitions are essential to overcome static and dynamic frequency offsets induced by the local environment. Here, we report on the large-range optical frequency tuning of diamond SnV- centers using micro-electro-mechanically mediated strain control in photonic integrated waveguide devices. We realize a tuning range of >40 GHz, covering a major part of the inhomogeneous distribution. In addition, we employ real-time feedback on the strain environment to stabilize the resonance frequency and mitigate spectral wandering. These results provide a path for on-chip scaling of diamond SnV-based quantum networks.

AB An efficient production planning and control is inevitable for the economic operation of a manufacturing system. As an essential part of production planning and control, process scheduling aims to assign processes to the available resources of a manufacturing system under consideration of its objectives. This forms an optimization problem also known as job shop scheduling which can be solved with computer aided techniques. Exact solution methods are only practical up to a certain number of functional units and processes, therefore, approximation methods are used in industry. However, as the problem size increases, the computational solving time increases significantly and the solution quality decreases in equal measure. In order to react to the current effects of global crises, such as disruptions in supply chains, approaches for fast and efficient rescheduling are needed. A dynamic shop job scheduling approach using Quantum Annealing bears the potential to close this research gap. Previous work has shown that Quantum Annealing is able to solve static job shop scheduling problems within seconds while finding good solutions. However, in a flexible environment such as a manufacturing system, the static approach is not suitable for process scheduling. Therefore, a dynamic Quantum Annealing based approach for job shop scheduling with consideration of machine breakdowns and new job arrivals is proposed. The approach monitors a manufacturing system and reacts to changes in the job pool or availabilities in functional units with rescheduling. The method is tested with several use cases involving small and large-scale problems and is compared with a simulated annealing approach. Thereby, the Quantum Annealing based computations show better results regarding solution quality and computing time. Moreover, the dynamic approach bears the potential for industrial application, especially as a supplement to a conventional advanced planning system. (c) 2023 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

SO ENTROPY
AB The ground state, magnetization scenario and the local bipartite quantum entanglement of a mixed spin-1/2 Ising-Heisenberg model in a magnetic field on planar lattices formed by identical corner-sharing bipyramidal plaquettes is examined by combining the exact analytical concept of generalized decoration-iteration mapping transformations with Monte Carlo simulations utilizing the Metropolis algorithm. The ground-state phase diagram of the model involves six different phases, namely, the standard ferrimagnetic phase, fully saturated phase, two unique quantum ferrimagnetic phases, and two macroscopically degenerate quantum ferrimagnetic phases with two chiral degrees of freedom of the Heisenberg triangular clusters. The diversity of ground-state spin arrangement is manifested themselves in seven different magnetization scenarios with one, two or three fractional plateaus whose values are determined by the number of corner-sharing plaquettes. The low-temperature values of the concurrence demonstrate that the bipartite quantum entanglement of the Heisenberg spins in quantum ferrimagnetic phases is field independent, but twice as strong if the Heisenberg spin arrangement is unique as it is two-fold degenerate.

TI Q-deformed rainbows: a universal simulator of free entanglement
   spectra
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB The behavior of correlations across a bipartition is an indispensable tool in diagnosing quantum phases of matter. Here we present a spin chain with position-dependent XX couplings and magnetic fields, that can reproduce arbitrary structure of free fermion correlations across a bipartition. In particular, by choosing appropriately the strength of the magnetic fields we can obtain any single particle energies of the entanglement spectrum with high fidelity. The resulting ground state can be elegantly formulated in terms of q-deformed singlets. To demonstrate the versatility of our method we consider certain examples, such as a system with homogeneous correlations and a system with correlations that follow a prime number decomposition. Hence, our entanglement simulator can be easily employed for the generation of arbitrary entanglement spectra with possible applications in quantum technologies and condensed matter physics.

TI Photon echoes using atomic frequency combs in Pr:YSO - experiment and
   semiclassical theory
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Photon echoes in rare-earth-doped crystals are studied to understand the challenges of making broadband quantum memories using the atomic frequency comb (AFC) protocol in systems with hyperfine structure. The hyperfine structure of Pr3+ poses an obstacle to this goal because frequencies associated with the hyperfine transitions change the simple picture of modulation at an externally imposed frequency. The current work focuses on the intermediate case where the hyperfine spacing is comparable to the comb spacing, a challenging regime that has recently been considered. Operating in this regime may facilitate storing quantum information over a larger spectral range in such systems. In this work, we prepare broadband AFCs using optical combs with tooth spacings ranging from 1 MHz to 16 MHz in fine steps, and measure transmission spectra and photon echoes for each. We predict the spectra and echoes theoretically using the optical combs as input to either a rate equation code or a density matrix code, which calculates the redistribution of populations. We then use the redistributed populations as input to a semiclassical theory using the frequency-dependent dielectric function. The two sets of predictions each give a good, but different account of the photon echoes.(c) 2023 Optica Publishing Group under the terms of the Optica Open Access Publishing Agreement

TI Single-copy entanglement purification: a robust approach for diverse
   noise sources
SO EPJ QUANTUM TECHNOLOGY
AB Effectively managing various types of decoherence is crucial for leveraging entanglement in quantum information processing and quantum computing. In this paper, we propose purification circuits that deterministically produce a maximally entangled state from a single copy of an imperfect entangled pair affected by various noise sources. Unlike conventional methods, our approach eliminates the need for multiple copies of the entangled state, pre-purification operations, and imposes no restrictions on the initial entanglement fidelity of the imperfect pair. Our method utilizes ancilla qubits and CNOT gates to address errors from Pauli X and Z (bit flip and phase flip), as well as combinations of these errors that create general mixed entangled states and amplitude-damped entangled states. Our analysis shows that noisy CNOT gates impact fidelity minimally, with only the final two gates being critical. We validate our approach through mathematical analysis and practical implementation in Qiskit, demonstrating its effectiveness and robustness.

TI Design of an Iterative Model for Incremental Enhancements in Quantum
   Image Processing Using Reinforcement Learning-Based Optimizations
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB In this text we propose a collection of enhanced quantum methods that would drastically enhance the efficiency and accuracy of biomedical image processing. There are four key methodologies that have been proposed in this work: Quantum Support Vector Machines with Enhanced Feature Extraction, Quantum Generative Adversarial Networks for Data Augmentation, Quantum Entanglement and Correlation Analysis for Feature Detection, and Quantum-Enhanced Image Reconstruction for Noisy Data Samples. Q-SVM-EFE is a Quantum Support Vector Machine-based framework that incorporates advanced feature extraction to map classical image data into high-dimensional quantum states, which should capture intricate patterns and therefore be more accurate for classification. This approach scored more than 95 percent in terms of classification accuracy and tenfold increased the speed of training compared to classical SVMs. QGAN-DA generates high-quality synthetic images to alleviate the scarcity of labeled medical data. It trains a generator network through quantum circuits for the generation of new samples and a discriminator network for real image and sample classification, thus ensuring high diversity and quality in synthetic data with SSIM values above 0.90. QECA-FD applies quantum entanglement in the analysis of biomedical image correlations and is therefore very effective in detecting subtle features and anomalies. This resulted in over 95% sensitivity in anomaly detection and increased the speed of the correlation analysis by five times. QIR-ND enables enhanced image reconstruction from sullied or incomplete data through quantum noise reduction and reconstruction techniques. This new approach gave a PSNR greater than 40 dB and an eightfold improvement in reconstruction delays.

In this work we show photon emission from dibenzoterrylene, a widely used organic emitter, in a new host matrix, para-terphenyl. We present a reprecipitation growth method that produces para-terphenyl nanocrystals which are ideal for integration into nanophotonic devices due to their small size. We characterise the optical properties of dibenzoterrylene in nanocrystals at room and cryogenic temperatures, showing bright, narrow emission from a single molecule. Spectral data on the vibrational energies is presented and a further 25 additional molecules are characterised. This emitter-host combination has potential for quantum technology purposes with wavelengths suitable for interfacing with quantum memories.

TI Simulation study on quantum dot formation of double-qubit-Si-MOS device
SO MICROELECTRONICS JOURNAL
AB Silicon quantum dots (QDs) are essential physical carriers of quantum bits (qubits) in quantum computing. However, their extremely small size renders them highly sensitive to both the fabrication process and surrounding environment. Accuracy and stability must be carefully considered. In this study, we propose a double gate QD device model based on silicon metal-oxide-semiconductor (Si-MOS) for the generation of spin qubits. Using a Technology Computer Aided Design (TCAD) simulation, we investigated the impact of device dimensions, including oxide layer thickness, channel length, and spacer length, on the QD structure. Additionally, we examined the effects of the temperature and interface trap concentration on QD formation. An equivalent circuit model was employed to assess the charging energy (Ec) of QDs. Our results demonstrate that by appropriately adjusting these parameters, it is possible to achieve a QD structure with a wide level spacing and small size capable of accommodating as few as four electrons. Furthermore, we calculated an Ec of 33 meV for the QDs.

TI Holographic measurement and quantum teleportation in the SYK thermofield
   double
SO JOURNAL OF HIGH ENERGY PHYSICS
AB According to holography, entanglement is the building block of spacetime; therefore, drastic changes of entanglement will lead to interesting transitions in the dual spacetime. In this paper, we study the effect of projective measurements on the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model's thermofield double state, dual to an eternal black hole in Jackiw-Teitelboim (JT) gravity. We calculate the (Renyi-2) mutual information between the two copies of the SYK model upon projective measurement of a subset of fermions in one copy. We propose a dual JT gravity model that can account for the change of entanglement due to measurement, and observe an entanglement wedge phase transition in the von Neumann entropy. The entanglement wedge for the unmeasured side changes from the region outside the horizon to include the entire time reversal invariant slice of the two-sided geometry as the number of measured Majorana fermions increases. Therefore, after the transition, the bulk information stored in the measured subsystem is not entirely lost upon projection in one copy of the SYK model, but rather teleported to the other copy. We further propose a decoding protocol to elucidate the teleportation interpretation, and connect our analysis to the physics of traversable wormholes.

TI Low-Latency Parallel Row-Layered Min-Sum Decoders with Scheduling
   Optimization for MDPC Code-Based Post-Quantum Cryptography
SO JOURNAL OF SIGNAL PROCESSING SYSTEMS FOR SIGNAL IMAGE AND VIDEO
   TECHNOLOGY
AB The medium-density parity-check (MDPC) code-based cryptosystem remains a finalist of the post-quantum cryptography standard. The row-layered Min-Sum decoding achieves an efficient trade-off between performance and complexity. Parallel row-layered MDPC decoders are designed in previous studies by enforcing constraints on the parity-check matrix. The preliminary work introduces two schemes to reduce the latency without increasing the constraints on the parity-check matrix, which may bring security concerns. The first scheme simultaneously processes multiple identity blocks in the parity-check matrix, and the second processes a larger block of variable width each time. However, their speedup is limited by data access conflicts. In this paper, optimizations are proposed for the computation scheduling of each scheme to further reduce the latency. Out-of-order processing of identity blocks is proposed for the first scheme to reduce memory access conflicts, enabling more simultaneous processing of multiple blocks. For the second scheme, out-of-order processing of block segments is explored to update more messages simultaneously without causing conflicts in layered decoding. Efficient hardware architectures have also been designed for both of the proposed scheduling optimizations. For an example code, the two proposed optimizations achieve 35% and 9%, respectively, speedup over the best prior designs with negligible area overhead. The out-of-order processing is more effective on the first design.

TI Quantum Entanglement Filtering: A PET Feasibility Study in Imaging
   Dual-Positron and Prompt Gamma Emission via Monte Carlo Simulation
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON RADIATION AND PLASMA MEDICAL SCIENCES
AB In this article, we investigate quantum entanglement (QE) filtering to address the challenges in multi-isotope positron emission tomography (PET) or in PET studies utilizing radiotracers with dual-positron and prompt gamma emissions. Via GATE simulation, we demonstrate the efficacy of QE filtering using a one-of-a-kind cadmium-zinc-telluride (CZT) PET system-establishing its viability as a multimodal scanner and ability to perform QE filtering. We show the high Compton scattering probability in this CZT-based scanner with 44.2% of gammas undergoing a single scatter prior to absorption. Additionally, the overall system sensitivity as a standard PET scanner (11.29%), QE-PET scanner (6.81%), and Compton camera (10.05%) is quantified. Further, we find a 23% decrease in the double Compton scatter (DCSc) frequency needed for QE filtering for each mm decrease in crystal resolution and an increase in mean absolute error (MAE) of their Delta phi s from 6.8 degrees for 1 mm resolution to 9.5 degrees, 12.2 degrees, and 15.3 degrees for 2, 4, and 8 mm resolution, respectively. These results reinforce the potential of CZT detectors to lead next-generation PET systems by fully leveraging QE information of positron annihilation photons.

TI Solving various NP-hard problems using exponentially fewer qubits on a
   quantum computer
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB NP-hard problems are not believed to be exactly solvable through general polynomial time algorithms. Hybrid quantum-classical algorithms to address such combinatorial problems have been of great interest in the past few years. Such algorithms are heuristic in nature and aim to obtain an approximate solution. Significant improvements in computational time and/or the ability to treat large problems are some of the principal promises of quantum computing in this regard. The hardware, however, is still in its infancy and the current noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) computers are not able to optimize industrially relevant problems. Moreover, the storage of qubits and introduction of entanglement require extreme physical conditions. An issue with quantum optimization algorithms such as the quantum approximate optimization algorithm is that they scale linearly with problem size. In this paper, we build upon a proprietary methodology which scales logarithmically with problem size-opening an avenue for treating optimization problems of unprecedented scale on gate-based quantum computers. To test the performance of the algorithm, we first find a way to apply it to a handful of NP-hard problems: Maximum Cut , Minimum Partition , Maximum Clique , Maximum Weighted Independent Set . Subsequently, these algorithms are tested on a quantum simulator with graph sizes of over a hundred nodes and on a real quantum computer up to graph sizes of 256. To our knowledge, these constitute the largest realistic combinatorial optimization problems ever run on a NISQ device, overcoming previous problem sizes by almost tenfold.

TI Fast generation of Pauli transfer matrices utilizing tensor product
   structure
SO PHYSICA SCRIPTA
AB Analysis of quantum processes, especially in the context of noise, errors, and decoherence is essential for the improvement of quantum devices. An intuitive representation of those processes modeled by quantum channels are Pauli transfer matrices. They display the action of a linear map in the n-qubit Pauli basis in a way, that is more intuitive, since Pauli strings are more tangible objects than the standard basis matrices. We set out to investigate classical algorithms that convert the various representations into Pauli transfer matrices. We propose new algorithms that make explicit use of the tensor product structure of the Pauli basis. They convert a quantum channel in a given representation (Chi or process matrix, Choi matrix, superoperator, or Kraus operators) to the corresponding Pauli transfer matrix. Moreover, the underlying principle can also be used to calculate the Pauli transfer matrix of other linear operations over n-qubit matrices such as left-, right-, and sandwich multiplication as well as forming the (anti-)commutator with a given operator. Finally, we investigate the runtime of these algorithms, derive their asymptotic scaling and demonstrate improved performance using instances with up to seven qubits.

TI Lower bounds for adiabatic quantum algorithms by quantum speed limits
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB We introduce a simple framework for estimating lower bounds on the runtime of a broad class of adiabatic quantum algorithms. The central formula consists of calculating the variance of the final Hamiltonian with respect to the initial state. After examining adiabatic versions of certain keystone circuit-based quantum algorithms, this technique is applied to adiabatic quantum algorithms with undetermined speedup. In particular, we analytically obtain lower bounds on adiabatic algorithms for finding k-clique in random graphs. Additionally, for a particular class of Hamiltonian, it is straightforward to prove the equivalence between our framework and the conventional approach based on spectral gap analysis.

AB Simulating the real-time dynamics of gauge theories represents a paradigmatic use case to test the hardware capabilities of a quantum computer, since it can involve non-trivial input states' preparation, discretized time evolution, long-distance entanglement, and measurement in a noisy environment. We implemented an algorithm to simulate the real-time dynamics of a few-qubit system that approximates the Schwinger model in the framework of lattice gauge theories, with specific attention to the occurrence of a dynamical quantum phase transition. Limitations in the simulation capabilities on IBM Quantum were imposed by noise affecting the application of single-qubit and two-qubit gates, which combine in the decomposition of Trotter evolution. The experimental results collected in quantum algorithm runs on IBM Quantum were compared with noise models to characterize the performance in the absence of error mitigation.

TI Hybrid quantum tensor networks for aeroelastic applications

AB We investigate the application of hybrid quantum tensor networks to aeroelastic problems, harnessing the power of Quantum Machine Learning (QML). By combining tensor networks with variational quantum circuits, we demonstrate the potential of QML to tackle complex time series classification and regression tasks. Our results showcase the ability of hybrid quantum tensor networks to achieve high accuracy in binary classification. Furthermore, we observe promising performance in regressing discrete variables. While hyperparameter selection remains a challenge, requiring careful optimisation to unlock the full potential of these models, this work contributes significantly to the development of QML for solving intricate problems in aeroelasticity. We present an end-to-end trainable hybrid algorithm. We first encode time series into tensor networks to then utilise trainable tensor networks for dimensionality reduction, and convert the resulting tensor to a quantum circuit in the encoding step. Then, a tensor network inspired trainable variational quantum circuit is applied to solve either a classification or a multivariate or univariate regression task in the aeroelasticity domain.

TI Continuous-variable quantum key distribution with extended Kalman filter
   assisted by recurrent neural networks for phase estimation
SO OPTICA APPLICATA
AB Continuous-variable quantum key distribution (CV-QKD) holds promise for enhancing security in communication networks. However, obtaining a higher secure key rate poses challenges, particularly in reliable phase estimation. So, it is very necessary for CV-QKD implementations with independent local oscillator (LO) to employ carrier recovery along with precise phase estimation. Our methodology combines extended Kalman filters (EKF) with recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to enhance the accuracy of phase recovery for locally generated LO signals. Using numerical simulations, we evaluate the achievable secret key rates for different transmission distances and line widths. The proposed method achieves a phase error of approximately 1x 10-4, leading to positive secure key rates for distances up to 40 km. This method of phase tracking solves the problem and is effective in real-time deployment of CV-QKD in communication networks.

TI Fluorescent Nanodiamonds for Quantum Sensing in Biology
SO WILEY INTERDISCIPLINARY REVIEWS-NANOMEDICINE AND NANOBIOTECHNOLOGY
AB Fluorescent nanodiamonds exhibiting outstanding optical and biocompatible properties are the subject of increased studies and attention in physics and biology. The nitrogen-vacancy center in diamonds with unique quantum properties at room temperature is sensitive to physical properties such as magnetic field, electric field, temperature, and pressure. By taking advantage of the NV center and high sensitivity that arises from the intrinsic quantum properties of spins in nanodiamonds, which are extensively employed in quantum sensing, bio-imaging, and bio-sensing. In this review, the selected topic mainly focuses on the surface functionalization of nanodiamonds and the recent progress in applying nanodiamonds as quantum sensors for intracellular orientation tracking, temperature sensing, and notably nuclear magnetic resonance and electron spin resonance applications.

TI Full daylight quantum-key-distribution at 1550 nm enabled by integrated
   silicon photonics
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB The future envisaged global-scale quantum-communication network will comprise various nodes interconnected via optical fibers or free-space channels, depending on the link distance. The free-space segment of such a network should guarantee certain key requirements, such as daytime operation and the compatibility with the complementary telecom-based fiber infrastructure. In addition, space-to-ground links will require the capability of designing light and compact quantum devices to be placed in orbit. For these reasons, investigating available solutions matching all the above requirements is still necessary. Here we present a full prototype for daylight quantum key distribution at 1550 nm exploiting an integrated silicon-photonics chip as state encoder. We tested our prototype in the urban area of Padua (Italy) over a 145 m-long free-space link, obtaining a quantum bit error rate around 0.5% and an averaged secret key rate of 30 kbps during a whole sunny day (from 11:00 to 20:00). The developed chip represents a cost-effective solution for portable free-space transmitters and a promising resource to design quantum optical payloads for future satellite missions.

AB Leveraging quantum annealing (QA) for the activity detection problem in massive wireless networks is a promising approach to address the stringent reliability and latency constraints of typical application scenarios. However, the practical implementation of QA on current D-Wave's processors requires embedding the problem. This increases the number of qubits needed for a given network size, which degrades QA performance. In this work, we propose to add a preprocessing step called the threshold method to mitigate the undesired effects of embedding. Our results show that, within limited computational time, this threshold method improves QA's accuracy in solving the activity detection problem. Thus, this is promising to effectively reduce the negative impact of embedding.

TI Solving Optimal Electric Vehicle Charging Station Placement Problem
   Using Digital Quantum Annealing
SO JOURNAL OF COMMUNICATIONS AND NETWORKS
AB is imperative to reduce carbon dioxide emissions and fossil fuel consumption to ensure the Earth's sustainable future and mitigate negative impacts like extreme climate changes caused by greenhouse gases. Electric vehicles (EVs) play a pivotal role in this context, where the convenience of charging stations is crucial in influencing consumer choices. This paper formulates the placement of charging stations as an optimization problem, considering factors like station density, accessibility, coverage, and regional cost variations, to minimize total construction costs. The problem is mapped onto a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) model. The QUBO can efficiently represent and solve complex combinatorial optimization problems, making it suitable for quantum and advanced classical algorithms. Utilizing digital quantum annealing, the optimal or near-optimal solutions are efficiently identified. The performance of the proposed approach is compared with classical algorithms, including mixed linear programming and simulated annealing, demonstrating significant advancements of digital annealing.

TI Advantage distillation for quantum key distribution
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Quantum key distribution promises information-theoretically secure communication, with data post-processing playing a vital role in extracting secure keys from raw data. While hardware advancements have significantly improved practical implementations, optimizing post-processing techniques offers a cost-effective avenue to enhance performance. Advantage distillation, which extends beyond standard information reconciliation and privacy amplification, has proven instrumental in various post-processing methods. However, the optimal post-processing remains an open question. Therefore, it is important to develop a comprehensive framework to encapsulate and enhance these existing methods. In this work, we propose an advantage distillation framework for quantum key distribution, generalizing and unifying existing key distillation protocols. Inspired by entanglement distillation, our framework not only integrates current techniques but also improves upon them. Notably, by employing classical linear codes, we achieve higher key rates, particularly in scenarios where one-time pad encryption is not used for post-processing. Our approach provides insights into existing protocols and offers a systematic way for further enhancements in quantum key distribution.

TI Distribution of Gaussian entanglement in linear-optical systems
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Entanglement is an essential ingredient for building a quantum network that can have many applications. Understanding how entanglement is distributed in a network is a crucial step to move forward. Here we study the conservation and distribution of Gaussian entanglement in a linear network using a new quantifier for bipartite entanglement. We show that the entanglement can be distributed through a beam splitter in the same way as the transmittance and reflectance. The requirements on the entangled states and the type of networks to satisfy this relation are presented explicitly. Our results provide a useful quantification for quantum entanglement and further insights into the structure of entanglement in a network.

TI Learning the Expressibility of Quantum Circuit Ansatz Using Transformer
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB With the exponentially faster computation for certain problems, quantum computing has garnered significant attention in recent years. Variational quantum algorithms are crucial methods to implement quantum computing, and an appropriate task-specific quantum circuit ansatz can effectively enhance the quantum advantage of VQAs. However, the vast search space makes it challenging to find the optimal task-specific ansatz. Expressibility, quantifying the diversity of quantum circuit ansatz states to explore the Hilbert space effectively, can be used to evaluate whether one ansatz is superior to another. In this work, using a transformer model to predict the expressibility of quantum circuit ansatze is proposed. A dataset containing random PQCs generated by the gatewise pipeline, with varying numbers of qubits and gates is constructed. The expressibility of the circuits is calculated using three measures: KL divergence, relative KL divergence, and maximum mean discrepancy. A transformer model is trained on the dataset to capture the intricate relationships between circuit characteristics and expressibility. Four evaluation metrics are employed to assess the performance of the transformer. Numerical results demonstrate that the trained model achieves high performance and robustness across various expressibility measures. This research can enhance the understanding of the expressibility of quantum circuit ansatze and advance quantum architecture search algorithms.

The rapid development of quantum computing technologies offers a promising perspective to efficiently tackle this challenge. In this work, we focus on peptide design and present a multiscale framework that combines classical and quantum computing to optimize amino acid sequences and predict binding poses at atomic resolution. We illustrate our scheme by designing binders for several protein targets, and we contrast the performance of the D-Wave quantum annealer with that of an industry-grade classical optimizer. To assess our results, we compare the designed sequences and the corresponding poses with those available in a data set of experimentally characterized peptide binders.

TI Variational thermal quantum simulation of the lattice Schwinger model
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
AB Confinement of quarks due to the strong interaction and the deconfinement at high temperatures and high densities are a basic paradigm for understanding the nuclear matter. Their simulation, however, is very challenging for classical computers due to the sign problem of solving equilibrium states of finite -temperature quantum chromodynamical systems at finite density. In this paper, we propose a variational approach, using the lattice Schwinger model, to simulate the confinement or deconfinement by investigating the string tension. We adopt an ansatz that the string tension can be evaluated without referring to quantum protocols for measuring the entropy in the free energy. Results of numeral simulation show that the string tension decreases both along the increasing of the temperature and the chemical potential, which can be an analog of the phase diagram of QCD. Through numerical simulations on the classical computer, we demonstrate the potential of exploiting near-term quantum computers for investigating the phase diagram of finite-temperature and finite-density nuclear matters.

AB Quantum computing holds transformative potential for various domains including cheminformatics through advancements in quantum algorithms. The key to realizing improvements with quantum algorithms in cheminformatics is encoding chemical data like proteins as quantum states with quantum state preparation. In this work, we propose a computational framework to encode proteins as quantum states for efficient downstream quantum processing. Protein data representations are encoded as multi-qubit quantum states with iterative quantum sparse state preparation guided by the classical heuristic search method for optimal gate sequence identification. The validity and efficiency of the proposed method is demonstrated with various computational experiments to encode uniform random states as well as proteins. Several performance comparisons against the baselines of exact and variational state preparation methods, the proposed approach is able to encode proteins with 25% fewer controlled-NOT gates while performing orders of magnitude faster than the variational method.

TI Noisy probabilistic error cancellation and generalized physical
   implementability
SO COMMUNICATIONS PHYSICS
AB Decoherence severely limits the performance of quantum processors, posing challenges to reliable quantum computation. Probabilistic error cancellation, a quantum error mitigation method, counteracts noise by quasiprobabilistically simulating (non-physical) inverse noise operations. However, existing formulations of physical implementability, quantifying the minimal cost of simulating non-physical operations using physical channels, do not fully account for the experimental constraints, since noise also affects the cancellation process, and not all physical channels are experimentally accessible. Here, we generalize the physical implementability to encompass arbitrary convex sets of experimentally available quantum states and operations. Within this generalized framework, we demonstrate noiseless error cancellation with noisy Pauli operations and analyze the bias of noisy cancellation. Furthermore, we establish connections between generalized physical implementability and quantum information measures, e.g. diamond norm, logarithmic negativity, and purity. These findings enhance the practical applicability of probabilistic error cancellation and open new avenues for robust quantum information processing and quantum computing.

TI Energy-Efficient Reconfigurable Acceleration Engine for Polynomial
   Coefficient Generation of Lattice-Based Post-Quantum Cryptography
SO ELECTRONICS
AB Aiming at the problem of energy-efficient design of polynomial coefficient generation algorithms and reconfigurable units in lattice-based post-quantum cryptography, this paper investigates and implements an efficient coefficient generation acceleration engine for multiple algorithms. In this paper, we investigate discrete Gaussian sampling-based and hash function-based coefficient generation schemes separately. For the schemes based on discrete Gaussian sampling, we propose a reconfigurable discrete Gaussian sampling algorithm utilizing a fusion tree structure, which offers greater flexibility in the random number compression through data extraction, and separates the initial sampling from the correction process, thereby achieving high energy efficiency in a parallel architecture. For those based on hash functions, we propose an energy-efficient parallel algorithm for the generation of reconfigurable coefficients, which could be adapted to a variety of uniform, reject, binomial, and ternary sampling schemes. This algorithm makes effective use of the common arithmetic process for all types of sampling schemes and introduces a data allocation process to improve the efficiency of smaller parameter operations, which provides the basis for an energy-efficient design of the hardware architecture. Building upon these two algorithms, we propose a reconfigurable lattice-based post-quantum cryptographic coefficient generation acceleration engine by investigating the algorithm's core arithmetic parallelism with the goal of resource efficiency. Experimental results showed that under the 40 nm CMOS process, it takes only 256.2 ns on average to complete the uniform-reject sampling with 256 points rejection value less than 216, and 214.2 ns on average to complete the binomial sampling with 256 points rejection value less than 8 bits. The maximum operating frequency reached 714 MHz, with an average power consumption of approximately 57.37 mW. Compared to existing studies, the proposed sampler reduced power consumption by about 13% for binomial sampling and about 21% for discrete Gaussian sampling.

TI Quantum semi-supervised kernel learning
SO QUANTUM MACHINE INTELLIGENCE
AB Quantum machine learning methods have the potential to facilitate learning using extremely large datasets. While the availability of data for training machine learning models is steadily increasing, oftentimes it is much easier to collect feature vectors to obtain the corresponding labels. One of the approaches for addressing this issue is to use semi-supervised learning, which leverages not only the labeled samples, but also unlabeled feature vectors. Here, we present a quantum machine learning algorithm for training semi-supervised kernel support vector machines. The algorithm uses recent advances in quantum sample-based Hamiltonian simulation to extend the existing quantum LS-SVM algorithm to handle the semi-supervised term in the loss. Through a theoretical study of the algorithm's computational complexity, we show that it maintains the same speedup as the fully-supervised quantum LS-SVM.

TI Modulated longitudinal gates on encoded spin qubits via curvature
   couplings to a superconducting cavity
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB We propose entangling operations based on the energy curvature couplings of encoded spin qubits to a superconducting cavity, exploring the nonlinear qubit response to a gate voltage variation. For a two-qubit (n-qubit) entangling gate we explore acquired geometric phases via a time-modulated longitudinal sigma(z) coupling, offering gate times of tens of nanoseconds even when the qubits and the cavity are far detuned. No dipole moment is necessary: the qubit transverse a, coupling to the resonator is zero at the full sweet spot of the encoded spin qubit of interest (a triple quantum dot three-electron exchange-only qubit or a double quantum dot singlet-triplet qubit). This approach allows always-on, exchange-only qubits, for example, to stay on their "sweet spots" during gate operations, minimizing the charge noise and eliminating an always-on static longitudinal qubit-qubit coupling. We calculate the main gate errors due to the (1) diffusion (Johnson) noise and (2) damping of the resonator, the (3) 1/f-charge noise qubit gate dephasing and 1/f noise on the longitudinal coupling, (4) qubit dephasing and AC-Stark frequency shifts via photon fluctuations in the resonator, and (5) spin-dependent resonator frequency shifts (via a "dispersivelike" static curvature coupling), most of them associated with the nonzero qubit energy curvature (quantum capacitance). Using spin-echo-like error suppression at optimal regimes, gate infidelities of 10(-2) -10(-3) can be achieved with experimentally existing parameters. The proposed schemes seem suitable for remote spin-to-spin entanglement of two spin qubits or a cluster of spin qubits: an important resource of quantum computing.

TI Computable lower bounds on the entanglement cost of quantum channels
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS A-MATHEMATICAL AND THEORETICAL
AB A class of lower bounds for the entanglement cost of any quantum state was recently introduced in Lami and Regula (2023 ) in the form of entanglement monotones known as the tempered robustness and tempered negativity. Here we extend their definitions to point-to-point quantum channels, establishing a lower bound for the asymptotic entanglement cost of any channel, whether finite or infinite dimensional. This leads, in particular, to a bound that is computable as a semidefinite program and that can outperform previously known lower bounds, including ones based on quantum relative entropy. In the course of our proof we establish a useful link between the robustness of entanglement of quantum states and quantum channels, which requires several technical developments such as showing the lower semicontinuity of the robustness of entanglement of a channel in the weak*-operator topology on bounded linear maps between spaces of trace class operators.

TI Quantum Computing: The Future of Big Data and Artificial Intelligence in
   Spine
SO SPINE SURGERY AND RELATED RESEARCH
AB With the emergence of big data and more personalized approaches to spine care and predictive modeling, data science and deep analytics are taking center-stage. Although current techniques in machine learning and artificial intelligence have gained attention, their applications remain limited by their reliance on traditional analytic platforms. Quantum computing has the ability to circumvent such constraints by attending to the various complexities of big data while minimizing space and time dimensions within computational algorithms. In doing so, quantum computing may one day address research and clinical objectives that currently cannot be tackled. Understanding quantum computing and its potential to improve patient management and outcomes is therefore imperative to drive further advancements in the spine field for the next several decades.

AB What else than Hybrid Quantum Computing will dominate data centers, just within a decade? But until now, it is unclear how precisely such high-performance computers will be constructed, even the fundamental functionality is in question. Thus, it is very hard to prepare today, from a programmer perspective, in-depth for the anticipated near-term programming paradigm shift due to quantum computers. Furthermore, the industry is reluctant to invest heavily into quantum software development right now, since under this uncertainty regarding the future development of hardware and Cloud services, no one would like to see all these efforts to be ruined by a novel technology, an unforeseen new machine, which Would eradicate the software in place, which the industry had developed so costly. This calls for a more generic view on Hybrid Quantum Computing, on one hand hardware agnostic, but still anticipating the fundamental laws of nature which rule ally future quantum computing system, regardless of its engineered excellence. This generalization can be done with the introduction of a Virtual Quantum Processor, a piece of imaginary hardware, which is described detailed enough, to emulate a generic hybrid quantum machine based on a set of instructions within a Turing machine. If this could be accomplished, we would retrieve a Uniform Computing Model fin Hybrid Quantum Software, which can be applied later to any physical representation of quantum computing hardware, but would run already today on our current machines.

TI Transverse quantum decoherence of a fast particle in a gas
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB The decoherence of a fast quantum particle in a gas is studied by applying the Kramers-Moyal expansion to the quantum master equation for the reduced density matrix of the particle. This expansion leads to a general form of the Caldeira-Leggett master equation accounting for the angular variation of the differential cross section. The equation describes the decoherence in both the longitudinal and transverse directions with respect to the particle motion. It is shown that, when the differential cross section is concentrated in the forward direction, transverse decoherence dominates. The coherence region off the diagonal of the density matrix is characterized by coherence lengths, which can be deduced, for Gaussian states, from the momentum covariance matrix according to a Heisenberg-type uncertainty relation. Finally, the longitudinal-to-transverse ratio of the coherence lengths is estimated for an alpha particle of a few MeVs. This ratio indicates that the coherence region looks like an ellipsoid elongated in the direction of motion.

TI An Area-Time Efficient Hardware Architecture for ML-KEM Post-Quantum
   Cryptography Standard
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB To facilitate the integration of the NIST-standardized post-quantum cryptographic (PQC) algorithm, Module Lattice-based Key Encapsulation Mechanism (ML-KEM), into quantum-resistant devices and cryptosystems, this study introduces an area-time efficient hardware implementation. We propose several key optimizations: a dedicated SHA3 design merging hashing and sampling to eliminate hash output storage, a high-performance polynomial arithmetic unit with a novel reuse technique that reduces twiddle factor storage by threefold, and a partitioned storage strategy to minimize memory footprint. By tightly coupling pipelining and parallelism, we further enhance execution speed and avoid memory access bottlenecks. Our FPGA-based ML-KEM implementation achieves a superior area-time product (ATP), outperforming stateof-the-art results by up to 6.7x across NIST security levels 1, 3, and 5. A 180 nm CMOS fabrication of our design yields a die area of 1,940 x 1.789 mu m2. Measured performance shows the lowest SRAM requirement (7.37 kB) and minimal energy consumption (6.4 mu J, 10.3 mu J, and 14.4 mu J for security levels 1, 3, and 5), leading to ATP improvements ranging from 1.5x to 115.0x compared to existing ASIC solutions.

TI Quantum Sensing of Local Magnetic Phase Transitions and Fluctuations
   near the Curie Temperature in Tm3Fe5O12
   Using NV Centers
SO MICROMACHINES
AB Thulium iron garnet (Tm3Fe5O12, TmIG) is a promising material for next-generation spintronic and quantum technologies owing to its high Curie temperature and strong perpendicular magnetic anisotropy. However, conventional magnetometry techniques are limited by insufficient spatial resolution and sensitivity to probe local magnetic phase transitions and critical spin dynamics in thin films. In this study, we present the first quantitative investigation of local magnetic field fluctuations near the Curie temperature in TmIG thin films using nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center-based quantum sensing. By integrating optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) and NV spin relaxometry (T1 measurements) with macroscopic techniques such as SQUID magnetometry and Hall effect measurements, we systematically characterize both the static magnetization and dynamic spin fluctuations across the magnetic phase transition. Our results reveal a pronounced enhancement in NV spin relaxation rates near 360 K, providing direct evidence of critical spin fluctuations at the nanoscale. This work highlights the unique advantages of NV quantum sensors for investigating dynamic critical phenomena in complex magnetic systems and establishes a versatile, multimodal framework for studying local phase transition kinetics in high-temperature magnetic insulators.

Our work shows that it is possible to use both multi-photon states of light together with high spatial mode numbers, opening avenues in quantum sensing, communications, and quantum computing.

SO RESULTS IN PHYSICS
AB We study the coherence and quantum correlations for a system consisting of two interacting qubits under the effect of a common environment, where the system of qubits has the dephasing coupling with its surrounding. We study the dynamical behavior of the quantumness measures when the influence of the qubits' interaction on the dephasing is analyzed. We display the effect of the qubit-qubit interaction and qubits-environment interaction on the measures considering the case of symmetry and asymmetry interaction between the qubits and environment. Finally, we explicitly illustrate the relation between the coherence and quantum correlations and show that quantum coherence and correlations can be preserved during the dynamics.

AB Quantum key distribution offers a way to create and distribute secure encryption keys based on the laws of quantum physics, which means that these protocols are secure even in the presence of an adversary with unlimited computing power. These keys can be forwarded over several hops in quantum key distribution networks (QKDN). At the moment, any established solutions to assess the security of these networks don't exist. This paper describes a concept of light tool for security status estimation, which provides a holistic estimation of quantum key distribution network systems' security status, especially concentrating in quantum issues that might not arise when assessing classical networks. Our approach is to make high abstraction level questions concerning the status of specific security issues. Rather than providing detailed questions, we try to reach a holistic view of QKDN security, where the questions will also guide the future security development. We present sets of questions which concern different areas of quantum key distribution network security. With the help of these questions, we offer a high-abstraction level tool for estimating the security of quantum key distribution networks.

TI An integrated strategy based on radiomics and quantum machine learning:
   diagnosis and clinical interpretation of pulmonary ground-glass nodules
SO BMC MEDICAL IMAGING
AB Purpose: Accurate classification of pulmonary pure ground-glass nodules (pGGNs) is essential for distinguishing invasive adenocarcinoma (IVA) from adenocarcinoma in situ (AIS) and minimally invasive adenocarcinoma (MIA), which significantly influences treatment decisions. This study aims to develop a high-precision integrated strategy by combining radiomics-based feature extraction, Quantum Machine Learning (QML) models, and SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) analysis to improve diagnostic accuracy and interpretability in pGGN classification. Methods: A total of 322 pGGNs from 275 patients were retrospectively analyzed. The CT images was randomly divided into training and testing cohorts (80:20), with radiomic features extracted from the training cohort. Three QML models-Quantum Support Vector Classifier (QSVC), Pegasos QSVC, and Quantum Neural Network (QNN)-were developed and compared with a classical Support Vector Machine (SVM). SHAP analysis was applied to interpret the contribution of radiomic features to the models' predictions. Results: All three QML models outperformed the classical SVM, with the QNN model achieving the highest improvements ([Formula: see text]) in classification metrics, including accuracy (89.23%, 95% CI: 81.54% - 95.38%), sensitivity (96.55%, 95% CI: 89.66% - 100.00%), specificity (83.33%, 95% CI: 69.44% - 94.44%), and area under the curve (AUC) (0.937, 95% CI: 0.871 - 0.983), respectively. SHAP analysis identified Low Gray Level Run Emphasis (LGLRE), Gray Level Non-uniformity (GLN), and Size Zone Non-uniformity (SZN) as the most critical features influencing classification. Conclusion: This study demonstrates that the proposed integrated strategy, combining radiomics, QML models, and SHAP analysis, significantly enhances the accuracy and interpretability of pGGN classification, particularly in small-sample datasets. It offers a promising tool for early, non-invasive lung cancer diagnosis and helps clinicians make more informed treatment decisions.

We also propose a new scheme for measuring the frequency of mechanical resonators. This study is of great significance in the fields of precision measurement and quantum information processing.

TI Parity-encoding-based quantum computing with Bayesian error tracking
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Measurement-based quantum computing (MBQC) in linear optical systems is promising for near-future quantum computing architecture. However, the nondeterministic nature of entangling operations and photon losses hinder the large-scale generation of graph states and introduce logical errors. In this work, we propose a linear optical topological MBQC protocol employing multiphoton qubits based on the parity encoding, which turns out to be highly photon-loss tolerant and resource-efficient even under the effects of nonideal entangling operations that unavoidably corrupt nearby qubits. For the realistic error analysis, we introduce a Bayesian methodology, in conjunction with the stabilizer formalism, to track errors caused by such detrimental effects. We additionally suggest a graph-theoretical optimization scheme for the process of constructing an arbitrary graph state, which greatly reduces its resource overhead. Notably, we show that our protocol is advantageous over several other existing approaches in terms of the fault-tolerance and resource overhead.

TI Quantum information metrics of a multi-level atom interacting with an
   SU(1;1) quantum amplifier system
SO EPJ QUANTUM TECHNOLOGY
AB This study investigates the quantum information dynamics of a multi-level atomic system interacting with an SU(1;1) quantum system, focusing on atomic inversion, entropy, coherence, and skew information. The system is specified as a two-level and three-level Lambda-type configuration, incorporating multi-mode SU(1;1) quantum systems and the Stark effect. Numerical simulations are performed to solve the time-dependent density matrix equations under varying shift, intensity, and Stark parameters. Results show that increasing the shift stabilizes inversion but raises statistical uncertainty, while greater field intensity amplifies entropy. The Stark amplitude suppresses decoherence and improves quantum information retention. Negativity is used to quantify entanglement between the first two SU(1;1) modes, showing that stronger Stark shifts stabilize entanglement and coherence. Three-level systems consistently outperform two-level ones in preserving coherence and entanglement due to enhanced interference and spectral separation. Eigenvalue analysis reveals the nonlinear structure of three-level systems, explaining their robustness. These findings are supported by recent experiments in SU(1;1) interferometry and Stark-tuned quantum systems, offering insights for quantum sensing, computation, and communication.

TI Certification of non-Gaussian Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen steering
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Non-Gaussian quantum states are a known necessary resource for reaching a quantum advantage and for violating Bell inequalities in continuous variable systems. As one kind of manifestation of quantum correlations, Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen steering enables verification of shared entanglement even when one of the subsystems is not characterized. However, how to detect and classify such an effect for non-Gaussian states is far from being well understood. Here, we present an efficient non-Gaussian steering criterion based on the high-order observables and conduct a systematic investigation into the hierarchy of non-Gaussian steering criteria. Moreover, we apply our criterion to three experimentally-relevant non-Gaussian states under realistic conditions and, in particular, propose a feasible scheme to create multi-component cat states with tunable size by performing a suitable high-order quadrature measurement on the steering party. Our work reveals the fundamental characteristics of non-Gaussianity and quantum correlations, and offers new insights to explore their applications in quantum information processing.

AB Deterministic photon-photon gates enable the controlled generation of entanglement between mobile carriers of quantum information. Such gates have thus far been exclusively realized in the optical domain and by relying on postselection. Here, we present a nonpostselected, deterministic, photon-photon gate in the microwave frequency range realized using superconducting circuits. We emit photonic qubits from a source chip and route those qubits to a gate chip with which we realize a universal gate set by combining controlled absorption and reemission with single-qubit gates and qubit-photon controlled-phase gates. We measure quantum process fidelities of 75% for single-and of 57% for two-qubit gates, limited mainly by radiation loss and decoherence. This universal gate set has a wide range of potential applications in superconducting quantum networks.

TI Microwave Photon-Number Amplification
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW X
AB We experimentally demonstrate a microwave photon-multiplication scheme which combines the advantages of a single-photon detector and a power meter by multiplying the incoming photon number by an integer factor. Our first experimental implementation achieves an n = 3-fold multiplication with 0.69 efficiency in a 116 MHz bandwidth up to an input photon rate of 400 MHz. It loses phase information but does not require any dead time or time binning. We expect an optimized device cascading such multipliers to achieve number-resolving measurement of itinerant photons with low dark count, which would offer new possibilities in a wide range of quantum-sensing and quantum-computing applications.

   decoherence
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB A logarithmic Schrodinger equation with time-dependent coupling to the nonlinearity is presented as a model of collisional decoherence of the wave function of a quantum particle in position space. The particular mathematical form of the logarithmic Schrodinger equation has been shown to follow from conditional wave theory, but the validity of the logarithmic Schrodinger equation has not yet been investigated numerically for general initial conditions. Using an operator-splitting approach, we solve the nonlinear equation of motion for the wave function numerically and compare it to the solution of the standard Joos-Zeh master equation for the density matrix. We find good agreement for the time-dependent behavior of the ensemble widths between the two approaches, but note curious zero-pinning behavior of the logarithmic Schrodinger equation, whereby the zeros of the wave function are not erased by continued propagation. By examining the derivation of the logarithmic Schrodinger equation from conditional wave theory, we indicate possible avenues of resolution to this zero-pinning problem.

TI Variational optimization of the quantum annealing schedule for the
   Lechner-Hauke-Zoller scheme
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB The annealing schedule is optimized for a parameter in the Lechner-Hauke-Zoller (LHZ) scheme for quantum annealing designed for the all-to-all-interacting Ising model representing generic combinatorial optimization problems. We adapt the variational approach proposed by Matsuura et al. (arXiv:2003.09913) to the annealing schedule of a term representing a constraint for variables intrinsic to the LHZ scheme with the annealing schedule of other terms kept intact. Numerical results for a simple ferromagnetic model and the spin-glass problem show that nonmonotonic annealing schedules optimize the performance measured by the residual energy and the final ground-state fidelity. This improvement does not accompany a notable increase in the instantaneous energy gap, which suggests the importance of a dynamical viewpoint in addition to static analyses in the study of practically relevant diabatic processes in quantum annealing.

TI Simulations of frustrated Ising Hamiltonians using quantum approximate
   optimization
SO PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY A-MATHEMATICAL PHYSICAL
   AND ENGINEERING SCIENCES
AB Novel magnetic materials are important for future technological advances. Theoretical and numerical calculations of ground-state properties are essential in understanding these materials, however, computational complexity limits conventional methods for studying these states. Here we investigate an alternative approach to preparing materials ground states using the quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) on near-term quantum computers. We study classical Ising spin models on unit cells of square, Shastry-Sutherland and triangular lattices, with varying field amplitudes and couplings in the material Hamiltonian. We find relationships between the theoretical QAOA success probability and the structure of the ground state, indicating that only a modest number of measurements (& LSIM;100) are needed to find the ground state of our nine-spin Hamiltonians, even for parameters leading to frustrated magnetism. We further demonstrate the approach in calculations on a trapped-ion quantum computer and succeed in recovering each ground state of the Shastry-Sutherland unit cell with probabilities close to ideal theoretical values. The results demonstrate the viability of QAOA for materials ground state preparation in the frustrated Ising limit, giving important first steps towards larger sizes and more complex Hamiltonians where quantum computational advantage may prove essential in developing a systematic understanding of novel materials.This article is part of the theme issue 'Quantum annealing and computation: challenges and perspectives'.

TI Information-theoretically secure quantum timestamping with one-time
   universal hashing
SO SCIENCE CHINA-PHYSICS MECHANICS & ASTRONOMY
AB Accurate and tamper-resistant timestamps are essential for applications demanding verifiable chronological ordering, such as legal documentation and digital intellectual property protection. Classical timestamp protocols rely on computational assumptions for security, rendering them vulnerable to quantum attacks, which is a critical limitation given the rapid progress in quantum computing. To address this, we propose an information-theoretically secure quantum timestamping protocol based on one-time universal hashing with quantum keys. Our protocol simultaneously achieves information-theoretic security and high efficiency, enabling secure timestamping for arbitrarily long documents. Simulations demonstrate a generation rate exceeding 100 times-tamps per second over intercity distances. In addition, our protocol only requires weak coherent states, making it practical for large-scale deployment. This work advances the field of quantum timestamping and contributes to the broader development of quantum cryptography and the future quantum internet.

TI Quantum Fisher information in moving reference frame
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB In the field of quantum metrology, an important application is quantum parameter estimation. As the fundamental theory of quantum parameter estimation, quantum Cramer-Rao inequality shows that the variance of parameter estimation is determined by the inverse of quantum Fisher information. Higher quantum Fisher information corresponds to a lower variance, thereby improving the precision of parameter estimation. Quantum Fisher information has been extensively investigated in many aspects of non-relativistic quantum mechanics, including entanglement structure detection, quantum teleportation, quantum phase transition, quantum chaos, and quantum computation. However, there are few researches considering the influence of relativistic effect on quantum Fisher information, and therefore, we attempt to investigate this topic in this work. The relativistic transformation of particle states is employed, and the quantum Fisher information about amplitude parameter theta and phase parameter phi are investigated in moving reference frame. In this work, the parameters to be estimated are encoded into the spin degree of freedom, and the pure single-qubit state and the pure two-qubit state are both considered. The quantum Fisher information about theta and phi of single-qubit state and two-qubit state in moving reference frame are numerically calculated, respectively. It can be observed that the quantum Fisher information is associated with rapidity, amplitude parameter, and the ratio of the width to the particle mass sigma(r)/m. The quantum Fisher information of the estimated parameters decreases with rapidity increasing for both single-qubit state and two-qubit state. As rapidity approaches infinity, i.e. increases to the speed of light, the quantum Fisher information reaches to a constant which decreases as the ratio sigma(r)/m increases. More importantly, for the phase parameter phi, it is observed that the quantum Fisher information of two-qubit state reduces more significantly than that of single-qubit state. While, for the amplitude parameter theta, the quantum Fisher information of two-qubit state is greater than that of single-qubit state. These results are useful and valuable for improving the precision of parameter estimation under the influence of relativistic effect.

TI Export Controls as Innovation Marketing? Sociotechnical Imaginaries in
   the Ringfencing of Quantum Technologies
SO LAW TECHNOLOGY AND HUMANS
AB Why are a host of states, such as the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, France and the Netherlands, imposing export controls on quantum computers with technical specifications (e.g. 2000 qubits) that are not yet realisable? No full-fledged 'useful' quantum technology (QT) exists yet; instead, the regulatory object of export controls is the network of technological artefacts (equipment, prototype, proof-of-concepts), people and labs (the 'assemblage' of quantum innovation) endeavouring to make quantum a reality. Thus, export controls serve mainly as a tool of knowledge regulation over critical knowledge and R&D exchanges taking place to realise the quantum ambition. This article contends that it is not the material reality of quantum innovation-which is still mired in major engineering challenges-that informs export control efforts surrounding QT, but rather the 'so ciotechnical imaginary' of quantum that serves as the 'muse' for law-and policy-makers. Quantum imaginaries are pivotal to understanding the rationales of QT export controls and the narratives in which they are entrenched. It is not necessarily the '2000 qubits' in and of themselves, their technical (non-)feasibility or (non-)realisability, but rather the imaginaries told and believed about their technological possibilities and power that are decisive in the ringfencing performed by export controls on QT.

TI High-Q cavity interface for color centers in thin film diamond
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Quantum information technology offers the potential to realize unprecedented computational resources via secure channels distributing entanglement between quantum computers. Diamond, as a host to optically-accessible spin qubits, is a leading platform to realize quantum memory nodes needed to extend such quantum links. Photonic crystal (PhC) cavities enhance light-matter interaction and are essential for an efficient interface between spins and photons that are used to store and communicate quantum information respectively. Here, we demonstrate one- and two-dimensional PhC cavities fabricated in thin-film diamonds, featuring quality factors (Q) of 1.8 x 105 and 1.6 x 105, respectively, the highest Qs for visible PhC cavities realized in any material. Importantly, our fabrication process is simple and high-yield, based on conventional planar fabrication techniques, in contrast to the previous with complex undercut processes. We also demonstrate fiber-coupled 1D PhC cavities with high photon extraction efficiency, and optical coupling between a single SiV center and such a cavity at 4 K achieving a Purcell factor of 18. The demonstrated photonic platform may fundamentally improve the performance and scalability of quantum nodes and expedite the development of related technologies.
   Improving the performance and scalability of quantum nodes is of paramount importance to expedite the development of quantum technologies. Here the authors demonstrate fiber-coupled 1D PhC cavities with high photon extraction efficiency, and optical coupling between a single SiV center and such a cavity.

TI Optimal protocols for entangling gates in N-qubit atomic systems
SO AIP ADVANCES
AB We use a novel optimization procedure that includes the temporal and spatial parameters of the pulses acting on arrays of trapped neutral atoms to prepare entangling gates in N-qubit systems. The spatiotemporal control allows treating a denser array of atoms, where each pulse acts on a subset of the qubits, potentially allowing to speed up the gate operation by two orders of magnitude by boosting the dipole-blockade between the Rydberg states. Studying the rate of success of the algorithm under different constraints, we evaluate the impact of the proximity of the atoms and, indirectly, the role of the geometry of the arrays in three and four-qubit systems, as well as the minimal energy requirements and how this energy is used among the different qubits. Finally, we characterize and classify all optimal protocols according to the mechanism of the gate using a quantum pathway analysis.(c) 2023 Author(s).

   governance
SO SUSTAINABLE FUTURES
AB This research explores the future synergy between quantum computing (QC) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) as a tool to revitalize urban transport systems through optimized improvement techniques as well as decentralized governance. Utilizing a conceptual approach combined with thematic analysis, this research provides an integrative framework that combines insights from quantum computing, blockchain governance, and transport geography. Key results include the observation that the integration of these technologies holds the potential to address enduring issues regarding efficiency, sustainability, and equity within transport through exemplary spatial optimization as well as open, participatory governance strategies. However, significant challenges do remain, including energy consumption, the digital divide, as well as regulative uncertainties, requiring careful design, equity-focused protections, as well as effective governance infrastructure. This paper suggests that the actualization of the full potential of these future technologies requires interdisciplinary collaboration as well as a focus on the public good rather than technological advancement alone.

TI Classical and Quantum Algorithms for Characters of the Symmetric Group
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Characters of irreducible representations are ubiquitous in group theory. However, computing characters of some groups such as the symmetric group Snis a challenging problem known to be #P-hard in the worst case. Here we describe a matrix product state (MPS) algorithm for characters of Sn. The algorithm computes an MPS encoding all irreducible characters of a given permutation. It relies on a mapping from characters of Sn to quantum spin chains proposed by Crichigno and Prakash. We also provide a simpler derivation of this mapping. We complement this result by presenting a poly(n) size quantum circuit that prepares the corresponding MPS obtaining an efficient quantum algorithm for certain sampling problems based on characters of Sn. To assess classical hardness of these problems, we present a general reduction from strong simulation (computing a given probability) to weak simulation (sampling with a small error). This reduction applies to any sampling problem with a certain granularity structure and may be of independent interest.

TI The quantum annealing gap and quench dynamics in the exact cover problem
SO QUANTUM
AB Quenching and annealing are extreme opposites in the time evolution of a quanrium phases of a Hamiltonian with slowly changing parameters and can be exploited as a tool for solving complex optimization problems. In contrast, quenches are sudden changes of the Hamiltonian, producing a non-equilibrium situation. Here, we investigate the relation between the two cases. Specifically, we show that the minimum of the annealing gap, which is an important bottleneck of quantum annealing algorithms, can be revealed from a dynamical quench parameter which describes the dynamical quantum state after the quench. Combined with statistical tools including the training of a neural network, the relation between quench and annealing dynamics can be exploited to reproduce the full functional behavior of the annealing gap from the quench data. We show that the partial or full knowledge about the annealing gap which can be gained in this way can be used to design optimized quantum annealing protocols with a practical time-tosolution benefit. Our results are obtained of the exact cover problem.

TI Noise investigation in a spin-based four-qubit GaAs block of

SO AIP ADVANCES
AB Optically controlled self-assembled quantum dots have received substantial attention in the quantum computing area, as techniques for initializing, manipulating, and reading out single spin qubits have been demonstrated in essence. The electron-spin coherence and hole-spin coherence are limited due to noisy quantum effects, and there is a significant need for further evaluation and investigation studies. In this work, the behavior of charge noise and spin noise for a fundamental logic unit of four qubit embedded in an AlAs/GaAs heterostructure is reported based on the modeling and simulation approach in the atomic level to provide a more in-depth analysis and evaluation of quantum noise. The numerical calculations are based on reliable simulation methods, which are consistent with experimental results. The approach presented here can become the basis for scaled-up advanced simulations expanding to larger logical blocks of qubits.

TI Quantum Circuit-Width Reduction through Parameterisation and
   Specialisation
SO ALGORITHMS
AB As quantum computing technology continues to develop, the need for research into novel quantum algorithms is growing. However, such algorithms cannot yet be reliably tested on actual quantum hardware, which is still limited in several ways, including qubit coherence times, connectivity, and available qubits. To facilitate the development of novel algorithms despite this, simulators on classical computing systems are used to verify the correctness of an algorithm, and study its behaviour under different error models. In general, this involves operating on a memory space that grows exponentially with the number of qubits. In this work, we introduce quantum circuit transformations that allow for the construction of parameterised circuits for quantum algorithms. The parameterised circuits are in an ideal form to be processed by quantum compilation tools, such that the circuit can be partially evaluated prior to simulation, and a smaller specialised circuit can be constructed by eliminating fixed input qubits. We show significant reduction in the number of qubits for various quantum arithmetic circuits. Divide-by-n-bits quantum integer dividers are used as an example demonstration. It is shown that the complexity reduces from 4n+2 to 3n+2 qubits in the specialised versions. For quantum algorithms involving divide-by-8 arithmetic operations, a reduction by 2(8)=256 in required memory is achieved for classical simulation, reducing the memory required from 137 GB to 0.53 GB.

TI Noisy intermediate-scale quantum computing algorithm for solving an
   n-vertex MaxCut problem with log(n) qubits
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Quantum computers are devices, which allow more efficient solutions of problems as compared to their classical counterparts. As the timeline to developing a quantum-error corrected computer is unclear, the quantum computing community has dedicated much attention to developing algorithms for currently available noisy intermediate-scale quantum computers (NISQ). Thus far, within NISQ, optimization problems are one of the most commonly studied and are quite often tackled with the quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA). This algorithm is best known for computing graph partitions with a maximal separation of edges (MaxCut), but can easily calculate other problems related to graphs. Here, I present a novel quantum optimization algorithm, which uses exponentially less qubits as compared to the QAOA while requiring a significantly reduced number of quantum operations to solve the MaxCut problem. Such an improved performance allowed me to partition graphs with 32 nodes on publicly available 5 qubit gate-based quantum computers without any preprocessing such as division of the graph into smaller subgraphs. These results represent a 40% increase in graph size as compared to state-of-art experiments on gate-based quantum computers such as Google Sycamore. The obtained lower bound is 54.9% on the solution for actual hardware benchmarks and 77.6% on ideal simulators of quantum computers. Furthermore, large-scale optimization problems represented by graphs of a 128 nodes are tackled with simulators of quantum computers, again without any predivision into smaller subproblems and a lower solution bound of 67.9% is achieved. The study presented here paves way to using powerful genetic optimizer in synergy with quantum computers.

TI Experimental optimal verification of three-dimensional entanglement on a

SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB High-dimensional entanglement is significant for the fundamental studies of quantum physics and offers unique advantages in various quantum information processing tasks. Integrated quantum devices have recently emerged as a promising platform for creating, processing, and detecting complex high-dimensional entangled states. A crucial step toward practical quantum technologies is to verify that these devices work reliably with an optimal strategy. In this work, we experimentally implement an optimal quantum verification strategy on a three-dimensional maximally entangled state using local projective measurements on a silicon photonic chip. A 95% confidence is achieved from 1190 copies to verify the target quantum state. The obtained scaling of infidelity as a function of the number of copies is -0.5497 +/- 0.0002, exceeding the standard quantum limit of -0.5 with 248 standard deviations. Our results indicate that quantum state verification could serve as an efficient tool for complex quantum measurement tasks.

TI Machine-learning-based device-independent certification of quantum
   networks
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Witnessing nonclassical behavior is a crucial ingredient in quantum information processing. For that, one has to optimize the quantum features a given physical setup can give rise to, which is a hard computational task currently tackled with semidefinite programming, a method limited to linear objective functions and that becomes prohibitive as the complexity of the system grows. Here, we propose an alternative strategy, which exploits a feedforward artificial neural network to optimize the correlations compatible with arbitrary quantum networks. A remarkable step forward with respect to existing methods is that it deals with nonlinear optimization constraints and objective functions, being applicable to scenarios featuring independent sources and nonlinear entanglement witnesses. Furthermore, it offers a significant speedup in comparison with other approaches, thus allowing to explore previously inaccessible regimes. We also extend the use of the neural network to the experimental realm, a situation in which the statistics are unavoidably affected by imperfections, retrieving device-independent uncertainty estimates on Bell-like violations obtained with independent sources of entangled photon states. In this way, this work paves the way for the certification of quantum resources in networks of growing size and complexity.

AB Calculations of nuclear properties and nuclear models are peformed using quantum computing algorithms on simulated and real quantum computers.
   The models are a realistic calculation of deuteron binding based on effective field theory, and a simplified two-level version of the nuclear shell model.
   A method of reducing the number of qubits needed for practical calculation is presented, the reduction being with respect to that used when the standard Jordan-Wigner encoding is used. Its efficacy is shown in the case of the deuteron binding and shell model.
   A version of the variational quantum eigensolver in which all eigenstates in a spectrum are targetted on an equal basis is shown. The method involves finding the minima of the variance of the Hamiltonian, and its ability to find the full spectrum of small version of the simplified shell model is presented.

TI Strong long-range spin-spin coupling via a Kerr magnon interface
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB Strong long-range coupling between distant spins is crucial for spin-based quantum information processing. However, achieving such a strong spin-spin coupling remains challenging. Here we propose to realize a strong coupling between two distant spins via the Kerr effect of magnons in a yttrium-iron-garnet nanosphere. By applying a microwave field on this nanosphere, the Kerr effect of magnons can induce the magnon squeezing, so that the coupling between the spin and the squeezed magnons can be exponentially enhanced. This in turn allows the spin-magnon distance to increase from nano- to micrometer scale. By considering the virtual excitation of the squeezed magnons in the dispersive regime, strong spin-spin coupling mediated by the squeezed magnons can be achieved, and a remote quantum-state transfer, as well as the nonlocal two-qubit ISWAP gate with high fidelity becomes implementable. Our approach offers a feasible scheme to perform quantum information processing among distant spins.

TI Effects of DM and KSEA interactions on entanglement, Fisher and
   Wigner-Yanase information correlations of two XYZ-Heisenberg-qubit
   states under a magnetic field
SO PHYSICA SCRIPTA
AB We employ entanglement negativity, local quantum uncertainty (LQU), and local quantum Fisher information (LQFI) to characterize thermal entanglement between two XYZ-Heisenberg-qubit states under the influence of Dzyaloshinsky-Moriya(DM) and Kaplan-Shekhtman-Entin-Wohlman-Aharony (KSEA) interactions, as well as a magnetic field and thermal equilibrium temperature. A comparative examination reveals similar behaviors among these correlation measures. For the antiferromagnetic scenario, we observe that increasing the DM interaction parameter D z enhances thermal entanglement. Conversely, in the ferromagnetic case, the behavior of thermal entanglement differs with varying D z . Additionally, employing Kraus operators, we explore the performance of these quantifiers under decoherence. Notably, LQFI exhibits greater robustness than negativity and LQU, even displaying a frozen phenomenon at some time under dephasing effects.

TI Positive operator-valued measure for two-photon detection via
   sum-frequency generation
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Spontaneous parametric down conversion (PDC), in the perturbative limit, can be considered as a probabilistic splitting of one input photon into two output photons. Conversely, sum-frequency generation (SFG) implements the reverse process of combining two input photons into one. Here we show that a single-photon projective measurement in the temporal-mode basis of the output photon of a two-photon SFG process affects a generalized measurement on the input two-photon state. We describe the positive operator-valued measure (POVM) associated with such a measurement and show that its elements are proportional to the two-photon states produced by the time-reversed PDC process. Such a detection acts as a joint measurement on two photons and is thus an important component of many quantum information processing protocols relying on photonic entanglement. Using the retrodictive approach, we analyze the properties of the two-photon POVM that are relevant for quantum protocols exploiting two-photon states and measurements.

TI Generalized quantum-assisted digital signature service in an
   SDN-controlled quantum-integrated optical network
SO JOURNAL OF OPTICAL COMMUNICATIONS AND NETWORKING
AB Digital signature (DS) is an essential application of cryptography, used to certify the provenance of a message and its authenticity, guaranteeing the non-repudiation, unforgeability, and transferability of messages. However, the forthcoming advent of quantum computation poses a significant threat to classical signature schemes. A possible solution could be the introduction of novel DS schemes based on the fundamental laws of quantum physics. Recently, several quantum DS (QDS) protocols have been proposed, even relying on the exploitation of off-the-shelf quantum key distribution (QKD) solutions. However, their efficiency and large signature size, uncorrelated to the size of the message to sign, represent the main limitation in their employment in a practical scenario. A trade-off solution could be a quantum-assisted DS (QADS), where the QKD technology is exploited together with classical cryptographic functions to achieve a stronger DS scheme, more resistant even to quantum attacks. We propose a generalized quantum-assisted digital signature (G-QADS) protocol based on a hybrid system, composed by the standard Wegman-Carter Message Authentication Code (WG-MAC) together with symmetric QKD keys, to enhance the security of the DS, allowing messages with arbitrary lengths to be signed while maintaining a suitable DS length. In this work, the G-QADS process is proposed for a three-party configuration (one signer and two verifiers), where the third participant is involved in the procedure just in the case of contention between the other two parties. The G-QADS protocol is then experimentally tested to prove its resilience to forging and non-repudiation attacks, demonstrating its capability in securing the message signature (with a success probability of the attacks < 10(-18)). The performance is experimentally tested exploiting QKD prototypes based on standard BB84 protocol with decoy states and polarization encoding, in a software-defined network (SDN) infrastructure supervised by a single SDN controller, which provides the management of both classical and quantum communication channels. The proposed solution could push the practical exploitation of QKD into a new application domain, leading to a more pervasive integration of quantum technology in realistic scenarios.

TI Quantum walk processes in quantum devices
SO HELIYON
AB Simulation and programming of current quantum computers as Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices represent a hot topic at the border of current physical and information sciences. The quantum walk process represents a basic subroutine in many quantum algorithms and plays an important role in studying physical phenomena. Simulating quantum walk processes is computationally challenging for classical processors. With an increasing improvement in qubits fidelity and qubits number in a single register, there is a potential to improve quantum walks simulations substantially. However, efficient ways to simulate quantum walks in qubit registers still have to be explored. Here, we explore the relationship between quantum walk on graphs and quantum circuits. Firstly, we discuss ways to obtain graphs provided quantum circuit. We then explore techniques to represent quantum walk on a graph as a quantum circuit. Specifically, we study hypercube graphs and arbitrary graphs. Our approach to studying the relationship between graphs and quantum circuits paves way for the efficient implementation of quantum walks algorithms on quantum computers.

TI Landauer's principle in qubit-cavity quantum-field-theory interaction in
   vacuum and thermal states
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Landauer's principle has seen a boom of interest in the last few years due to the growing interest in quantum information sciences. However, its relevance and validity in the contexts of quantum field theory (QFT) remain surprisingly unexplored. In the present paper, we consider Landauer's principle in qubit-cavity QFT interaction perturbatively, in which the initial state of the cavity QFT is chosen to be a vacuum or thermal state. In the vacuum case, the QFT always absorbs heat and jumps to excited states. For the qubit at rest, its entropy decreases, whereas if the qubit accelerates it may also gain energy and it increases its entropy due to the Unruh effect. For the thermal state, the QFT can both absorb and release heat, depending on its temperature and the initial state of the qubit, and the higher-order perturbations can excite or deexcite the initial state to a higher or lower state. Landauer's principle is valid in all the cases we consider. We hope that this paper will pave the way for future explorations of Landauer's principle in QFT and gravity theories.

TI Tensor lattice field theory for renormalization and quantum computing
SO REVIEWS OF MODERN PHYSICS
AB The successes and limitations of statistical sampling for a sequence of models studied in the context of lattice QCD are discussed and the need for new methods to deal with finite-density and real-time evolution is emphasized. It is shown that these lattice models can be reformulated using tensorial methods where the field integrations in the path-integral formalism are replaced by discrete sums. These formulations involve various types of duality and provide exact coarse-graining formulas that can be combined with truncations to obtain practical implementations of the Wilson renormalization group program. Tensor reformulations are naturally discrete and provide manageable transfer matrices. Truncations with the time continuum limit are combined, and Hamiltonians suitable for performing quantum simulation experiments, for instance, using cold atoms, or to be programmed on existing quantum computers, are derived. Recent progress concerning the tensor field theory treatment of noncompact scalar models, supersymmetric models, economical four-dimensional algorithms, noiserobust enforcement of Gauss's law, symmetry preserving truncations, and topological considerations are reviewed. Connections with other tensor network approaches are also discussed.

TI Security of Quantum Key Distribution with One-Time-Pad-Protected Error
   Correction and Its Performance Benefits
SO ENTROPY
AB In quantum key distribution (QKD), public discussion over the authenticated classical channel inevitably leaks information about the raw key to a potential adversary, which must later be mitigated by privacy amplification. To limit this leakage, a one-time pad (OTP) has been proposed to protect message exchanges in various settings. Building on the security proof of Tomamichel and Leverrier, which is based on a non-asymptotic framework and considers the effects of finite resources, we extend the analysis to the OTP-protected scheme. We show that when the OTP key is drawn from the entropy pool of the same QKD session, the achievable quantum key rate is identical to that of the reference protocol with unprotected error-correction exchange. This equivalence holds for a fixed security level, defined via the diamond distance between the real and ideal protocols modeled as completely positive trace-preserving maps. At the same time, the proposed approach reduces the computational requirements: for non-interactive low-density parity-check codes, the encoding problem size is reduced by the square of the syndrome length, while privacy amplification requires less compression. The technique preserves security, avoids the use of QKD keys between sessions, and has the potential to improve performance.

SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM ENGINEERING
AB The double-quantum-dot device benefits from the advantages of both the spin and charge qubits, while offering ways to mitigate their drawbacks. Careful gate voltage modulation can grant greater spinlike or chargelike dynamics to the device, yielding long coherence times with the former and high electrical susceptibility with the latter for electrically driven spin rotations or coherent interactions with microwave photons. As this architecture is a serious contender for the realization of a versatile physical qubit, improving its control is a critical step toward building a large-scale spin-based universal quantum computer. We show that optimal control pulses generated using the gradient ascent pulse engineering algorithm can yield higher fidelity operating regime transfers than can be achieved using linear methods.

TI Majorana Loop Models for Measurement-Only Quantum Circuits
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW X
AB Projective measurements in random quantum circuits lead to a rich breadth of entanglement phases and extend the realm of nonunitary quantum dynamics. Here, we explore the connection between measurement-only quantum circuits in one spatial dimension and the statistical mechanics of loop models in two dimensions. While Gaussian Majorana circuits admit a microscopic mapping to loop models, for nonGaussian, i.e., generic Clifford, circuits, a corresponding mapping may emerge only on a coarse-grained scale. We then focus on a fundamental symmetry of loop models: the orientability of worldlines. We discuss how orientability enters in the measurement framework, acting as a separatrix for the universal long-wavelength behavior in a circuit. When orientability is broken, the circuit falls into the universality class of closely packed loops with crossings (CPLC) and features a Goldstone phase with a peculiar, universal log2oL thorn scaling of the entanglement entropy. In turn, when orientability is preserved, the longwavelength behavior of the circuit mimics that of (coupled) two-dimensional Potts models. We demonstrate the strength of the loop model approach by numerically simulating a variety of measurement-only Clifford circuits. Upon varying the set of measured operators, a rich circuit dynamics is observed, ranging from CPLC to the one-state Potts model (percolation), the two-state Potts model (Ising), and coupled Potts models (Berezhinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless) universality class. Loop models, thus, provide a handle to access a large class of measurement-only circuits and yield a blueprint on how to realize desired entanglement phases by measurement.

TI Improved quantum algorithm for calculating eigenvalues of differential
   operators and its application to estimating the decay rate of the
   perturbation distribution tail in stochastic inflation
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Quantum algorithms for scientific computing and their applications have been actively studied. In this paper, we propose a quantum algorithm for estimating the first eigenvalue of a differential operator L on Rd and its application to cosmic inflation theory. A common approach for this eigenvalue problem involves applying the finite-difference discretization to L and computing the eigenvalues of the resulting matrix, but this method suffers from the curse of dimensionality, namely, the exponential complexity with respect to d. Our first contribution is the development of a quantum algorithm for this task, leveraging recent quantum singular value transformation-based methods. Given a trial function that overlaps well with the eigenfunction, our method runs with query complexity scaling as (O) over tilde (d(3)/epsilon(2)) with d and estimation accuracy E, which is polynomial in d and shows improvement over existing quantum algorithms. Then, we consider the application of our method to a problem in a theoretical framework for cosmic inflation known as stochastic inflation, specifically calculating the eigenvalue of the adjoint Fokker-Planck operator, which is related to the decay rate of the tail of the probability distribution for the primordial density perturbation. We numerically see that, in some cases, simple trial functions overlap well with the first eigenfunction, indicating our method is promising for this problem.

TI Entanglement generation using cryogenic integrated four-wave mixing
SO OPTICA
AB Cryogenic integrated nonlinear photonics can provide fundamental building blocks for scalable photonic quantum computing and optical interfacing among different platforms. Here, we investigate the spontaneous four-wave mixing effect in an integrated silicon waveguide with cryogenic operating conditions (4 K) and employ the system to generate the entangled photon-pair source, one of the key elements of photonic quantum information applications. We experimentally prove that even at cryogenic temperatures, the four-wave mixing effect in silicon waveguides is still an effective method to generate quantum photonic sources. The cryogenic photon-pair source is verified over multiple frequency channels within a bandwidth of similar to 2 THz. Furthermore, the source is used to generate high-quality frequency-multiplexed energy-time entangled states. Our results will advance the development of cryogenic nonlinear photonics and scalable integrated photonics for quantum information processing.

TI Simulating Quantum Computation: How Many "Bits" for "It"?
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB A recently introduced classical simulation method for universal quantum computation with magic states operates by repeated sampling from probability functions [M. Zurel et al. PRL 260404 (2020)]. This method is closely related to sampling algorithms based on Wigner functions, with the important distinction that Wigner functions can take negative values obstructing the sampling. Indeed, negativity in Wigner functions has been identified as a precondition for a quantum speed-up. However, in the present method of classical simulation, negativity of quasiprobability functions never arises. This model remains probabilistic for all quantum computations. In this paper, we analyze the amount of classical data that the simulation procedure must track. We find that this amount is small. Specifically, for any number n of magic states, the number of bits that describe the quantum system at any given time is 2n2 n 2 + O(n). .

TI Multidimensional Quantum Generative Modeling by Quantum Hartley
   Transform
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB An approach for building quantum models based on the exponentially growing orthonormal basis of Hartley kernel functions is developed. First, a differentiable Hartley feature map parameterized by real-valued argument that enables quantum models suitable for solving stochastic differential equations and regression problems is designed. Unlike the naturally complex Fourier encoding, the proposed Hartley feature map circuit leads to quantum states with real-valued amplitudes, introducing an inductive bias and natural regularization. Next, a quantum Hartley transform circuit is proposed as a map between computational and Hartley basis. The developed paradigm is applied to generative modeling from solutions of stochastic differential equations, and utilize the quantum Hartley transform for fine sampling from parameterized distributions through an extended register. Finally, the capability of multivariate quantum generative modeling is demonstrated for both correlated and uncorrelated distributions. As a result, the developed quantum Hartley-based generative models (QHGMs) offer a distinct quantum approach to generative AI at increasing scale.

This method is focused on the tau -> pi nu(tau) decay. We show how the introduced method works on simulated events without detector effects. When detector effects are applied, the necessary tau four-momenta can be reconstructed from kinematic constraints. We will discuss the advantages of e(+)e(-) collisions over pp collisions where the reconstruction of the tt rest frame is more difficult. This discussion will focus on the influence of p(T) trigger cuts on the visible pi(+/-) in the tau t lepton decay.

TI Study of quantum decoherence at the Protvino to ORCA experiment
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
AB Protvino to ORCA (oscillation research with cosmics in the abyss) (P2O) is an upcoming neutrino oscillation experiment with a very long baseline of 2595 km. Because of the substantial baseline, this experiment provides a unique opportunity to study the Earth matter effects over very large distances. This makes it a suitable experiment to investigate the environmental decoherence in neutrino oscillations, where the neutrino system could interact with a stochastic environment and lead to a loss in the coherence of neutrino states. In this work, we consider an open quantum system framework to simulate the neutrino oscillations in the P2O experiment and obtain bounds on the decoherence parameters in different phenomenological models. Here, we also consider that the decoherence parameter F depends on neutrino energy E nu as Fjk(E nu) = F0(E nu E0)n. Furthermore, assuming the presence of decoherence in nature, we study the effect of it on the determination of neutrino mass hierarchy and CP violation at the P2O experiment.

AB In this work, we study the impact of the environmental decoherence at Protvino to ORCA (P2O) experiment which has a substantial baseline of 2595 kilometres. We simulate this experiment assuming different phenomenological models and considering energy dependency of decoherence parameter, gamma proportional to E-gamma(n). Here, E-gamma is the neutrino energy and n = 0, +/- 1, +/- 2. We estimate the sensitivity of P2O experiment to obtain the upper bounds on gamma parameters in each of these cases. Additionally, we use these bounds to illustrate the effect of environmental decoherence on mass hierarchy (MH) and CP violation (CPV) sensitivity of this experiment.
   We have noted that P2O poses the strong bound on gamma <= 1.89 x 10(-24) GeV (90% CL) for the case of n = 0. Moreover, we observed that while the MH sensitivity has not changed significantly in all the cases, CP violation sensitivity increased above the standard case for all true values of delta(CP).

TI Measuring statistics-induced entanglement entropy with a Hong-Ou-Mandel
   interferometer
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Despite its ubiquity in quantum computation and quantum information, a universally applicable definition of quantum entanglement remains elusive. The challenge is further accentuated when entanglement is associated with other key themes, e.g., quantum interference and quantum statistics. Here, we introduce two novel motifs that characterize the interplay of entanglement and quantum statistics: an 'entanglement pointer' and a 'statistics-induced entanglement entropy'. The two provide a quantitative description of the statistics-induced entanglement: (i) they are finite only in the presence of quantum entanglement underlined by quantum statistics and (ii) their explicit form depends on the quantum statistics of the particles (e.g., fermions, bosons, and anyons). We have experimentally implemented these ideas by employing an electronic Hong-Ou-Mandel interferometer fed by two highly diluted electron beams in an integer quantum Hall platform. Performing measurements of auto-correlation and cross-correlation of current fluctuations of the scattered beams (following 'collisions'), we quantify the statistics-induced entanglement by experimentally accessing the entanglement pointer and the statistics-induced entanglement entropy. Our theoretical and experimental approaches pave the way to study entanglement in various correlated platforms, e.g., those involving anyonic Abelian and non-Abelian states.
   Measuring quantum entanglement remains a demanding task. The authors introduce two functions to quantify entanglement induced by fermionic or bosonic statistics, in transport experiments. Both functions, in theory and experiment, are remarkably resilient against the nonuniversal effects of interactions.

TI Continuous-variable quantum key distribution based on non-Gaussian
   operations with on-off detection
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Quantum key distribution (QKD) with continuous variable (CV) is an effective method for achieving the high key rate, but is also limited to a short transmission distance. To overcome this limitation, some solutions have been proposed, including non-Gaussian operations, such as photon addition and photon subtraction using ideal photon source and number-resolving detection. Here we consider the effect of non-Gaussian operation for realistic photon source and ideal on-off photon detection. In the realistic case, it is shown that the performance of CVQKD can not be improved by both photon-subtraction/addition on the right side before the entangled source reaches the channel and photon-subtraction on the left side preceding the entangled source to the sender Alice before performing heterodyne detection, but be enhanced by the photon addition on the left side in a long distance case. These results may provide a useful reference for quantum information with continuous variable.

TI Quantum advantage and noise reduction in distributed quantum computing
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Distributed quantum computing can provide substantial noise reduction due to shallower circuits. An experiment illustrates the advantages in the case of a Grover search. This motivates study of the quantum advantage of the distributed version of the Simon and Deutsch-Jozsa algorithms. We show that the distributed Simon algorithm retains the exponential advantage, but the complexity deteriorates from O(n) to O(n2), where n = log2(N). The distributed Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm deteriorates to being probabilistic but retains a quantum advantage over classical random sampling.

TI Benchmarking Advantage and D-Wave 2000Q quantum annealers with exact
   cover problems
SO QUANTUM INFORMATION PROCESSING
AB We benchmark the quantum processing units of the largest quantum annealers to date, the 5000+ qubit quantum annealer Advantage and its 2000+ qubit predecessor D-Wave 2000Q, using tail assignment and exact cover problems from aircraft scheduling scenarios. The benchmark set contains small, intermediate, and large problems with both sparsely connected and almost fully connected instances. We find that Advantage outperforms D-Wave 2000Q for almost all problems, with a notable increase in success rate and problem size. In particular, Advantage is also able to solve the largest problems with 120 logical qubits that D-Wave 2000Q cannot solve anymore. Furthermore, problems that can still be solved by D-Wave 2000Q are solved faster by Advantage. We find, however, that D-Wave 2000Q can achieve better success rates for sparsely connected problems that do not require the many new couplers present on Advantage, so improving the connectivity of a quantum annealer does not per se improve its performance.

TI Input Data Format for Sparse Matrix in Quantum Annealing Emulator
SO IEICE TRANSACTIONS ON FUNDAMENTALS OF ELECTRONICS COMMUNICATIONS AND
   COMPUTER SCIENCES
AB Recently, Quantum Annealing (QA) has attracted attention as an efficient algorithm for combinatorial optimization problems. In QA, the input data size becomes large and its reduction is important for accelerating by the hardware emulation since the usable memory size and its bandwidth are limited. The paper proposes the compression method of input sparse matrices for QA emulator. The proposed method uses the sparseness of the coefficient matrix and the reappearance of the same values. An independent table is introduced and data are compressed by the search and registration method of two consecutive data in the value table. The proposed method is applied to Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) with 32, 64 and 96 cities and Nurse Scheduling Problem (NSP). The proposed method could reduce the amount of data by 1/40 for 96 city TSP and could manage 96 city TSP on the hardware emulator. When applied to NSP, we confirmed the effectiveness of the proposed method by the compression ratio ranging from 1/4 to 1/11.8. The data reduction is also useful for the simulation/emulation performance when using the compressed data directly and 1.9 times faster speed can be found on 96 city TSP than the CSR -based method.

TI F-Divergences and Cost Function Locality in Generative Modelling with
   Quantum Circuits
SO ENTROPY
AB Generative modelling is an important unsupervised task in machine learning. In this work, we study a hybrid quantum-classical approach to this task, based on the use of a quantum circuit born machine. In particular, we consider training a quantum circuit born machine using f-divergences. We first discuss the adversarial framework for generative modelling, which enables the estimation of any f-divergence in the near term. Based on this capability, we introduce two heuristics which demonstrably improve the training of the born machine. The first is based on f-divergence switching during training. The second introduces locality to the divergence, a strategy which has proved important in similar applications in terms of mitigating barren plateaus. Finally, we discuss the long-term implications of quantum devices for computing f-divergences, including algorithms which provide quadratic speedups to their estimation. In particular, we generalise existing algorithms for estimating the Kullback-Leibler divergence and the total variation distance to obtain a fault-tolerant quantum algorithm for estimating another f-divergence, namely, the Pearson divergence.</p>

TI Implementation of a two-stroke quantum heat engine with a collisional

SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We put forth a quantum simulation of a stroboscopic two-stroke thermal engine in the IBM quantum (IBMQ) processor. The system consists of a quantum spin chain connected to two baths at their boundaries, prepared at different temperatures using the variational quantum thermalizer algorithm. The dynamics alternates between heat and work strokes, which can be separately designed using independent quantum circuits. The results show good agreement with theoretical predictions, showcasing IBMQ as a powerful tool to study thermodynamics in the quantum regime, as well as the implementation of variational quantum algorithms in real-world quantum computers. It also opens the possibility of simulating quantum heat transport across a broad range of chain geometries and interactions.

TI Understanding domain-wall encoding theoretically and experimentally
SO PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY A-MATHEMATICAL PHYSICAL
   AND ENGINEERING SCIENCES
AB We analyse the method of encoding pairwise interactions of higher-than-binary discrete variables (these models are sometimes referred to as discrete quadratic models) into binary variables based on domain walls on one-dimensional Ising chains. We discuss how this is relevant to quantum annealing, but also many gate model algorithms such as VQE and QAOA. We theoretically show that for problems of practical interest for quantum computing and assuming only quadratic interactions are available between the binary variables, it is not possible to have a more efficient general encoding in terms of number of binary variables per discrete variable. We furthermore use a D-Wave Advantage 1.1 flux qubit quantum annealing computer to show that the dynamics effectively freeze later for a domain-wall encoding compared with a traditional one-hot encoding. This second result could help explain the dramatic performance improvement of domain wall over one-hot, which has been seen in a recent experiment on D-Wave hardware. This is an important result because usually problem encoding and the underlying physics are considered separately, our work suggests that considering them together may be a more useful paradigm. We argue that this experimental result is also likely to carry over to a number of other settings, we discuss how this has implications for gate-model and quantum-inspired algorithms.

TI Logical error rates for the surface code under a mixed coherent and
   stochastic circuit-level noise model inspired by trapped ions
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB With fault-tolerant quantum computing (FTQC) on the horizon, it is critical to understand sources of logical errors in plausible hardware implementations of quantum error-correcting codes. Detailed error modeling of computational instructions on particular FTQC architectures will enable the better prediction of error propagation in FT-encoded quantum circuits while revealing where greater attention is needed in hardware design. In this work, we consider logical error rates for the surface code implemented on a hypothetical grid-based trapped-ion quantum charge-coupled device architecture. Specifically, we construct logical channels for the idling surface code and examine its diamond error under a mixed coherent and stochastic circuit-level noise model inspired by trapped ions. We include the coherent dephasing noise that is known to accumulate during physical qubit idling and transport in these systems, determining idling and transport durations using the time-resolved output of an open-source trapped-ion surface code compiler. To estimate expectation values of logical Pauli observables following hardware circuits containing non-Clifford sources of noise, we utilize a Monte Carlo technique to sample from an underlying quasiprobability distribution of Clifford circuits that we independently simulate in a phase-sensitive fashion. We verify error suppression up to code distance d = 11 at coherent dephasing rates near and below those of current-generation trapped-ion quantum computers and find that logical error rates align with those of analogous fully stochastic simulations in this regime. Exploring higher dephasing rates at d = 3-5, we find evidence for growing coherent rotations about all three logical Pauli axes, increased diagonal logical error process matrix elements relative to those of stochastic simulations, and a reduced dephasing rate threshold. Overall, our work paves a way toward realistic hardware emulation of small fault-tolerant quantum processes, e.g., members of an FTQC instruction set.

TI Multi-Dimensional Routing, Wavelength, and Timeslot Allocation (RWTA) in
   Quantum Key Distribution Optical Networks (QKD-ON)
SO APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
AB Currently, with the continuous advancement of network and communication technology, the amount of data carried by the optical network is very huge. The security of high-speed and large-capacity information in optical networks has attracted more and more attention. Quantum key distribution (QKD) provides information-theoretic security based on the laws of quantum mechanics. Introducing QKD into an optical network can greatly improve the security of the optical network. In order to reduce the cost of deployment on QKD infrastructure, quantum signals in QKD and classical signals in optical networks are multiplexed in the same fiber by wavelength-division manner. Moreover, due to the limited wavelength resources in an optical fiber, time-division technology is adopted to construct different kinds of channels in QKD system for efficient utilization of wavelength resources. Under such situation, how to satisfy the security requirements of service requests and complete the efficient scheduling of multi-dimensional resources, i.e., wavelengths and timeslots, is a challenging problem. This paper addresses this problem by considering multi-dimensional routing, wavelength, and timeslot allocation (RWTA) in short-distance quantum key distribution optical networks (QKD-ON), in which any two nodes can directly establish a quantum channel, and the maximum distance between any two nodes is less than the distance that can carry out point-to-point quantum key distribution process. While accommodating services with security requirements in QKD optical networks, to avoid the wavelength time-slot fragmentation caused by the constraints of wavelength consistency and time-slot continuity, we propose a time-window-based security orchestration strategy as well as relative-loss of time continuous compactness based RWTA strategy. We conducted the simulations under various scenarios, e.g., different key updating periods and different distributions on wavelength resources, etc., and the results show that the proposed strategy can achieve better performance compared with the baselines in terms of key success rate, key-updating delay, and blocking probability.

TI Protocols and trade-offs of quantum state purification
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Quantum state purification is crucial in quantum communication and computation, aiming to recover a purified state from multiple copies of an unknown noisy state. This work introduces a general state purification framework designed to achieve the highest fidelity with a specified probability and characterize the associated trade-offs. For i.i.d. quantum states under depolarizing noise, our framework can replicate the purification protocol proposed by Barenco et al (1997 SIAM J. Comput. 26 1541-57) and further provide exact formulas for the purification fidelity and probability with explicit trade-offs. We prove the protocols' optimality for two copies of noisy states with any dimension and confirm its optimality for higher numbers of copies and dimensions through numerical analysis. Our methodological approach paves the way for proving the protocol's optimality in more general scenarios and leads to optimal protocols for other noise models. Furthermore, we present a systematic implementation method via block encoding and parameterized quantum circuits, providing explicit circuits for purifying three-copy and four-copy states under depolarizing noise. Finally, we estimate the sample complexity and generalize the protocol to a recursive form, demonstrating its practicality for quantum computers with limited memory.

Current dark matter searches operating at microwave frequencies use a resonant cavity to coherently accumulate the field sourced by the dark matter and a near standard quantum limited (SQL) linear amplifier to read out the cavity signal. To further increase sensitivity to the dark matter signal, sub-SQL detection techniques are required. Here we report the development of a novel microwave photon counting technique and a new exclusion limit on hidden photon dark matter. We operate a superconducting qubit to make repeated quantum nondemolition measurements of cavity photons and apply a hidden Markov model analysis to reduce the noise to 15.7 dB below the quantum limit, with overall detector performance limited by a residual background of real photons. With the present device, we perform a hidden photon search and constrain the kinetic mixing angle to epsilon <= 1.68 x 10(-15) in a band around 6.011 GHz (24.86 mu eV) with an integration time of 8.33 s. This demonstrated noise reduction technique enables future dark matter searches to be sped up by a factor of 1,300. By coupling a qubit to an arbitrary quantum sensor, more general sub-SQL metrology is possible with the techniques presented in this Letter.

TI Improving the success rate of quantum algorithm attacking RSA encryption
   system
SO JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS
AB Shor's factorization algorithm (SFA) aims at finding the non-trivial factor of a given composite number, but the algorithm does not always work. In some cases, it has to call back to the beginning of the algorithm to make recalculation. After the analysis of the principle of SFA and the characteristics of RSA public-key cryptography with a series of data calculations, it can be concluded that the random value selected by the algorithm is closely related to whether the obtained period is effective. Therefore, a new optimized scheme is proposed to tackle with this defect from two perspectives: (a) When the a value is a perfect square, the algorithm can be completed with an odd cycle r. (b) When the period r obtained by the randomly selected a value is a multiple of 3, the algorithm can be completed by modifying the decomposition method to relax the requirements for the period without affecting the complexity of the algorithm. Due to the limitations of hardware in applying the quantum algorithms, the classical algorithm is applied to simulate quantum algorithms to test the success rate of decomposition of some composite numbers. The result indicates the effectiveness of the improved algorithm, which significantly reduces the probability of repeated operations to save the quantum circuit resources.

TI Transition state search and geometry relaxation throughout chemical
   compound space with quantum machine learning
SO JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS
AB We use energies and forces predicted within response operator based quantum machine learning (OQML) to perform geometry optimization and transition state search calculations with legacy optimizers but without the need for subsequent re-optimization with quantum chemistry methods. For randomly sampled initial coordinates of small organic query molecules, we report systematic improvement of equilibrium and transition state geometry output as training set sizes increase. Out-of-sample S(N)2 reactant complexes and transition state geometries have been predicted using the LBFGS and the QST2 algorithms with an root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) of 0.16 and 0.4 & ANGS;-after training on up to 200 reactant complex relaxations and transition state search trajectories from the QMrxn20 dataset, respectively. For geometry optimizations, we have also considered relaxation paths up to 5'595 constitutional isomers with sum formula C7H10O2 from the QM9-database. Using the resulting OQML models with an LBFGS optimizer reproduces the minimum geometry with an RMSD of 0.14 & ANGS;, only using & SIM;6000 training points obtained from normal mode sampling along the optimization paths of the training compounds without the need for active learning. For converged equilibrium and transition state geometries, subsequent vibrational normal mode frequency analysis indicates deviation from MP2 reference results by on average 14 and 26 cm(-1), respectively. While the numerical cost for OQML predictions is negligible in comparison to density functional theory or MP2, the number of steps until convergence is typically larger in either case. The success rate for reaching convergence, however, improves systematically with training set size, underscoring OQML's potential for universal applicability. (C) 2022 Author(s).

TI An analysis of the relative effects of connectivity and coupling
   interactions on spin networks emulating the D-Wave 2000Q quantum
   annealer
SO NATURAL COMPUTING
AB From available data, we show strong positive spatial correlations in the qubits of a D-Wave 2000Q quantum annealing chip that are connected to qubits outside their own unit cell. Then, by simulating the dynamics of three different spin networks and two different initial conditions, we then show that correlation between nodes is affected by a number of factors. The different connectivity of qubits within the network means that information transfer is not straightforward even when all the qubit-qubit couplings have equal weighting. Connected nodes behave even more dissimilarly when the couplings' strength is scaled according to the physical length of the connections (here to simulate dipole-dipole interactions). This highlights the importance of understanding the architectural features and potentially unprogrammed interactions/connections that can divert the performance of a quantum system away from the idealised model of identical qubits and couplings across the chip.

TI Quantum annealing for hard 2-satisfiability problems: Distribution and
   scaling of minimum energy gap and success probability
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB In recent years, quantum annealing has gained the status of being a promising candidate for solving various optimization problems. Using a set of hard 2-satisfiability (2-SAT) problems, consisting of problems of up to 18 variables, we analyze the scaling complexity of the quantum annealing algorithm and study the distributions of the minimum energy gap and the success probability. We extend the analysis of the standard quantum annealing Hamiltonian by introducing an additional term, the trigger Hamiltonian, which can be of two types: ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic. We use these trigger Hamiltonians to study their influence on the success probability for solving the selected 2-SAT problems. We find that although the scaling of the runtime is exponential for the standard and modified quantum annealing Hamiltonians, the scaling constant in the case of adding the trigger Hamiltonians can be significantly smaller. Furthermore, certain choices for the trigger Hamiltonian and annealing times can result in a better scaling than that for simulated annealing. Finally, we also use the quantum annealers of D-Wave Systems Inc. to study their performance in solving the 2-SAT problems and compare it with the simulation results.

TI Probing coherence and noise tolerance in discrete-time quantum walks:
   Unveiling self-focusing and breathing dynamics
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB The sensitivity of quantum systems to external disturbances is a fundamental problem for the implementation of functional quantum devices, quantum information, and computation. Based on remarkable experimental progress in optics and ultracold gases, we study the consequences of a short-time (instantaneous) noise while an intensity-dependent phase acquisition is associated with a qubit propagating on an N cycle. By employing quantum coherence measures, we report emerging unstable regimes in which quantum walks arise, such as self-focusing and breathing dynamics. Our numerical and analytical results unveil appropriate settings which favor the stable regime, with the asymptotic distribution surviving for weak nonlinearities and disappearing in the thermodynamic limit with 1/N. The diagram showing the threshold between different regimes reveals the quantum gates close to Pauli-Z as more noise tolerant. As we move towards the Pauli-X quantum gate, such aptness dramatically decreases and the threshold to the self-focusing regime becomes almost unavoidable. Quantum gates close to Hadamard exhibit an unusual aspect, in which an increment of the nonlinear strength can remove the dynamics from the self-focusing regime.

TI Quantum Classifier Based on Compact Encoding and Polynomial Kernel
SO LASER & OPTOELECTRONICS PROGRESS
AB Kernel method has a wide range of applications in machine learning. The combination of quantum computing and kernel method can effectively solve the problem of increasing computational costs in classical kernel method when the feature space becomes larger. Researches show that the minimized quantum circuits based on kernel method can be reliably executed on noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices. Some classifiers based on the quantum kernel method that have been proposed so far still have certain defects in terms of fully mapping data and circuit architecture. Therefore, we propose a compact quantum classifier based on polynomial kernel functions. First, a polynomial kernel function is introduced to increase the classification iteration rate of nonlinear data, thereby improve the classification efficiency. On this basis, a compact amplitude encoding is further proposed to encode the data labels corresponding to the quantum state. Compared with the existing quantum kernel method classifier, the number of coding bits of the quantum circuit of the proposed model can be reduced from 5 qubits to 3 qubits, and the two-qubit measurement in the existing method is simplified to a single- qubit measurement in the proposed model. In addition, the model achieves the optimal variance of the quantum circuit parameters in the measurement stage, which can effectively save computing resource overhead. Experimental simulations show that the expected value in the proposed classifier model is closer to the theoretical one, and higher classification accuracy is obtained. At the same time, the model has a low degree of entanglement, which effectively reduces the overhead of the entire preparation work.

TI Solving Large-Scale Linear Systems of Equations by a Quantum Hybrid
   Algorithm
SO ANNALEN DER PHYSIK
AB Today's intermediate-scale quantum computers, although imperfect, already perform computational tasks that are manifestly beyond the capabilities of modern classical supercomputers. However, so far, quantum-enabled large-scale solutions have been realized only for limited set of problems. Here a hybrid algorithm based on phase estimation and classical optimization of the circuit width and depth is employed for solving a specific class of large linear systems of equations ubiquitous to many areas of science and engineering. A classification of linear systems based on the entanglement properties of the associated phase-estimation unitary operation is introduced, enabling a highly efficient search for solutions that is facilitated by a straightforward matrix-to-circuit map. A 2(17)-dimensional problem is implemented on several IBM quantum computer superconducting quantum processors, a record-breaking result for a linear system solved by a quantum computer. Demonstrated realisation sets a clear benchmark in the quest for the future quantum speedup in the linear systems of equations solution.

TI Fault-Tolerant Compiling of Classically Hard Instantaneous Quantum
   Polynomial Circuits on Hypercubes
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Realizing computationally complex quantum circuits in the presence of noise and imperfections is a challenging task. While fault-tolerant quantum computing provides a route to reducing noise, it requires a large overhead for generic algorithms. Here, we develop and analyze a hardware-efficient, fault-tolerant approach to realizing complex sampling circuits. We co-design the circuits with the appropriate quantum error-correcting codes for efficient implementation in a reconfigurable neutral atom-array architecture, constituting what we call a fault-tolerant compilation of the sampling algorithm. Specifically, we consider a family of [2D, D, 2] quantum error-detecting codes whose transversal and permutation gate set can realize arbitrary degree-D instantaneous quantum polynomial (IQP) circuits. Using native operations of the code and the atom-array hardware, we compile a fault-tolerant and fast-scrambling family of such IQP circuits in a hypercube geometry, realized recently in the experiments by Bluvstein et al. [Nature 626, 7997 (2024)]. We develop a theory of second-moment properties of degree-D IQP circuits for analyzing hardness and verification of random sampling by mapping to a statistical mechanics model. We provide strong evidence that sampling from these hypercube IQP circuits is classically hard to simulate even at relatively low depths. We analyze the linear cross-entropy benchmark (XEB) in comparison to the average fidelity and, depending on the local noise rate, find two different asymptotic regimes. To realize a fully scalable approach, we first show that Bell sampling from degree-4 IQP circuits is classically intractable and can be efficiently validated. We further devise new families of [O(dD), D, d] color codes of increasing distance d, permitting exponential error suppression for transversal IQP sampling. Our results highlight fault-tolerant compiling as a powerful tool in co-designing algorithms with specific error-correcting codes and realistic hardware.

TI Composable security for continuous variable quantum key distribution:
   Trust levels and practical key rates in wired and wireless networks
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Continuous variable (CV) quantum key distribution (QKD) provides a powerful setting for secure quantum communications, thanks to the use of room-temperature off-the-shelf optical devices and the potential to reach much higher rates than the standard discrete-variable counterpart. In this paper, we provide a general framework for studying the composable finite-size security of CV-QKD with Gaussian-modulated coherent-state protocols under various levels of trust for the loss and noise experienced by the parties. Our paper considers both wired (i.e., fiber-based) and wireless (i.e., free-space) quantum communications. In the latter case, we show that high key rates are achievable for short-range optical wireless (LiFi) in secure quantum networks with both fixed and mobile devices. Finally, we extend our investigation to microwave wireless (WiFi) discussing security and feasibility of CV-QKD for very short-range applications.

TI Enhanced entanglement and steering in PT-symmetric cavity
   magnomechanics
SO OPTICS COMMUNICATIONS
AB We study creation of entanglement and quantum steering in a parity -time-(PT-) symmetric cavity magnomechanical system. There are photon-magnon coupling and phonon-magnon coupling in this system. By introducing a gain cavity mode, a PT-symmetric Hamiltonian of the system is obtained. We find that bipartite entanglement and magnon-*phonon steering in PT-symmetry system (gain-loss system) are significantly enhanced versus the case in the conventional cavity magnomechanical system (loss-loss system). Moreover, the magnon-*phonon one-way-like quantum steering can be realized in unbroken-PT-symmetry regime. The boundary of stability is demonstrated and it shows that the gain-loss system becomes more stable with respect to the conventional loss-loss system under the parameters we consider. This work opens up a route to explore the characteristics of quantum entanglement and steering in magnomechanical systems, which might have potential applications in quantum state engineering and quantum information.

TI Collective quantum enhancement in critical quantum sensing
SO COMMUNICATIONS PHYSICS
AB Critical systems represent a valuable resource in quantum sensing and metrology. Critical quantum sensing (CQS) protocols can be realized using finite-component phase transitions, where criticality arises from the rescaling of system parameters rather than the thermodynamic limit. Here, we show that a collective quantum advantage can be achieved in a multipartite CQS protocol using a chain of parametrically coupled critical resonators in the weak-nonlinearity limit. We derive analytical solutions for the low-energy spectrum of this unconventional quantum many-body system, which is composed of locally critical elements. We then assess the scaling of the quantum Fisher information with respect to fundamental resources. We demonstrate that the coupled chain outperforms an equivalent ensemble of independent critical sensors, achieving quadratic scaling in the number of resonators. Finally, we show that even with finite Kerr nonlinearity or Markovian dissipation, the critical chain retains its advantage, making it relevant for implementing quantum sensors with current microwave superconducting technologies.

TI Ultra-sensitive measurement of small optical rotation angles using
   quantum entanglement based on a quasi-Wollaston prism beam splitter
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB The measurement of optical rotation is fundamental to optical atomic magnetometry. Ultra -high sensitivity has been achieved by employing a quasi -Wollaston prism as the beam splitter within a quantum entanglement state, complemented by synchronous detection. Initially, we designed a quasi -Wollaston prism and intentionally rotated the crystal axis of the exit prism element by a specific bias angle. A linearly polarized light beam, incident upon this prism, is divided into three beams, with the intensity of each beam correlated through quantum entanglement. Subsequently, we formulated the equations for optical rotation angles by synchronously detecting the intensities of these beams, distinguishing between differential and reference signals. Theoretical analysis indicates that the measurement uncertainty for optical rotation angles, when using quantum entanglement, exceeds the conventional photon shot noise limit. Moreover, we have experimentally validated the effectiveness of our method. In DC mode, the experimental results reveal that the measurement uncertainty for optical rotation angles is 4.7 x 10 - 9 rad, implying a sensitivity of 4.7 x 10 - 10 rad/Hz 1 / 2 for each 0.01 s measurement duration. In light intensity modulation mode, the uncertainty is 48.9 x 10 - 9 rad, indicating a sensitivity of 4.89 x 10 - 9 rad/Hz 1 / 2 per 0.01 s measurement duration. This study presents a novel approach for measuring small optical rotation angles with unprecedentedly low uncertainty and high sensitivity, potentially playing a pivotal role in advancing all -optical atomic magnetometers and magneto -optical effect research.

TI Quantum reservoir computing with a single nonlinear oscillator
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Realizing the promise of quantum information processing remains a daunting task given the omnipresence of noise and error. Adapting noise-resilient classical computing modalities to quantum mechanics may be a viable path towards near-term applications in the noisy intermediate-scale quantum era. Here, we propose continuous variable quantum reservoir computing in a single nonlinear oscillator. Through numerical simulation of our model we demonstrate quantum-classical performance improvement and identify its likely source: the nonlinearity of quantum measurement. Beyond quantum reservoir computing, this result may impact the interpretation of results across quantum machine learning. We study how the performance of our quantum reservoir depends on Hilbert space dimension, how it is impacted by injected noise, and briefly comment on its experimental implementation. Our results show that quantum reservoir computing in a single nonlinear oscillator is an attractive modality for quantum computing on near-term hardware.

TI Sparse Blossom: correcting a million errors per core second with
   minimum-weight matching
SO QUANTUM
AB In this work, we introduce a fast implementation of the minimum-weight perfect matching (MWPM) decoder, the most widely used decoder for several important families of quantum error correcting codes, including surface codes. Our algorithm, which we call sparse blossom, is a variant of the blossom algorithm which directly solves the decoding problem relevant to quantum error correction. Sparse blossom avoids the need for all-to-all Dijkstra searches, common amongst MWPM decoder implementations. For 0.1% circuit-level depolarising noise, sparse blossom processes syndrome data in both X and Z bases of distance-17 surface code circuits in less than one microsecond per round of syndrome extraction on a single core, which matches the rate at which syndrome data is generated by superconducting quantum computers. Our implementation is open-source, and has been released in version 2 of the PyMatching library.

TI Unitary block optimization for variational quantum algorithms
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Variational quantum algorithms are a promising hybrid framework for solving chemistry and physics problems with broad applicability to optimization as well. They are particularly well suited for noisy intermediate-scale quantum computers. In this paper we describe the unitary block optimization scheme (UBOS) and apply it to two variational quantum algorithms: the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) and variational time evolution. The goal of VQE is to optimize a classically intractable parameterized quantum wave function to target a physical state of a Hamiltonian or solve an optimization problem. UBOS is an alternative to other VQE optimization schemes with a number of advantages, including fast convergence, less sensitivity to barren plateaus, the ability to tunnel through some local minima, and no hyperparameters to tune. We additionally describe how UBOS applies to real and imaginary time-evolution (TUBOS).

TI Low-rank density-matrix evolution for noisy quantum circuits
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB In this work, we present an efficient rank-compression approach for the classical simulation of Kraus decoherence channels in noisy quantum circuits. The approximation is achieved through iterative compression of the density matrix based on its leading eigenbasis during each simulation step without the need to store, manipulate, or diagonalize the full matrix. We implement this algorithm using an in-house simulator and show that the low-rank algorithm speeds up simulations by more than two orders of magnitude over existing implementations of full-rank simulators, and with negligible error in the noise effect and final observables. Finally, we demonstrate the utility of the low-rank method as applied to representative problems of interest by using the algorithm to speed up noisy simulations of Grover's search algorithm and quantum chemistry solvers.

TI Grover's Oracle for the Shortest Vector Problem and Its Application in
   Hybrid Classical-Quantum Solvers
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM ENGINEERING
AB Finding the shortest vector in a lattice is a problem that is believed to be hard both for classical and quantum computers. Many major postquantum secure cryptosystems base their security on the hardness of the shortest vector problem (SVP) (Moody, 2023). Finding the best classical, quantum, or hybrid classical-quantum algorithms for the SVP is necessary to select cryptosystem parameters that offer a sufficient level of security. Grover's search quantum algorithm provides a generic quadratic speedup, given access to an oracle implementing some function, which describes when a solution is found. In this article, we provide concrete implementation of such an oracle for the SVP. We define the circuit and evaluate costs in terms of the number of qubits, the number of gates, depth, and T-quantum cost. We then analyze how to combine Grover's quantum search for small SVP instances with state-of-the-art classical solvers that use well-known algorithms, such as the block Korkine Zolotorev (Schnorr and Euchner, 1994), where the former is used as a subroutine. This could enable solving larger instances of SVP with higher probability than classical state-of-the-art records, but still very far from posing any threat to cryptosystems being considered for standardization. Depending on the technology available, there is a spectrum of tradeoffs in creating this combination.

TI Variational quantum algorithm based on the minimum potential energy for
   solving the Poisson equation
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Computer-aided engineering techniques are indispensable in modern engineering developments. In particular, partial differential equations are commonly used to simulate the dynamics of physical phenomena, but very large systems are often intractable within a reasonable computation time, even when using supercomputers. To overcome the inherent limit of classical computing, we present a variational quantum algorithm for solving the Poisson equation that can be implemented in noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices. The proposed method defines the total potential energy of the Poisson equation as an expectation of certain observables, which are decomposed into a linear combination of Pauli operators and simple observables. The expectation value of these observables is then minimized with respect to a parameterized quantum state. Because the number of decomposed terms is independent of the size of the problem, this method requires relatively few quantum measurements. Numerical experiments demonstrate the faster computing speed of this method compared with classical computing methods and a previous variational quantum approach. We believe that our approach brings quantum computer-aided techniques closer to future applications in engineering developments.

TI Mapping the frontier: a review of quantum and evolutionary game theory
   for complex decision-making
SO QUANTUM INFORMATION PROCESSING
AB In the current context, where the productivity paradox coexists with growing concerns about inequality, quantum economics and quantum game theory are emerging as novel frameworks to address inherent uncertainty and complex strategic interactions. Quantum game theory applies the principles of quantum mechanics to model strategic interactions, providing new insights into decision-making, optimization and conflict resolution. In this article, we conduct a systematic review following the PRISMA methodology and a bibliometric analysis of the literature on quantum game theory to assess its development, methodologies and applications. We examine the growing interest in quantum technologies such as quantum computing, quantum communication and quantum simulation, which have had a significant impact on both theoretical models and practical economic and social systems. By mapping trends in the quantum game theory research landscape, this article aims to identify key advances, highlight important milestones and propose future directions for research in this emerging field. This comprehensive mapping not only elucidates the dynamic evolution and interdisciplinary convergence of quantum and evolutionary game theory, but also establishes a foundation for future research, fostering innovative approaches to complex decision-making in increasingly uncertain and interconnected environments.

TI Axion bounds from quantum technology
SO JOURNAL OF HIGH ENERGY PHYSICS
AB A consistent treatment of the quantum field theory of an axion-like particle (ALP) interacting with Standard Model fields requires to account for renormalisation group running and matching to the low-energy theory. Quantum sensor experiments designed to search for very light ALPs are particularly sensitive to these effects because they probe large values of the decay constant for which running effects become important. In addition, while linear axion interactions are set by its pseudoscalar nature, quadratic interactions are indistinguishable from scalar interactions. We show how the Wilson coefficients of linear and quadratic ALP interactions are related, including running effects above and below the QCD scale and provide a comprehensive analysis of the sensitivity of current and future experiments. We identify the reach of different experiments for the case of ALP dark matter and comment on how it could be distinguished from the case where it is not the dark matter. We present novel search strategies to observe quadratic ALP interactions via fifth force searches, haloscopes, helioscopes and quantum sensors. We emphasize the nonlinear behaviour of the ALP field close to the surface of the earth and point out which experimental results are independent on the local background field value.

TI Quantum Circuit Synthesis Using Fuzzy-Logic-Assisted Genetic Algorithms
SO ALGORITHMS
AB Quantum algorithms will likely play a key role in future high-performance-computing (HPC) environments. These algorithms are typically expressed as quantum circuits composed of arbitrary gates or as unitary matrices. Executing these on physical devices, however, requires translation to device-compatible circuits, in a process called quantum compilation or circuit synthesis, since these devices support a limited number of native gates. Moreover, these devices typically have specific qubit topologies, which constrain how and where gates can be applied. Consequently, logical qubits in input circuits and unitaries may need to be mapped to and routed between physical qubits. Furthermore, current Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices present additional constraints. They are vulnerable to errors during gate application and their short decoherence times lead to qubits rapidly succumbing to accumulated noise and possibly corrupting computations. Therefore, circuits synthesized for NISQ devices need to minimize gates and execution times. The problem of synthesizing device-compatible circuits, while optimizing for low gate count and short execution times, can be shown to be computationally intractable using analytical methods. Therefore, interest has grown towards heuristics-based synthesis techniques, which are able to produce approximations of the desired algorithm, while optimizing depth and gate-count. In this work, we investigate using genetic algorithms (GA)-a proven gradient-free optimization technique based on natural selection-for circuit synthesis. In particular, we formulate the quantum synthesis problem as a multi-objective optimization (MOO) problem, with the objectives of minimizing the approximation error, number of multi-qubit gates, and circuit depth. We also employ fuzzy logic for runtime parameter adaptation of GA to enhance search efficiency and solution quality in our proposed method.

TI Holographic renormalization group flow effect on quantum correlations
SO JOURNAL OF HIGH ENERGY PHYSICS
AB We holographically study the finite-size scaling effects on macroscopic and microscopic quantum correlations deformed by excitation and condensation. The excitation (condensation) increases (decreases) the entanglement entropy of the system. We also investigate the two-point correlation function of local operators by calculating the geodesic length connecting two local operators. As opposed to the entanglement entropy case, the excitation (condensation) decreases (increases) the two-point function. This is because the screening effect becomes strong in the background with the large entanglement entropy. We further show that the holographic renormalization leads to the qualitatively same two-point function as the one obtained from the geodesic length.

TI Folded Spectrum VQE: A Quantum Computing Method for the Calculation of
   Molecular Excited States
SO JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL THEORY AND COMPUTATION
AB The recent developments of quantum computing present novel potential pathways for quantum chemistry as the scaling of the computational power of quantum computers could be harnessed to naturally encode and solve electronic structure problems. Theoretically exact quantum algorithms for chemistry have been proposed (e.g., quantum phase estimation), but the limited capabilities of current noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices motivated the development of less demanding hybrid algorithms. In this context, the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) algorithm was successfully introduced as an effective method to compute the ground-state energies of small molecules. This study investigates the folded spectrum (FS) method as an extension of the VQE algorithm for the computation of molecular excited states. It provides the possibility of directly computing excited states around a selected target energy using the same or quantum circuit as for the ground-state calculation. Inspired by the variance-based methods from the quantum Monte Carlo literature, the FS method minimizes the energy variance, thus, in principle, requiring a computationally expensive squared Hamiltonian to be applied. We alleviate this potentially poor scaling by employing a Pauli grouping procedure to identify sets of commuting Pauli strings that can be evaluated simultaneously. This allows for a significant reduction in the computational cost. We applied the FS-VQE method to small molecules (H2, LiH), obtaining all electronic excited states with chemical accuracy on ideal quantum simulators. Furthermore, we explore the application of quantum error mitigation techniques, demonstrating improved energy accuracy on noisy simulators compared with simulations without mitigation.

TI Monogamy of quantum correlations shared in a cavity-freeoptomechanical
   system
SO PHYSICA SCRIPTA
AB In this work, we discuss the monogamy property of quantum correlations (entanglement and steering) distributed in a cavity-free optomechanical system. In a tripartite pure Gaussian state, we verify the hierarchy of the studied quantum correlations. We investigate in detail the CKW-type monogamy inequalities, based on Gaussian R & eacute;nyi-2 entropy entanglement, as well as, Gaussian steering. We quantify genuine tripartite entanglement by using the minimum residual Gaussian entanglement. In addition, we consider the minimum residual Gaussian steering as a quantifier of genuine tripartite steering. Our results indicate that, in the one-mode versus two-mode Gaussian state, the correlations hierarchy was respected; in the considered pure state, the monogamy of entanglement and steering distribution was proven and the studied genuine tripartite correlations have similar time evolution under the same conditions.

CY JUL 15-19, 2024
CL Buenos Aires, ARGENTINA
AB We give a sound and complete equational theory for 3-qubit quantum circuits over the ToffoliHadamard gate set { X , CX , CCX , H } . That is, we introduce a collection of true equations among Toffoli-Hadamard circuits on three qubits that is sufficient to derive any other true equation between such circuits. To obtain this equational theory, we first consider circuits over the Toffoli-K K gate set { X , CX , CCX , K } , where K = H circle times H . The Toffoli-Hadamard and Toffoli-K K gate sets appear similar, but they are crucially different on exactly three qubits. Indeed, in this case, the former generates an infinite group of operators, while the latter generates the finite group of automorphisms of the well-known E 8 lattice. We take advantage of this fact, and of the theory of automorphism groups of lattices, to obtain a sound and complete collection of equations for Toffoli-K K circuits. We then extend this equational theory to one for Toffoli-Hadamard circuits by leveraging prior work of Li et al. on Toffoli-Hadamard operators.

TI Analyzing the impact of quantum computing on IoT security using
   computational based data analytics techniques
SO AIMS MATHEMATICS
AB The Internet of Things (IoT) market is experiencing exponential growth, with projections increasing from 15 billion dollars to an estimated 75 billion dollars by 2025. Quantum computing has emerged as a key enabler for managing the rapid expansion of IoT technology, serving as the foundation for quantum computing support. However, the adoption of quantum computing also introduces numerous privacy and security challenges. We delve into the critical realm of quantum -level security within a typical quantum IoT. To achieve this objective, we identified and precisely analyzed security attributes at various levels integral to quantum computing. A hierarchical tree of quantum computing security attributes was envisioned, providing a structured approach for systematic and efficient security considerations. To assess the impact of security on the quantum-IoT landscape, we employed a unified computational model based on Multi -Criteria Decision -Making (MCDM), incorporating the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) and the Technique for Ordering Preferences by Similarity to Ideal Solutions (TOPSIS) within a fuzzy environment. Fuzzy sets were used to provide practical solutions that can accommodate the nuances of diverse and ambiguous opinions, ultimately yielding precise alternatives and factors. The projected undertaking was poised to empower practitioners in the quantum-IoT realm by aiding in the identification, selection, and prioritization of optimal security factors through the lens of quantum computing.

TI Performance of Teleportation-Based Error-Correction Circuits for Bosonic
   Codes with Noisy Measurements
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Bosonic quantum error-correcting codes offer a viable direction towards reducing the hardware over-head required for fault-tolerant quantum information processing. A broad class of bosonic codes, namely rotation-symmetric codes, can be characterized by their phase-space rotation symmetry. However, their performance has been examined to date only within an idealistic noise model. Here, we further analyze the error-correction capabilities of rotation-symmetric codes using a teleportation-based error-correction circuit. To this end, we numerically compute the average gate fidelity, including measurement errors into the noise model of the data qubit. Focusing on physical measurement models, we assess the performance of heterodyne and adaptive homodyne detection in comparison to the previously studied canonical phase measurement. This setting allows us to shed light on the role of different currently available measurement schemes when decoding the encoded information. We find that with the currently achievable measurement efficiencies in microwave optics, bosonic rotation codes undergo a substantial decrease in their break-even potential. In addition, we perform a detailed analysis of Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) codes using a similar error-correction circuit that allows us to analyze the effect of realistic measurement models on different codes. In comparison to RSB codes, we find for GKP codes an even greater reduction in performance together with a vulnerability to photon-number dephasing. Our results show that highly efficient measurement protocols constitute a crucial building block towards error-corrected quantum information processing with bosonic continuous-variable systems.

TI Mechanically induced correlated errors on superconducting qubits with
   relaxation times exceeding 0.4 ms
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Superconducting qubits are among the most advanced candidates for achieving fault-tolerant quantum computing. Despite recent significant advancements in the qubit lifetimes, the origin of the loss mechanism for state-of-the-art qubits is still subject to investigation. Furthermore, the successful implementation of quantum error correction requires negligible correlated errors between qubits. Here, we realize long-lived superconducting transmon qubits that exhibit fluctuating lifetimes, averaging 0.2 ms and exceeding 0.4 ms - corresponding to quality factors above 5 million and 10 million, respectively. We then investigate their dominant error mechanism. By introducing novel time-resolved error measurements that are synchronized with the operation of the pulse tube cooler in a dilution refrigerator, we find that mechanical vibrations from the pulse tube induce nonequilibrium dynamics in highly coherent qubits, leading to their correlated bit-flip errors. Our findings not only deepen our understanding of the qubit error mechanisms but also provide valuable insights into potential error-mitigation strategies for achieving fault tolerance by decoupling superconducting qubits from their mechanical environments.
   Significant efforts have been dedicated to understanding the mechanisms of decoherence in superconducting qubits. Here, using time-resolved error measurements, the authors link errors present in transmon qubits based on Nb electrodes to mechanical vibrations of a commonly used pulse tube cooler.

SO REPORTS ON PROGRESS IN PHYSICS
AB Strong-laser-field physics is a research direction that relies on the use of high-power lasers and has led to fascinating achievements ranging from relativistic particle acceleration to attosecond science. On the other hand, quantum optics has been built on the use of low photon number sources and has opened the way for groundbreaking discoveries in quantum technology, advancing investigations ranging from fundamental tests of quantum theory to quantum information processing. Despite the tremendous progress, until recently these directions have remained disconnected. This is because the majority of the interactions in the strong-field limit have been successfully described by semi-classical approximations treating the electromagnetic field classically, as there was no need to include the quantum properties of the field to explain the observations. The link between strong-laser-field physics, quantum optics, and quantum information science has been developed in the recent past. Studies based on fully quantized and conditioning approaches have shown that intense laser-matter interactions can be used for the generation of controllable entangled and non-classical light states. These achievements open the way for a vast number of investigations stemming from the symbiosis of strong-laser-field physics, quantum optics, and quantum information science. Here, after an introduction to the fundamentals of these research directions, we report on the recent progress in the fully quantized description of intense laser-matter interaction and the methods that have been developed for the generation of non-classical light states and entangled states. Also, we discuss the future directions of non-classical light engineering using strong laser fields, and the potential applications in ultrafast and quantum information science.

TI Heritage preservation in quantum computing era - reference procedures
SO NPJ HERITAGE SCIENCE
AB Many cultural heritage preservation processes today are linked to digital technology. Not only are traditional artifacts being digitized and stored in digital form, but more and more new artifacts are being created natively in digital form. Once they are in digital form, cryptography is a key means of preserving them. However, due to advances in quantum computing, many of the cryptographic means used today are at risk. And not only cryptographic means, but also advanced architectures such as blockchains, which are increasingly used for the preservation of cultural heritage. Therefore, an analysis that focuses on the preservation of digital and digitized cultural heritage serves as a starting point for deriving appropriate reference procedures considering the aforementioned developments. In order to understand these procedures, one must also be familiar with the associated conceptual changes resulting from the quantum computing paradigm. This will enable the profiles involved to anticipate and implement appropriate solutions when needed. Furthermore, the procedures developed have been experimentally applied to a novel blockchain architecture called Culturae Archivum that focuses on the (trans)national level and is in line with recent efforts towards sustainability in our societies.

TI Optical and microstructural characterization of Er3+ doped
   epitaxial cerium oxide on silicon
SO APL MATERIALS
AB Rare-earth ion dopants in solid-state hosts are ideal candidates for quantum communication technologies, such as quantum memories, due to the intrinsic spin-photon interface of the rare-earth ion combined with the integration methods available in the solid state. Erbium-doped cerium oxide (Er:CeO2) is a particularly promising host material platform for such a quantum memory, as it combines the telecom-wavelength (similar to 1.5 mu m) 4f-4f transition of erbium, a predicted long electron spin coherence time when embedded in CeO2, and a small lattice mismatch with silicon. In this work, we report on the epitaxial growth of Er:CeO2 thin films on silicon using molecular beam epitaxy, with controlled erbium concentration between 2 and 130 parts per million (ppm). We carry out a detailed microstructural study to verify the CeO2 host structure and characterize the spin and optical properties of the embedded Er3+ ions as a function of doping density. In as-grown Er:CeO2 in the 2-3 ppm regime, we identify an EPR linewidth of 245(1) MHz, an optical inhomogeneous linewidth of 9.5(2) GHz, an optical excited state lifetime of 3.5(1) ms, and a spectral diffusion-limited homogeneous linewidth as narrow as 4.8(3) MHz. We test the annealing of Er:CeO2 films up to 900 degrees C, which yields narrowing of the inhomogeneous linewidth by 20% and extension of the excited state lifetime by 40%.

AB ICSC ("Italian Center for SuperComputing") is one of the five Italian National Centres created within the framework of the NextGenerationEU funding by the European Commission. The aim of ICSC, designed and approved through 2022 and eventually started in September 2022, is to create the national digital infrastructure for research and innovation, leveraging existing HPC, HTC and Big Data infrastructures and evolving towards a cloud data-lake model. It will be available to the scientific and industrial communities through flexible and uniform cloud web interfaces and will be relying on a high-level support team; as such, it will form a globally attractive ecosystem based on strategic public-private partnerships to fully exploit top level digital infrastructure for scientific and technical computing and promote the development of new computing technologies. The ICSC IT infrastructure is built upon existing scientific digital infrastructures as provided by the major national players: GARR, the Italian NREN, provides the network infrastructure, whose capacity will be upgraded to multiples of Tbps; CINECA hosts Leonardo, one of the world largest HPC systems, with a power of over 250 Pflops, to be further increased and complemented with a quantum computer; INFN contributes with its distributed Big Data cloud infrastructure, built in the last decades to respond to the needs of the HEP community. On top of the IT infrastructure, several thematic activities will be funded and will focus on the development of tools and applications in several research domains. Of particular relevance to this audience are the activities on "Fundamental Research and Space Economy" and "Astrophysics and Cosmos Observations", strictly aligned with the INFN and HEP core activities. Finally, two technological research activities will foster research on "Future HPC and Big Data" and "Quantum Computing".

TI Improved quantum (t, n) threshold group signature
SO CHINESE PHYSICS B
AB Threshold signature is an important branch of the digital signature scheme, which can distribute signature rights and avoid the abuse of signature rights. With the continuous development of quantum computation and quantum information, quantum threshold signatures are gradually becoming more popular. Recently, a quantum (t, n) threshold group signature scheme was analyzed that uses techniques such as quantum-controlled-not operation and quantum teleportation. However, this scheme cannot resist forgery attack and does not conform to the design of a threshold signature in the signing phase. Based on the original scheme, we propose an improved quantum (t, n) threshold signature scheme using quantum (t, n) threshold secret sharing technology. The analysis proves that the improved scheme can resist forgery attack and collusion attack, and it is undeniable. At the same time, this scheme reduces the level of trust in the arbitrator during the signature phase.

TI Perspective on electromagnetically induced transparency vs Autler-Townes
   splitting
SO AVS QUANTUM SCIENCE
AB Electromagnetically induced transparency and Autler-Townes splitting are two distinct yet related effects. These phenomena are relevant to quantum technologies, including quantum memory, quantum switching, and quantum transduction. Here, the similarities and differences between these phenomena along historical and conceptual lines are discussed and their realizations on various physical platforms including atomic gases, superconducting circuits, and optomechanics are elaborated. In particular, the author clarifies two approaches to assessing which phenomenon is observed based on a black-box approach of modeling the output, given a particular input vs analyzing the underpinning physics. Furthermore, the author highlights the ability to effect a continuous transition between the two seemingly disparate phenomena.

TI Quantifying Qubit Magic Resource with Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill Encoding
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Quantum resource theories are a powerful framework for characterizing and quantifying relevant quantum phenomena and identifying processes that optimize their use for different tasks. Here, we define a resource measure for magic, the sought-after property in most fault-tolerant quantum computers. In contrast to previous literature, our formulation is based on bosonic codes, well-studied tools in continuous-variable quantum computation. Particularly, we use the Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill code to represent multiqubit states and consider the resource theory for the Wigner negativity. Our techniques are useful in finding resource lower bounds for different applications as state conversion and gate synthesis. The analytical expression of our magic measure allows us to extend current analysis limited to small dimensions, easily addressing systems of up to 12 qubits.

TI Tensor ring optimized quantum-enhanced tensor neural networks
SO QUANTUM MACHINE INTELLIGENCE
AB Quantum machine learning researchers often rely on incorporating tensor networks (TN) into deep neural networks (DNN) and variational optimization. However, the standard optimization techniques used for training the contracted trainable weights of each model layer suffer from the correlations and entanglement structure between the model parameters in classical implementations. To address this issue, a multi-layer design of a tensor ring optimized variational quantum learning classifier (Quan-TR) comprising cascading entangling gates replacing the fully connected (dense) layers of a TN is proposed, and it is referred to as tensor ring optimized quantum-enhanced tensor neural networks (TR-QNet). TR-QNet parameters are optimized using the stochastic gradient descent algorithm on qubit measurements. The proposed TR-QNet is evaluated on three distinct datasets, namely Iris, MNIST, and CIFAR-10, to demonstrate the enhanced precision achieved for binary classification. In quantum simulations, the proposed TR-QNet achieves promising precision of 94.5%\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$94.5\%$$\end{document}, 86.16%\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$86.16\%$$\end{document}, and 83.54%\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$83.54\%$$\end{document} on the Iris, MNIST, and CIFAR-10 datasets. Benchmark studies have been conducted on state-of-the-art quantum and classical implementations of TN models to show the efficacy of the proposed TR-QNet. Moreover, the scalability of TR-QNet highlights its potential for exhibiting in deep learning applications on a large scale. The PyTorch implementation of TR-QNet is available on Github https://github.com/konar1987/TR-QNet/.

TI Quantum computing for financial risk measurement
SO QUANTUM INFORMATION PROCESSING
AB Quantum computing allows a significant speed-up over traditional CPU-and GPUbased algorithms when applied to particular mathematical challenges such as optimisation and simulation. Despite promising advances and extensive research in hard-and software developments, currently available quantum systems are still largely limited in their capability. In line with this, practical applications in quantitative finance are still in their infancy. This paper analyses requirements and concrete approaches for the application to risk management in a financial institution. On the examples of Value-at-Risk for market risk and Potential Future Exposure for counterparty credit risk, the main contribution lies in going beyond textbook illustrations and instead exploring must-have model features and their quantum implementations. While conceptual solutions and small-scale circuits are feasible at this stage, the leap needed for real-life applications is still significant. In order to build a usable risk measurement system, the hardware capacity-measured in number of qubits-would need to increase by several magnitudes from their current value of about 102. Quantum noise poses an additional challenge, and research into its control and mitigation would need to advance in order to render risk measurement applications deployable in practice. Overall, given the maturity of established classical simulation-based approaches that allow risk computations in reasonable time and with sufficient accuracy, the business case for a move to quantum solutions is not very strong at this point.

TI Generating Shuttling Procedures for Constrained Silicon Quantum Dot
   Array
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM ENGINEERING
AB In silicon quantum computers, a single electron is trapped in a microstructure called a quantum dot, and its spin is used as a qubit. For large-scale integration of qubits, we previously proposed an approach of sharing a control gate in the row or column of a 2-D quantum dot array. In our array, the shuttling of electrons is a useful technique to operate the target qubit independently and avoid crosstalk. However, since the shuttling is also conducted using shared control gates, the movement of qubits is complexly constrained. We, therefore, propose a formal model based on state transition systems to describe those constraints and operation procedures on the array. We also present an approach to generate operation procedures under the constraints. Utilizing this approach, we present a concrete method for our 16 x 8 quantum dot array. By implementing the proposed method as a quantum compiler, we confirmed that it is possible to generate operation procedures in a practical amount of time for arbitrary quantum circuits. We also demonstrated that crosstalk can be avoided by shuttling and that the fidelity in that case is higher than when crosstalk is not avoided.

TI Complete complementarity relations for quantum correlations in neutrino
   oscillations
SO EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL C
AB We analyze quantum correlations and quantum coherence in neutrino oscillations. To this end, we exploit complete complementarity relations (CCR) that fully characterize the interplay between different correlations encoded in a quantum system both for pure and mixed states. We consider the CCR for neutrino oscillations both in the case of plane-waves (pure state) and of wave packets (mixed state). In this last case we find a complex structure of correlations depending on the mixing angle, and we show the connection with the non local advantage of quantum coherence, a relevant quantifier of coherence.

AB Quantum measurements based on mutually unbiased bases, mutually unbiased measurements and general symmetric informationally complete positive operator valued measurements, which are commonly used in quantum information and quantum computation. In this paper, by a broad class of informationally complete symmetric measurements and correlation matrices, some separability criteria are proposed for different quantum systems that are more robust and comprehensive than the corresponding criteria previously introduced L M Lai, T Li, S M Fei, and Z X Wang, (2018 Quantum Inf. Process., 17, 314); J W Shang, A Asadian, and H J Zhu, (2018 Phys. Rev. A 98, 022309). Furthermore, we extend the separability criteria of tripartite quantum systems to many-body systems. The proposed entanglement criteria may further enrich the relationship between quantum entanglement and measurement.

TI Contextual subspace variational quantum eigensolver calculation of the
   dissociation curve of molecular nitrogen on a superconducting quantum
   computer
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB We present an experimental demonstration of the Contextual Subspace Variational Quantum Eigensolver on superconducting hardware. Calculating the potential energy curve of molecular nitrogen proves challenging for many conventional quantum chemistry techniques, since static correlation dominates in the dissociation limit. Our quantum simulations retain good agreement with the Full Configuration Interaction energy, outperforming all benchmarked single-reference wavefunction techniques in capturing the bond-breaking appropriately. Moreover, our methodology is competitive with multiconfigurational approaches but at a saving of quantum resource, meaning larger active spaces can be treated for a fixed qubit allowance. To achieve this result, we deploy an error mitigation/suppression strategy comprised of Dynamical Decoupling, Measurement-Error Mitigation and Zero-Noise Extrapolation. Circuit parallelization also provides passive noise-averaging and improves the effective shot yield to reduce the measurement overhead. Furthermore, we introduce a modified adaptive ansatz construction algorithm that incorporates hardware awareness into our variational circuits, minimizing the transpilation cost for the target qubit topology.

TI New classifications for quantum bioinformatics: Q-bioinformatics,
   QCt-bioinformatics, QCg-bioinformatics, and QCr-bioinformatics
SO BRIEFINGS IN BIOINFORMATICS
AB Bioinformatics has revolutionized biology and medicine by using computational methods to analyze and interpret biological data. Quantum mechanics has recently emerged as a promising tool for the analysis of biological systems, leading to the development of quantum bioinformatics. This new field employs the principles of quantum mechanics, quantum algorithms, and quantum computing to solve complex problems in molecular biology, drug design, and protein folding. However, the intersection of bioinformatics, biology, and quantum mechanics presents unique challenges. One significant challenge is the possibility of confusion among scientists between quantum bioinformatics and quantum biology, which have similar goals and concepts. Additionally, the diverse calculations in each field make it difficult to establish boundaries and identify purely quantum effects from other factors that may affect biological processes. This review provides an overview of the concepts of quantum biology and quantum mechanics and their intersection in quantum bioinformatics.

TI Minimal qubit representations of Hamiltonians via conserved charges
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB In the last years, we have been witnessing a tremendous push to demonstrate that quantum computers can solve classically intractable problems. This effort, initially focused on the hardware, progressively included the simplification of the models to be simulated. We consider Hamiltonians written in terms of Pauli operators and systematically cut all qubits that are not essential to simulate the system. Our approach is universally applicable and lowers the complexity by first ensuring that the largest possible portion of the Hilbert space becomes irrelevant, and then by finding and exploiting all conserved charges of the system, i.e., symmetries that can be expressed as Pauli operators. Remarkably, both processes are classically efficient and optimal. To showcase our algorithm, we simplify chemical molecules, lattice gauge theories, and the Hubbard and Kitaev models.

TI A tutorial introduction to quantum stochastic master equations based on
   the qubit/photon system
SO ANNUAL REVIEWS IN CONTROL
AB From the key composite quantum system made of a two-level system (qubit) and a harmonic oscillator (photon) with resonant or dispersive interactions, one derives the corresponding quantum Stochastic Master Equations (SME) when either the qubits or the photons are measured. Starting with an elementary discrete-time formulation based on explicit formulae for the interaction propagators, one shows how to include measurement imperfections and decoherence. This qubit/photon quantum system illustrates the Kraus-map structure of general discrete-time SME governing the dynamics of an open quantum system subject to measurement back -action and decoherence induced by the environment. Then, on the qubit/photon system, one explains the passage to a continuous-time mathematical model where the measurement signal is either a continuous real -value signal (typically homodyne or heterodyne signal) or a discontinuous and integer-value signal obtained from a counter. During this derivation, the Kraus map formulation is preserved in an infinitesimal way. Such a derivation provides also an equivalent Kraus-map formulation to the continuous-time SME usually expressed as stochastic differential equations driven either by Wiener or Poisson processes. From such Kraus -map formulation, simple linear numerical integration schemes are derived that preserve the positivity and the trace of the density operator, i.e. of the quantum state.

TI Quantum circuits for measuring weak values, Kirkwood-Dirac
   quasiprobability distributions, and state spectra
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Weak values and Kirkwood-Dirac (KD) quasiprobability distributions have been independently associated with both foundational issues in quantum theory and advantages in quantum metrology. We propose simple quantum circuits to measure weak values, KD distributions, and spectra of density matrices without the need for post-selection. This is achieved by measuring unitary-invariant, relational properties of quantum states, which are functions of Bargmann invariants, the concept that underpins our unified perspective. Our circuits also enable experimental implementation of various functions of KD distributions, such as out-of-time-ordered correlators and the quantum Fisher information in post-selected parameter estimation, among others. An upshot is a unified view of nonclassicality in all those tasks. In particular, we discuss how negativity and imaginarity of Bargmann invariants relate to set coherence.

TI Error-correcting codes for fermionic quantum simulation
SO SCIPOST PHYSICS
AB Utilizing the framework of Z2 lattice gauge theories in the context of Pauli stabilizer codes, we present methodologies for simulating fermions via qubit systems on a twodimensional square lattice. We investigate the symplectic automorphisms of the Pauli module over the Laurent polynomial ring. This enables us to systematically increase the code distances of stabilizer codes while fixing the rate between encoded logical fermions and physical qubits. We identify a family of stabilizer codes suitable for fermion simulation, achieving code distances of d = 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, allowing correction of any L d-1 error. In contrast to the traditional code concatenation approach, our method can increase the code distances without decreasing the (fermionic) code rate. In particular, we explicitly show all stabilizers and logical operators for codes with code distances of d = 3, 4, 5. We provide syndromes for all Pauli errors and invent a syndrome-matching algorithm to compute code distances numerically.

TI Quantum sensing of microwave electric fields based on Rydberg atoms
SO REPORTS ON PROGRESS IN PHYSICS
AB Microwave electric field (MW E-field) sensing is important for a wide range of applications in the areas of remote sensing, radar astronomy and communications. Over the past decade, Rydberg atoms have been used in ultrasensitive, wide broadband, traceable, stealthy MW E-field sensing because of their exaggerated response to MW E-fields, plentiful optional energy levels and integratable preparation methods. This review first introduces the basic concepts of quantum sensing, the properties of Rydberg atoms and the principles of quantum sensing of MW E-fields with Rydberg atoms. An overview of this very active research direction is gradually expanding, covering the progress of sensitivity and bandwidth in Rydberg atom-based microwave sensing, superheterodyne quantum sensing with microwave-dressed Rydberg atoms, quantum-enhanced sensing of MW E-field and recent advanced quantum measurement systems and approaches to further improve the performance of MW E-field sensing. Finally, a brief outlook on future development directions is provided.

TI Private and Robust States for Distributed Quantum Sensing
SO QUANTUM
AB Distributed quantum sensing enables the estimation of multiple parameters encoded in spatially separated probes. While traditional quantum sensing is often focused on estimating a single parameter with maximum precision, distributed quantum sensing seeks to estimate some function of multiple parameters that are only locally accessible for each party involved. In such settings, it is natural to not want to give away more information than is necessary. To address this, we use the concept of privacy with respect to a function, ensuring that only information about the target function is available to all the parties, and no other information. We define a measure of privacy (essentially how close we are to this condition being satisfied) and show it satisfies a set of naturally desirable properties of such a measure. Using this privacy measure, we identify and construct entangled resource states that ensure privacy for a given function under different resource distributions and encoding dynamics, characterized by Hamiltonian evolution. For separable and parallel Hamiltonians, we prove that the GHZ state is the only private state for certain linear functions, with the minimum amount of required resources, up to SLOCC. Recognizing the vulnerability of this state to particle loss, we create families of private states, that remain robust even against loss of qubits, by incorporating additional resources. We then extend our findings to different resource distribution scenarios and Hamiltonians, resulting in a comprehensive set of private and robust states for distributed quantum estimation. These results advance the understanding of privacy and robustness in multi-parameter quantum sensing.

TI Intrusion Detection Quantum Sensor Networks
SO SENSORS
AB This paper proposes a perimeter detection scheme based on the quantum physical properties of photons. Existing perimeter intrusion detection schemes, if using light, rely on the classical properties of light only. Our quantum sensor network uses the quantum property of spatial superposition of photons, meaning that a photon can simultaneously follow two different paths after going through a beam splitter. Using multiple Mach-Zehnder interferometers, an entire web of paths can be generated, such that one single photon occupies them all. If an intruder violates this web in some arbitrary point, the entire photon superposition is destroyed, the photon does not self-interfere any more and this event is detected by measurements. For one single photon, the intruder detection probability is limited theoretically but can be increased arbitrarily with the usage of a sequence of photons. We show both theoretical bounds as well as practical results of the proposed schemes. The practical results are obtained by simulation experiments on IBM Quantum platforms. The benefits of our quantum approach are: low power, invisibility to potential intruders, scalability and easy practical implementation.

TI Orbit design of satellite quantum key distribution constellations in
   different ground stations networks
SO ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
AB In the field of Cryptography, Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) is an application of Quantum Information theory that obtained a great deal of attention in recent years. It allows to establish secret keys between two or more parties, in a much safer way than that implemented by classic cryptography (based on discrete logarithms and factorization of prime numbers). The most promising way of realizing a QKD network (especially over great distances) in the near future is by a constellation of satellites. This paper considers the problem of optimizing the orbits of the satellites in order to maximize the minimum key length shared in a network of ground stations over a fixed amount of time. Different networks of stations are considered and the influence of their geographical disposition on the design and the performance index is highlighted. The networks considered are: a global constellation, a regional European constellation, and two in which there are groups of stations in two different narrow bands of latitude. The effect of Inter-satellite links is then taken into account and how, in some cases, they can improve the performances. Finally the daily performance of the considered constellations are analyzed.

TI Kernel based quantum machine learning at record rate: Many-body
   distribution functionals as compact representations
SO JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS
AB The feature vector mapping used to represent chemical systems is a key factor governing the superior data efficiency of kernel based quantum machine learning (QML) models applicable throughout chemical compound space. Unfortunately, the most accurate representations require a high dimensional feature mapping, thereby imposing a considerable computational burden on model training and use. We introduce compact yet accurate, linear scaling QML representations based on atomic Gaussian many-body distribution functionals (MBDF) and their derivatives. Weighted density functions of MBDF values are used as global representations that are constant in size, i.e., invariant with respect to the number of atoms. We report predictive performance and training data efficiency that is competitive with state-of-the-art for two diverse datasets of organic molecules, QM9 and QMugs. Generalization capability has been investigated for atomization energies, highest occupied molecular orbital-lowest unoccupied molecular orbital eigenvalues and gap, internal energies at 0 K, zero point vibrational energies, dipole moment norm, static isotropic polarizability, and heat capacity as encoded in QM9. MBDF based QM9 performance lowers the optimal Pareto front spanned between sampling and training cost to compute node minutes, effectively sampling chemical compound space with chemical accuracy at a sampling rate of similar to 48 molecules per core second.

The nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center, a crystal defect in diamond, has become a unique object for microwave sensing applications due to its excellent stability, long spin coherence time, and optical properties at ambient condition. In this work, we use diamond NV center as atomic receiver to demodulate on-off keying (OOK) signal transmitted in broad frequency range (2 GHz-14 GHz in a portable benchtop setup). We proposed a unique algorithm of voltage discrimination and demonstrated audio signal transceiving with fidelity above 99%. This diamond receiver is attached to the end of a tapered fiber, having all optic nature, which will find important applications in data transmission tasks under extreme conditions such as strong electromagnetic interference, high temperatures, and high corrosion.

TI Weight-Reduced Stabilizer Codes with Lower Overhead
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Stabilizer codes are the most widely studied class of quantum error-correcting codes and form the basis of most proposals for a fault-tolerant quantum computer. A stabilizer code is defined by a set of parity- check operators, which are measured in order to infer information about errors that may have occurred. In typical settings, measuring these operators is itself a noisy process and the noise strength scales with the number of qubits involved in a given parity check, or its weight. Hastings has proposed a method for reducing the weights of the parity checks of a stabilizer code, though it has previously only been studied in the asymptotic regime. Here, we instead focus on the regime of small to medium-size codes suitable for quantum computing hardware. We both provide a fully explicit description of Hastings's method and propose a substantially simplified weight-reduction method that is applicable to the class of quantum product codes. Our simplified method allows us to reduce the check weights of hypergraph- and lifted- product codes to at most six, while preserving the number of logical qubits and at least retaining (in fact, often increasing) the code distance. The price we pay is an increase in the number of physical qubits by a constant factor but we find that our method is much more efficient than Hastings's method in this regard. We benchmark the performance of our codes on a simulated photonic quantum computing architecture based on Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill qubits and passive linear optics, finding that our weight-reduction method substantially improves code performance.

TI A New Approach for Optimization of Distributed Quantum Circuits
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF THEORETICAL PHYSICS
AB In the present work, a novel approach was proposed to optimize the teleportation cost in Distributed Quantum Circuits (DQCs) by applying a new approach. To overcome the difficulty with keeping a large number of qubits next to each other, DQCs, as a well-known solution, have always been employed. In a distributed quantum system, qubits are transferred from a subsystem to another subsystem by a quantum protocol such as teleportation. First, we proposed a heuristic approach through which we could replace the equivalent circuits in the initial quantum circuit. Then, we used a genetic algorithm to partition the placement of qubits so that the number of teleportations could be optimized for the communications of a DQC. Finally, results showed that the proposed approach could impressively work.

The problem is as follows: for a finite group G and a finite set X, given a function f : G -> X and the promise that for any g(1), g(2) is an element of G, f (g(1)) = f (g(2)) iff g(1)H = g(2)H for a subgroup H <= G, the goal of the decision version is to determine whether H is trivial, and the goal of the search version is to find H. Nayak (2021) asked whether there exist deterministic algorithms with O root vertical bar G vertical bar/vertical bar H vertical bar) query complexity for HSP. We answer this problem for Abelian groups, which also extends the main results of Ye et al. (2021), since here the algorithms do not rely on any prior knowledge of H. (c) 2022 Elsevier Inc.

TI Automated machine learning for secure key rate in discrete-modulated
   continuous-variable quantum key distribution
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Continuous-variable quantum key distribution (CV QKD) with discrete modulation has attracted increasing attention due to its experimental simplicity, lower-cost implementation and compatibility with classical optical communication. Correspondingly, some novel numerical methods have been proposed to analyze the security of these protocols against collective attacks, which promotes key rates over one hundred kilometers of fiber distance. However, numerical methods are limited by their calculation time and resource consumption, for which they cannot play more roles on mobile platforms in quantum networks. To improve this issue, a neural network model predicting key rates in nearly real time has been proposed previously. Here, we go further and show a neural network model combined with Bayesian optimization. This model automatically designs the best architecture of neural network computing key rates in real time. We demonstrate our model with two variants of CV QKD protocols with quaternary modulation. The results show high reliability with secure probability as high as 99.15% - 99.59%, considerable tightness and high efficiency with speedup of approximately 10(7) in both cases. This inspiring model enables the real-time computation of unstructured quantum key distribution protocols' key rate more automatically and efficiently, which has met the growing needs of implementing QKD protocols on moving platforms.

TI Sub-quantum Fisher information
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB The quantum Fisher information (QFI) plays a crucial role in quantum information theory and in many practical applications such as quantum metrology. However, computing the QFI is generally a computationally demanding task. In this work we analyze a lower bound on the QFI which we call the sub-quantum Fisher information (sub-QFI). The bound can be efficiently estimated on a quantum computer for an n-qubit state using 2n qubits. The sub-QFI is based on the super-fidelity, an upper bound on Uhlmann's fidelity. We analyze the sub-QFI in the context of unitary families, where we derive several crucial properties including its geometrical interpretation. In particular, we prove that the QFI and the sub-QFI are maximized for the same optimal state, which implies that the sub-QFI is faithful to the QFI in the sense that both quantities share the same global extrema. Based on this faithfulness, the sub-QFI acts as an efficiently computable surrogate for the QFI for quantum sensing and quantum metrology applications. Finally, we provide additional meaning to the sub-QFI as a measure of coherence, asymmetry, and purity loss.

TI Limitations of optimization algorithms on noisy quantum devices
SO NATURE PHYSICS
AB Recent successes in producing intermediate-scale quantum devices have focused interest on establishing whether near-term devices could outperform classical computers for practical applications. A central question is whether noise can be overcome in the absence of quantum error correction or if it fundamentally restricts any potential quantum advantage. We present a transparent way of comparing classical and quantum algorithms running on noisy devices for a large family of tasks that includes optimization and variational eigenstate solving. Our approach is based on entropic inequalities that determine how fast the quantum state converges to the fixed point of the noise model, together with established classical methods of Gibbs state simulation. Our techniques are extremely versatile and so may be applied to a large variety of algorithms, noise models and quantum computing architectures. We use our result to provide estimates for problems within reach of current experiments, such as quantum annealers or variational quantum algorithms. The bounds we obtain indicate that substantial quantum advantages are unlikely for classical optimization unless noise rates are decreased by orders of magnitude or the topology of the problem matches that of the device. This is the case even if the number of available qubits increases substantially.
   Current quantum computers do not have error correction, which means noise may prevent them outperforming classical devices in useful tasks. An analysis of quantum optimization shows that current noise levels are too high to produce a quantum advantage.

TI Quantum simulation of bosons with the contracted quantum eigensolver
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB Quantum computers are promising tools for simulating many-body quantum systems due to their potential scaling advantage over classical computers. While significant effort has been expended on many-fermion systems, here we simulate a model entangled many-boson system with the contracted quantum eigensolver (CQE). We generalize the CQE to many-boson systems by encoding the bosonic wavefunction on qubits. The CQE provides a compact ansatz for the bosonic wave function whose gradient is proportional to the residual of a contracted Schrodinger equation. We apply the CQE to a bosonic system, where N quantum harmonic oscillators are coupled through a pairwise quadratic repulsion. The model is relevant to the study of coupled vibrations in molecular systems on quantum devices. Results demonstrate the potential efficiency of the CQE in simulating bosonic processes such as molecular vibrations with good accuracy and convergence even in the presence of noise.

TI Long-distance photon-mediated and short-distance entangling gates in
   three-qubit quantum dot spin systems
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Superconducting resonator couplers will likely become an essential component in modular semiconductor quantum dot (QD) spin qubit processors, as they help alleviate crosstalk and wiring issues as the number of qubits increases. Here, we focus on a three-qubit system composed of two modules: a two-electron triple QD resonator coupled to a single-electron double QD. Using a combination of analytical techniques and numerical results, we derive an effective Hamiltonian that describes the three-qubit logical subspace and show that it accurately captures the dynamics of the system. We examine the performance of short-range and long-range entangling gates, revealing the effect of a spectator qubit in reducing the gate fidelities in both cases. We further study the competition between nonadiabatic errors and spectator-associated errors in short-range operations and quantify their relative importance across practical parameter ranges for short and long gate times. We also analyze the impact of charge noise together with residual coupling to the spectator qubit on intermodule entangling gates and find that for current experimental settings, leakage errors are the main source of infidelities in these operations. Our results help pave the way toward identifying optimal modular QD architectures for quantum information processing on semiconductor chips.

TI Modeling and designing a robotic swarm: A quantum computing approach
SO SWARM AND EVOLUTIONARY COMPUTATION
AB Nature is a neverending source of inspiration for technology. Quantum physics suggests applications to-ward quantum computing. Swarms' self-organization leads to robotic swarm developments. Here, quantum computing is applied to swarm robotics. We model local interactions with a quantum circuit, testing it on simulators and quantum computers. To relate local with global behavior, we develop a block matrix-based model. Diagonal sub-matrices contain information on single robots; off-diagonal sub-matrices are the pairwise interaction terms. Comparing different swarms means comparing different block matrices. Choosing initial values and computation rules for off-diagonal blocks (with a particular logic gate), different behaviors can be modeled. To show the global-behavior emergence, we propose a specific pairwise-interaction logic gate, embedding the corresponding quantum circuit in an ant-foraging-inspired algorithm. To implement a first application, we choose the foraging-ant behavior for its clarity and importance in nature, running experiments with toy swarms (3 and 10 robots). We consider ants' individual and collective back-and-forth movements between the nest and the food source, analyzing the effect of entanglement. Our research can help shed light on quantum potentialities for swarms. The implications of our findings and results concern the future development of a decision-making system, based on the advantages of swarms and quantum computing. While an ant-foraging scenario is chosen as an example of application, our study is not focused on optimization. We present a new methodology, open to non-optimal solutions. Future developments can concern improvements toward optimization.

TI Strategic Portfolio Optimization Using Simulated, Digital, and Quantum
   Annealing
SO APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
AB In this work, we introduce a new workflow to solve portfolio optimization problems on annealing platforms. We combine a classical preprocessing step with a modified unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) model and evaluate it using simulated annealing (classical computer), digital annealing (Fujitsu's Digital Annealing Unit), and quantum annealing (D-Wave Advantage). Starting from Markowitz's theory on portfolio optimization, our classical preprocessing step finds the most promising assets within a set of possible assets to choose from. We then modify existing QUBO models for portfolio optimization, such that there are no limitations on the number of assets that can be invested in. Furthermore, our QUBO model enables an investor to also place an arbitrary amount of money into each asset. We apply this modified QUBO to the set of promising asset candidates we generated previously via classical preprocessing. A solution to our QUBO model contains information about what percentage of the whole available capital should be invested into which asset. For the evaluation, we have used publicly available real-world data sets of stocks of the New York Stock Exchange as well as common ETFs. Finally, we have compared the respective annealing results with randomly generated portfolios by using the return, variance, and diversification of the created portfolios as measures. The results show that our QUBO formulation is capable of creating well-diversified portfolios that respect certain criteria given by an investor, such as maximizing return, minimizing risk, or sticking to a certain budget.

TI Enhanced Quantum State Transfer via Feedforward Cancellation of Optical
   Phase Noise
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Many experimental platforms for quantum science depend on state control via laser fields. Frequently, however, the control fidelity is limited by optical phase noise. This is exacerbated in stabilized laser systems where high-frequency phase noise is an unavoidable consequence of feedback. Here we implement an optical feedforward technique to suppress laser phase noise in the stimulated Raman adiabatic passage state transfer of ultracold RbCs molecules, across 114 THz, from a weakly bound Feshbach state to the rovibrational ground state. By performing over 100 state transfers on single molecules, we measure a significantly enhanced transfer efficiency of 98.7(1)% limited only by available laser intensity.

TI Spin-Echo Silencing Using a Current-Biased Frequency-Tunable Resonator
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB The ability to control microwave emission from a spin ensemble is a requirement of several quantum memory protocols. Here, we demonstrate such ability by using a resonator whose frequency can be rapidly tuned with a bias current. We store excitations in an ensemble of rare-earth ions and suppress on demand the echo emission ("echo silencing") by two methods: (1) detuning the resonator during the spin rephasing, and (2) subjecting spins to magnetic field gradients generated by the bias current itself. We also show that spin coherence is preserved during silencing.

TI Missed Detection of Entanglement in Two-Mode Squeezed States Based on
   the Inseparability Criterion
SO APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
AB The inseparability criterion provides a straightforward and efficient method for identifying and quantifying two-mode Gaussian quantum entanglement, making it a crucial tool in quantum optics experiments. However, it is crucial to recognize that the inseparability criterion serves only as a sufficient condition for entanglement assessment, thereby posing a risk of missed detection during evaluation. This paper investigates the use of the inseparability criterion in assessing two-mode squeezed states, with a particular focus on examining missed entanglement detection due to entanglement asymmetry. The results show that when decoherence symmetrically affects both modes, the inseparability criterion effectively detects entanglement. In contrast, when this symmetry is broken, the criterion may fail to identify entanglement, with the likelihood of missed detection increasing with increasing asymmetry. By comparing these results with the positive partial transpose criterion, which serves as a necessary and sufficient condition, the occurrence of missed detections by the inseparability criterion is confirmed. Our research not only provides valuable insights into the application of the inseparability criterion in quantum information tasks but also deepens the understanding of its operational principles and limitations.

TI Recent developments of quantum sensing under pressurized environment
   using the nitrogen vacancy (NV) center in diamond
SO JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS
AB Pressure has been established as a powerful way of tuning material properties and studying various exotic quantum phases. Nonetheless, measurements under pressure are no trivial matter. To ensure a stable pressure environment, several experimental restrictions must be imposed including the limited size of a sample chamber. These have created difficulties in assembling high-pressure devices and conducting measurements. Hence, novel sensing methods that are robust and compatible with high-pressure devices under pressure are highly in demand. In this review, we discuss the nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond as a versatile quantum sensor under pressure. The excellent sensitivity and superior resolution of the NV center enable exciting developments in recent years. The NV center has great potential in sensing under pressure, especially beneficial to magnetic-related measurements.

TI Probing quantum information propagation with out-of-time-ordered
   correlators
SO NATURE PHYSICS
AB The complexity of many-body quantum states makes their evolution difficult to simulate with classical computers. Experiments on a 2D nine-qubit device demonstrate that the key properties of quantum lattices can be accessed by measuring out-of-time-ordered correlators.
   Interacting many-body quantum systems show a rich array of physical phenomena and dynamical properties, but are notoriously difficult to study: they are analytically challenging and exponentially hard to simulate on classical computers. Small-scale quantum information processors hold the promise to efficiently emulate these systems, but characterizing their dynamics is experimentally difficult, requiring probes beyond simple correlation functions and multi-body tomographic methods. Here we demonstrate the measurement of out-of-time-ordered correlators-one of the most effective tools for studying quantum system evolution and processes like quantum thermalization. We implement a 3 x 3 two-dimensional hard-core Bose-Hubbard lattice with a superconducting circuit, study its time reversibility by performing a Loschmidt echo, and measure out-of-time-ordered correlators that enable us to observe the propagation of quantum information. A central requirement for our experiments is the ability to coherently reverse time evolution, which was achieved with a digital-analogue simulation scheme. In the presence of frequency disorder, we observe that localization can partially be overcome with more particles present-a possible signature of many-body localization in two dimensions.

TI Quantum entanglement distribution via uplink satellite channels
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Significant work has been done to develop quantum satellites, which generate entangled pairs in space and distribute them to ground stations separated some distance away. The reverse "uplink" case, where pairs are generated on the ground and swapped on the satellite using an optical Bell measurement, has not been seriously considered due to a prevailing assumption that it is practically infeasible. In this paper, we illustrate the feasibility of performing Discrete Variable photonic Bell measurements in space by conducting a detailed numerical analysis to estimate the channel efficiency and attainable pair fidelity for various satellite-station configurations. Our model accounts for a wide range of physical effects such as atmospheric effects, stray photons, and mode mismatch. Our findings show promise toward the feasibility of photonic Bell measurements in space, which motivates future research toward large-scale satellite-based uplink entanglement distribution.

TI Ergodic theory of diagonal orthogonal covariant quantum channels
SO LETTERS IN MATHEMATICAL PHYSICS
AB We analyse the ergodic properties of quantum channels that are covariant with respect to diagonal orthogonal transformations. We prove that the ergodic behaviour of a channel in this class is essentially governed by a classical stochastic matrix. This allows us to exploit tools from classical ergodic theory to study quantum ergodicity of such channels. As an application of our analysis, we study dual unitary brickwork circuits which have recently been proposed as minimal models of quantum chaos in many-body systems. Upon imposing a local diagonal orthogonal invariance symmetry on these circuits, the long-term behaviour of spatio-temporal correlations between local observables in such circuits is completely determined by the ergodic properties of a channel that is covariant under diagonal orthogonal transformations. We utilize this fact to show that such symmetric dual unitary circuits exhibit a rich variety of ergodic behaviours, thus emphasizing their importance.

TI Quantum Biology Research Meets Pathophysiology and Therapeutic
   Mechanisms: A Biomedical Perspective
SO QUANTUM REPORTS
AB The recent advances of quantum biology suggest a potential role in biomedical research. Studies related to electromagnetic fields, proton pumping in mitochondrial respiratory chain, quantum theory of T-cell receptor (TCR)-degeneracy, theories on biophotons, pyrophosphates or tubulin as possible carriers for neural information, and quantum properties of ions and protons, might be useful for understanding mechanisms of some serious immune, cardiovascular, and neural pathologies for which classic biomedical research, based on biochemical approach, is struggling to find new therapeutic strategies. A breakthrough in medical knowledge is therefore needed in order to improve the understanding of the complex interactions among various systems and organs typical of such pathologies. In particular, problems related to immune system over-activation, to the role of autonomic nervous system (ANS) dysfunction in the obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) syndrome, to the clinical consequences of ion channels dysfunction and inherited cardiac diseases, could benefit from the new perspective provided by quantum biology advancement. Overall, quantum biology might provide a promising biophysical theoretic system, on which to base pathophysiology understanding and hopefully therapeutic strategies. With the present work, authors hope to open a constructive and multidisciplinary debate on this important topic.

TI Toward a Photonic Demonstration of Device-Independent Quantum Key
   Distribution
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB The security of quantum key distribution (QKD) usually relies on that the users' devices are well characterized according to the security models made in the security proofs. In contrast, device-independent QKD-an entanglement-based protocol-permits the security even without any knowledge of the underlying quantum devices. Despite its beauty in theory, device-independent QKD is elusive to realize with current technologies. Especially in photonic implementations, the requirements for detection efficiency are far beyond the performance of any reported device-independent experiments. In this Letter, we report a proof-of-principle experiment of device-independent QKD based on a photonic setup in the asymptotic limit. On the theoretical side, we enhance the loss tolerance for real device imperfections by combining different approaches, namely, random postselection, noisy preprocessing, and developed numerical methods to estimate the key rate via the von Neumann entropy. On the experimental side, we develop a high-quality polarization-entangled photon source achieving a state-of-the-art (heralded) detection efficiency about 87.5%. Although our experiment does not include random basis switching, the achieved efficiency outperforms previous photonic experiments involving loophole-free Bell tests. Together, we show that the measured quantum correlations are strong enough to ensure a positive key rate under the fiber length up to 220 m. Our photonic platform can generate entangled photons at a high rate and in the telecom wavelength, which is desirable for high-speed generation over long distances. The results present an important step toward a full demonstration of photonic device-independent QKD.

TI Hidden Tensor Structures
SO ENTROPY
AB Any single system whose space of states is given by a separable Hilbert space is automatically equipped with infinitely many hidden tensor-like structures. This includes all quantum mechanical systems as well as classical field theories and classical signal analysis. Accordingly, systems as simple as a single one-dimensional harmonic oscillator, an infinite potential well, or a classical finite-amplitude signal of finite duration can be decomposed into an arbitrary number of subsystems. The resulting structure is rich enough to enable quantum computation, violation of Bell's inequalities, and formulation of universal quantum gates. Less standard quantum applications involve a distinction between position and hidden position. The hidden position can be accompanied by a hidden spin, even if the particle is spinless. Hidden degrees of freedom are, in many respects, analogous to modular variables. Moreover, it is shown that these hidden structures are at the roots of some well-known theoretical constructions, such as the Brandt-Greenberg multi-boson representation of creation-annihilation operators, intensively investigated in the context of higher-order or fractional-order squeezing. In the context of classical signal analysis, the discussed structures explain why it is possible to emulate a quantum computer by classical analog circuit devices.

TI Quantum error channels in high energetic photonic systems
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB In medical applications-such as positron emission tomography (PET)-511 keV photons that experience Compton scattering are studied. We present a consistent framework based on quantum error-correction channels-intensively studied in quantum computing-to fully describe the quantum information-theoretic content of high energetic photons undergoing Compton scattering, characterized by the Klein-Nishina formula in unoriented matter. In this way, we can predict the expected spatial distribution of two or more, pure or mixed, polarization entangled or separable photons. This framework allows us to characterize the accessible and inaccessible information for different parameter ranges. It also answers the question of how to describe successive multi-photon scattering. In addition our formalism provides a complete framework for dealing with single and all multi-partite errors that can occur in the propagation, providing the basis for modeling future dedicated experiments that will then have applications in medicine, such as reducing errors in PET imaging or exploring possibilities for quantum-based diagnostic indicators.

TI Upper bound on device-independent quantum key distribution with two way
   classical postprocessing under individual attack
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB Device-independent quantum key distribution (DI-QKD) can guarantee the security even with untrusted devices. Unfortunately, conventional DI-QKD protocols can tolerate low noises only and require high detection efficiencies to achieve positive key rates. To improve the noise robustness, one promising solution is implementing the two-way classical postprocessing, which has the advantage of reducing the bit errors. In this paper, we study the DI-QKD with B-step two-way classical postprocessing under individual attacks. We adopt the tool of convex combination attack, i.e. an optimal individual attack, to upper bound the Devetak-Winter key rate. We show that, by using the B-step procedure, our protocol can tolerate detection efficiencies as low as 81.0% and depolarising noise of 0.799, which is better than the thresholds for the protocol with one-way error correction. This result can serve as the lower bounds on the critical noise and detection efficiency for the scenarios under general attacks. Our work justifies the advantage of two-way classical postprocessing for DI-QKD, thus offering a step towards its applications.

TI Detecting Quantum Critical Points of Correlated Systems by Quantum
   Convolutional Neural Network Using Data from Variational Quantum
   Eigensolver
SO QUANTUM REPORTS
AB Machine learning has been applied to a wide variety of models, from classical statistical mechanics to quantum strongly correlated systems, for classifying phase transitions. The recently proposed quantum convolutional neural network (QCNN) provides a new framework for using quantum circuits instead of classical neural networks as the backbone of classification methods. We present the results from training the QCNN by the wavefunctions of the variational quantum eigensolver for the one-dimensional transverse field Ising model (TFIM). We demonstrate that the QCNN identifies wavefunctions corresponding to the paramagnetic and ferromagnetic phases of the TFIM with reasonable accuracy. The QCNN can be trained to predict the corresponding 'phase' of wavefunctions around the putative quantum critical point even though it is trained by wavefunctions far away. The paper provides a basis for exploiting the QCNN to identify the quantum critical point.

TI Investigating the effect of circuit cutting in QAOA for the MaxCut
   problem on NISQ devices
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices are restricted by their limited number of qubits and their short decoherence times. An approach addressing these problems is quantum circuit cutting. It decomposes the execution of a large quantum circuit into the execution of multiple smaller quantum circuits with additional classical postprocessing. Since these smaller quantum circuits require fewer qubits and gates, they are more suitable for NISQ devices. To investigate the effect of quantum circuit cutting in a quantum algorithm targeting NISQ devices, we design two experiments using the quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) for the Maximum Cut (MaxCut) problem and conduct them on state-of-the-art superconducting devices. Our first experiment studies the influence of circuit cutting on the objective function of QAOA, and the second evaluates the quality of results obtained by the whole algorithm with circuit cutting. The results show that circuit cutting can reduce the effects of noise in QAOA, and therefore, the algorithm yields better solutions on NISQ devices.

TI Preparation of Matrix Product States with Log-Depth Quantum Circuits
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB We consider the preparation of matrix product states (MPS) on quantum devices via quantum circuits of local gates. We first prove that faithfully preparing translation-invariant normal MPS of N sites requires a circuit depth T = Omega(log N). We then introduce an algorithm based on the renormalization-group transformation to prepare normal MPS with an error epsilon in depth T = O[log(N/epsilon)], which is optimal. We also show that measurement and feedback leads to an exponential speedup of the algorithm to T = O[log log(N/epsilon)]. Measurements also allow one to prepare arbitrary translation-invariant MPS, including long-range non-normal ones, in the same depth. Finally, the algorithm naturally extends to inhomogeneous MPS.

TI Jordan products of quantum channels and their compatibility
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Given two quantum channels, we examine the task of determining whether they are compatible-meaning that one can perform both channels simultaneously but, in the future, choose exactly one channel whose output is desired (while forfeiting the output of the other channel). Here, we present several results concerning this task. First, we show it is equivalent to the quantum state marginal problem, i.e., every quantum state marginal problem can be recast as the compatibility of two channels, and vice versa. Second, we show that compatible measure-and-prepare channels (i.e., entanglement-breaking channels) do not necessarily have a measure-and-prepare compatibilizing channel. Third, we extend the notion of the Jordan product of matrices to quantum channels and present sufficient conditions for channel compatibility. These Jordan products and their generalizations might be of independent interest. Last, we formulate the different notions of compatibility as semidefinite programs and numerically test when families of partially dephasing-depolarizing channels are compatible.

TI A Symmetric Extensible Protocol for Quantum Secret Sharing
SO SYMMETRY-BASEL
AB This paper introduces the Symmetric Extensible Quantum Secret Sharing protocol, a novel quantum protocol for secret sharing. At its heart, it is an entanglement-based protocol that relies on the use of maximally entangled GHZ tuples, evenly distributed among the players, endowing the spymaster with the ability to securely share a secret message with the agents. Its security stems from the fact that it is highly improbable for a malicious eavesdropper or a rogue double agent to disrupt its successful execution. It is characterized by symmetry, since all agents are treated indiscriminately, utilizing identical quantum circuits. Furthermore, it can be seamlessly extended to an arbitrary number of agents. Finally, after the completion of the quantum part of the protocol, the spymaster will have to publicly transmit some information, in order to allow the agents to unlock the secret message. This part of the protocol can be considered as an additional advantage, due to the fact that it gives the spymaster the privilege of deciding if, or when, it is the right time for the agents to unlock the secret message, after the completion of the quantum part of the protocol.

TI Renyi Entropies of Multidimensional Oscillator and Hydrogenic Systems
   with Applications to Highly Excited Rydberg States
SO ENTROPY
AB The various facets of the internal disorder of quantum systems can be described by means of the Renyi entropies of their single-particle probability density according to modern density functional theory and quantum information techniques. In this work, we first show the lower and upper bounds for the Renyi entropies of general and central-potential quantum systems, as well as the associated entropic uncertainty relations. Then, the Renyi entropies of multidimensional oscillator and hydrogenic-like systems are reviewed and explicitly determined for all bound stationary position and momentum states from first principles (i.e., in terms of the potential strength, the space dimensionality and the states's hyperquantum numbers). This is possible because the associated wavefunctions can be expressed by means of hypergeometric orthogonal polynomials. Emphasis is placed on the most extreme, non-trivial cases corresponding to the highly excited Rydberg states, where the Renyi entropies can be amazingly obtained in a simple, compact, and transparent form. Powerful asymptotic approaches of approximation theory have been used when the polynomial's degree or the weight-function parameter(s) of the Hermite, Laguerre, and Gegenbauer polynomials have large values. At present, these special states are being shown of increasing potential interest in quantum information and the associated quantum technologies, such as e.g., quantum key distribution, quantum computation, and quantum metrology.

TI Direct observation of deterministic macroscopic entanglement
SO SCIENCE
AB Quantum entanglement of mechanical systems emerges when distinct objects move with such a high degree of correlation that they can no longer be described separately. Although quantum mechanics presumably applies to objects of all sizes, directly observing entanglement becomes challenging as masses increase, requiring measurement and control with a vanishingly small error. Here, using pulsed electromechanics, we deterministically entangle two mechanical drumheads with masses of 70 picograms. Through nearly quantum-limited measurements of the position and momentum quadratures of both drums, we perform quantum state tomography and thereby directly observe entanglement. Such entangled macroscopic systems are poised to serve in fundamental tests of quantum mechanics, enable sensing beyond the standard quantum limit, and function as long-lived nodes of future quantum networks.

TI Auditing the 'Social' of Quantum Technologies: A Scoping Review
SO SOCIETIES
AB Various phrases such as "social implications", social impact" and "ethical, legal and social implications" are used to indicate the impact of a given scientific or technological advancements on the 'social'. The impact on the 'social' is one focus of science and technology governance discussions. Many terms and phrases can be used to audit the engagement of a given technology (such as quantum technologies) with the 'social'. Marginalized groups are particularly impacted by the 'social'. Equity, Diversity, and, Inclusion (EDI) and similar phrases are part of discussing the 'social'. EDI frameworks and phrases are employed as policy concepts to decrease the research, education, and general workplace problems members of marginalized groups such as women, Indigenous peoples, visible/racialized minorities, disabled people, and LGBTQ2S+ encounter at universities and other workplaces. How quantum technologies-focused discussions engage with the 'social' can impact EDI activities, and quantum technologies-focused discussions can be impacted in turn by EDI activities. The objective of this study was to map the engagement with the 'social' in the quantum technologies-focused academic literature. A scoping review coupled with a manifest coding approach was used to answer three research questions: (1) Which terms, phrases, and measures that can be seen to cover aspects of the 'social' are present in the quantum technologies-focused academic literature? (2) To what extent are EDI frameworks and phrases present in the quantum technologies-focused academic literature? (3) Which marginalized groups visible in EDI discourses are covered in the quantum technologies-focused academic literature? Using the academic databases SCOPUS, EBSCO-HOST, Web of Science, Compendex, Inspec Archive, and Knovel, 362,728 English language abstracts were obtained for the manifest coding using 62 Quantum-related technical phrases and 1062 English language abstracts were obtained using 17 non-technical Quantum-related phrases. Within the 362,728 abstracts of the 200 terms and phrases (which did not have to contain the term "social") used to answer the research questions, 87 were not mentioned in any abstracts, 47 were mentioned in less than 10, 30 were mentioned in between 10 and 100, and 29 were mentioned in over 100 abstracts. Within the 1062 abstracts, 164 terms and phrases were not mentioned at all, 19 were mentioned in over 10, 8 were mentioned in between 10 and 100 (all false positive), and one was mentioned in over 100 abstracts (false positive). The term "social" or phrases containing "social" appeared in only 867 of the 362,728 abstracts and only 10 of the 1062 abstracts. EDI frameworks and phrases were not present in the 362,728 abstracts and 1062 abstracts, and many marginalized groups engaged with in EDI discussions were not present in the 362,728 and 1062 abstracts either. The results reveal vast opportunities to engage with the 'social' of quantum technologies in many different ways, including through EDI frameworks and concepts and by engaging with marginalized groups covered under EDI.

TI Resonance Fluorescence of a Chiral Artificial Atom
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW X
AB We demonstrate a superconducting artificial atom with strong unidirectional coupling to a microwave photonic waveguide. Our artificial atom is realized by coupling a transmon qubit to the waveguide at two spatially separated points with time-modulated interactions. Direction-sensitive interference arising from the parametric couplings in our scheme results in a nonreciprocal response, where we measure a forward/backward ratio of spontaneous emission exceeding 100. We verify the quantum nonlinear behavior of this artificial chiral atom by measuring the resonance fluorescence spectrum under a strong resonant drive and observing well-resolved Mollow triplets. Further, we demonstrate chirality for the second transition energy of the artificial atom and control it with a pulse sequence to realize a qubit-state-dependent nonreciprocal phase on itinerant photons. Our demonstration puts forth a superconducting hardware platform for the scalable realization of several key functionalities pursued within the paradigm of chiral quantum optics, including quantum networks with all-to-all connectivity, driven-dissipative stabilization of many-body entanglement, and the generation of complex nonclassical states of light.

TI Principle of majorization: Application to random quantum circuits
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We test the principle of majorization J. I. Latorre and M. A. Martin-Delgado, Phys. Rev. A 66, 022305 (2002). in random circuits. Three classes of circuits were considered: (i) universal, (ii) classically simulatable, and (iii) neither universal nor classically simulatable. The studied families are: {CNOT, H, T}, {CNOT, H, NOT}, {CNOT, H, S} (Clifford), matchgates, and IQP (instantaneous quantum polynomial-time). We verified that all the families of circuits satisfy on average the principle of decreasing majorization. In most cases the asymptotic state (number of gates -> infinity) behaves like a random vector. However, clear differences appear in the fluctuations of the Lorenz curves associated with asymptotic states. The fluctuations of the Lorenz curves discriminate between universal and nonuniversal classes of random quantum circuits, and they also detect the complexity of some nonuniversal but not classically efficiently simulatable quantum random circuits. We conclude that majorization can be used as an indicator of complexity of quantum dynamics, as an alternative to, e.g., entanglement spectrum and outof-time-order correlators.

AB In recent years, the growing number of devices connected to the Internet led network operators to continuously expand their own infrastructures. In order to simplify this scaling process, the research community is currently investigating the opportunity to move the complexity from a hardware to a software domain, through the introduction of a new paradigm, called Network Functions Virtualisation (NFV). It considers standard hardware platforms where many virtual instances are allocated to implement specific network services. However, despite the theoretical benefits, the mapping of the different virtual instances to the available physical resources represents a complex problem, difficult to be solved classically. The present work proposes a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimisation (QUBO) formulation of this embedding process, exploring the implementation possibilities on D-Wave's Quantum Annealers. Many test cases, with realistic constraints, have been considered to validate and characterise the potential of the model, and the promising results achieved are discussed throughout the document. The technical discussion is enriched with comparisons of the results obtained through heuristic algorithms, highlighting the strengths and the limitations in the resolution of the QUBO formulation proposed on current quantum machines.

TI Post-Quantum KEMs for IoT: A Study of Kyber and NTRU
SO SYMMETRY-BASEL
AB Current improvements in quantum computing present a substantial challenge to classical cryptographic systems, which typically rely on problems that can be solved in polynomial time using quantum algorithms. Consequently, post-quantum cryptography (PQC) has emerged as a promising solution to emerging quantum-based cryptographic challenges. The greatest threat is public-key cryptosystems, which are primarily responsible for key exchanges. In PQC, key encapsulation mechanisms (KEMs) are crucial for securing key exchange protocols, particularly in Internet communication, virtual private networks (VPNs), and secure messaging applications. CRYSTALS-Kyber and NTRU are two well-known PQC KEMs offering robust security in the quantum world. However, even when quantum computers are functional, they are not easily accessible. IoT devices will not be able to utilize them directly, so there will still be a requirement to protect IoT devices from quantum attacks. Concerns such as limited computational power, energy efficiency, and memory constraints in devices such as those used in IoTs, embedded systems, and smart cards limit the use of these techniques in constrained environments. These concerns always arise there. To address this issue, this study conducts a broad comparative analysis of Kyber and NTRU, with special focus on their security, performance, and implementation efficiency in such environments (IOT/constrained environments). In addition, a case study was conducted by applying KEMs to a low-power embedded device to analyze their performance in real-world scenarios. These results offer an important comparison for cyber security engineers and cryptographers who are involved in integrating post-quantum cryptography into resource-constrained devices.

TI Quantum annealing for microstructure equilibration with long-range
   elastic interactions
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB We demonstrate the use and benefits of quantum annealing approaches for the determination of equilibrated microstructures in shape memory alloys and other materials with long-range elastic interaction between coherent grains and their different martensite variants and phases. After a one dimensional illustration of the general approach, which requires to formulate the energy of the system in terms of an Ising Hamiltonian, we use distant dependent elastic interactions between grains to predict the variant selection for different transformation eigenstrains. The results and performance of the computations are compared to classical algorithms, demonstrating that the new approach can lead to a significant acceleration of the simulations. Beyond a discretization using simple cuboidal elements, also a direct representation of arbitrary microstructures is possible, allowing fast simulations with currently up to several thousand grains.
