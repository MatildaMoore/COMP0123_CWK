TI Single-shot high-resolution spectroscopy of single-photon-level optical
   pulses using a virtually imaged phased-array and single-photon avalanche
   diode array
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Single-shot high-resolution spectroscopy at the single photon-level has emerged a promising measurement technique, enabling novel observations and evaluations that were previously challenging. This technology is particularly effective for spectroscopic applications aimed at realizing frequency-multiplexed quantum repeaters. In this study, we propose single-shot high-resolution single-photon spectroscopy system that integrates high-resolution frequency-to-spatial mode mapping using a virtually imaged phased-array (VIPA) and high precision spatial mode detection using a single-photon avalanche diode (SPAD) array. experimentally demonstrated the principle of this system using weak coherent pulses with frequency mode interval of 120 MHz. This interval closely matches the minimum frequency mode spacing of the atomic frequency comb quantum memory with the Pr3+-ion-doped Y2SiO5 crystal. By applying the proposed system, we expect to maximize the multiplexing capability frequency-multiplexed quantum repeater schemes utilizing such quantum memories.

AB Quantum Machine Learning algorithms generally rely on hybrid implementation with a classical learning loop running on a CPU and small quantum circuits running on a Quantum Processing Unit (QPU) for serialized processing batches of data. Considering the scarcity of quantum resources, parallelizing the execution of multiple instances of small quantum circuits instead of allocating a single circuit would better use quantum hardware resources. However, exploiting all available qubits in QPUs could result in a noisier operating condition and disrupt or slow the learning mechanism.
   This paper investigates the parallelization of QML algorithms on QPU for data clustering based on trainable generative models. We design a parallel macro-circuit with the Qiskit framework and measure their performance on an IBM superconducting quantum computer. A theoretical performance model is then proposed to determine the expected level of acceleration. Finally, we measure the impact of the QPU's occupancy on the loss functions of our QML algorithm, enabling us to identify the most reliable and exploitable acceleration range.

TI Celestial Quantum Error Correction. Part II. From qudits to celestial
   CFT
SO JOURNAL OF HIGH ENERGY PHYSICS
AB A holographic CFT description of asymptotically flat spacetimes inherits vacuum degeneracies and IR divergences from its gravitational dual. We devise a Quantum Error Correcting (QEC) framework to encode both effects as correctable fluctuations on the CFT dual. The framework is physically motivated by embedding a chain of qudits in the so-called Klein spacetime and then taking a continuum N -> infinity limit. At finite N the qudit chain 1) enjoys a discrete version of celestial symmetries and 2) supports a Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) code. The limit results in hard states with quantized BMS hair in the celestial torus forming the logical subspace, robust under errors induced by soft radiation. Technically, the construction leverages the recently studied w1+infinity hierarchy of soft currents and its realization from a sigma model in twistor space.

TI Quantum Coding via Quasi-Cyclic Block Matrix
SO ENTROPY
AB An effective construction method for long-length quantum code has important applications in the field based on large-scale data. With the rapid development of quantum computing, how to construct this class of quantum coding has become one of the key research fields in quantum information theory. Motivated by the block jacket matrix and its circulant permutation, we proposed a construction method for quantum quasi-cyclic (QC) codes with two classical codes. This simplifies the coding process for long-length quantum error-correction code (QECC) using number decomposition. The obtained code length N can achieve O(n2) if an appropriate prime number n is taken. Furthermore, with a suitable parameter in the construction method, the obtained codes have four cycles in their generator matrices and show good performance for low density codes.

TI Vernam's, Kotelnikov's, and Shannon's one-time pad and quantum
   cryptography
SO PHYSICS-USPEKHI
AB Quantum cryptography quantum key distribution (QKD) was one of the first fields of study of quantum information theory. It reached a mature scientific level and has been implemented in commercial systems for secure quantum communications. The key distribution problem is the central issue of symmetric cryptography. Quantum cryptography solves this problem on the basis of the fundamental laws of nature: the principles of quantum mechanics. Quantum key distribution is essentially matching two independent random sequences on the transmitting and receiving sides by exchanging quantum states. Required in addition to the quantum channel is an authentic classical communication channel. Both communication channels are open and vulnerable to a perpetrator's attack. To ensure the authenticity of the classical channel at initial system startup, a seed key is required, which is used to provide information-theoretic authentication. In essence, quantum cryptography systems are mechanisms for expanding this seed key. Subsequent sessions generate a quantum key, part of which is used for authentication, while another part is employed for other cryptographic purposes, such as encryption. An issue fundamental for quantum cryptography is the number of quantum key distribution sessions that can be conducted from the initial system launch until a new system reboot, when the cryptographic properties of the quantum keys reach a critical level, after which they can no longer be used for cryptographic purposes, and a new system reboot is needed. Although a number of reviews on quantum cryptography are currently available, this issue has not been discussed in detail. It is shown that for realistic parameters of quantum cryptography systems that are currently achievable, a QKD system can operate for virtually any length of time before the next reboot. This implies that QKD systems can implement a `one-time pad' a set of one-time keys using only a single seed key. A brief historical overview is also presented, outlining some facts little known to the general public. This review, which is intended for a general audience, is comprehensible to undergraduate and graduate students who have completed university courses on quantum information science. The authors hope that it will provide a deeper understanding of the cryptographic underpinnings of state-of-the-art quantum key distribution systems.

   continuous variables
SO SICE JOURNAL OF CONTROL MEASUREMENT AND SYSTEM INTEGRATION
AB Quantum entanglement states in continuous-variable quantum teleportation can transfer any quantum state. However, errors occur in the quantum states before and after the transfer in scientific experiments because generating a perfect quantum entanglement is physically unattainable. This paper limits the quantum states transferred to squeezed coherent states and introduces a controller to classical information transfer in continuous-variable quantum teleportation to improve transfer accuracy. Under such a setup, we derived the optimal controller that maximizes the fidelity, independent of the measurement results and the value of the displacement of the squeezed coherent state.

TI End-to-end capacities of imperfect-repeater quantum networks
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB The optimal performance of a communication network is limited not only by the quality of point-to-point channels, but by the efficacy of its constituent technologies. Understanding the limits of quantum networks requires an understanding of both the ultimate capacities of quantum channels and the efficiency of imperfect quantum repeaters. In this work, using a recently developed node-splitting technique which introduces internal losses and noise into repeater devices, we present achievable end-to-end rates for noisy-repeater quantum networks. These are obtained by extending the coherent and reverse coherent information (single channel capacity lower bounds) into end-to-end capacity lower bounds, both in the context of single-path and multi-path routing. These achievable rates are completely general, and apply to networks composed of arbitrary channels arranged in general topologies. Through this general formalism, we show how tight upper-bounds can also be derived by supplementing appropriate single-edge capacity bounds. As a result, we develop tools which provide tight performance bounds for quantum networks constituent of channels whose capacities are not exactly known, and reveal critical network properties which are necessary for high-rate quantum communications. This permits the investigation of pertinent classes of quantum networks with realistic technologies; qubit amplitude damping networks and bosonic thermal-loss networks.

TI Beyond Single-Shot Fault-Tolerant Quantum Error Correction
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION THEORY
AB Extensive quantum error correction is necessary in order to perform a useful computation on a noisy quantum computer. Moreover, quantum error correction must be implemented based on imperfect parity check measurements that may return incorrect outcomes or inject additional faults into the qubits. To achieve fault-tolerant error correction, Shor proposed to repeat the sequence of parity check measurements until the same outcome is observed sufficiently many times. Then, one can use this information to perform error correction. A basic implementation of this fault tolerance strategy requires Omega(rd(2)) parity check measurements for a distance-d code defined by r parity checks. For some specific highly structured quantum codes, Bombin has shown that single-shot fault-tolerant quantum error correction is possible using only r measurements. In this work, we consider a phenomenological noise model for parity check measurements assuming that each bit of a codeword and the measurement outcome suffer from independent bit flips with some error rate p. For this model, we demonstrate that fault-tolerant quantum error correction can be achieved using O(d log(d)) measurements for any code with distance d >= Omega(n(alpha)) for some constant alpha > 0. Moreover, we prove the existence of a sub-single-shot fault-tolerant quantum error correction scheme using fewer than r measurements. In some cases, the number of parity check measurements required for fault-tolerant quantum error correction is exponentially smaller than the number of parity checks defining the code. The short measurement sequences constructed generally have high weight and our phenomenological noise model is not realistic in this regime. Our error correction strategy could find applications to small codes and LDPC codes if one can manage to keep the weight of the measured parity checks low.

AB In this paper, we present a verifiable arbitrated quantum signature scheme based on controlled quantum teleportation. The five-qubit entangled state functions as a quantum channel. The proposed scheme uses mutually unbiased bases particles as decoy particles and performs unitary operations on these decoy particles, applying the functional values of symmetric bivariate polynomial. As such, eavesdropping detection and identity authentication can both be executed. The security analysis shows that our scheme can neither be disavowed by the signatory nor denied by the verifier, and it cannot be forged by any malicious attacker.

SO FINTECH
AB Quantum technology is significantly transforming businesses, organisations, and information systems. It will have a significant impact on accounting and finance, particularly in the context of cybersecurity. It presents both opportunities and risks in maintaining confidentiality and protecting financial data. This study aims to demonstrate the application of quantum technologies in accounting cybersecurity, utilising quantum algorithms and QKD to overcome the limitations of classical computing. The literature review emphasises the vulnerabilities of current accounting cybersecurity to quantum attacks and highlights the necessity for quantum-resistant cryptographic mechanisms. It discusses the risks related to traditional encryption methods within the context of quantum capabilities. This research enhances understanding of how quantum computing can revolutionise accounting cybersecurity by advancing quantum-resistant algorithms and implementing QKD in accounting systems. This study employs the PSALSAR systematic review methodology to ensure thoroughness and rigour. The analysis shows that quantum computing pushes encryption techniques beyond classical limits.

TI A Software Development Kit and Translation Layer for Executing Intel
   8080 Assembler on a Quantum Computer (August 2022)
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM ENGINEERING
AB One of the major obstacles to the adoption of quantum computing is the requirement to define quantum circuits at the quantum gate level. Many programmers are familiar with high-level or low-level programming languages but not quantum gates nor the low-level quantum logic required to derive useful results from quantum computers. The steep learning curve involved when progressing from quantum gates to complex simulations such as Shor's algorithm has proven too much for many developers. The purpose of this article and the software presented within addresses this challenge by providing a Software Development Kit (SDK), translation layer, emulator, and a framework of techniques for executing Intel 8080/Z80 assembler on a quantum computer, i.e., all salient points of CPU execution, logic, arithmetic, and bitwise manipulation will be executed on the quantum computer using quantum circuits. This provides a novel means of displaying the equivalency and interoperability of quantum and classical computers. Developers and researchers can use the SDK to write code in Intel 8080/Z80 assembler which is executed locally via traditional emulation and remotely on a quantum computer in parallel. The emulator features side-by-side code execution with visibility of the running quantum circuit and reusable/overridable methods. This enables programmers to learn, reuse, and contrast techniques for performing any traditional CPU-based technique/instruction on a quantum computer, e.g., a programmer may know how to multiply and perform checks on a classical CPU but is not able to perform the same tasks in a quantum implementation, and this SDK allows the programmer to pick and choose the methods they would like to use to fulfil their requirements. The SDK makes use of open-source software, specifically Python and Qiskit for the emulation, translation, API calls, and execution of user-supplied code or binaries.

Here, we employ network theory to study the properties of the photonic networks that can be generated by satellite-based quantum communication and compare them with those of their optical-fiber counterpart. We predict that satellites can generate small-world networks, implying that physically distant nodes are actually near from a network perspective. We also analyze the connectivity properties of the network and show, in particular, that they are robust against random failures. This positions satellite-based quantum communication as the most promising technology to distribute entanglement across large distances in quantum networks of growing size and complexity.

These attacks have been shown to impact the critical infrastructure of a nation, such as its major financial institutions. The possibility of DDoS attacks has also been identified for quantum networks. In this theoretical work, we introduce a quantum analogue of classical entropic DDoS detection systems and apply it in the context of detecting an attack on a quantum network. In particular, we examine DDoS attacks on a quantum repeater and harness the associated entanglement entropy for the detection system. Our results extend the applicability of quantum information from the domain of data security to the area of network security.

AB The Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) code encodes a logical qubit into a bosonic system with resilience against single -photon loss, the predominant error in most bosonic systems. Here we present experimental results demonstrating quantum error correction of GKP states based on reservoir engineering of a superconducting device. Error correction is made fully autonomous through an unconditional reset of an auxiliary transmon qubit. We show that the lifetime of the logical qubit is increased from quantum error correction, therefore reaching the point at which more errors are corrected than generated.

TI Efficient data replication in distributed clouds via quantum
   entanglement algorithms
SO METHODSX
AB In cloud computing, it remains difficult to make data available in a cloud service such that the data is replicated and maintained consistently across various data centers. Traditional replication systems are sufficient, even though they take too long to process, cause significant data transfers, and face problems with final data consistency. This work presents a new method named Quantum Entanglement-Based Replication Algorithm (QERA), which makes use of quantum entanglement to ensure quick and high-performance synchronization of cloud data across all nodes. In this proposed work, the QERA approach encodes data changes in the primary cloud node onto quantum states and entangled qubit pairs to the related replica nodes. As a result, any change is quickly shown on all replicas without the usual overhead and delay of message broadcasts. It simulates how QERA is designed to decrease latency, promote consistency, and make better use of resources in cloud environments. This paper creates a theoretical framework using IBM Qiskit and Microsoft Quantum Development Kit simulators to compare classical and quantum baseline algorithms. The results show that QERA may greatly enhance the way updates and replications are managed across many cloud systems. It demonstrates how QERA can ensure a very synchronized replication among the remote cloud nodes. Employs a qubit pair entangled to minimize latency and decrease bandwidth expenses as it goes through updates. Combines the idea of quantum teleportation with methods of non-invasive verification made to maintain the integrity of the state without altering the quantum system.

TI Generation of high-dimensional qudit quantum states via two-dimensional
   quantum walks
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Several quantum protocols, with applications ranging from fundamental studies to cryptographic scenarios, can be enhanced through the generation and manipulation of quantum states that belong to high-dimensional Hilbert spaces. For this reason, it is worth devoting efforts to find more efficient methods for complex qudit-state generation. One-dimensional quantum walks have proved to be efficient and versatile platforms for the engineering of such complex states. Hitherto, however, using their two-dimensional counterpart for this task has remained unexplored. In this paper, we consider two-dimensional quantum walk evolution as a tool for the generation of high-dimensional qudit states. We theoretically prove that a suitable change of the coin operators at each step permits the generation of a subset of qudit states by using less resources with respect to the one-dimensional counterpart. Then, we successfully generate qudit states by exploiting two-dimensional quantum walks on an experimental photonic platform. The walker position is encoded on discrete sets of optical modes carrying quantized amounts of transverse momentum and the mode couplings are actively controlled via liquid-crystal devices. The obtained results provide insight into qudit generation for applications in quantum communication and quantum cryptography.

TI Investigating and improving student understanding of the basics of
   quantum computing
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW PHYSICS EDUCATION RESEARCH
AB Quantum information science and engineering (QISE) is a rapidly developing field that leverages the skills of experts from many disciplines to utilize the potential of quantum systems in a variety of applications. It requires talent from a wide variety of traditional fields, including physics, engineering, chemistry, and computer science, to name a few. To prepare students for such opportunities, it is important to give them a strong foundation in the basics of QISE, in which quantum computing plays a central role. In this study, we discuss the development, validation, and evaluation of a Quantum Interactive Learning Tutorial, on the basics and applications of quantum computing. These include an overview of key quantum mechanical concepts relevant to quantum computation (including ways a quantum computer is different from a classical computer), properties of single- and multiqubit systems, and the basics of single-qubit quantum gates. The tutorial uses guided inquiry-based teaching-learning sequences. Its development and validation involved conducting cognitive task analysis from both expert and student perspectives and using common student difficulties as a guide. For example, before engaging with the tutorial, after traditional lecture-based instruction, one reasoning primitive that was common in student responses is that a major difference between an N-bit classical and N-qubit quantum computer is that various things associated with a number N for a classical computer should be replaced with the number 2N N for a quantum computer (e.g., 2N N qubits must be initialized and 2N N bits of information are obtained as the output of the computation on the quantum computer). This type of reasoning primitive also led many students to incorrectly think that there are only N distinctly different states available when computation takes place on a classical computer. Research suggests that this type of reasoning primitive has its origins in students learning that quantum computers can provide exponential advantage for certain problems, e.g., Shor's algorithm for factoring products of large prime numbers, and that the quantum state during the computation can be in a superposition of 2N N linearly independent states. The inquiry-based learning sequences in the tutorial provide scaffolding support to help students develop a functional understanding. The final version of the validated tutorial was implemented in two distinct courses offered by the physics department with slightly different student populations and broader course goals. Students' understanding was evaluated after traditional lecture-based instruction on the requisite concepts and again after engaging with the tutorial. We analyze and discuss their improvement in performance on concepts covered in the tutorial.

TI Entanglement polygon inequality in qudit systems
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Entanglement is an important resource for quantum communication tasks. Most results are focused on qubit entanglement. Our goal in this work is to characterize the multipartite high-dimensional entanglement. We first derive an entanglement polygon inequality for the q concurrence, which manifests the relationship among all the "one-to-group" marginal entanglements in any multipartite qudit system. This implies lower and upper bounds for the marginal entanglement of any three-qudit system. We further extend our study to general entanglement distribution inequalities for high-dimensional entanglement in terms of the unified-(r, s) entropy entanglement, including Tsallis entropy, Renyi entropy, and von Neumann entropy entanglement as special cases. These results provide insights into characterizing bipartite high-dimensional entanglement in quantum information processing.

TI Algebraic language for the efficient representation and optimization of
   quantum circuits
SO PHYSICA SCRIPTA
AB The use of graphical language in quantum computing for the representation of algorithms, although intuitive, is not very useful for different tasks such as the description of quantum circuits in text environments, the calculation of quantum states or the optimization of quantum circuits. While classical circuits can be represented either by circuit graphs or by Boolean expressions, quantum circuits have until now predominantly been illustrated as circuit graphs because no formal language for quantum circuits that allows algebraic manipulations has so far been accepted. This work proposes a means to represent quantum circuits in a convenient and concise manner, similar to the way Boolean expressions are used in classical circuits. The proposed notation allows the consistent and parameterized description of quantum algorithms, as well as the easy handling of the elements that compose it to achieve powerful optimizations in the number of gates of the circuits. To visualize it, a software implementation of an algebraic quantum circuit framework has been made, which allows describing quantum circuits, as well as their respective state vectors, using the proposed algebraic language.

TI Towards a Global Scale Quantum Information Network: A Study Applied to
   Satellite-Enabled Distributed Quantum Computing
SO ENTROPY
AB Recent developments have reported on the feasibility of interconnecting small quantum registers in a quantum information network of a few meter-scale for distributed quantum computing purposes. Small quantum processors in a network represent a promising solution to the scalability problem of manipulating more than thousands of noise-free qubits. Here, we propose and assess a satellite-enabled distributed quantum computing system at the French national scale based on existing infrastructures in Paris and Nice. We consider a system composed of both a ground and a Space segment, allowing for the distribution of end-to-end entanglement between Alice in Paris and Bob in Nice, each owning a few-qubit processor composed of trapped ions. In the context of quantum computing, this entanglement resource can be used for the teleportation of a qubit state or for gate teleportation. After having developed a model, we numerically assess the entanglement distribution rate and fidelity generated by this space-based quantum information network and discuss concrete use cases and service performance levels in the framework of distributed quantum computing. We obtain 90 end-to-end entangled photon pairs distributed over a satellite pass of 331 s that can perform a teleportation-based controlled-Z operation with a fidelity of at most 82%.

TI Molecular nanomagnets with competing interactions as optimal units for

SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Quantum systems displaying many accessible levels could be very powerful units of forthcoming quantum computing architectures. Indeed, the large number of available states could significantly simplify the actual implementation of several algorithms. Here we show that artificial molecular spins are particularly suitable to realize such a platform. In particular, multispin molecules with competing interactions provide a large number of low-energy multiplets in which decoherence is strongly suppressed compared to a single spin S and does not increase with the system size. This feature, combined with the proper connectivity between the multiplets, enables the implementation of complex operations with remarkable fidelity, thus fully unleashing the potential of the molecular approach. We demonstrate the power of this approach by numerically simulating the implementation of one- and two-qudit gates on realistic molecular systems.

AB Quantum annealing (QA) is a heuristic quantum optimization algorithm that can be used to solve combinatorial optimization problems. In recent years, advances in quantum technologies have enabled the development of small- and intermediate-scale quantum processors that implement the QA algorithm for programmable use. Specifically, QA processors produced by D-Wave systems have been studied and tested extensively in both research and industrial settings across different disciplines. In this paper we provide a literature review of the theoretical motivations for QA as a heuristic quantum optimization algorithm, the software and hardware that is required to use such quantum processors, and the state-of-the-art applications and proofs-of-concepts that have been demonstrated using them. The goal of our review is to provide a centralized and condensed source regarding applications of QA technology. We identify the advantages, limitations, and potential of QA for both researchers and practitioners from various fields.

TI Engineering Quantum Error Correction Codes Using Evolutionary Algorithms
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM ENGINEERING
AB Quantum error correction and the use of quantum error correction codes are likely to be essential for the realization of practical quantum computing. Because the error models of quantum devices vary widely, quantum codes that are tailored for a particular error model may have much better performance. In this work, we present a novel evolutionary algorithm that searches for an optimal stabilizer code for a given error model, number of physical qubits, and number of encoded qubits. We demonstrate an efficient representation of stabilizer codes as binary strings, which allows for random generation of valid stabilizer codes as well as mutation and crossing of codes. Our algorithm finds stabilizer codes whose distance closely matches the best-known-distance codes of Grassl (2007) for n <= 20 physical qubits. We perform a search for optimal distance Calderbank-Steane-Shor codes and compare their distance to the best known codes. Finally, we show that the algorithm can be used to optimize stabilizer codes for biased error models, demonstrating a significant improvement in the undetectable error rate for [[12,1]](2) codes versus the best-known-distance code with the same parameters. As part of this work, we also introduce an evolutionary algorithm QDistEvol for finding the distance of quantum error correction codes.

TI On the Probabilistic Quantum Error Correction
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION THEORY
AB Probabilistic quantum error correction is an error-correcting procedure which uses postselection to determine if the encoded information was successfully restored. In this work, we analyze the probabilistic version of the error-correcting procedure for general noise. We generalize the Knill-Laflamme conditions for probabilistically correctable errors. We show that for some noise channels, the initial information has to be encoded into a mixed state to maximize the probability of successful error correction. Finally, the probabilistic error-correcting procedure offers an advantage over the deterministic procedure. Reducing the probability of successful error correction allows for correcting errors generated by a broader class of noise channels. Significantly, if the errors are caused by a unitary interaction with an auxiliary qubit system, we can probabilistically restore a qubit state by using only one additional physical qubit.

TI Lifetime reductions and read-out oscillations due to imperfect initial
   level preparations of atoms in a long-lived DLCZ-like quantum memory
SO APPLIED PHYSICS B-LASERS AND OPTICS
AB Entanglement between a spin-wave qubit (memory qubit) and a photonic qubit is a basic building block for quantum repeaters. Duan-Lukin-Cirac-Zoller (DLCZ) scheme, which generates spin waves via spontaneous Raman scattering (SRS) of Stokes photons in atomic ensemble, provides a promising way to generate such entanglement. In a recent work [arXiv: 2006.05631, accepted by communications physics], DLCZ-like quantum memory that generates long-lived atom-photon entanglement has been experimentally demonstrated, where magnetic-field-insensitive (MFI) coherence is used to store spin waves. For realizing such MFI spin-wave storage, the atoms have to be initially prepared in a specific Zeeman sublevel, which is achieved by applying optical pumping lasers. Here, we demonstrate the memory lifetimes for the cases that the atoms are perfectly and imperfectly prepared in the specific Zeeman level, respectively. The experimental results show that the spin waves associated with magnetic-field-sensitive (MFS) and MFI coherences will be simultaneously created for the case that the atoms are imperfectly prepared in the Zeeman sublevel. Thus, the read outs will experience decay oscillations due to interferences between the two spin waves and the memory lifetime will be shorten due to dephasing of MFS coherence. A detailed theoretical analysis has been developed for explaining the experimental results. The present work will help one to understand decoherence of spin waves (SWs) and then enable one to obtain optimal lifetime of the entanglement storage in the cold atoms.

SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Quantum teleportation enables the transfer of quantum states across any distance and plays a prominent role in quantum communication. In this paper, we theoretically investigate the feasibility of quantum two-qubit teleportation through a hybrid channel consisting of thermal, magnetic, and local components. To study this process, we check the success probability of quantum teleportation and address the quality of the teleported quantum state using fidelity and average fidelity concepts. Furthermore, we examine a crucial quantum aspect of the system, such as the non-Markovianity of the dynamics, by utilizing success probability witness related to the teleported state. Our findings show that this hybrid channel has a good potential to be successful in quantum teleportation.

TI NTT and Inverse NTT Quantum Circuits in CRYSTALS-Kyber for Post-Quantum
   Security Evaluation
SO APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
AB The emergence of quantum computers threatens current cryptographic systems, and NIST is preparing for the post-quantum era through the post-quantum cryptography (PQC) contest. CRYSTALS-Kyber is a lattice-based cipher suite that is used as a PQC standard. Lattice-based cryptography is considered quantum-safe for quantum computing because a quantum algorithm that can more efficiently solve the lattice problem of lattice-based cryptography compared to a classic algorithm has not been reported as yet. In this paper, we present quantum circuits tailored to NTT and inverse NTT, employed for optimized polynomial multiplication within CRYSTALS-Kyber. The proposed quantum circuits operate at Z3329[X]/(X256+1), which are the parameters of CRYSTALS-Kyber. We provide an in-depth description of the NTT/InvNTT quantum circuit's operation and subsequently assess and analyze the quantum resources necessary for these functions. The NTT/InvNTT quantum circuits comprise four unique sub-functions, with the InvNTT additionally incorporating Barrett reduction. To the best of our knowledge, this represents the inaugural implementation of the CRYSTALS-Kyber NTT/InvNTT quantum circuits. We anticipate that our findings will aid in analyzing the security strengths of quantum computers for lattice-based cryptography.

TI Correlation measures of a quantum state and information characteristics
   of a quantum channel
SO JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL PHYSICS
AB We discuss the interconnections between basic correlation measures of a bipartite quantum state and basic information characteristics of a quantum channel, focusing on the benefits of these interconnections for solving specific problems concerning the characteristics of both types. We describe properties of the (unoptimized and optimized) quantum discord in infinite-dimensional bipartite systems. In particular, using the generalized Koashi-Winter relation, a simple condition is obtained that guarantees that a state with zero quantum discord is quantum-classical. Two possible definitions of the quantum discord for states with infinite one-way classical correlation are proposed and analysed. The generalized versions of Koashi-Winter and Xi-Lu-Wang-Li relations are used to obtain advanced continuity bounds for the Holevo information at the outputs of a channel and its complementary channel (as functions of a channel for a given ensemble of input states), for the Holevo capacity and the unregularized private capacity of a quantum channel depending either on the input dimension or on the input energy bound. We also discuss the properties of quantum channels which are "doppelgangers" of the monotonicity of the quantum discord and the entropy reduction of a local measurement under quantum channels acting on an unmeasured subsystem.

TI Simulation of the five-qubit quantum error correction code on
   superconducting qubits
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Experimental realization of stabilizer-based quantum error correction (QEC) codes that would yield superior logical qubit performance is one of the formidable task for state-of-the-art quantum processors. A major obstacle toward realizing this goal is the large footprint of QEC codes, even those with a small distance. We propose a circuit based on the minimal distance-3 QEC code, which requires only five data qubits and five ancilla qubits, connected in a ring with iSWAP gates implemented between neighboring qubits. Using a density-matrix simulation, we show that, thanks to its smaller footprint, the proposed code has a lower logical error rate than SURFACE-17 for similar physical error rates. We also estimate the performance of a neural-network-based error decoder, which can be trained to accommodate the error statistics of a specific quantum processor by training on experimental data.

TI Universal quantum computation based on nanoelectromechanical systems
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB We propose to use a buckled plate as a qubit, where a double-well potential is mechanically produced by pushing the plate from both sides. The right and left positions of the plate are assigned to be quantum states |0) and |1). The NOT gate is executed by changing the buckling force acting on the plate, while the Pauli-Z gate and the phase-shift gate are executed by applying an electric field. A two-qubit phase-shift gate is materialized with the use of an electrostatic potential. They constitute a set of universal quantum gates. We estimate the relaxation time and the coherence time. We also discuss the fidelity of each gate operation. An examination of sample parameters leads to a feasibility of a nano-electro-mechanical-system-based quantum computer.

TI Toward superpolynomial quantum speedup of equivariant quantum algorithms
   with SU(d) symmetry
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We introduce a framework of the equivariant convolutional quantum algorithms which is tailored for a number of machine-learning tasks on physical systems with arbitrary SU(d) symmetries. It allows us to enhance a natural model of quantum computation-permutational quantum computing (PQC) [Jordan, Quantum Inf. Comput. 10, 470 (2010)]-and define a more powerful model: PQC+. While PQC was shown to be efficiently classically simulatable, we exhibit a problem which can be efficiently solved on a PQC+ machine, whereas no classical polynomial time algorithm is known, thus providing evidence against PQC+ being classically simulatable. We further discuss practical quantum machine learning algorithms which can be carried out in the paradigm of PQC+.

TI Universal quantum computing models: a perspective of resource theory
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB Quantum computing has been proven to be powerful, however, there are still great challenges for building real quantum computers due to the requirements of both fault-tolerance and universality. There is still no systematic method to design fast quantum algorithms and identify the key quantum resources. In this work, we develop a resource-theoretic approach to characterize universal quantum computing models and the universal resources for quantum computing. Our theory combines the framework of universal quantum computing model (UQCM) and the quantum resource theory (QRT). The former has played major roles in quantum computing, while the later was developed mainly for quantum information theory. Putting them together proves to be 'win-win': on one hand, using QRT can provide a resource-theoretic characterization of a UQCM, the relation among models and inspire new ones, and on the other hand, using UQCM offers a framework to apply resources, study relation among resources and classify them. In quantum theory, we mainly study states, evolution, observable, and probability from measurements, and this motivates the introduction of different families of UQCMs. A family also includes generations depending on a hierarchical structure of resource theories. We introduce a table of UQCMs by first classifying two categories of models: one referring to the format of information, and one referring to the logical evolution of information requiring quantum error-correction codes. Each category contains a few families of models, leading to more than one hundred of them in total. Such a rich spectrum of models include some well-known ones that people use, such as the circuit model, the adiabatic model, but many of them are relatively new and worthy of more study in the future. Among them are the models of quantum von Neumann architectures established recently. This type of architecture or model circumvents the no-go theorems on both the quantum program storage and quantum control unit, enabling the construction of more complete quantum computer systems and high-level programming. Correspondingly, each model is captured by a unique quantum resource. For instance, in the state family, the universal resource for the circuit model is coherence, for the local quantum Turing machine is bipartite entanglement, and for the cluster-state based, also known as measurement-based model is a specific type of entanglement relevant to symmetry-protected topological order. As program-storage is a central feature of the quantum von Neumann architecture, we find the quantum resources for it are quantum memories, which are dynamical resources closely related to entanglement. In other words, our classification of UQCMs also serves as a computational classification of quantum resources. This can be used to resolve the dispute over the computing power of resources, such as interference, entanglement, or contextuality. In all, we believe our theory lays down a solid framework to study computing models, resources, and design algorithms.

TI Nuclear spin quantum memory in silicon carbide
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Transition metal (TM) defects in silicon carbide (SiC) are a promising platform for applications in quantum technology. Some TM defects, e.g., vanadium, emit in one of the telecom bands, but the large ground-state hyperfine manifold poses a problem for applications which require pure quantum states. We develop a driven, dissipative protocol to polarize the nuclear spin, based on a rigorous theoretical model of the defect. We further show that nuclear-spin polarization enables the use of well-known methods for initialization and long time coherent storage of quantum states. The proposed nuclear-spin preparation protocol thus marks the first step towards an all-optically controlled integrated platform for quantum technology with TM defects in SiC.

TI Measurement-based universal blind quantum computation with minor
   resources
SO QUANTUM INFORMATION PROCESSING
AB Blind quantum computation (BQC) enables a client with less quantum computational ability to delegate her quantum computation to a server with strong quantum computational power while preserving the client's privacy. Generally, many-qubit entangled states are often used to complete BQC tasks. But for a large-scale entangled state, it is difficult to be described since its Hilbert space dimension is increasing exponentially. Furthermore, the number of entangled qubits is limited in experiment of existing works. To tackle this problem, in this paper we propose a universal BQC protocol based on measurement with minor resources, where the trap technology is adopted to verify correctness of the server's measurement outcomes during computation and testing process. In our model, there are two participants, a client who prepares initial single-qubit states and a server that performs universal quantum computation. The client is almost classical since she does not require any quantum computational power, quantum memory. To realize the client's universal BQC, we construct an m x n latticed state composed of six-qubit cluster states and eight-qubit cluster states, which needs less qubits than the brickwork state. Finally, we analyze and prove the blindness, correctness, universality and verifiability of our proposed BQC protocol.

TI Error-mitigated quantum simulation of interacting fermions with trapped
   ions
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Quantum error mitigation has been extensively explored to increase the accuracy of the quantum circuits in noisy-intermediate-scale-quantum (NISQ) computation, where quantum error correction requiring additional quantum resources is not adopted. Among various error-mitigation schemes, probabilistic error cancellation (PEC) has been proposed as a general and systematic protocol that can be applied to numerous hardware platforms and quantum algorithms. However, PEC has only been tested in two-qubit systems and a superconducting multi-qubit system by learning a sparse error model. Here, we benchmark PEC using up to four trapped-ion qubits. For the benchmark, we simulate the dynamics of interacting fermions with or without spins by applying multiple Trotter steps. By tomographically reconstructing the error model and incorporating other mitigation methods such as positive probability and symmetry constraints, we are able to increase the fidelity of simulation and faithfully observe the dynamics of the Fermi-Hubbard model, including the different behavior of charge and spin of fermions. Our demonstrations can be an essential step for further extending systematic error-mitigation schemes toward practical quantum advantages.

TI Equivalence regimes for geometric quantum discord and local quantum
   uncertainty
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB The concept of quantum discord aims at unveiling quantum correlations that go beyond those described by entanglement. Its original formulation [L. Henderson and V. Vedral, J. Phys. A: Math. Gen. 34, 6899 (2001); H. 011ivier and W. H. Zurek, Phy,. R. Lett. 88, 017901 (2001)] is difficult to compute even for the simplest case of two-qubits systems. Alternative formulations have been developed to address this drawback, such as the geometric measure of quantum discord [L. Chang and S. Luo, Phys. Rev. A 87, 062303 (2013)] and the local quantum uncertainty [D. Girolami, T. Tufarelli, and G. Adesso, Phys. Rev. Lett. 110, 240402 (2013)] that can be evaluated in closed form for some quantum systems, such as two-qubit systems. We show here that these two measures of quantum discord are equivalent for 2xD dimensional bipartite quantum systems. By considering the relevant example of NOON states for phase estimation in lossy environments, we also show that both metrics of quantum discord quantify the decrease of quantum Fisher information of the phase estimation protocol. Given their ease of computation in 2xD bipartite systems, the geometric measure of quantum discord and the local quantum uncertainty demonstrate their relevance as computable measures of quantum discord.

TI Feasibility of logical Bell state generation in memory assisted quantum
   networks
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB This study explores the feasibility of utilizing quantum error correction to generate and store logical Bell states in heralded quantum entanglement protocols, crucial for quantum repeater networks. Two lattice surgery-based protocols (local and nonlocal) are introduced to establish logical Bell states between distant nodes using an intermediary node. We simulate the protocols using realistic experimental parameters, including ion trap memories, noisy optical channels, frequency conversion, and nondestructive detection of photonic qubits. The study evaluates rotated and planar surface codes alongside Bacon-Shor codes for small code distances (d = 3, 5) under depolarizing and physical noise models. Pseudothresholds are identified, with physical error rates above perr similar to 10-3 offering no advantage over unencoded Bell states under depolarizing noise. Pseudo-thresholds are also reevaluated in terms of gate error rates perrH, perrCX , and perrM . For a distance of 1 km between the end node and the intermediary, an advantage over unencoded Bell-state heralded protocols requires reducing gate error rates by an order of magnitude (0.1perrH , 0.1perrCX, and 0.1perrM). These results highlight the need for significant hardware improvements to implement logical Bell state protocols with quantum memories. Additionally, the nonlocal protocol rate was analyzed achieving rates up to (32.53 +/- 1.53) Hz over distances of 1 to 80 km between the end node and the intermediary node.

TI A complete continuous-variable quantum computation architecture based on
   the 2D spatiotemporal cluster state
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Continuous-variable measurement-based quantum computation, which requires deterministically generated large-scale cluster states, is a promising candidate for practical, scalable, universal, and fault-tolerant quantum computation. In this work, based on our compact and scalable scheme of generating a two-dimensional spatiotemporal cluster state, a complete architecture including cluster state preparation, gate implementations, and error correction, is proposed. First, a scheme for generating two-dimensional large-scale continuous-variable cluster state by multiplexing both the temporal and spatial domains is proposed. Then, the corresponding gate implementations by gate teleportation are discussed and the actual gate noise from the generated cluster state is considered. After that, the quantum error correction can be further achieved by utilizing the square-lattice Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) code. Finally, a fault-tolerant quantum computation can be realized by introducing bias into the square-lattice GKP code (to protect against phase-flip errors) and concatenating a repetition code (to handle the residual bit-flip errors), with a squeezing threshold of 12.3 dB. Our work provides a possible option for a complete fault-tolerant quantum computation architecture in the future.

TI Raman Storage of Quasideterministic Single Photons Generated by Rydberg
   Collective Excitations in a Low-Noise Quantum Memory
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB We demonstrate the storage and retrieval of an on-demand single photon generated by a collective Rydberg excitation in a low-noise Raman quantum memory located in a different cold atomic ensemble. We generate single photons on demand by exciting a cold cloud of rubidium atoms off resonantly to a Rydberg state, with a generation probability up to 15% per trial. We then show that the single photons can be stored and retrieved with a storage-and-retrieval efficiency of 21% and a low noise floor in the Raman quantum memory. This leads to a signal-to-noise ratio ranging from 11 to 26 for the retrieved sin-gle photon, depending on the input-photon-generation probability, which allows us to observe significant antibunching. We also evaluate the performance of the Raman memory as a built-in unbalanced temporal beam splitter, tunable by varying the write-in control-pulse intensity. In addition, we demonstrate that the Raman memory can be used to control the single-photon wave shape. These results are a step forward in the implementation of efficient quantum repeater links using single-photon sources.

TI Analysis of the shortest vector problems with quantum annealing to
   search the excited states
SO JAPANESE JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS
AB The shortest vector problem (SVP) is one of the lattice problems and is the mathematical basis for lattice-based cryptography, which is expected to be post-quantum cryptography. The SVP can be mapped onto the Ising problem, which in principle can be solved by quantum annealing (QA). However, one issue in solving the SVP using QA is that the solution of the SVP corresponds to the first excited state of the problem Hamiltonian. Therefore, QA, which searches for ground states, cannot provide a solution with high probability. In this paper, we propose to adopt an excited-state search of the QA to solve the shortest vector problem. We numerically show that the excited-state search provides a solution with a higher probability than the ground-state search.

TI Entropic Uncertainty for Two Coupled Dipole Spins Using Quantum Memory
   under the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya Interaction
SO ENTROPY
AB In the thermodynamic equilibrium of dipolar-coupled spin systems under the influence of a Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (D-M) interaction along the z-axis, the current study explores the quantum-memory-assisted entropic uncertainty relation (QMA-EUR), entropy mixedness and the concurrence two-spin entanglement. Quantum entanglement is reduced at increased temperature values, but inflation uncertainty and mixedness are enhanced. The considered quantum effects are stabilized to their stationary values at high temperatures. The two-spin entanglement is entirely repressed if the D-M interaction is disregarded, and the entropic uncertainty and entropy mixedness reach their maximum values for equal coupling rates. Rather than the concurrence, the entropy mixedness can be a proper indicator of the nature of the entropic uncertainty. The effect of model parameters (D-M coupling and dipole-dipole spin) on the quantum dynamic effects in thermal environment temperature is explored. The results reveal that the model parameters cause significant variations in the predicted QMA-EUR.

TI Demonstration of a general fault-tolerant quantum error detection code
   for (2n+1)-qubit entangled state on IBM 16-qubit quantum computer
SO IET QUANTUM COMMUNICATION
AB Quantum error detection has always been a fundamental challenge in a fault-tolerant quantum computer. Hence, it is of immense importance to detect and deal with arbitrary errors to efficiently perform quantum computation. Several error detection codes have been proposed and realised for lower number of qubit systems. Here we present an error detection code for a (2n + 1)-qubit entangled state using two syndrome qubits and simulate it on International Business Machines 16-qubit quantum computer for a 13-qubit entangled system. The code is able to detect an arbitrary quantum error in any one of the first 2n qubits of the (2n + 1)-qubit entangled state and detects any bit-flip error on the last qubit of the (2n + 1)-qubit entangled state via measurements on a pair of ancillary error syndrome qubits. The protocol presented here paves the way for designing error detection codes for the general higher number of entangled qubit systems.

AB Demonstrating small error rates by integrating quantum error correction (QEC) into an architecture of quantum computing is the next milestone towards scalable fault-tolerant quantum computing (FTQC). Encoding logical qubits with superconducting qubits and surface codes is considered a promising candidate for FTQC architectures. In this paper, we propose an FTQC architecture, which we call Q3DE, that enhances the tolerance to multi-bit burst errors (MBBEs) by cosmic rays with moderate changes and overhead. There are three core components in Q3DE: in-situ anomaly DEtection, dynamic code DEformation, and optimized error DEcoding. In this architecture, MBBEs are detected only from syndrome values for error correction. The effect of MBBEs is immediately mitigated by dynamically increasing the encoding level of logical qubits and re-estimating probable recovery operation with the rollback of the decoding process. We investigate the performance and overhead of the Q3DE architecture with quantum-error simulators and demonstrate that Q3DE effectively reduces the period of MBBEs by 1000 times and halves the size of their region. Therefore, Q3DE significantly relaxes the requirement of qubit density and qubit chip size to realize FTQC. Our scheme is versatile for mitigating MBBEs, i.e., temporal variations of error properties, on a wide range of physical devices and FTQC architectures since it relies only on the standard features of topological stabilizer codes.

TI Quantum dots as potential sources of strongly entangled photons:
   Perspectives and challenges for applications in quantum networks
SO APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS
AB The generation and long-haul transmission of highly entangled photon pairs is a cornerstone of emerging photonic quantum technologies with key applications such as quantum key distribution and distributed quantum computing. However, a natural limit for the maximum transmission distance is inevitably set by attenuation in the medium. A network of quantum repeaters containing multiple sources of entangled photons would allow overcoming this limit. For this purpose, the requirements on the source's brightness and the photon pairs' degree of entanglement and indistinguishability are stringent. Despite the impressive progress made so far, a definitive scalable photon source fulfilling such requirements is still being sought after. Semiconductor quantum dots excel in this context as sub-Poissonian sources of polarization entangled photon pairs. In this work, we present the state-of-the-art set by GaAs based quantum dots and use them as a benchmark to discuss the challenges toward the realization of practical quantum networks.

TI Generalization in quantum machine learning from few training data
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Modern quantum machine learning (QML) methods involve variationally optimizing a parameterized quantum circuit on a training data set, and subsequently making predictions on a testing data set (i.e., generalizing). In this work, we provide a comprehensive study of generalization performance in QML after training on a limited number N of training data points. We show that the generalization error of a quantum machine learning model with T trainable gates scales at worst as root T/N. When only K << T gates have undergone substantial change in the optimization process, we prove that the generalization error improves to root K/N. Our results imply that the compiling of unitaries into a polynomial number of native gates, a crucial application for the quantum computing industry that typically uses exponential-size training data, can be sped up significantly. We also show that classification of quantum states across a phase transition with a quantum convolutional neural network requires only a very small training data set. Other potential applications include learning quantum error correcting codes or quantum dynamical simulation. Our work injects new hope into the field of QML, as good generalization is guaranteed from few training data.

TI Hierarchical Quantum Network using Hybrid Entanglement
SO QUANTUM INFORMATION PROCESSING
AB The advent of a new kind of entangled state known as hybrid entangled state, i.e., entanglement between different degrees of freedom, makes it possible to perform various quantum computational and communication tasks with lesser amount of resources. Here, we aim to exploit the advantage of these entangled states in communication over quantum networks. Unfortunately, the entanglement shared over the network deteriorates due to its unavoidable interaction with surroundings. Thus, an entanglement concentration protocol is proposed to obtain a maximally entangled hybrid Omega-type state from the corresponding non-maximally entangled states. The advantage of the proposed entanglement concentration protocol is that it is feasible to implement this protocol with linear optical components and present technology. The corresponding linear optical quantum circuit is provided for experimental realizations, while the success probability of the concentration protocol is also reported. Thereafter, we propose an application of maximally entangled hybrid state in the hierarchical quantum teleportation network by performing information splitting using Omega-type state, which is also the first hierarchical quantum communication scheme in the hybrid domain so far. The present hybrid entangled state has advantage in circumventing Pauli operations on the coherent state by polarization rotation of single qubit, which can be performed with lesser errors.

AB In this paper, we propose OneQ, the first optimizing compilation framework for one-way quantum computation towards realistic photonic quantum architectures. Unlike previous compilation efforts for solid-state qubit technologies, our innovative framework addresses a unique set of challenges in photonic quantum computing. Specifically, this includes the dynamic generation of qubits over time, the need to perform all computation through measurements instead of relying on 1-qubit and 2-qubit gates, and the fact that photons are instantaneously destroyed after measurements. As pioneers in this field, we demonstrate the vast optimization potential of photonic one-way quantum computing, showcasing the remarkable ability of OneQ to reduce computing resource requirements by orders of magnitude.

TI Resource analysis and modifications of quantum computing with noisy
   qubits for elliptic curve discrete logarithms
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB We estimate the number of physical qubits and execution time by decomposing an implementation of Shor's algorithm for elliptic curve discrete logarithms into universal gate units at the logical level when surface codes are used. We herein also present modified quantum circuits for elliptic curve discrete logarithms and compare our results with those of the original quantum circuit implementations at the physical level. Through the analysis, we show that the use of more logical qubits in quantum algorithms does not always lead to the use of more physical qubits. We assumed using rotated surface code and logical qubits with all-to-all connectivity. The number of physical qubits and execution time are expressed in terms of bit length, physical gate error rate, and probability of algorithm failure. In addition, we compare our results with the number of physical qubits and execution time of Shor's factoring algorithm to assess the risk of attack by quantum computers in RSA and elliptic curve cryptography.

TI Determinate arbitrary quantum state engineering through one-dimensional
   quantum walks
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Efficient generation of arbitrary superposed quantum states in high-dimensional systems is crucial for various quantum technologies but remains fundamentally challenging because of the intricate and extensive parameter control. In this work, we propose a generalized discrete one-dimensional quantum walk model with time-and position-dependent coin operations, and varied shift lengths. This approach enables deterministic and direct preparation of any qudit state |phi > = Sigma(d-1)(k =0) ak|k > using binary or ternary tree structures, without solving quadratic equations. Our method requires only O(log d) steps and O(d) coin operations, significantly reducing the resource requirements compared to the previous approach of O(d) steps and O(d(2)) coin operations. Additionally, we propose an experimental scheme based on successive interferometers, demonstrating that our method is compatible with current state-of-the-art experimental technologies. This efficient method for preparing quantum superposition states lays a foundation for advancing quantum technologies, with broad applications in quantum information processing.

SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB The high-fidelity multi-ion entangled states and quantum gates are the basis for trapped-ion quantumcomputing. Among the developed quantum gate schemes, Molmer-Sorensen gate is a relatively matureexperimental technique to realize multi-ion entanglement and quantum logic gates. In recent years, there havealso been schemes to realize ultrafast quantum entanglement and quantum logic gates that operate outside theLamb-Dicke regime by designing ultrafast laser pulse sequences. In such a many-body quantum system, theseentanglement gates couple the spin states between ions by driving either the phonon energy level or themotional state of the ion chain. To improve the fidelity of quantum gates, the modulated laser pulses or theappropriately designed pulse sequences are applied to decouple the multi-mode motional states. In this review,we summarize and analyze the essential aspects of realizing these entanglement gates from both theoretical andexperimental points of view. We also reveal that the basic physical process of realizing quantum gates is toutilize nonlinear interactions in non-equilibrium processes through driving the motional states of an ion chainwith laser fields.

AB The quantum internet, which will be a hybrid of quantum and classical networks, is expected to provide information-theoretic security for data transmission. Classical networks have well-established protocols for reliable end-to-end transmission that use duplicating the classical bits implicitly. However, due to the no-cloning theorem, quantum bits (qubits) cannot be copied. In this paper, we propose to use a Universal Quantum Copying Machine (UQCM) to create imperfect clones and summarizes the Quantum Automatic Repeat Request (QARQ) protocol, which is inspired by its classical counterpart. To investigate the viability of QARQ, a simulation platform is created considering Nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center qubit platform that implements QARQ for quantum communication. The results explore the applications it is suitable for while maintaining enough quality of the qubit state. Two major quantum technologies are studied for these protocols: Direct Transmission (DT), and Teleportation (TP). It has been shown that for short distance communication DT provides better fidelity than TP while for long-distance communication TP outperforms DT and hence improves the QARQ performance as well.

AB For a number of useful quantum circuits, qudit constructions have been found which reduce resource requirements compared to the best known or best possible qubit construction. However, many of the necessary qutrit gates in these constructions have never been explicitly and efficiently constructed in a fault-tolerant manner. We show how to exactly and unitarily construct any qutrit multiple-controlled Clifford+T unitary using just Clifford+T gates and without using ancillae. The T-count to do so is polynomial in the number of controls k, scaling as O(k(3.585)). With our results we can construct ancilla-free Clifford+T implementations of multiple-controlled T gates as well as all versions of the qutrit multiple-controlled Toffoli, while the analogous results for qubits are impossible. As an application of our results, we provide a procedure to implement any ternary classical reversible function on n trits as an ancilla-free qutrit unitary using O(3(n)n(3.585)) T gates.

TI Bath dynamical decoupling with a quantum channel
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS A-MATHEMATICAL AND THEORETICAL
AB Bang-bang dynamical decoupling protects an open quantum system from decoherence due to its interaction with the surrounding bath/environment. In its standard form, this is achieved by strongly kicking the system with cycles of unitary operations, which average out the interaction Hamiltonian. In this paper, we generalize the notion of dynamical decoupling to repeated kicks with a quantum channel, which is applied to the bath. We derive necessary and sufficient conditions on the employed quantum channel and find that bath dynamical decoupling works if and only if the kick is ergodic. Furthermore, we study in which circumstances completely positive trace-preserving (CPTP) kicks on a mono-partite quantum system induce quantum Zeno dynamics with its Hamiltonian cancelled out. This does not require the ergodicity of the kicks, and the absence of decoherence-free subsystems is both necessary and sufficient. While the standard unitary dynamical decoupling is essentially the same as the quantum Zeno dynamics, our investigation implies that this is no longer true in the case of CPTP kicks. To derive our results, we prove some spectral properties of ergodic quantum channels, that might be of independent interest. Our approach establishes an enhanced and unified mathematical understanding of several recent experimental demonstrations and might form the basis of new dynamical decoupling schemes that harness environmental noise degrees of freedom.

TI Quantum Computing for Advanced Driver Assistance Systems and Autonomous
   Vehicles: A Review
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Advanced Driver Assistance System (ADAS) has become an essential feature in vehicles, and it is leading to the evolution of autonomous vehicles. But the technologies to implement ADAS suffer from certain inherent limitations, such as latency rate, computational speed, accuracy of the algorithm, security, and privacy, which are also the important factors for realizing full autonomous vehicles. With respect to these hindrances, an in-depth analysis of the existing research has shown that quantum machine learning (QML) can hold a powerful and alternate solution for the development of autonomous vehicles. The perks of quantum computation (QC) over classical systems are apparent with respect to security, privacy, and an exponentially high computation rate. The current review study underlines the benefits of quantum computation and asks for more QML research to improve real-time decision-making in autonomous vehicles, ultimately improving their safety and efficiency. The promise of quantum computing to handle the massive data and computational complexity that classical methods struggle with necessitates new studies in quantum machine learning (QML) for autonomous vehicles.

TI Optimizing Quantum Error-Correction Protocols with Erasure Qubits
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Erasure qubits offer a promising avenue toward reducing the overhead of quantum error correction (QEC) protocols. However, they require additional operations, such as erasure checks, that may add extra noise and increase the run-time of QEC protocols. To assess the benefits provided by erasure qubits, we focus on the performance of the surface code as a quantum memory. In particular, we analyze various erasure check schedules, find the correctable regions in the phase space of error parameters, and probe the subthreshold scaling of the logical error rate. We then consider a realization of erasure qubits in the superconducting hardware architectures via dual-rail qubits. We use the standard transmon-based implementation of the surface code as the performance benchmark. Our results indicate that QEC protocols with erasure qubits can outperform the ones with state-of-the-art transmons, even in the absence of precise information about the locations of erasure errors.

TI Authenticated Multiparty Quantum Key Agreement for Optical-Ring Quantum
   Communication Networks
SO FRONTIERS IN PHYSICS
AB Quantum communication networks are connected by various devices to achieve communication or distributed computing for users in remote locations. In order to solve the problem of generating temporary session key for secure communication in optical-ring quantum networks, a quantum key agreement protocol is proposed. In the key agreement protocols, an attacker can impersonate a legal user to participate in the negotiation process and eavesdrop the agreement key easily. This is often overlooked in most quantum key agreement protocols, which makes them insecure in practical implementation. Considering this problem, the function of authenticating the user's identity is added in the proposed protocol. Combining classical hash function with identity information, we design the authentication operation conforming to the characteristics of quantum search algorithm. In the security analysis of the proposed protocol, quantum state discrimination is utilized to show that the protocol is secure against common attacks and impersonation attack. In addition, only single photons need to be prepared and measured, which makes our protocol feasible with existing technology.

TI Free-Space Quantum Key Distribution with Single Photons from Defects in
   Hexagonal Boron Nitride
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB Efficient single photon generation is an important requirement for several practical applications in quantum technologies, including quantum cryptography. A proof-of-concept demonstration of free-space quantum key distribution (QKD) is presented with single photons generated from an isolated defect in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN). The bright source operating at room temperature is integrated into a QKD system based on B92 protocol and a sifted key rate of 238 bps with a quantum bit error rate of 8.95% are achieved at 1 MHz clock rate. The effect of temporal filtering of detected photons on the performance of QKD parameters is also studied. It is believed that these results will stimulate the research on optically active defects in hBN as well as other 2D-based quantum emitters and their applications within quantum information technologies including practical QKD systems.

TI Yoked surface codes
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB One of the biggest obstacles to building a large scale quantum computer is the high qubit cost of protecting quantum information. For two-dimensional architectures, the surface code has long been the leading candidate quantum memory, but can require upwards of a thousand physical qubits per logical qubit to reach algorithmically-relevant logical error rates. In this work, we introduce a hierarchical memory formed from surface codes concatenated into high-density parity check codes. These yoked surface codes are arrayed in a rectangular grid, with parity checks (yokes) measured along each row, and optionally along each column, using lattice surgery. Our construction assumes no additional connectivity beyond a nearest-neighbor square qubit grid operating at a physical error rate of 10-3. At algorithmically-relevant logical error rates, yoked surface codes use as few as one-third the number of physical qubits per logical qubit as standard surface codes, enabling moderate-overhead fault-tolerant quantum memories in two dimensions.

TI Integrated Non-Terrestrial and Terrestrial Quantum Anonymous Networks
SO IEEE NETWORK
AB Due to optical fiber limitations for quantum communication, global-scale quantum networks are possible only by integrating non-terrestrial components in the overall network architecture. Quantum networks are expected to support distributed tasks for quantum information processing, such as quantum sensing, control, communication, and computing. These networks enable emerging applications that are uniquely quantum or augmented by quantum mechanics. Leveraging quantum resources, anonymous networking can be enhanced to such an extent that even an adversary with control over all network resources cannot trace the message source, achieving perfect untraceability. To provide this untraceable global connectivity, we demonstrate the integration of non-terrestrial networks (NTNs) and terrestrial networks (TNs) for quantum anonymous communication (QAC), highlighting possible architectures and key challenges in these integrated NTN-TN quantum anonymous networks (QANs). To illustrate and benchmark the design of QAC protocols within integrated networks, we present essential quantum protocols such as anonymous conference key agreement (CKA) and anonymous broadcast. In the first case study, we propose a satellite-to-ground quantum anonymous CKA (QA-CKA) protocol and assess the anonymous key exchange rate. This QA-CKA protocol utilizes low Earth orbit satellites to generate anonymous keys among two distinct TN nodes. In the second case study, we develop an air-to-ground quantum anonymous broadcast (QAB) protocol and examine the anonymous broadcast announcement rate. This QAB protocol exploits unmanned aerial vehicles to enable a broadcasting party to transmit classical information anonymously across two distinct TNs. These QAC protocols are simulated with realistic integrated network parameters to provide practical estimates of achievable performance. Furthermore, we discuss future research directions for enabling integrated NTN-TN QANs.

TI Exploring Quantum Sensing Potential for Systems Applications
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB The current rise of quantum technology is compelled by quantum sensing research. Thousands of research labs are developing and testing a broad range of sensor prototypes. However, there is a lack of knowledge about specific applications and real-world use cases where the benefits of these sensors will be most pronounced. This study presents a comprehensive review of quantum sensing state-of-practice. It also provides a detailed analysis of how quantum sensing overcomes the existing limitations of sensor-driven systems' precision and performance. Based on the review of over 500 quantum sensor prototype reports, we determined four groups of quantum sensors and discussed their readiness for commercial usage. We concluded that quantum magnetometry and quantum optics are the most advanced sensing technologies with empirically proven results. In turn, quantum timing and kinetics are still in the early stages of practical validation. In addition, we defined four systems domains in which quantum sensors offer a solution for existing limitations of conventional sensing technologies. These domains are 1) GPS-free positioning and navigating services, 2) time-based operations, 3) topological visibility, and 4) environment detection, prediction, and modeling. Finally, we discussed the current constraints of quantum sensing technologies and offered directions for future research.

TI Numerical hardware-efficient variational quantum simulation of a soliton
   solution
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Implementing variational quantum algorithms with noisy intermediate-scale quantum machines of up to a hundred qubits is nowadays considered as one of the most promising routes towards achieving a quantum practical advantage. In multiqubit circuits, running advanced quantum algorithms is hampered by the noise inherent to quantum gates which distances us from the idea of universal quantum computing. Based on a one-dimensional quantum spin chain with competing symmetric and asymmetric pairwise exchange interactions, herein we discuss the capabilities of quantum algorithms with special attention paid to a hardware-efficient variational eigensolver. A delicate interplay between magnetic interactions allows one to stabilize a chiral state that destroys the homogeneity of magnetic ordering, thus making this solution highly entangled. Quantifying entanglement in terms of quantum concurrence, we argue that, while being capable of correctly reproducing a uniform magnetic configuration, the hardware-efficient Ansatz meets difficulties in providing a detailed description to a noncollinear magnetic structure. The latter naturally limits the application range of variational quantum computing to solve quantum simulation tasks.

TI Suppressing Decoherence in Quantum State Transfer with Unitary
   Operations
SO ENTROPY
AB Decoherence is the fundamental obstacle limiting the performance of quantum information processing devices. The problem of transmitting a quantum state (known or unknown) from one place to another is of great interest in this context. In this work, by following the recent theoretical proposal, we study an application of quantum state-dependent pre- and post-processing unitary operations for protecting the given (multi-qubit) quantum state against the effect of decoherence acting on all qubits. We observe the increase in the fidelity of the output quantum state both in a quantum emulation experiment, where all protecting unitaries are perfect, and in a real experiment with a cloud-accessible quantum processor, where protecting unitaries themselves are affected by the noise. We expect the considered approach to be useful for analyzing capabilities of quantum information processing devices in transmitting known quantum states. We also demonstrate the applicability of the developed approach for suppressing decoherence in the process of distributing a two-qubit state over remote physical qubits of a quantum processor.

TI Research on Quantum Annealing Integer Factorization Based on Different
   Columns
SO FRONTIERS IN PHYSICS
AB The majority of scholars believe that Shor's algorithm is a unique and powerful quantum algorithm for RSA cryptanalysis, so current postquantum cryptography research has largely considered only the potential threats of Shor's algorithm. This paper verifies the feasibility of deciphering RSA public key cryptography based on D-Wave, which is the second most effective RSA attack method after Shor's algorithm. This paper proposes the influence of different column methods on the final integer factorization, puts forward a new dimension reduction formula, simplifies the integer factorization model based on quantum annealing, simulates it with the qbsolv quantum computing software environment provided by D-Wave, and factors the integer 1630729 (an 11-bit prime factor multiplied by an 11-bit prime factor). The research results show that choosing an appropriate number of columns and column width in the binary integer factorization multiplication table is very important for studying the optimization ability of the quantum annealing algorithm. In fact, Science, Nature, IEEE Spectrum, and the National Academies of Sciences (NAS) are consistent in asserting that the practical application of general-purpose quantum computers is far in the future. Therefore, although D-Wave computers were initially mainly purchased by Lockheed Martin, Google, etc., for purposes such as image processing, machine learning, combinatorial optimization, and software verification, post quantum cryptography research should further consider the potential of the D-Wave quantum computer in deciphering RSA cryptosystems in the future, and a discussion of this potential is one of the contributions of this paper.

TI Continuous Optical-to-Mechanical Quantum State Transfer in the
   Unresolved Sideband Regime
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB (Received January accepted published 2023) Optical-to-mechanical quantum state transfer is an important capability for future quantum networks, quantum communication, and distributed quantum sensing. However, existing continuous state transfer protocols operate in the resolved sideband regime, necessitating a high-quality optical cavity and a high mechanical resonance frequency. Here, we propose a continuous protocol that operates in the unresolved sideband regime. The protocol is based on feedback cooling, can be implemented with current technology, and is able to transfer non-Gaussian quantum states with high fidelity. Our protocol significantly expands the kinds of optomechanical devices for which continuous optical-to-mechanical state transfer is possible, paving the way toward quantum technological applications and the preparation of macroscopic super-positions to test the fundamentals of quantum science.

TI Autonomous error correction of a single logical qubit using two
   transmons
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Large-scale quantum computers will inevitably need quantum error correction to protect information against decoherence. Traditional error correction typically requires many qubits, along with high-efficiency error syndrome measurement and real-time feedback. Autonomous quantum error correction instead uses steady-state bath engineering to perform the correction in a hardware-efficient manner. In this work, we develop a new autonomous quantum error correction scheme that actively corrects single-photon loss and passively suppresses low-frequency dephasing, and we demonstrate an important experimental step towards its full implementation with transmons. Compared to uncorrected encoding, improvements are experimentally witnessed for the logical zero, one, and superposition states. Our results show the potential of implementing hardware-efficient autonomous quantum error correction to enhance the reliability of a transmon-based quantum information processor.
   Autonomous quantum error correction protects quantum systems against decoherence through engineered dissipation. Here the authors introduce the Star code, which actively corrects single-photon loss and passively suppresses low-frequency dephasing and implement it in a two-transmon device.

TI Machine learning for continuous quantum error correction on
   superconducting qubits
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB Continuous quantum error correction has been found to have certain advantages over discrete quantum error correction, such as a reduction in hardware resources and the elimination of error mechanisms introduced by having entangling gates and ancilla qubits. We propose a machine learning algorithm for continuous quantum error correction that is based on the use of a recurrent neural network to identify bit-flip errors from continuous noisy syndrome measurements. The algorithm is designed to operate on measurement signals deviating from the ideal behavior in which the mean value corresponds to a code syndrome value and the measurement has white noise. We analyze continuous measurements taken from a superconducting architecture using three transmon qubits to identify three significant practical examples of non-ideal behavior, namely auto-correlation at temporal short lags, transient syndrome dynamics after each bit-flip, and drift in the steady-state syndrome values over the course of many experiments. Based on these real-world imperfections, we generate synthetic measurement signals from which to train the recurrent neural network, and then test its proficiency when implementing active error correction, comparing this with a traditional double threshold scheme and a discrete Bayesian classifier. The results show that our machine learning protocol is able to outperform the double threshold protocol across all tests, achieving a final state fidelity comparable to the discrete Bayesian classifier.

So far, the quantum Fredkin gate has only been demonstrated with pre-entangled input states in free-space optics, which limits its usage for independent input photons. Here, we put forward an exquisite scheme and experimentally perform a proof-of-principle demonstration of three-qubit Fredkin and Toffoli gates on a programmable quantum photonic chip. Our scheme can also be used to realize a series of other two-qubit quantum gates.

TI Towards Building a Facial Identification System Using Quantum Machine
   Learning Techniques
SO JOURNAL OF ADVANCES IN INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY
AB In the modern world, facial identification is an extremely important task, in which many applications rely on high performing algorithms to detect faces efficiently. Whilst commonly used classical methods of SVM and k-NN may perform to a good standard, they are often highly complex and take substantial computing power to run effectively. With the rise of quantum computing boasting large speedups without sacrificing large amounts of much needed performance, we aim to explore the benefits that quantum machine learning techniques can bring when specifically targeted towards facial identification applications. In the following work, we explore a quantum scheme which uses fidelity estimations of feature vectors in order to determine the classification result. Here, we are able to achieve exponential speedups by utilizing the principles of quantum computing without sacrificing large proportions of performance in terms of classification accuracy. We also propose limitations of the work and where some future efforts should be placed in order to produce robust quantum algorithms that can perform to the same standard as classical methods whilst utilizing the speedup performance gains.

AB Quantum information processing systems rely on a broad range of microwave technologies and have spurred development of microwave devices and methods in new operating regimes. Here we review the use of microwave signals and systems in quantum computing, with specific reference to three leading quantum computing platforms: trapped atomic ion qubits, spin qubits in semiconductors, and superconducting qubits. We highlight some key results and progress in quantum computing achieved through the use of microwave systems, and discuss how quantum computing applications have pushed the frontiers of microwave technology in some areas. We also describe open microwave engineering challenges for the construction of large-scale, fault-tolerant quantum computers.

TI The XZZX surface code
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Performing large calculations with a quantum computer will likely require a fault-tolerant architecture based on quantum error-correcting codes. The challenge is to design practical quantum error-correcting codes that perform well against realistic noise using modest resources. Here we show that a variant of the surface code-the XZZX code-offers remarkable performance for fault-tolerant quantum computation. The error threshold of this code matches what can be achieved with random codes (hashing) for every single-qubit Pauli noise channel; it is the first explicit code shown to have this universal property. We present numerical evidence that the threshold even exceeds this hashing bound for an experimentally relevant range of noise parameters. Focusing on the common situation where qubit dephasing is the dominant noise, we show that this code has a practical, high-performance decoder and surpasses all previously known thresholds in the realistic setting where syndrome measurements are unreliable. We go on to demonstrate the favourable sub-threshold resource scaling that can be obtained by specialising a code to exploit structure in the noise. We show that it is possible to maintain all of these advantages when we perform fault-tolerant quantum computation. The surface code is a keystone in quantum error correction, but it does not generally perform well against structured noise and suffers from large overheads. Here, the authors demonstrate that a variant of it has better performance and requires fewer resources, without additional hardware demands.

TI Nonlinear Quantum Photonics With AlGaAs Bragg-Reflection Waveguides
SO JOURNAL OF LIGHTWAVE TECHNOLOGY
AB Integrated photonics is playing a key role in the development of quantum technologies covering applications ranging from quantum communication to computing and from simulations to sensing. In this context, material platforms enabling the chip-scale integration of quantum components are a key issue on the way towards real-world and large-scale technological implementations. In this paper, we review our last achievements on AlGaAs Bragg reflection waveguides emitting nonclassical states of light by spontaneous parametric down conversion. The choice of this platform combines the advantages of a mature fabrication technology, room temperature operation, emission in the telecom C-Band and compliance with electrical injection. We demonstrate the ability of these devices to generate a large variety of quantum states spanning from biphoton frequency combs to broadband polarization entanglement enabling promising applications in quantum processing as well as flexible quantum networks.

TI Universal set of quantum gates for the flip-flop qubit in the presence
   of 1/f noise
SO EPJ QUANTUM TECHNOLOGY
AB Impurities hosted in semiconducting solid matrices represent an extensively studied platform for quantum computing applications. In this scenario, the so-called flip-flop qubit emerges as a convenient choice for scalable implementations in silicon. Flip-flop qubits are realized implanting phosphorous donor in isotopically purified silicon, and encoding the logical states in the donor nuclear spin and in its bound electron. Electrically modulating the hyperfine interaction by applying a vertical electric field causes an Electron Dipole Spin Resonance (EDSR) transition between the states with antiparallel spins {vertical bar down arrow up arrow >, vertical bar down arrow up arrow >}, that are chosen as the logical states. When two qubits are considered, the dipole-dipole interaction is exploited to establish long-range coupling between them. A universal set of quantum gates for flip-flop qubits is here proposed and the effect of a realistic 1/f noise on the gate fidelity is investigated for the single qubit R-z (-pi/2) and Hadamard gate and for the two-qubit root iSWAP gate.

TI Entanglement of Signal Paths via Noisy Superconducting Quantum Devices
SO ENTROPY
AB Quantum routers will provide for important functionality in emerging quantum networks, and the deployment of quantum routing in real networks will initially be realized on low-complexity (few-qubit) noisy quantum devices. A true working quantum router will represent a new application for quantum entanglement-the coherent superposition of multiple communication paths traversed by the same quantum signal. Most end-user benefits of this application are yet to be discovered, but a few important use-cases are now known. In this work, we investigate the deployment of quantum routing on low-complexity superconducting quantum devices. In such devices, we verify the quantum nature of the routing process as well as the preservation of the routed quantum signal. We also implement quantum random access memory, a key application of quantum routing, on these same devices. Our experiments then embed a five-qubit quantum error-correcting code within the router, outlining the pathway for error-corrected quantum routing. We detail the importance of the qubit-coupling map for a superconducting quantum device that hopes to act as a quantum router, and experimentally verify that optimizing the number of controlled-X gates decreases hardware errors that impact routing performance. Our results indicate that near-term realization of quantum routing using noisy superconducting quantum devices within real-world quantum networks is possible.

TI Quantum key recovery under plaintext-checking attacks on post-quantum
   cryptosystems
SO QUANTUM INFORMATION PROCESSING
AB Coping with the potential security threats arising from quantum computing, American National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) recently launched a post-quantum cryptography (PQC) standardization project with the goal to standardize new next-generation public-key cryptosystems. In particular, many NIST-PQC cryptosystems follow the same meta-cryptosystem. At EUROCRYPT 2019, B & abreve;etu et al. analyzed the security of meta-cryptosystem under key reuse by mounting a classical key recovery under plaintext-checking attacks (KR-PCA) and a quantum key recovery under chosen-ciphertext attacks (KR-CCA). Their results showed that quantum KR-CCA is much more efficient than classical KR-PCA. But, KR-PCA is more threatening than KR-CCA since KR-PCA just needs plaintext-checking oracle that tells whether a given ciphertext correctly decrypts to a given plaintext, while KR-CCA requires a full decryption oracle. This paper proposes a quantum KR-PCA algorithm and shows that quantum KR-PCA still outperforms classical KR-PCA. In detail, firstly, we transform the noise learning problem (the core to implement KR-PCA) into an ordered search problem. Based on the quantum algorithm for solving the ordered search problem, we solve the noise learning problems using quantum algorithms. Then, based on this quantum algorithm, we develop a quantum KR-PCA for meta-cryptosystem under key reuse, where the number of the oracle queries is about one third of the one required by classical KR-PCA. In addition, we also show that such an improvement cannot be further significantly improved for quantum adversaries. Finally, applying to 8 concrete NIST-PQC cryptosystems, we show that our quantum KR-PCA will save at least half of the running times and the oracle queries.

TI Concurrence percolation threshold of large-scale quantum networks
SO COMMUNICATIONS PHYSICS
AB The move to the quantum internet demands developments in communication networks that are based on quantum entanglement. The authors discuss the phenomenon of entanglement percolation in a quantum network presenting solutions to significantly accelerate the intensive computation effort involved in the process.
   Quantum networks describe communication networks that are based on quantum entanglement. A concurrence percolation theory has been recently developed to determine the required entanglement to enable communication between two distant stations in an arbitrary quantum network. Unfortunately, concurrence percolation has been calculated only for very small networks or large networks without loops. Here, we develop a set of mathematical tools for approximating the concurrence percolation threshold for unprecedented large-scale quantum networks by estimating the path-length distribution, under the assumption that all paths between a given pair of nodes have no overlap. We show that our approximate method agrees closely with analytical results from concurrence percolation theory. The numerical results we present include 2D square lattices of 200(2) nodes and complex networks of up to 10(4) nodes. The entanglement percolation threshold of a quantum network is a crucial parameter for constructing a real-world communication network based on entanglement, and our method offers a significant speed-up for the intensive computations involved.

AB Teleportation, a novel scheme, initially posited by Bennett et.al, has been studied here in the context of sending a single qutrit from Alice to Bob using two qutrit entangled channels as resources. In this paper we have considered two special two qutrit entangled states, which belong to SU(3) group, as useful resources for teleportation. For the successful teleportation, these entangled states have been chosen as quantum channels shared between Alice and Bob. Another entangled basis of two qutrit states have been used as auxiliary states, which would help Alice to manipulate with her channel so that the single qutrit she holds can be successfully teleported to Bob. Bob's choices of measurement operators influence the retrieval of Alice's single qutrit.

TI Simulator Demonstration of Large Scale Variational Quantum Algorithm on
   HPC Cluster
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Advances in quantum simulator technology are increasingly required because research on quantum algorithms is becoming more sophisticated and complex. State vector simulation utilizes CPU and memory resources in computing nodes exponentially with respect to the number of qubits; furthermore, in a variational quantum algorithm, the large number of repeated runs by classical optimization is also a heavy load. This problem has been addressed by preparing numerous computing nodes or simulation frameworks that operate effectively. This study aimed to accelerate quantum simulation using two newly proposed methods: to efficiently utilize limited computational resources by adjusting the ratio of the MPI and distributed processing parallelism corresponding to the target problem settings and to slim down the Hamiltonian by considering the effect of accuracy on the calculation result. Ground-state energy calculations of a fermionic model were performed using a variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) on an HPC cluster with up to 1024 FUJITSU Processor A64FX connected to each other by InfiniBand; the processor is also used on supercomputer Fugaku. We achieved 200 times higher speed over VQE simulations and demonstrated 32 qubits ground-state energy calculations in acceptable time. This result indicates that > 30 qubit state vector simulations can be realistically utilized for further research on variational quantum algorithms.

TI Holographic quantum algorithms for simulating correlated spin systems
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB We present a suite of "holographic" quantum algorithms for efficient ground-state preparation and dynamical evolution of correlated spin systems, which require far fewer qubits than the number of spins being simulated. The algorithms exploit the equivalence between matrix-product states (MPS) and quantum channels, along with partial measurement and qubit reuse, in order to simulate a D-dimensional spin system using only a (D - 1)-dimensional subset of qubits along with an ancillary qubit register whose size scales logarithmically in the amount of entanglement present in the simulated state. Ground states can either be directly prepared from a known MPS representation or obtained via a holographic variational quantum eigensolver (holoVQE). Dynamics of MPS under local Hamiltonians for time t can also be simulated with an additional (multiplicative) poly(t ) overhead in qubit resources. These techniques open the door to efficient quantum simulation of MPS with exponentially large bond dimension, including ground states of two- and three-dimensional systems, or thermalizing dynamics with rapid entanglement growth. As a demonstration of the potential resource savings, we implement a holoVQE simulation of the antiferromagnetic Heisenberg chain on a trapped-ion quantum computer, achieving within 10(3)% of the exact ground-state energy of an infinite chain using only a pair of qubits.

TI Optimizing Gate Decomposition for High-Level Quantum Programming
SO QUANTUM
AB This paper presents novel methods for optimizing multi-controlled quantum gates, which naturally arise in high-level quantum programming. Our primary approach involves rewriting U(2) gates as SU(2) gates, utilizing one auxiliary qubit for phase correction. This reduces the number of CNOT gates required to decompose any multi-controlled quantum gate from O(n2) to at most 32n. Additionally, we can reduce the number of CNOTs for multi-controlled Pauli gates from 16n to 12n and propose an optimization to reduce the number of controlled gates in high-level quantum programming. We have implemented these optimizations in the Ket quantum programming platform and demonstrated significant reductions in the number of gates. For instance, for a Grover's algorithm layer with 114 qubits, we achieved a reduction in the number of CNOTs from 101,252 to 2,684. This reduction in the number of gates significantly impacts the execution time of quantum algorithms, thereby enhancing the feasibility of executing them on NISQ computers.

TI Quantum correlation in a nano-electro-optomechanical system enhanced by
   an optical parametric amplifier and Coulomb-type interaction
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB In this paper, we investigated the quantum correlation of nano-electro-optomechanical system enhanced by an optical parametric amplifier (OPA) and Coulomb-type interaction. In particular, we consider a hybrid system consisting of a cavity and two charged mechanical oscillators with an OPA, where the optical cavity mode is coupled with a charged mechanical oscillator via radiation pressure, and the two charged mechanical oscillators are coupled through a Coulomb interaction. We use logarithmic negativity to quantify quantum entanglement, and quantum discord to measure the quantumness correlation between the two mechanical oscillators. We characterize quantum steering using the steerability between the two mechanical oscillators. Our results show that the presence of OPA and strong Coulomb coupling enhances the quantum correlations between the two mechanical oscillators. In addition, Coulomb interactions are more prominent in quantum correlations. Besides, in the presence of OPA, the maximum amount of quantum entanglement, quantum steering, and quantum discord were achieved between the two mechanical oscillators is greater than in the absence of OPA. Moreover, a proper phase choice of the optical field driving the OPA enhances quantum correlations under suitable conditions. We obtain quantum entanglement confines quantum steering and quantum discord beyond entanglement. Furthermore, quantum entanglement, quantum steering, and quantum discord decrease rapidly with increasing temperature as a result of decoherence. In addition, quantum discord persists at higher temperature values, although the quantum entanglement between the systems also vanishes completely. Our proposed scheme enhances quantum correlation and proves robust against fluctuations in the bath environment. We believe that the present scheme of quantum correlation provides a promising platform for the realization of continuous variable quantum information processing.

TI Neural-enabled quantum information hiding with error-correcting codes: a
   novel framework for arbitrary quantum state embedding
SO EPJ QUANTUM TECHNOLOGY
AB Quantum information hiding, as an extension of classical information hiding techniques into the realm of quantum information, currently focuses on embedding classical bits (0/1) within quantum carriers. This includes methods such as disguising classical secret information as channel noise and embedding it within quantum error correction codes. However, the embedding mechanism for arbitrary quantum states alpha|0 >+beta|1 >\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$\alpha |0\rangle + \beta |1\rangle $\end{document} is still in the exploratory stage. This paper proposes an innovative framework that leverages the redundant space of quantum error correction codes to construct a nonlinear decoding architecture with quantum neural networks. This approach simultaneously achieves both carrier state error correction and secret state embedding and extraction functions. Specifically, the [5,1,3] stabilizer code is used as the carrier, with secret state embedding achieved through single-qubit substitution, and a quantum autoencoder is designed for steganographic state information decoding. The proposed framework features fully quantum-based input/output systems, overcoming the limitations of traditional variational quantum circuits that rely on probabilistic measurements for output generation. By performing full ground-state measurements at the autoencoder bottleneck layer and optimizing the parallel sub-network architecture, the network achieves efficient convergence and effective extraction of single-copy quantum states. Experimental results show that under the conditions of optimized parameters and data size of 20, the training losses for the carrier and secret states are 0.03 and 0.08, respectively, with test fidelities of 0.92 and 0.93. For a data size of 50, the secret states recovery fidelity exceeds 0.87. KS test analysis indicates that the full ground-state measurement and parallel sub-network are key strategies for achieving network performance. Equivalent error analysis shows that this approach successfully utilizes the potential redundant space of quantum error correction codes, providing new research directions for quantum state information hiding.

TI Tunable quantum logic gate on photonic qubits with a ladder emitter
SO APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS
AB We describe how a ladder emitter can implement a tunable quantum logic gate on photonic qubits encoded in the frequency basis. The ground-to-first excited state of the ladder emitter interacts with the control photon, and the first-to-second excited state transition interacts with the target photon. By controlling the relative detuning between the target photon and the first-to-second excited state transition of the ladder emitter, we enable any controlled-phase operation from 0 to pi. We derive analytical formulas for the performance of the gate through the S-matrix formalism as well as describe the mechanism intuitively. This gate is deterministic, does not utilize any active control, and needs only a single ladder emitter, enabling low-footprint and more efficient decomposition of quantum circuits, especially the quantum Fourier transform. We suggest multiple potential systems for physical realization of our proposal, such as lanthanide ions embedded in Purcell-enhanced cavities. We expect these results to motivate further interest in photonic quantum information processing with designer emitters. (C) 2022 Author(s).

TI Quantum internet under random breakdowns and intentional attacks
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Quantum networks (QNs) will play a key role in distributed quantum information processing. As the network size increases, network-level errors like random breakdown and intentional attack are inevitable; therefore, it is important to understand the robustness of large-scale QNs, similar to what has been done for the classical counterpart-the internet. For exponential networks such as Waxman networks, errors simply re-parameterize the network and lead to a linear decrease of the quantum capacity with the probability of error. The same linear decay happens for scale-free QNs under random breakdowns, despite the previously discovered robustness in terms of the connectivity. In presence of attack, however, the capacity of scale-free QNs shows a sharp exponential decay with the increasing attack fraction. Our results apply to quantum internet based on fibers for all kinds of quantum communications and provide implications for the future construction of QNs with regard to its robustness.

TI 2023 roadmap for materials for quantum technologies
SO MATERIALS FOR QUANTUM TECHNOLOGY
AB Quantum technologies are poised to move the foundational principles of quantum physics to the forefront of applications. This roadmap identifies some of the key challenges and provides insights on material innovations underlying a range of exciting quantum technology frontiers. Over the past decades, hardware platforms enabling different quantum technologies have reached varying levels of maturity. This has allowed for first proof-of-principle demonstrations of quantum supremacy, for example quantum computers surpassing their classical counterparts, quantum communication with reliable security guaranteed by laws of quantum mechanics, and quantum sensors uniting the advantages of high sensitivity, high spatial resolution, and small footprints. In all cases, however, advancing these technologies to the next level of applications in relevant environments requires further development and innovations in the underlying materials. From a wealth of hardware platforms, we select representative and promising material systems in currently investigated quantum technologies. These include both the inherent quantum bit systems and materials playing supportive or enabling roles, and cover trapped ions, neutral atom arrays, rare earth ion systems, donors in silicon, color centers and defects in wide-band gap materials, two-dimensional materials and superconducting materials for single-photon detectors. Advancing these materials frontiers will require innovations from a diverse community of scientific expertise, and hence this roadmap will be of interest to a broad spectrum of disciplines.

TI Enhanced Uplink Quantum Communication With Satellites via Downlink
   Channels
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM ENGINEERING
AB In developing the global quantum Internet, quantum communication with low-earth-orbit satellites will play a pivotal role. Such communication will need to be two way: effective not only in the satellite-to-ground (downlink) channel but also in the ground-to-satellite channel (uplink). Given that losses on this latter channel are significantly larger relative to the former, techniques that can exploit the superior downlink to enhance quantum communication in the uplink should be explored. In this article, we do just that-exploring how continuous-variable entanglement in the form of two-mode-squeezed vacuum (TMSV) states can be used to significantly enhance the fidelity of ground-to-satellite quantum-state transfer relative to direct uplink-transfer. More specifically, through detailed phase-screen simulations of beam evolution through turbulent atmospheres in both the downlink and uplink channels, we demonstrate how a TMSV teleportation channel, created by the satellite, can be used to dramatically improve the fidelity of uplink coherent-state transfer relative to direct transfer. We then show how this, in turn, leads to the uplink-transmission of a higher alphabet of coherent states. Additionally, we show how non-Gaussian operations, acting on the received component of the TMSV state at the ground station, can lead to further enhancement of the fidelity. Since TMSV states can readily be produced in situ on a satellite platform and form a reliable teleportation channel for most quantum states, our work suggests that future satellites forming part of the emerging quantum Internet should be designed with uplink-communication via quantum teleportation in mind.

TI Characterization of a Transmon Qubit in a 3D Cavity for Quantum Machine
   Learning and Photon Counting
SO APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
AB In this paper, we report the use of a superconducting transmon qubit in a 3D cavity for quantum machine learning and photon counting applications. We first describe the realization and characterization of a transmon qubit coupled to a 3D resonator, providing a detailed description of the simulation framework and of the experimental measurement of important parameters, such as the dispersive shift and the qubit anharmonicity. We then report on a Quantum Machine Learning application implemented on a single-qubit device to fit the u-quark parton distribution function of the proton. In the final section of the manuscript, we present a new microwave photon detection scheme based on two qubits coupled to the same 3D resonator. This could in principle decrease the dark count rate, favoring applications like axion dark matter searches.

TI Room-temperature waveguide integrated quantum register in a
   semiconductor photonic platform
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Quantum photonic integrated circuits are reshaping quantum networks and sensing by providing compact, efficient platforms for practical quantum applications. Despite continuous breakthroughs, integrating entangled registers into photonic devices on a CMOS-compatible platform presents significant challenges. Herein, we present single electron-nuclear spin entanglement and its integration into a silicon-carbide-on-insulator (SiCOI) waveguide. We demonstrate the successful generation of single divacancy electron spins and near-unity spin initialization of single 13C nuclear spins. Both single nuclear and electron spin can be coherently controlled and a maximally entangled state with a fidelity of 0.89 has been prepared under ambient conditions. Based on the nanoscale positioning techniques, the entangled quantum register has been further integrated into SiC photonic waveguides for the first time. We find that the intrinsic optical and spin characteristics of the register are well preserved and the fidelity of the entangled state remains as high as 0.88. Our findings highlight the promising prospects of the SiCOI platform as a compelling candidate for future scalable quantum photonic applications.
   Silicon-carbide-on-insulator is a promising platform for scalable quantum photonic circuits. Here the authors demonstrate the integration of a single electron-nuclear spin register into silicon-carbide-on-insulator waveguides, which is an important step toward CMOS-compatible quantum photonic devices.

TI Improved Differential Privacy Noise Mechanism in Quantum Machine
   Learning
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Quantum computing, as an emerging research field, is attracting people's attention. It has been proven to be superior in many ways to classical computing. Differential privacy provides an easy way to achieve demonstrable privacy, and the most common method is to add noise to datasets. At this stage of quantum computers, noise is a factor that cannot be ignored. Indeed, the existence of noise will negatively affect the performance of quantum computers, but we can apply it to privacy protection. In this work, we will consider two situations: inherent noise and artificially added noise. The noise is added to the variational quantum algorithm to implement quantum machine learning with differential privacy. The importance of each type will be examined and less artificial noise is needed for a common privacy budget over classical machine learning. Composition theory will be invoked to prove the advantage of the entire quantum machine learning process.

TI Trade off-free entanglement stabilization in a superconducting
   qutrit-qubit system
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB The approach to stabilizing a quantum state by coupling to engineered reservoirs is limited by a trade-off between state fidelity and stabilization rate. Here the authors implement a protocol based on parametric system-bath coupling to achieve fast and high-fidelity Bell state stabilization in a qutrit-qubit system.
   Quantum reservoir engineering is a powerful framework for autonomous quantum state preparation and error correction. However, traditional approaches to reservoir engineering are hindered by unavoidable coherent leakage out of the target state, which imposes an inherent trade off between achievable steady-state state fidelity and stabilization rate. In this work we demonstrate a protocol that achieves trade off-free Bell state stabilization in a qutrit-qubit system realized on a circuit-QED platform. We accomplish this by creating a purely dissipative channel for population transfer into the target state, mediated by strong parametric interactions coupling the second-excited state of a superconducting transmon and the engineered bath resonator. Our scheme achieves a state preparation fidelity of 84% with a stabilization time constant of 339 ns, leading to a 54 ns error-time product in a solid-state quantum information platform.

TI Multidimensional Fourier series with quantum circuits
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Quantum machine learning is the field that aims to integrate machine learning with quantum computation. In recent years, the field has emerged as an active research area with the potential to bring new insights to classical machine learning problems. One of the challenges in the field is to explore the expressibility of parametrized quantum circuits and their ability to be universal function approximators, as classical neural networks are. Recent works have shown that, with a quantum supervised learning model, we can fit any one-dimensional Fourier series, proving their universality. However, models for multidimensional functions have not been explored in the same level of detail. In this work, we study the expressibility of various types of circuit Ansatze that generate multidimensional Fourier series. We found that, for some Ansatze, the degrees of freedom required for fitting such functions grow faster than the available degrees in the Hilbert space generated by the circuits. For example, single-qudit models have limited power to represent arbitrary multidimensional Fourier series. Despite this, we show that we can enlarge the Hilbert space of the circuit by using more qudits or higher local dimensions to meet the degrees of freedom requirements, thus ensuring the universality of the models.

TI Qubit Geometry through Holomorphic Quantization
SO QUANTUM INFORMATION & COMPUTATION
AB We develop a wave mechanics formalism for qubit geometry using holomorphic functions and M & ouml;bius transformations, providing a geometric perspective on quantum computation. This framework extends the standard Hilbert space description, offering a natural interpretation of standard quantum gates on the Riemann sphere that is examined through their M & ouml;bius action on holomorphic wavefunction. These wavefunctions emerge via a quantization process, with the Riemann sphere serving as the classical phase space of the qubit geometry. We quantize this space using Isham's canonical group quantization with holomorphic polarization, yielding holomorphic wavefunctions and spin angular momentum operators that recover the standard SU(2) algebra with interesting geometric properties. Such properties reveal how geometric transformations induce quantum logic gates on the Riemann sphere, providing a novel perspective on quantum information processing. This result provides a new direction for exploring quantum computation through Isham's canonical group quantization and its holomorphic polarization method.

In this study, we propose a method for solving the inverse kinematics of a robot using quantum computing. The approach leverages the ability of qubits to represent points on a sphere in three-dimensional space. Forward kinematics calculations are performed using qubits that encode the posture of each robot link, while inverse kinematics solutions are obtained through iterative optimization on a classical computer. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the robot's end-effector position can be effectively represented using a 2-qubit rotation gate, where the root joint angle influences the tip joint angle, resulting in accelerated convergence during inverse kinematics optimization. The proposed method was validated on an actual quantum computer, confirming its feasibility and efficiency. These findings suggest that hybrid quantum-classical approaches can enhance robotic motion planning and optimization in future quantum computing applications.

TI Quantum entanglement in the triangle network
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Beyond future applications, quantum networks open interesting fundamental perspectives, notably novel forms of quantum correlations. In this Letter we discuss quantum correlations in networks from the perspective of the underlying quantum states and their entanglement. We address the questions of which states can be prepared in the so-called triangle network, consisting of three nodes connected pairwise by three sources. We derive necessary criteria for a state to be preparable in such a network, considering both cases where the sources are statistically independent and classically correlated. This shows that the network structure imposes strong and nontrivial constraints on the set of preparable states, fundamentally different from the standard characterization of multipartite quantum entanglement.

TI Estimating the Number of Junta Variables for Optimizing Boolean
   Functions in Quantum Memories
SO MATHEMATICS
AB Optimizing Boolean function components to have the minimum number of inputs in order to reduce the memory space required during these functions in computing devices is a significant demand. This paper proposes a quantum computation approach based on the degree-of-entanglement quantum computation model to estimate the number of junta variables of an unknown Boolean function presented through an oracle. The time complexity of the developed quantum approach is independent of the number of inputs and depends on an allowable assigned error & varepsilon;. Thus, the time complexity of the developed algorithm is O(& varepsilon;-2), compared to O(2n+1) in the traditional approach. Also, the memory space of the developed approach is linear, O(2n+4), in terms of the number of inputs compared to the exponential memory space O(2n+1) using the traditional approach. Therefore, the developed quantum approach has exponential supremacy in comparison to the traditional approach. The developed approach was implemented practically using both the Qiskit simulator and the IBM real quantum computer. The obtained results expose high statistical fidelities between the empirical and theoretical results.

TI n-qubit operations on sphere and queueing scaling limits for
   programmable quantum computer
SO QUANTUM INFORMATION PROCESSING
AB We derive a general spherical coordinate formula for a quantum state of n-qubit register and study n-qubit operation rules on (n + 1)-sphere with the target to help developing a (photon or other technique)-based programmable quantum computer. The newly developed angle-based n-qubit operation rules are simple and efficient, which reduce the complicated quantum multiplication and division operations to simple addition and subtraction operations just like those used in a conventional computer. The rules for n-qubit operations are realized through measurement-based feedback controls and quantum entanglements. In the meanwhile, we derive the scaling limits (called reflecting Gaussian random fields on a (n + 1)-sphere) for n-qubit quantum computer-based queueing systems under two different heavy traffic regimes. The queueing systems are with multiple classes of users and batch quantum random walks over the (n + 1) sphere as arrival inputs. In the first regime, the qubit number n is fixed and the scaling is in terms of both time and space. Under this regime, performance modeling during deriving the scaling limit in terms of balancing the arrival and service rates under first in first-out and work-conserving service policy is conducted. In the second regime, besides the time and space scaling parameters, the qubit number n itself is also considered as a varying scaling parameter with the additional aim to find a suitable number of qubits for the design of a quantum computer. This regime is in contrast to the well-known Halfin-Whitt regime.

TI A Secured Half-Duplex Bidirectional Quantum Key Distribution Protocol
   against Collective Attacks
SO SYMMETRY-BASEL
AB Quantum Key Distribution is a secure method that implements cryptographic protocols. The applications of quantum key distribution technology have an important role: to enhance the security in communication systems. It is originally inspired by the physical concepts associated with quantum mechanics. It aims to enable a secure exchange of cryptographic keys between two parties through an unsecured quantum communication channel. This work proposes a secure half-duplex bidirectional quantum key distribution protocol. The security of the proposed protocol is proved against collective attacks by estimating the interception of any eavesdropper with high probability in both directions under the control of the two parties. A two-qubit state encodes two pieces of information; the first qubit represents the transmitted bit and the second qubit represents the basis used for measurement. The partial diffusion operator is used to encrypt the transmitted qubit state as an extra layer of security. The predefined symmetry transformations induced by unitary in conjunction with the asymmetrical two-qubit teleportation scheme retain the protocol's secrecy. Compared to the previous protocols, the proposed protocol has better performance on qubit efficiency.

Based on various types of noisy quantum channel models, we construct the architecture of the quantum neural network and the model training process. Finally, we perform experiments to verify the training effectiveness of the scheme, and the results show that the cost function of the quantum neural network could approach above 90% of the channel model.

TI Orbital and electronic entanglement in quantum teleportation schemes
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB With progress toward more compact quantum computing architectures, fundamental questions regarding the entanglement of indistinguishable particles need to be addressed. In a solid state device, this quest is naturally connected to the quantum correlations of electrons. Here, we analyze the formation of orbital (mode) and particle entanglement in strongly correlated materials due to the Coulomb interaction between the electrons. We extend the analysis to include spectroscopic measurements of the electronic structure, with a particular focus on the photoemission process. To study the role of the different forms of electronic entanglement, including the effect of particle-number superselection rules, we propose and analyze three different electronic teleportation schemes: quantum teleportation within (i) a molecule on graphene, (ii) a nitrogen-vacancy center, and (iii) a quantum dot array.

TI A Modified Key Sifting Scheme With Artificial Neural Network Based Key
   Reconciliation Analysis in Quantum Cryptography
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Quantum Cryptography emerged from the limitations of classical cryptography. It will play a vital role in information security after the availability of expected powerful quantum computers. Still many quantum primitives like quantum money, blind quantum computation, quantum copy protection, etc. are theoretical as they require a completely functional quantum computer for their implementation. But one prominent quantum cryptographic primitive, the Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) is possible with current technology. The QKD is a key establishment system having several stages namely raw key generation, key sifting, key reconciliation, and privacy amplification. In this paper, an efficient key sifting scheme has been developed. Successful simulation has shown that the proposed modified key sifting scheme requires less time to build the sifted key compared to the sifted key in conventional BB84 protocol in most cases. This paper also represents Tree Parity Machine (TPM) based key reconciliation analysis using different learning algorithms such as Hebbian, Anti-Hebbian, and Random-Walk. This reconciliation analysis helps to choose the optimum learning algorithm for Artificial Neural Network (ANN) based key reconciliation in future Quantum Key Distribution systems.

TI Demonstration of fault-tolerant universal quantum gate operations
SO NATURE
AB Quantum computers can be protected from noise by encoding the logical quantum information redundantly into multiple qubits using error-correcting codes(1,2). When manipulating the logical quantum states, it is imperative that errors caused by imperfect operations do not spread uncontrollably through the quantum register. This requires that all operations on the quantum register obey a fault-tolerant circuit design(3-5), which, in general, increases the complexity of the implementation. Here we demonstrate a fault-tolerant universal set of gates on two logical qubits in a trapped-ion quantum computer. In particular, we make use of the recently introduced paradigm of flag fault tolerance, where the absence or presence of dangerous errors is heralded by the use of auxiliary flag qubits(6-10). We perform a logical two-qubit controlled-NOT gate between two instances of the seven-qubit colour code(11,12), and fault-tolerantly prepare a logical magic state(8,13). We then realize a fault-tolerant logical T gate by injecting the magic state by teleportation from one logical qubit onto the other(14). We observe the hallmark feature of fault tolerance-a superior performance compared with a non-fault-tolerant implementation. In combination with recently demonstrated repeated quantum error-correction cycles(15,16), these results provide a route towards error-corrected universal quantum computation.

TI All-optical spin access via a cavity-broadened optical transition in
   on-chip hybrid quantum photonics
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB Hybrid quantum photonic systems connect classical photonics to the quantum world and promise to deliver efficient light-matter quantum interfaces while leveraging the advantages of both, the classical and the quantum, subsystems. However, combining efficient, scalable photonics and solid-state quantum systems with desirable optical and spin properties remains a formidable challenge. In particular, the access to individual spin states and coherent mapping to photons remains unsolved for hybrid systems. In this paper, we demonstrate all-optical initialization and readout of the electron spin of a negatively charged silicon-vacancy center in a nanodiamond coupled to a silicon nitride photonic crystal cavity. We characterize relevant parameters of the coupled emitter-cavity system and determine the silicon-vacancy center's spin-relaxation and spin-decoherence rate. Our results mark a key step towards the realization of a hybrid spin-photon interface based on silicon nitride photonics and the silicon-vacancy center's electron spin in nanodiamonds with potential use for quantum networks, quantum communication, and distributed quantum computation.

TI Calculable lower bounds on the efficiency of universal sets of quantum
   gates
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS A-MATHEMATICAL AND THEORETICAL
AB Currently available quantum computers, so called Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum devices, are characterized by relatively low number of qubits and moderate gate fidelities. In such scenario, the implementation of quantum error correction is impossible and the performance of those devices is quite modest. In particular, the depth of circuits implementable with reasonably high fidelity is limited, and the minimization of circuit depth is required. Such depths depend on the efficiency of the universal set of gates S used in computation, and can be bounded using the Solovay-Kitaev theorem. However, it is known that much better, asymptotically tight bounds of the form O (log(?(-1))), can be obtained for specific S. Those bounds are controlled by so called spectral gap, denoted gap(S). Yet, the computation of gap(S) is not possible for general S and in practice one considers spectral gap at a certain scale r(?), denoted gap(r)(S). This turns out to be sufficient to bound the efficiency of S provided that one is interested in a physically feasible case, in which an error epsilon is bounded from below. In this paper we derive lower bounds on gap(r)(S) and, as a consequence, on the efficiency of universal sets of d-dimensional quantum gates S satisfying an additional condition. The condition is naturally met for generic quantum gates, such as e.g. Haar random gates. Our bounds are explicit in the sense that all parameters can be determined by numerical calculations on existing computers, at least for small d. This is in contrast with known lower bounds on gap(r)(S) which involve parameters with ambiguous values.

TI Simulating molecules on a cloud-based 5-qubit IBM-Q universal quantum
   computer
SO COMMUNICATIONS PHYSICS
AB Simulating the behaviour of complex quantum systems is impossible on classical supercomputers due to the exponential scaling of the number of quantum states with the number of particles in the simulated system. Quantum computers aim to break through this limit by using one quantum system to simulate another quantum system. Although in their infancy, they are a promising tool for applied fields seeking to simulate quantum interactions in complex atomic and molecular structures. Here, we show an efficient technique for transpiling the unitary evolution of quantum systems into the language of universal quantum computation using the IBM quantum computer and show that it is a viable tool for compiling near-term quantum simulation algorithms. We develop code that decomposes arbitrary 3-qubit gates and implement it in a quantum simulation first for a linear ordered chain to highlight the generality of the approach, and second, for a complex molecule. We choose the Fenna-Matthews-Olsen (FMO) photosynthetic protein because it has a well characterised Hamiltonian and presents a complex dissipative system coupled to a noisy environment that helps to improve the efficiency of energy transport. The method can be implemented in a broad range of molecular and other simulation settings.
   Quantum simulators are becoming an established method to help investigate and unpack the complexities of a many-body system and understand how it evolves over time. Here, using the 5-qubit IBM cloud computer the authors simulate the evolution of a protein complex and show that the energy-transfer behaviour is consistent with theoretical expectations.

TI Satellite Quantum Key Distribution: Analysis, Modeling, Performance
   Evaluation, and Validation
SO IEEE OPEN JOURNAL OF THE COMMUNICATIONS SOCIETY
AB Digital security is a critical concern in modern society, and quantum cryptography offers a promising defense against the threat posed by quantum computers to existing encryption systems. Quantum key distribution (QKD) provides an unconditionally secure method for symmetric key exchange, but its range is limited over optical fiber. Satellite-based QKD can overcome these distance constraints, making it a key component of future global secure communication networks. This paper presents the modeling and performance evaluation of a satellite QKD system implementing the BB84 protocol with two decoy states, considering both active and passive receiver configurations. We introduce a dedicated evaluation methodology and tool to estimate key generation rates, incorporating finite key effects (FKE), a critical factor given the short and dynamic visibility intervals of satellite-to-ground links. Our results are validated against publicly available experimental data from the Micius satellite QKD experiments, showing strong agreement and confirming the reliability of our approach. Then, we apply the tool to conduct a comparative analysis of LEO and GEO satellite QKD, demonstrating its versatility across scenarios. This work enables more accurate and realistic performance assessments, which are essential for the development of reliable and secure satellite-based quantum communication systems.

TI Investigating hardware acceleration for simulation of CFD quantum
   circuits
SO FRONTIERS IN MECHANICAL ENGINEERING-SWITZERLAND
AB Among the many computational models for quantum computing, the Quantum Circuit Model is the most well-known and used model for interacting with current quantum hardware. The practical implementation of quantum computers is a very active research field. Despite this progress, access to physical quantum computers remains relatively limited. Furthermore, the existing machines are susceptible to random errors due to quantum decoherence, as well as being limited in number of qubits, connectivity and built-in error correction. Simulation on classical hardware is therefore essential to allow quantum algorithm researchers to test and validate new algorithms in a simulated-error environment. Computing systems are becoming increasingly heterogeneous, using a variety of hardware accelerators to speed up computational tasks. One such type of accelerators, Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs), are reconfigurable circuits that can be programmed using standardized high-level programming models such as OpenCL and SYCL. FPGAs allow to create specialized highly-parallel circuits capable of mimicking the quantum parallelism properties of quantum gates, in particular for the class of quantum algorithms where many different computations can be performed concurrently or as part of a deep pipeline. They also benefit from very high internal memory bandwidth. This paper focuses on the analysis of quantum algorithms for applications in computational fluid dynamics. In this work we introduce novel quantum-circuit implementations of model lattice-based formulations for fluid dynamics, specifically the D1Q3 model using quantum computational basis encoding, as well as, efficient simulation of the circuits using FPGAs. This work forms a step toward quantum circuit formulation of the Lattice Boltzmann Method (LBM). For the quantum circuits implementing the nonlinear equilibrium distribution function in the D1Q3 lattice model, it is shown how circuit transformations can be introduced that facilitate the efficient simulation of the circuits on FPGAs, exploiting their fine-grained parallelism. We show that these transformations allow us to exploit more parallelism on the FPGA and improve memory locality. Preliminary results show that for this class of circuits the introduced transformations improve circuit execution time. We show that FPGA simulation of the reduced circuits results in more than 3x improvement in performance per Watt compared to the CPU simulation. We also present results from evaluating the same kernels on a GPU.

TI Low rank approximation in simulations of quantum algorithms
SO JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL SCIENCE
AB Simulating quantum algorithms on classical computers is challenging when the system size, i.e., the number of qubits used in the quantum algorithm, is moderately large. However, some quantum algorithms and the corresponding quantum circuits can be simulated efficiently on a classical computer if the input quantum state is a low rank tensor and all intermediate states of the quantum algorithm can be represented or approximated by low rank tensors. In this paper, we examine the possibility of simulating a few quantum algorithms by using low-rank canonical polyadic (CP) decomposition to represent the input and all intermediate states of these algorithms. Two rank reduction algorithms are used to enable efficient simulation. We show that some of the algorithms preserve the low rank structure of the input state and can thus be efficiently simulated on a classical computer. However, the rank of the intermediate states in other quantum algorithms can increase rapidly, making efficient simulation more difficult. To some extent, such difficulty reflects the advantage or superiority of a quantum computer over a classical computer. As a result, understanding the low rank structure of a quantum algorithm allows us to identify algorithms that can benefit significantly from quantum computers.

TI Local Information as an Essential Factor for Quantum Entanglement
SO ENTROPY
AB Quantum entanglement is not only a fundamental concept in quantum mechanics but also a special resource for many important quantum information processing tasks. An intuitive way to understand quantum entanglement is to analyze its geometric parameters which include local parameters and correlation parameters. The correlation parameters have been extensively studied while the role of local parameters have not been drawn attention. In this paper, we investigate the question how local parameters of a two-qubit system affect quantum entanglement in both quantitative and qualitative perspective. Firstly, we find that the concurrence, a measure of quantum entanglement, of a general two-qubit state is bounded by the norms of local vectors and correlations matrix. Then, we derive a sufficient condition for a two-qubit being separable in perspective of local parameters. Finally, we find that different local parameters could make a state with fixed correlation matrix separable, entangled or even more qualitatively entangled than the one with vanished local parameters.

TI Quantum error correction in SYK and bulk emergence
SO JOURNAL OF HIGH ENERGY PHYSICS
AB We analyze the error correcting properties of the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model, with errors that correspond to erasures of subsets of fermions. We study the limit where the number of fermions erased is large but small compared to the total number of fermions. We compute the price of the quantum error correcting code, defined as the number of physical qubits needed to reconstruct whether a given operator has been acted upon the thermal state or not. By thinking about reconstruction via quantum teleportation, we argue for a bound that relates the price to the ordinary operator size in systems that display socalled detailed size winding [1]. We then find that in SYK the price roughly saturates this bound. Computing the price requires computing modular flowed correlators with respect to the density matrix associated to a subset of fermions. We offer an interpretation of these correlators as probing a quantum extremal surface in the AdS dual of SYK. In the large N limit, the operator algebras associated to subsets of fermions in SYK satisfy half-sided modular inclusion, which is indicative of an emergent Type III1 von Neumann algebra. We discuss the relationship between the emergent algebra of half-sided modular inclusions and bulk symmetry generators.

TI Exploiting OFDM method for quantum communication
SO QUANTUM INFORMATION PROCESSING
AB Orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) is a crucial modulation method used in contemporary digital communication systems for its significant spectral efficiency, low latency, and robustness in challenging environments. This work examines the novel use of OFDM in quantum communication, an area that offers exceptional security and efficiency in information transfer using quantum mechanics principles. In the rapidly evolving field of quantum computing, understanding, and mitigating quantum bit errors is paramount. This paper presents a rigorous analysis of bit error rates (BER) in quantum circuits, focusing on the impact of the quantum Fourier transform and its inverse, contrasted against quantum circuits employing dynamic gate sequences. Our research methodology encompasses simulations over a diverse set of parameters, including varying qubit counts ranging from 2 to 8 and theta angles (15, 30, 45, and 60 degrees), as well as random theta values, utilizing the advanced capabilities of the Qiskit framework. Our findings indicate that quantum OFDM substantially improves quantum communication, lowering errors and boosting security. The quantum model outperforms the reference model in BER, with further enhancements as qubits increase.

TI Learning with Errors: A Lattice-Based Keystone of Post-Quantum
   Cryptography
SO SIGNALS
AB The swift advancement of quantum computing devices holds the potential to create robust machines that can tackle an extensive array of issues beyond the scope of conventional computers. Consequently, quantum computing machines create new risks at a velocity and scale never seen before, especially with regard to encryption. Lattice-based cryptography is regarded as post-quantum cryptography's future and a competitor to a quantum computer attack. Thus, there are several advantages to lattice-based cryptographic protocols, including security, effectiveness, reduced energy usage and speed. In this work, we study the learning with errors (LWE) problem and the cryptosystems that are based on the LWE problem and, in addition, we present a new efficient variant of LWE cryptographic scheme.

TI Skew information-based coherence generating power of quantum channels
SO QUANTUM INFORMATION PROCESSING
AB We study the ability of a quantum channel to generate quantum coherence when it applies to incoherent states. We define the measure of coherence generating power (CGP) for a generic quantum channel to be the average coherence generated by the quantum channel acting on a uniform ensemble of incoherent states based on the skew information-based coherence measure. We present explicitly the analytical formulae of the CGP for any arbitrary finite dimensional unitary channels. We derive the mean value of the CGP over the unitary groups and investigate the typicality of the normalized CGP. Furthermore, we give an upper bound of the CGP for the convex combinations of unitary channels. Detailed examples are provided to calculate exactly the values of the CGP for the unitary channels related to specific quantum gates and for some qubit channels.

TI High-throughput quantum photonic devices emitting indistinguishable
   photons in the telecom C-band
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Single indistinguishable photons at telecom C-band wavelengths are essential for quantum networks and the future quantum internet. However, high-throughput technology for single-photon generation at 1550 nm remained a missing building block to overcome present limitations in quantum communication and information technologies. Here, we demonstrate the high-throughput fabrication of quantum-photonic integrated devices operating at C-band wavelengths based on epitaxial semiconductor quantum dots. Our technique enables the deterministic integration of single pre-selected quantum emitters into microcavities based on circular Bragg gratings. Respective devices feature the triggered generation of single photons with ultra-high purity and record-high photon indistinguishability. Further improvements in yield and coherence properties will pave the way for implementing single-photon non-linear devices and advanced quantum networks at telecom wavelengths.
   An efficient way of realising a large number of telecom single-photon emitters for quantum communication is still missing. Here, the authors use a wide-field imaging technique for fast localization of single InAs/InP quantum dots, which are then integrated into circular Bragg grating cavities featuring high single-photon purity and indistinguishability.

TI Efficient Stabilized Two-Qubit Gates on a Trapped-Ion Quantum Computer
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB In order to scale up quantum processors and achieve a quantum advantage, it is crucial to economize on the power requirement of two-qubit gates, make them robust to drift in experimental parameters, and shorten the gate times. Applicable to all quantum computer architectures whose two-qubit gates rely on phase-space closure, we present here a new gate-optimizing principle according to which negligible amounts of gate fidelity are traded for substantial savings in power, which, in turn, can be traded for substantial increases in gate speed and/or qubit connectivity. As a concrete example, we illustrate the method by constructing optimal pulses for entangling gates on a pair of ions within a trapped-ion chain, one of the leading quantum computing architectures. Our method is direct, noniterative, and linear, and, in some parameter regimes, constructs gate-steering pulses requiring up to an order of magnitude less power than the standard method. Additionally, our method provides increased robustness to mode drift. We verify the new trade-off principle experimentally on our trapped-ion quantum computer.

TI Quantum compiling with a variational instruction set for accurate and
   fast quantum computing
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB The quantum instruction set (QIS) is defined as the quantum gates that are physically realizable by controlling the qubits in quantum hardware. Compiling quantum circuits into the product of the gates in a properly defined QIS is a fundamental step in quantum computing. We here propose the quantum variational instruction set (QuVIS) formed by flexibly designed multiqubit gates for higher speed and accuracy of quantum computing. The controlling of qubits for realizing the gates in a QuVIS is variationally achieved using the fine-grained time optimization algorithm. Significant reductions in both the error accumulation and time cost are demonstrated in realizing the swaps of multiple qubits and quantum Fourier transformations, compared with the compiling by a standard QIS such as the quantum microinstruction set (QuMIS, formed by several one-and two-qubit gates including one-qubit rotations and controlled -NOT gates). With the same requirement on quantum hardware, the time cost for QuVIS is reduced to less than one-half of that for QuMIS. Simultaneously, the error is suppressed algebraically as the depth of the compiled circuit is reduced. As a general compiling approach with high flexibility and efficiency, QuVIS can be defined for different quantum circuits and be adapted to the quantum hardware with different interactions.

TI Probabilistic Hierarchical Quantum Information Splitting of Arbitrary
   Multi-Qubit States
SO ENTROPY
AB By utilizing the non-maximally entangled four-qubit cluster states as the quantum channel, we first propose a hierarchical quantum information splitting scheme of arbitrary three-qubit states among three agents with a certain probability. Then we generalize the scheme to arbitrary multi-qubit states. Hierarchy is reflected on the different abilities of agents to restore the target state. The high-grade agent only needs the help of one low-grade agent, while the low-grade agent requires all the other agents' assistance. The designated receiver performs positive operator-valued measurement (POVM) which is elaborately constructed with the aid of Hadamard matrix. It is worth mentioning that a general expression of recovery operation is derived to disclose the relationship with measurement outcomes. Moreover, the scheme is extended to multiple agents by means of the symmetry of cluster states.

TI Quantum computation of frequency-domain molecular response properties
   using a three-qubit iToffoli gate
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB The quantum computation of molecular response properties on near-term quantum hardware is a topic of substantial interest. Computing these properties directly in the frequency domain is desirable, but the circuits require large depth if the typical hardware gate set consisting of single- and two-qubit gates is used. While high-fidelity multipartite gates have been reported recently, their integration into quantum simulation and the demonstration of improved accuracy of the observable properties remains to be shown. Here, we report the application of a high-fidelity multipartite gate, the iToffoli gate, to the computation of frequency-domain response properties of diatomic molecules. The iToffoli gate enables a similar to 50% reduction in circuit depth and similar to 40% reduction in circuit execution time compared to the traditional gate set. We show that the molecular properties obtained with the iToffoli gate exhibit comparable or better agreement with theory than those obtained with the native CZ gates. Our work is among the first demonstrations of the practical usage of a native multi-qubit gate in quantum simulation, with diverse potential applications to near-term quantum computation.

TI Quantum Embedding Search for Quantum Machine Learning
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB This paper introduces an automated search algorithm (QES, pronounced as "quest"), which derives optimal design of entangling layout for supervised quantum machine learning. First, we establish the connection between the structures of entanglement using CNOT gates and the representations of directed multi-graphs, enabling a well-defined search space. The proposed encoding scheme of quantum entanglement as genotype vectors bridges the ansatz optimization and classical machine learning, allowing efficient search on any well-defined search space. Second, we instigate the entanglement level to reduce the cardinality of the search space to a feasible size for practical implementations. Finally, we mitigate the cost of evaluating the true loss function by using surrogate models via sequential model-based optimization. We demonstrate the feasibility of our proposed approach on simulated and bench-marking datasets, including Iris, Wine and Breast Cancer datasets, which empirically shows that found quantum embedding architecture by QES outperforms manual designs in term of the predictive performance.

TI Practical quantum encryption protocol with varying encryption
   configurations
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Quantum communication is an important application that derives from the burgeoning field of quantum information and quantum computation. Focusing on secure communication, quantum cryptography has two major directions of development, namely quantum key distribution and quantum encryption. In this work we propose a quantum encryption protocol that utilizes a quantum algorithm to create blocks of ciphertexts based on quantum states. The main feature of our quantum encryption protocol is that the encryption configuration of each block is determined by the previous blocks, such that additional security is provided. We then demonstrate our method by an example model encrypting the English alphabet, with numerical simulation results showing the large error rate of a mock attack by a potential adversary. The safety of the encryption method is further demonstrated against several possible attack models. With the improvements against noises, our quantum encryption protocol is a capable addition to the toolbox of quantum cryptography.

TI Ultrafast Holonomic Quantum Gates
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB Quantum computation based on geometric phase is generally believed to be more robust against certain errors or noises than the conventional dynamical strategy. However, the gate error caused by the decoherence effect is inevitable, and thus faster gate operations are highly desired. Here, we propose a nonadiabatic holonomic quantum-computation (NHQC) scheme with detuned interactions on a A-type three-level system, which combines the time-optimal control technique with the time-independent detuning adjustment to further accelerate universal gate operations, so that the gate time can be greatly shortened within the hardware limitation, and thus high-fidelity gates can be obtained. Meanwhile, our numerical simulations show that the gate robustness is also stronger than previous schemes. Finally, we present an implementation of our proposal on superconducting quantum circuits, with a decoherence-free subspace encoding, based on the experimentally demonstrated parametrically tunable coupling technique, which simplifies previous investigations. Therefore, our protocol provides a more promising alternative for future fault-tolerant quantum computation.

TI Sensor-Assisted Fault Mitigation in Quantum Computation
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB We propose a method to assist fault mitigation in quantum computation through the use of sensors co-located near physical qubits. Specifically, we consider using transition edge sensors co-located on silicon substrates hosting superconducting qubits to monitor for energy injection from ionizing radiation, which has been demonstrated to increase decoherence in transmon qubits. We generalize from these two physical device concepts and explore the potential advantages of co-located sensors to assist fault mitigation in quantum computation. In the simplest scheme, co-located sensors beneficially assist rejection of calculations potentially affected by environmental disturbances. Investigating the potential computational advantage further required development of an extension to the standard formulation of quantum error correction. In a specific case of the standard three-qubit, bit-flip quantum error-correction code, we show that given a 20% overall error probability per qubit, approximately 90% of repeated calculation attempts are correctable. However, when sensor-detectable errors account for 45% of overall error probability, the use of co-located sensors uniquely associated with independent qubits boosts the fraction of correct final-state calculations to 96%, at the cost of rejecting 7% of repeated calculation attempts.

TI Reinforcement Learning for Digital Quantum Simulation
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Digital quantum simulation on quantum computers provides the potential to simulate the unitary evolution of any many-body Hamiltonian with bounded spectrum by discretizing the time evolution operator through a sequence of elementary quantum gates. A fundamental challenge in this context originates from experimental imperfections, which critically limits the number of attainable gates within a reasonable accuracy and therefore the achievable system sizes and simulation times. In this work, we introduce a reinforcement learning algorithm to systematically build optimized quantum circuits for digital quantum simulation upon imposing a strong constraint on the number of quantum gates. With this we consistently obtain quantum circuits that reproduce physical observables with as little as three entangling gates for long times and large system sizes up to 16 qubits. As concrete examples we apply our formalism to a long-range Ising chain and the lattice Schwinger model. Our method demonstrates that digital quantum simulation on noisy intermediate scale quantum devices can be pushed to much larger scale within the current experimental technology by a suitable engineering of quantum circuits using reinforcement learning.

TI Next Generation Power System Planning and Operation With Quantum
   Computation
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Innovative solutions and developments are being inspected to tackle rising electrical power demand to be supplied by clean forms of energy. The integration of renewable energy generations, varying nature loads, importance of active role of distribution system and consumer participation in grid operation has changed the landscape of classical power grids. Implementation of smarter applications to plan, monitor, operate the grid safely are deemed paramount for efficient, secure and reliable functioning of grid. These smarter applications for modern power systems demand capabilities such as real-time monitoring, dynamic security analysis, stochastic power flow calculations, large-scale data analytics, and high-dimensional combinatorial and constrained optimization. Although sophisticated computations to process gigantic volume of data to produce useful information in a time critical manner is the paradigm of future grid operations, these enhanced functionalities impose significantly higher computational demands compared to traditional approaches used in conventional power systems. Advancements in quantum technologies holds promising solution for dealing with demanding computational complexity of power system related applications. In this article, we lay out clear motivations for seeking quantum solutions for solving computational burden challenges associated with power system applications. Next, we present the fundamental principles of quantum computing, introduce key quantum algorithms, and offer a comparison of the computational load between classical and quantum approaches for few important mathematical problems, indicating their relevance to various power system applications. Additionally, we provide an overview of quantum solutions for various power system related applications available in current literature and suggest future topics for research. We further highlight challenges with existing quantum solutions for exploiting full quantum capabilities. To this end, this article serves as a bridge for power engineers to the quantum domain by outlining fundamental principles of quantum computation, facilitating a smoother transition to the future of power system computations and also provides quantum experts with insights into new application areas for quantum computing within power systems.

TI High dimensional counterdiabatic quantum computing
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB The digital version of adiabatic quantum computing enhanced by counterdiabatic driving, known as digitized counterdiabatic quantum computing, has emerged as a paradigm that opens the door to fast and low-depth algorithms. In this work, we explore the extension of this paradigm to high-dimensional systems. Specifically, we consider qutrits in the context of quadratic problems, obtaining the qutrit Hamiltonian codifications and the counterdiabatic drivings. Our findings show that qutrits can improve the solution quality up to 90 times compared to the qubit counterpart. We tested our proposal on 1000 random instances of the multiway number partitioning, max 3-cut, and portfolio optimization problems, demonstrating that, in general, without prior knowledge, it is better to use qutrits and, apparently, high-dimensional systems in general instead of qubits. Finally, considering the state-of-the-art quantum platforms, we show the experimental feasibility of our high-dimensional counterdiabatic quantum algorithms at least in a fully digital form. This work paves the way for the efficient codification of optimization problems in high-dimensional spaces and their efficient implementation using counterdiabatic quantum computing.

TI Quantum error correction using squeezed Schrodinger cat states
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Bosonic quantum codes redundantly encode quantum information in the states of a quantum harmonic oscillator, making it possible to detect and correct errors. Schrodinger cat codes-based on the superposition of two coherent states with opposite displacements-can correct phase-flip errors induced by dephasing, but they are vulnerable to bit-flip errors induced by particle loss. Here, we develop a bosonic quantum code relying on squeezed cat states, i.e., cat states made of a linear superposition of displaced-squeezed states. Squeezed cat states allow to partially correct errors caused by particle loss, while at the same time improving the protection against dephasing. We present a comprehensive analysis of the squeezed cat code, including protocols for code generation and elementary quantum gates. We characterize the effect of both particle loss and dephasing and develop an optimal recovery protocol that is suitable to be implemented on currently available quantum hardware. We show that with moderate squeezing, and using typical parameters of state-of-the-art quantum hardware platforms, the squeezed cat code has a resilience to particle loss errors that significantly outperforms that of the conventional cat code.

TI Two quantum algorithms for solving the one-dimensional
   advection-diffusion equation
SO COMPUTERS & FLUIDS
AB Two quantum algorithms are presented for the numerical solution of a linear one-dimensional advection- diffusion equation with periodic boundary conditions. Their accuracy and performance with increasing qubit number are compared point-by-point with each other. Specifically, we solve the linear partial differential equation with a Quantum Linear Systems Algorithm (QLSA) based on the Harrow-Hassidim-Lloyd method and a Variational Quantum Algorithm (VQA), for resolutions that can be encoded using up to 6 qubits, which corresponds to N = 64 grid points on the unit interval. Both algorithms are hybrid in nature, i.e., they involve a combination of classical and quantum computing building blocks. The QLSA and VQA are solved as ideal statevector simulations using the in-house solver QFlowS and open-access Qiskit software, respectively. We discuss several aspects of both algorithms which are crucial for a successful performance in both cases. These are the accurate eigenvalue estimation with the quantum phase estimation for the QLSA and the choice of the algorithm of the minimization of the cost function for the VQA. The latter algorithm is also implemented in the noisy Qiskit framework including measurement noise. We reflect on the current limitations and suggest some possible routes of future research for the numerical simulation of classical fluid flows on a quantum computer.

TI Quantifying noncovariance of quantum channels with respect to groups
SO PHYSICA SCRIPTA
AB A quantum channel is covariant with respect to a group if it commutes with the action of the group. In general, a quantum channel may not be covariant with respect to a given group. The degree of noncovariance can vary between different channels, and it is desirable to have a quantitative characterization for the degree of channel noncovariance. In this work, we propose a measure based on the Hilbert-Schmidt norm to quantify noncovariance of quantum channels with respect to a group and demonstrate that it satisfies several desirable properties. Compared with the existing measures of channel noncovariance, our measure applies to not only compact Lie groups but also finite groups, and it is easy to evaluate. Using this measure and its modified version together with two existing measures, we evaluate and analyze channel noncovariance through an example, finding that these measures of channel noncovariance are closely related but differ from each other. They capture different perspectives of noncovariance of quantum channels. As applications, we provide a relation between channel noncovariance and approximate quantum error correction using our measures of channel noncovariance.

TI Quantum algorithms for matrix operations and linear systems of equations
SO COMMUNICATIONS IN THEORETICAL PHYSICS
AB Fundamental matrix operations and solving linear systems of equations are ubiquitous in scientific investigations. Using the 'sender-receiver' model, we propose quantum algorithms for matrix operations such as matrix-vector product, matrix-matrix product, the sum of two matrices, and the calculation of determinant and inverse matrix. We encode the matrix entries into the probability amplitudes of the pure initial states of senders. After applying proper unitary transformation to the complete quantum system, the desired result can be found in certain blocks of the receiver's density matrix. These quantum protocols can be used as subroutines in other quantum schemes. Furthermore, we present an alternative quantum algorithm for solving linear systems of equations.

Recently, superconducting multi-qubit processors demonstrated quantum supremacy and quantum error correction below the surface code threshold. However, the decoherence-induced loss of quantum information still remains a challenge for 100+ qubit quantum computing. Here, we review the key aspects of superconducting quantum circuits shielding from stray electromagnetic fields and infrared radiation-multilayer shielding design, materials, fridge line filtration, cryogenic setup configurations, and shielding efficiency evaluation methods developed over the last 10 years. In summary, we provide recommendations for the design of an efficient and compact shielding system, as well as microwave filtering for large-scale superconducting quantum systems.

TI Variational quantum circuits for convolution and window-based image
   processing applications
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Quantum information processing is gaining popularity in the fields of machine learning and image processing because of its advantages. Quantum convolution is an interesting topic in this field, and studies on this topic can be divided into value-based and angle-based methods. Although quantum convolution studies on angle-based or variational quantum circuits (VQCs) is called convolution, the circuits work differently from classical convolution. In this study, contrary to the literature, the VQC was trained to imitate classical convolution. The differential evolution algorithm (DEA) was used to optimize the VQCs. The proposed method requires as many qubits as the filter size (N x N). The generated circuits contain N x N x 4 quantum gates and N x N x 3 trainable parameters. The generated circuits were tested in Python environment using Cirq simulator. The Cifar10 and MNIST datasets are used as examples. For 2 x 2 filters with different weights, the convolution was successfully modeled with a mean squared error of less than 0.001. In general, the proposed method imitates classic convolution within +/- 5% tolerance. In conclusion, VQCs that imitate classical convolution with fewer qubits and quantum gates than value-based methods were obtained.

TI Building a Hierarchical Architecture and Communication Model for the
   Quantum Internet
SO IEEE JOURNAL ON SELECTED AREAS IN COMMUNICATIONS
AB The research of architecture has tremendous significance in realizing quantum Internet. Although there is not yet a standard quantum Internet architecture, the distributed architecture is one of the possible solutions, which utilizes quantum repeaters or dedicated entanglement sources in a flat structure for entanglement preparation & distribution. In this paper, we analyze the distributed architecture in detail and demonstrate that it has three limitations: 1) possible high maintenance overhead, 2) possible low-performance entanglement distribution, and 3) unable to support optimal entanglement routing. We design a hierarchical quantum Internet architecture and a communication model to solve the problems above. We also present a W-state Based Centralized Entanglement Preparation & Distribution (W-state Based CEPD) scheme and a Centralized Entanglement Routing (CER) algorithm within our hierarchical architecture and perform an experimental comparison with other entanglement preparation & distribution schemes and entanglement routing algorithms within the distributed architecture. The evaluation results show that the entanglement distribution efficiency of hierarchical architecture is 11.5% higher than that of distributed architecture on average (minimum 3.3%, maximum 37.3%), and the entanglement routing performance of hierarchical architecture is much better than that of a distributed architecture according to the fidelity and throughput.

TI Fault-Tolerant Parity Readout on a Shuttling-Based Trapped-Ion Quantum
   Computer
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW X
AB Quantum error correction requires the detection of errors via reliable measurements of multiqubit correlation operators. As these operations are inherently faulty, fault-tolerant schemes for realizing quantum error correction are required. Recently, a paradigm requiring only minimal resource overhead in the form of "flag" qubits to detect and correct errors has been proposed. We experimentally demonstrate a fault-tolerant weight-4 parity-check measurement scheme, where one additional flag qubit serves to detect errors, which would otherwise proliferate into uncorrectable weight-2 errors onto the qubit register. We achieve a parity measurement fidelity of 92.3(2)%, which increases to 93.2(2)% upon conditioning to the flag readout result, which shows that the measurement scheme intercepts intrinsic errors occurring throughout the sequence. We show that the protocol is capable of reliably intercepting faults by deliberately injecting bit- and phase-flip errors. For holistic benchmarking of the parity measurement scheme, we use an entanglement witnessing scheme requiring a minimal number of measurements to verify genuine six-qubit multipartite entanglement. The demonstrated fault-tolerant parity measurement scheme constitutes the key building block in a broad class of resource-efficient flag-based quantum error correction protocols including topological color codes. Our hardware platform is based on atomic ions stored in a microchip ion trap. The qubit register is dynamically recoogured via shuttling operations enabling effective full connectivity without operational cross talk, thereby providing key prerequisites underlying fault-tolerant circuit design. These architectural features in combination with the demonstrated approach to flag-based fault-tolerant quantum error correction open up a route toward scalable fault-tolerant quantum computing.

TI Metasurfaces for quantum photonics
SO NATURE PHOTONICS
AB Progress in the field of quantum-photonics applications of metasurfaces is reviewed. Cutting-edge research, including the development of optical chips supporting high-dimensional quantum entanglement and advanced quantum tomography, is summarized.
   Rapid progress in the development of metamaterials and metaphotonics allowed bulky optical assemblies to be replaced with thin nanostructured films, often called metasurfaces, opening a broad range of novel and superior applications of flat optics to the generation, manipulation and detection of classical light. Recently, these developments started making headway in quantum photonics, where novel opportunities arose for the control of non-classical nature of light, including photon statistics, quantum state superposition, quantum entanglement and single-photon detection. In this Perspective, we review recent progress in the emerging field of quantum-photonics applications of metasurfaces, focusing on innovative and promising approaches to create, manipulate and detect non-classical light.

TI New perspectives on covariant quantum error correction
SO QUANTUM
AB Covariant codes are quantum codes such that a symmetry transformation on the logical system could be realized by a symmetry transformation on the physical system, usually with limited capability of performing quantum error correction (an important case being the Eastin-Knill theorem). The need for understanding the limits of covariant quantum error correction arises in various realms of physics including fault-tolerant quantum computation, condensed matter physics and quantum gravity. Here, we explore covariant quantum error correction with respect to continuous symmetries from the perspectives of quantum metrology and quantum resource theory, establishing solid connections between these formerly disparate fields. We prove new and powerful lower bounds on the infidelity of covariant quantum error correction, which not only extend the scope of previous no-go results but also provide a substantial improvement over existing bounds. Explicit lower bounds are derived for both erasure and depolarizing noises. We also present a type of covariant codes which nearly saturates these lower bounds.

SO QUANTUM INFORMATION PROCESSING
AB Investigating the influence of quantum information (QI) scrambling on quantum correlations in a physical system is an interesting problem. In this article, we establish the mathematical connections among the quantifiers known as quantum information scrambling, Uhlmann fidelity, Bures metric and bipartite concurrence. We study these connections via four-point out-of-time-order correlation function used for quantum information scrambling. Further, we study the dynamics of all the quantifiers and investigate the influence of QI scrambling on entanglement in two qubits prepared in Bell states. We also investigate the QI scrambling and entanglement balancing points in Bell states under Ising Hamiltonian.

TI Quantum Information Theory in Infinite Dimensions with Application to
   Optical Channels
SO JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE
AB Information theory deals with the efficient representation of information sources as well as providing fundamental limits to the amount of information communicated reliably over channels. These sources and channels are generally classical, i.e., represented by standard probability distributions. Quantum information theory takes it to the next level where we allow for the sources as well as channels to be quantum. From the representation of quantum states to the communication over quantum channels, the theory not only essentially encapsulates classical information theoretic methods but also accounts for quantum effects such as superposition, entanglement, interference, etc. In this article, we will review and focus on the information theoretic analysis of quantum channels with infinite dimensions. Infinite dimensionality is needed to model quantum optical channels which are ubiquitous in today's practical networks, distributed quantum communication and quantum internet. The infinite dimensionality introduces some unique problems when compared with finite-dimensional channels and has not been deeply explored in literature from the quantum information theoretic perspective. For these channels, we provide the essential concepts and state-of-the-art channel capacity results. To make this paper self-contained, we also recall the finite dimensional results.

TI Towards near-term quantum simulation of materials
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Determining the ground and excited state properties of materials is considered one of the most promising applications of quantum computers. On near-term hardware, the limiting constraint on such simulations is the requisite circuit depths and qubit numbers, which currently lie well beyond near-term capabilities. Here we develop a quantum algorithm which reduces the estimated cost of material simulations. For example, we obtain a circuit depth improvement by up to 6 orders of magnitude for a Trotter layer of time-dynamics simulation in the transition-metal oxide SrVO3 compared with the best previous quantum algorithms. We achieve this by introducing a collection of connected techniques, including highly localised and physically compact representations of materials Hamiltonians in the Wannier basis, a hybrid fermion-to-qubit mapping, and an efficient circuit compiler. Combined together, these methods leverage locality of materials Hamiltonians and result in a design that generates quantum circuits with depth independent of the system's size. Although the requisite resources for the quantum simulation of materials are still beyond current hardware, our results show that realistic simulation of specific properties may be feasible without necessarily requiring fully scalable, fault-tolerant quantum computers, providing quantum algorithm design incorporates deeper understanding of the target materials and applications.
   The use of NISQ devices for useful quantum simulations of materials and chemistry is still mainly limited by the necessary circuit depth. Here, the authors propose to combine classically-generated effective Hamiltonians, hybrid fermion-to-qubit mapping and circuit optimisations to bring this requirement closer to experimental feasibility.

TI Eavesdropping Detection in BB84 Quantum Key Distribution Protocols
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NETWORK AND SERVICE MANAGEMENT
AB The nature of quantum mechanics provides us with an opportunity to statistically detect eavesdropping in quantum key distribution (QKD) protocols, which is unimaginable in classical digital communications. By utilizing Hoeffding's inequality, this study analyzes the upper bounds of the false-positive ratio (FPR) and false-negative ratio (FNR) of eavesdropping detection in the Bennett-Brassard-84 (BB84) QKD protocol, where eavesdropping is detected if the measured quantum bit error rate (QBER) is equal to or higher than a threshold. The analysis clarifies the trade-off between the accuracy of eavesdropping detection and the economy of quantum resources in the BB84 protocol. Owing to the central limit theorem, the QBER measured by 300 quantum bits (qubits) is sufficient to guarantee lower than 0.009% of the FPR and FNR of eavesdropping detection. To deal with rapidly varying quantum channel conditions, this study further introduces grouped BB84 protocol and combinatory eavesdropping detection algorithms. A polarization basis is changeable for a group of qubits, and eavesdropping is judged by a combination of criteria between QBER and group-QBER in the proposed protocol and algorithms. In our extensive simulation study, the grouped BB84 protocol with 300 qubits comparison guarantees at least 99.92% accuracy in eavesdropping detection under rapidly varying quantum channel conditions.

TI Low-latency readout electronics for dynamic superconducting quantum
   computing
SO AIP ADVANCES
AB Dynamic quantum computing can support quantum error correction circuits to build a large general-purpose quantum computer, which requires electronic instruments to perform the closed-loop operation of readout, processing, and control within 1% of the qubit coherence time. In this paper, we present low-latency readout electronics for dynamic superconducting quantum computing. The readout electronics use a low-latency analog-to-digital converter to capture analog signals, a field-programmable gate array (FPGA) to process digital signals, and the general I/O resources of the FPGA to forward the readout results. Running an algorithm based on the design of multichannel parallelism and single instruction multiple data on an FPGA, the readout electronics achieve a readout latency of 40 ns from the last sample input to the readout valid output. The feedback data link for cross-instrument communication shows a communication latency of 48 ns when 16 bits of data are transmitted over a 2 m-length cable using a homologous clock to drive the transceiver. With codeword-based triggering mechanisms, readout electronics can be used in dynamic superconducting quantum computing. (C)& nbsp;2022 Author(s).& nbsp;

TI Universal and operational benchmarking of quantum memories
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Quantum memory-the capacity to faithfully preserve quantum coherence and correlations-is essential for quantum-enhanced technology. There is thus a pressing need for operationally meaningful means to benchmark candidate memories across diverse physical platforms. Here we introduce a universal benchmark distinguished by its relevance across multiple key operational settings, exactly quantifying (1) the memory's robustness to noise, (2) the number of noiseless qubits needed for its synthesis, (3) its potential to speed up statistical sampling tasks, and (4) performance advantage in non-local games beyond classical limits. The measure is analytically computable for low-dimensional systems and can be efficiently bounded in the experiment without tomography. We thus illustrate quantum memory as a meaningful resource, with our benchmark reflecting both its cost of creation and what it can accomplish. We demonstrate the benchmark on the five-qubit IBM Q hardware, and apply it to witness the efficacy of error-suppression techniques and quantify non-Markovian noise. We thus present an experimentally accessible, practically meaningful, and universally relevant quantifier of a memory's capability to preserve quantum advantage.

TI Bell Diagonal and Werner State Generation: Entanglement, Non-Locality,
   Steering and Discord on the IBM Quantum Computer
SO ENTROPY
AB We propose the first correct special-purpose quantum circuits for preparation of Bell diagonal states (BDS), and implement them on the IBM Quantum computer, characterizing and testing complex aspects of their quantum correlations in the full parameter space. Among the circuits proposed, one involves only two quantum bits but requires adapted quantum tomography routines handling classical bits in parallel. The entire class of Bell diagonal states is generated, and several characteristic indicators, namely entanglement of formation and concurrence, CHSH non-locality, steering and discord, are experimentally evaluated over the full parameter space and compared with theory. As a by-product of this work, we also find a remarkable general inequality between "quantum discord" and "asymmetric relative entropy of discord": the former never exceeds the latter. We also prove that for all BDS the two coincide.

TI Entropic uncertainty relations with quantum memory in a multipartite
   scenario
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Entropic uncertainty relations demonstrate the intrinsic uncertainty of nature from an information-theory perspective. Recently, a quantum-memory-assisted entropic uncertainty relation for multiple measurements was proposed by Wu et al. [Phys. Rev. A 106, 062219 (2022)]. Interestingly, the quantum-memory-assisted entropic uncertainty relation for multiple measurement settings can be further generalized. In this work, we propose two complementary multipartite quantum-memory-assisted entropic uncertainty relations and our lower bounds depend on values of complementarity of the observables, (conditional) von Neumann entropies, Holevo quantities, and mutual information. As an illustration, we provide several typical cases to exhibit that our bounds are tighter and outperform the previous bounds.

TI Average fidelity and fidelity deviation in noisy quantum teleportation
SO JOURNAL OF THE KOREAN PHYSICAL SOCIETY
AB We analyze the average fidelity (say, F) and the fidelity deviation (say, D) in noisy-channel quantum teleportation. Here, F represents how well teleportation is performed on average and D quantifies whether the teleportation is performed impartially on the given inputs, that is, the condition of universality. Our analysis results prove that the achievable maximum average fidelity ensures zero fidelity deviation, that is, perfect universality. This structural trait of teleportation is distinct from those of other limited-fidelity probabilistic quantum operations, for instance, universal-NOT or quantum cloning. This feature is confirmed again based on a tighter relationship between F and D in the qubit case. We then consider another realistic noise model where F decreases and D increases due to imperfect control. To alleviate such deterioration, we propose a machine-learning-based algorithm. We demonstrate by means of numerical simulations that the proposed algorithm can stabilize the system. Notably, the recovery process consists solely of the maximization of F, which reduces the control time, thus leading to a faster cure cycle.

A threedimensional structure of optical tweezer arrays offers the potential for scaling up neutral atom processors. However, coherent local operations, essential for quantum error correction, have yet to be explored for this platform. Here, we demonstrate plane-by-plane initialization of nuclear spin qubits of 171Yb atoms in a threedimensional atom array and plane-dependent coherent temporal evolution of qubits, as well as plane-selective qubit manipulation by exploiting the plane-selective excitation of the atoms from the 1S0 to the 3P2 state. This plane-selective manipulation technique paves the way for quantum computing and quantum simulation in three-dimensional multilayer architectures.

TI Predictive Time-Series Analysis of Single-Qubit Quantum Circuit Outcomes
   for a Superconducting Quantum Computer: Forecasting Error Patterns
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Quantum computing promises a paradigm shift in computational power. However, a major challenge is mitigating the inherent noise and errors in quantum circuits. As quantum computers operate, their fragile qubits are highly susceptible to environmental disturbances, leading to errors that affect the outcomes of repeated circuit executions. Understanding and predicting these errors is crucial for improving the accuracy and reliability of quantum computing systems. In this work, we analyze and predict the output patterns of a single qubit quantum circuit by treating the results of repeated executions as a time series. Specifically, we collect measurement data from multiple runs of a quantum circuit and construct a time series from these observations. By training a predictive model, we aim to forecast future outcomes, providing insights into the error behavior of the quantum circuit. Additionally, we analyze time series data from two different circuits executed on the same qubit to investigate potential relationships and assess whether one dataset can be used to predict the other. Our findings reveal key characteristics of quantum circuit outputs, including stationarity, autocorrelation, seasonality, trends, linearity, and causality. The analysis highlights intriguing behaviors within the dataset. Furthermore, we evaluate multiple time series prediction methods and determine that XGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boosting) outperforms other approaches, demonstrating its effectiveness in accurately predicting quantum computing outputs in subsequent runs.

TI Generating Sustained Coherence in a Quantum Memory for Retrieval at
   Times of Quantum Revival
SO ATOMS
AB We study the time degradation of quantum information stored in a quantum memory device under a dissipative environment in a parameter range which is experimentally relevant. The quantum memory under consideration is comprised of an optomechanical system with additional Kerr nonlinearity in the optical mode and an anharmonic mechanical oscillator with quadratic nonlinearity. Time degradation is monitored, both in terms of loss of coherence, which is analyzed with the help of Wigner functions, as well as in terms of loss of amplitude of the original state, studied as a function of time. While our time trajectories explore the degree to which the stored information degrades depending upon the variation in values of various parameters involved, we suggest a set of parameters for which the original information can be retrieved without degradation. We identify a very interesting situation where the role played by the nonlinearity is insignificant, and the system behaves as if the information is stored in a linear medium. For this case, the information retrieval is independent of the coherence revival time and can be retrieved at any instant during the time evolution.

TI Hardware-efficient quantum error correction via concatenated bosonic
   qubits
SO NATURE
AB To solve problems of practical importance1,2, quantum computers probably need to incorporate quantum error correction, in which a logical qubit is redundantly encoded in many noisy physical qubits3, 4-5. The large physical-qubit overhead associated with error correction motivates the search for more hardware-efficient approaches6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17-18. Here, using a superconducting quantum circuit19, we realize a logical qubit memory formed from the concatenation of encoded bosonic cat qubits with an outer repetition code of distance d = 5 (ref. 10). A stabilizing circuit passively protects cat qubits against bit flips20, 21, 22, 23-24. The repetition code, using ancilla transmons for syndrome measurement, corrects cat qubit phase flips. We study the performance and scaling of the logical qubit memory, finding that the phase-flip correcting repetition code operates below the threshold. The logical bit-flip error is suppressed with increasing cat qubit mean photon number, enabled by our realization of a cat-transmon noise-biased CX gate. The minimum measured logical error per cycle is on average 1.75(2)% for the distance-3 code sections, and 1.65(3)% for the distance-5 code. Despite the increased number of fault locations of the distance-5 code, the high degree of noise bias preserved during error correction enables comparable performance. These results, where the intrinsic error suppression of the bosonic encodings enables us to use a hardware-efficient outer error-correcting code, indicate that concatenated bosonic codes can be a compelling model for reaching fault-tolerant quantum computation.

TI Blind Quantum Computation Using a Circuit-Based Quantum Computer
SO JOURNAL OF THE PHYSICAL SOCIETY OF JAPAN
AB When a universal quantum computer is used by the public, it is assumed that it will be in the form of a quantum cloud server that exists at a few places due to its cost. In this cloud server, privacy will be an important issue. A blind quantum computation protocol will be necessary so that each user can use the server without the input=output and the details of the calculations being revealed. In this paper, we propose a new protocol that satisfies blindness using a quantum onetime pad for encryption and T-like gates. While most blind protocols use measurement-based quantum computation, our protocol is a blind protocol using circuit-based quantum computation. In our protocol, the ability of the user is the same as in the previous study, and the ability of the server is lower than in that study.

TI Measurement-Free Fault-Tolerant Quantum Error Correction in Near-Term
   Devices
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ONLINE PEDAGOGY AND COURSE DESIGN
AB Logical qubits can be protected from decoherence by performing quantum error-correction (QEC) cycles repeatedly. Algorithms for fault-tolerant QEC must be compiled to the specific hardware platform under consideration in order to practically realize a quantum memory that operates for in principle arbitrary long times. All circuit components must be assumed as noisy unless specific assumptions about the form of the noise are made. Modern QEC schemes are challenging to implement experimentally in physical architectures where in-sequence measurements and feed forward of classical information cannot be reliably executed fast enough or even at all. Here we provide a novel scheme to perform QEC cycles without the need of measuring qubits that is fully fault-tolerant with respect to all components used in the circuit. Our scheme can be used for any low-distance CSS code since its only requirement towards the underlying code is a transversal CNOT gate. Similarly to Steane-type EC, we coherently copy errors to a logical auxiliary qubit but then apply a coherent feedback operation from the auxiliary system to the logical data qubit. The logical auxiliary qubit is prepared fault tolerantly without measurements, too. We benchmark logical failure rates of the scheme in comparison to a flag-qubit-based EC cycle. We map out a parameter region where our scheme is feasible and estimate physical error rates necessary to achieve the break-even point of beneficial QEC with our scheme. We outline how our scheme could be implemented in ion traps and with neutral atoms in a tweezer array. For recently demonstrated capabilities of atom shuttling and native multiatom Rydberg gates, we achieve moderate circuit depths and beneficial performance of our scheme while not breaking fault tolerance. These results thereby enable practical fault-tolerant QEC in hardware architectures that do not support midcircuit measurements.

TI Mapping quantum circuits to shallow-depth measurement patterns based on
   graph states
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB The paradigm of measurement-based quantum computing (MBQC) starts from a highly entangled resource state on which unitary operations are executed through adaptive measurements and corrections ensuring determinism. This is set in contrast to the more common quantum circuit model, in which unitary operations are directly implemented through quantum gates prior to final measurements. In this work, we incorporate concepts from MBQC into the circuit model to create a hybrid simulation technique, permitting us to split any quantum circuit into a classically efficiently simulatable Clifford-part and a second part consisting of a stabilizer state and local (adaptive) measurement instructions-a so-called standard form-which is executed on a quantum computer. We further process the stabilizer state with the graph state formalism, thus, enabling a significant decrease in circuit depth for certain applications. We show that groups of mutually-commuting operators can be implemented using fully-parallel, i.e. non-adaptive, measurements within our protocol. In addition, we discuss how groups of mutually commuting observables can be simulatenously measured by adjusting the resource state, rather than performing a costly basis transformation prior to the measurement as it is done in the circuit model. Finally, we demonstrate the utility of our technique on two examples of high practical relevance-the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm and the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) for the ground-state energy estimation of the water molecule. For the VQE, we find a reduction of the depth by a factor of 4 to 5 using measurement patterns vs. the standard circuit model. At the same time, since we incorporate the simultaneous measurements, our patterns allow us to save shots by a factor of at least 3.5 compared to measuring Pauli strings individually in the circuit model.

In the former case, we will discuss the calculation of molecular integrals that can then be used to calculate potential energy curves at the Hartree-Fock level and to correct them by obtaining the exact results for all states in the minimal basis. Some aspects of spin-symmetry will also be discussed. In the case of quantum computing, we will start out from the second-quantized Hamiltonian and qubit mappings. We then provide circuits for quantum phase estimation using two different algorithms: Trotterization and qubitization. Finally, the significance of quantum error correction will be briefly discussed.

TI Noise-adapted recovery circuits for quantum error correction
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Implementing quantum error correction (QEC) protocols is a challenging task in today's era of noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices. We present quantum circuits for a universal, noise-adapted recovery map, often referred to as the Petz map, which is known to achieve close-to-optimal fidelity for arbitrary codes and noise channels. While two of our circuit constructions draw upon algebraic techniques such as isometric extension and block encoding, the third approach breaks down the recovery map into a sequence of two-outcome POVMs. In each of the three cases we improve upon the resource requirements that currently exist in the literature. Apart from Petz recovery circuits, we also present circuits that can directly estimate the fidelity between the encoded state and the recovered state. As a concrete example of our circuit constructions, we implement Petz recovery circuits corresponding to a four-qubit code that is tailor-made to correct for amplitude-damping noise. The efficacy of our noise-adapted recovery circuits is then demonstrated through ideal and noisy simulations on the IBM QasmSimulator.

The growing interest in quantum computing and the recent developments of quantum hardware devices motivates the development of new advanced computational tools focused on performance and usage simplicity. In this work we introduce a new quantum simulation framework that enables developers to delegate all complicated aspects of hardware or platform implementation to the library so they can focus on the problem and quantum algorithms at hand. This software is designed from scratch with simulation performance, code simplicity and user friendly interface as target goals. It takes advantage of hardware acceleration such as multi-threading Central Processing Unit (CPU), single Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) and multi-GPU devices.

TI Imperfect Quantum Photonic Neural Networks
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB Quantum photonic neural networks are variational photonic circuits that can be trained to implement high-fidelity quantum operations. However, work-to-date has assumed idealized components, including a perfect pi Kerr nonlinearity. This work investigates the limitations of non-ideal quantum photonic neural networks that suffer from fabrication imperfections leading to unbalanced photon loss and imperfect routing, and weak nonlinearities, showing that they can learn to overcome most of these errors. Using the example of a Bell-state analyzer, the results demonstrate that there is an optimal network size, which balances imperfections versus the ability to compensate for lacking nonlinearities. With a sub-optimal pi/10$\pi /10$ effective Kerr nonlinearity, it is shown that a network fabricated with current state-of-the-art processes can achieve an unconditional fidelity of 0.905 that increases to 0.999999 if it is possible to precondition success on the detection of a photon in each logical photonic qubit. These results provide a guide to the construction of viable, brain-inspired quantum photonic devices for emerging quantum technologies.

In this work, we show how quantum machine learning can be used to improve financial forecasting. First, we use classical and quantum Determinantal Point Processes to enhance Random Forest models for churn prediction, improving precision by almost 6%. Second, we design quantum neural network architectures with orthogonal and compound layers for credit risk assessment, which match classical performance with significantly fewer parameters. Our results demonstrate that leveraging quantum ideas can effectively enhance the performance of machine learning, both today as quantum-inspired classical ML solutions, and even more in the future, with the advent of better quantum hardware.

TI Fault-tolerant quantum memory using low-depth random circuit codes
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Low-depth random circuit codes possess many desirable properties for quantum error correction but have so far only been analyzed in the code capacity setting where it is assumed that encoding gates and syndrome measurements are noiseless. In this work, we design a fault-tolerant distillation protocol for preparing encoded states of one-dimensional random circuit codes even when all gates and measurements are subject to noise. This is sufficient for fault-tolerant quantum memory since these encoded states can then be used as ancillas for Steane error correction. We show through numerical simulations that our protocol can correct erasure errors up to an error rate of 2%. In addition, we also extend results in the code capacity setting by developing a maximum likelihood marginal decoder for depolarizing noise similar to work by Darmawan et al. [Phys. Rev. Res. 6, 023055 (2024)]. As in their work, we formulate the decoding problem as a tensor network contraction and show how to contract the network efficiently by exploiting the low-depth structure. Replacing the tensor network with a so-called "tropical" tensor network, we also show how to perform minimum weight decoding. With these decoders, we are able to numerically estimate the depolarizing error threshold of finite-rate random circuit codes and show that this threshold closely matches the hashing bound even when the decoding is suboptimal.

Here, we consider a setting in which a process generates a quantum resource state with some probability p in each time step and stores it in a quantum memory that is subject to time-dependent noise. To maintain sufficient quality for an application, each resource state is discarded from the memory after w time steps. Let s be the number of desired resource states required by a protocol. We characterize the probability distribution X((w,s) )of the ages of the quantum resource states, once s states have been generated in a window w. Combined with a time-dependent noise model, knowledge of this distribution allows for the calculation of fidelity statistics of the s quantum resources. We also give exact solutions for the first and second moments of the waiting time tau((w,s)) until s resources are produced within a window w , which provides information about the rate of the protocol. Since it is difficult to obtain general closed-form expressions for statistical quantities describing the expected waiting time E(tau((w,s))) and the distribution X-(w,X-s), we present two novel results that aid their computation in certain parameter regimes. The methods presented in this work can be used to analyze and optimize the execution of quantum protocols. Specifically, with an example of a blind quantum computing protocol, we illustrate how they may be used to infer w and p to optimize the rate of successful protocol execution.

TI EP-PQM: Efficient Parametric Probabilistic Quantum Memory With Fewer
   Qubits and Gates
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM ENGINEERING
AB Machine learning (ML) classification tasks can be carried out on a quantum computer (QC) using probabilistic quantum memory (PQM) and its extension, parametric PQM (P-PQM), by calculating the Hamming distance between an input pattern and a database of r patterns containing z features with a distinct attributes. For PQM and P-PQM to correctly compute the Hamming distance, the feature must be encoded using one-hot encoding, which is memory intensive for multiattribute datasets with a > 2. We can represent multiattribute data more compactly by replacing one-hot encoding with label encoding; both encodings yield the same Hamming distance. Implementing this replacement on a classical computer is trivial. However, replacing these encoding schemes on a QC is not straightforward because PQMand P-PQM operate at the bit level, rather than at the feature level (a feature is represented by a binary string of 0's and 1's). We present an enhanced P-PQM, called efficient P-PQM (EP-PQM), that allows label encoding of data stored in a PQM data structure and reduces the circuit depth of the data storage and retrieval procedures. We show implementations for an ideal QC and a noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) device. Our complexity analysis shows that the EP-PQM approach requires O(z log(2)(a)) qubits as opposed to O(za) qubits for P-PQM. EP-PQM also requires fewer gates, reducing gate count from O(rza) to O(rz log(2)(a)). For five datasets, we demonstrate that training an ML classification model using EP-PQM requires 48% to 77% fewer qubits than P-PQM for datasets with a > 2. EP-PQM reduces circuit depth in the range of 60% to 96%, depending on the dataset. The depth decreases further with a decomposed circuit, ranging between 94% and 99%. EP-PQM requires less space; thus, it can train on and classify larger datasets than previous PQM implementations on NISQ devices. Furthermore, reducing the number of gates speeds up the classification and reduces the noise associated with deep quantum circuits. Thus, EP-PQM brings us closer to scalable ML on an NISQ device.

TI Estimation of the Influence of a Noisy Environment on the Binary
   Decision Strategy in a Quantum Illumination Radar
SO SENSORS
AB A quantum illumination radar uses quantum entanglement to enhance photodetection sensitivity. The entanglement is quickly destroyed by the decoherence in an environment, although the sensitivity enhancement could survive thanks to quantum correlations beyond the entanglement. These quantum correlations are quantified by the quantum discord. Here, we use a toy model with an amplitude damping channel and Lloyd's binary decision strategy to highlight the possible role of these correlations from the perspective of a quantum radar.

TI Quantum tomography of three-qubit state
SO OPTICS COMMUNICATIONS
AB This paper presents a significant advancement in the field of quantum tomography, specifically focusing on the canonical form of three-qubit states, which are increasingly vital in quantum computing and quantum information processing. The motivation for this research arises from the need to accurately characterize pure three-qubit states in the presence of environmental disturbances, particularly amplitude-damping noise. Our analysis reveals that measurement probabilities obtained from generalized single-qubit Symmetric Informationally Complete Positive Operator-Valued Measures (SIC-POVMs) are sufficient for uniquely determining the quantum state, even in the presence of noise. A key innovation of this study is its thorough exploration of how amplitude-damping noise not only affects the measurement process but also influences the quantum state. We demonstrate that entanglement between qubits plays a crucial role in this context; specifically, we establish that any qubit entangled with a qubit affected by noise is also subjected to its effects. This insight highlights the interconnected nature of qubits in multi-qubit systems and the implications for state reconstruction. The findings of this research contribute a robust framework for state reconstruction in noisy environments, which is essential for the advancement of fault-tolerant quantum computing and secure quantum communication protocols. By elucidating the relationship between measurement probabilities and noise parameters, we enhance the understanding of the resilience of quantum state tomography techniques, thereby improving their applicability in practical quantum technologies. This work not only strengthens the theoretical foundations of quantum information science but also lays the groundwork for implementing these principles in real-world scenarios.

TI High-fidelity geometric quantum gates exceeding 99.9% in germanium
   quantum dots
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Achieving high-fidelity and robust qubit manipulations is a crucial requirement for realizing fault-tolerant quantum computation. Here, we demonstrate a single-hole spin qubit in a germanium quantum dot and characterize its control fidelity using gate set tomography. The maximum control fidelities reach 97.48%, 99.81%, 99.88% for the I, X/2 and Y/2 gate, respectively. These results reveal that off-resonance noise during consecutive I gates in gate set tomography sequences severely limits qubit performance. Therefore, we introduce geometric quantum computation to realize noise-resilient qubit manipulation. The geometric gate control fidelities remain above 99% across a wide range of Rabi frequencies. The maximum fidelity surpasses 99.9%. Furthermore, the fidelities of geometric X/2 and Y/2 (I) gates exceed 99% even when detuning the microwave frequency by +/- 2.5 MHz (+/- 1.2 MHz), highlighting the noise-resilient feature. These results demonstrate that geometric quantum computation is a potential method for achieving high-fidelity qubit manipulation reproducibly in semiconductor quantum computation.

These fields start to build their ecosystems which in the future will probably coalesce into a homogeneous quantum information layer consisting of such interconnected components as quantum internet, full size quantum computers with efficient error corrections and ultrasensitive quantum metrology nodes stationary and mobile. Today, however, the skepticism expressing many doubts about the realizability of this optimistic view fights with a cheap optimism pouring out of some popular press releases. Where is the truth? Financing of the IQT by key players in research, development and markets substantially strengthens the optimistic side. Keeping the bright side with some reservations, we concentrate on showing the FAST pace of IQT developments in such areas as biological sciences, quantum evolutionary computations, quantum internet and some of its components.

TI Complex quantum network models from spin clusters
SO COMMUNICATIONS PHYSICS
AB In the emerging quantum internet, complex network topology could lead to efficient quantum communication and robustness against failures. However, there are concerns about complexity in quantum communication networks, such as potentially limited end-to-end transmission capacity. These challenges call for model systems in which the impact of complex topology on quantum communication protocols can be explored. Here, we present a theoretical model for complex quantum communication networks on a lattice of spins, wherein entangled spin clusters in interacting quantum spin systems serve as communication links between appropriately selected regions of spins. Specifically, we show that ground state Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger clusters of the two-dimensional random transverse-field Ising model can be used as communication links between regions of spins. Further, the resulting quantum networks can have complexity comparable to that of the classical internet. Our work provides a generative model for further studies towards determining the network characteristics of the emerging quantum internet.

AB The Quantum Natural Gradient (QNG) method enhances optimization in variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) by incorporating geometric insights from the quantum state space through the Fubini-Study metric. In this work, we extend QNG by introducing higher-order integrators and geodesic corrections using the Riemannian Euler update rule and geodesic equations, deriving an updated rule for the Quantum Natural Gradient with Geodesic Correction (QNGGC). We also develop an efficient method for computing the Christoffel symbols necessary for these corrections, leveraging the parameter-shift rule to enable direct measurement from quantum circuits. Through theoretical analysis and practical examples, we demonstrate that QNGGC significantly improves convergence rates over standard QNG, highlighting the benefits of integrating geodesic corrections into quantum optimization processes. Our approach paves the way for more efficient quantum algorithms, leveraging the advantages of geometric methods.

AB Rapid progress in quantum technology has transformed quantum computing and quantum information science from theoretical possibilities into tangible engineering challenges. Breakthroughs in quantum algorithms, quantum simulations, and quantum error correction are bringing useful quantum computation closer to fruition. These remarkable achievements have been facilitated by advances in quantum characterization, verification, and validation (QCVV). QCVV methods and protocols enable scientists and engineers to scrutinize, understand, and enhance the performance of quantum information-processing devices. In this tutorial, we review the fundamental principles underpinning QCVV, and introduce a diverse array of QCVV tools used by quantum researchers. We define and explain QCVV's core models and concepts-quantum states, measurements, and processes-and illustrate how these building blocks are leveraged to examine a target system or operation. We survey and introduce protocols ranging from simple qubit characterization to advanced benchmarking methods. Along the way, we provide illustrated examples and detailed descriptions of the protocols, highlight the advantages and disadvantages of each, and discuss their potential scalability to future large-scale quantum computers. This tutorial serves as a guidebook for researchers unfamiliar with the benchmarking and characterization of quantum computers, and also as a detailed reference for experienced practitioners.

AB Quantum computers are constantly growing in their number of qubits, but continue to suffer from restrictions such as the limited pairs of qubits that may interact with each other. Thus far, this problem is addressed by mapping and moving qubits to suitable positions for the interaction (known as quantum circuit mapping). However, this movement requires additional gates to be incorporated into the circuit, whose number should be kept as small as possible since each gate increases the likelihood of errors and decoherence. State-of-the-art mapping methods utilize swapping and bridging to move the qubits along the static paths of the coupling map-solving this problem without exploiting all means the quantum domain has to offer. In this paper, we propose to additionally exploit quantum teleportation as a possible complementary method. Quantum teleportation conceptually allows to move the state of a qubit over arbitrary long distances with constant overhead-providing the potential of determining cheaper mappings. The potential is demonstrated by a case study on the IBM Q Tokyo architecture which already shows promising improvements. With the emergence of larger quantum computing architectures, quantum teleportation will become more effective in generating cheaper mappings.

TI Faithful Quantum Teleportation via a Nanophotonic Nonlinear Bell State
   Analyzer
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Quantum networking protocols, including quantum teleportation and entanglement swapping, use linear-optical Bell state measurements for heralding the distribution and transfer of quantum information. However, a linear-optical Bell state measurement requires identical photons and is susceptible to errors caused by multiphoton emission, fundamentally limiting the efficiency and fidelity of quantum networking protocols. Here we show a nonlinear Bell state analyzer for time-bin encoded photons based on a nanophotonic cavity with a sum-frequency generation efficiency of 4 x 10-5 to filter multiphoton emissions, and utilize it for faithful quantum teleportation involving spectrally distinct photons with fidelities >= 94% down to the single-photon level. Our result demonstrates that nonlinear-optical entangling operations, empowered by our efficient nanophotonics platform, can realize faithful quantum information protocols without requiring identical photons and without the fundamental limit on the fidelity of a Bell state measurement imposed by linear optics, which facilitates the realization of practical quantum networks.

TI Topological-Graph Dependencies and Scaling Properties of a Heuristic
   Qubit-Assignment Algorithm
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM ENGINEERING
AB The qubit-mapping problem aims to assign and route qubits of a quantum circuit onto an noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) device in an optimized fashion, with respect to some cost function. Finding an optimal solution to this problem is known to scale exponentially in computational complexity; as such, it is imperative to investigate scalable qubit-mapping solutions for NISQ computation. In this work, a noise-aware heuristic qubit-assignment algorithm (which assigns initial placements for qubits in a quantum algorithm to qubits on an NISQ device, but does not route qubits during the quantum algorithm's execution) is presented and compared against the optimal brute-force solution, as well as a trivial qubit assignment, with the aim to quantify the performance of our heuristic qubit-assignment algorithm. We find that for small, connected-graph algorithms, our heuristic-assignment algorithm faithfully lies in between the effective upper and lower bounds given by the brute-force and trivial qubit-assignment algorithms. Additionally, we find that the topological-graph properties of quantum algorithms with over six qubits play an important role in our heuristic qubit-assignment algorithm's performance on NISQ devices. Finally, we investigate the scaling properties of our heuristic algorithm for quantum processors with up to 100 qubits; here, the algorithm was found to be scalable for quantum-algorithms that admit path-like graphs. Our findings show that as the size of the quantum processor in our simulation grows, so do the benefits from utilizing the heuristic qubit-assignment algorithm, under particular constraints for our heuristic algorithm. This work, thus, characterizes the performance of a heuristic qubit-assignment algorithm with respect to the topological-graph and scaling properties of a quantum algorithm that one may wish to run on a given NISQ device.

TI Quantum Computing Approaches for Mission Covering Optimization
SO ALGORITHMS
AB Quantum computing has the potential to revolutionize the way hard computational problems are solved in terms of speed and accuracy. Quantum hardware is an active area of research and different hardware platforms are being developed. Quantum algorithms target each hardware implementation and bring advantages to specific applications. The focus of this paper is to compare how well quantum annealing techniques and the QAOA models constrained optimization problems. As a use case, a constrained optimization problem called mission covering optimization is used. Quantum annealing is implemented in adiabatic hardware such as D-Wave, and QAOA is implemented in gate-based hardware such as IBM. This effort provides results in terms of cost, timing, constraints held, and qubits used.

TI Feasible measurement-based entanglement purification in linear optics
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Entanglement purification is used to distill high quality entangled states from several noisy low quality entangled states, and it plays a key role in quantum repeater. The measurement-based entanglement purification protocol (MB-EPP) does not require local two-qubit gates or single-particle measurements on the noisy pairs and may offer significant advantages compared with the gate-based EPPs. We present an alternative MB-EPP in linear optics. Subsequently, we provide a detailed analysis on the realization of this MB-EPP using spontaneous parametric down conversion (SPDC) sources. By delicately designing the optical circuits, the double-pair emission noise caused by SPDC sources can be eliminated automatically. Combined with suitable quantum memory and entanglement swapping, this MB-EPP may have application potential in the implementation of a practical measurement-based quantum repeater.

TI Quantum computing: A taxonomy, systematic review and future directions
SO SOFTWARE-PRACTICE & EXPERIENCE
AB Quantum computing (QC) is an emerging paradigm with the potential to offer significant computational advantage over conventional classical computing by exploiting quantum-mechanical principles such as entanglement and superposition. It is anticipated that this computational advantage of QC will help to solve many complex and computationally intractable problems in several application domains such as drug design, data science, clean energy, finance, industrial chemical development, secure communications, and quantum chemistry. In recent years, tremendous progress in both quantum hardware development and quantum software/algorithm has brought QC much closer to reality. Indeed, the demonstration of quantum supremacy marks a significant milestone in the Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ) era-the next logical step being the quantum advantage whereby quantum computers solve a real-world problem much more efficiently than classical computing. As the quantum devices are expected to steadily scale up in the next few years, quantum decoherence and qubit interconnectivity are two of the major challenges to achieve quantum advantage in the NISQ era. QC is a highly topical and fast-moving field of research with significant ongoing progress in all facets. A systematic review of the existing literature on QC will be invaluable to understand the state-of-the-art of this emerging field and identify open challenges for the QC community to address in the coming years. This article presents a comprehensive review of QC literature and proposes taxonomy of QC. The proposed taxonomy is used to map various related studies to identify the research gaps. A detailed overview of quantum software tools and technologies, post-quantum cryptography, and quantum computer hardware development captures the current state-of-the-art in the respective areas. The article identifies and highlights various open challenges and promising future directions for research and innovation in QC.

AB We implement an iterative scheme for the generation of coherent states superpositions, using a quantum memory to take advantage of the iterative nature of the protocol. The generation rate has thus been increased by one order of magnitude, reaching 100 (Hz). Furthermore, the generated states were stored in the quantum memory during 184 (ns) before their characterization, paving the way toward the implementation of more complex iterative protocols.

TI Flexible generation of optomagnonic quantum entanglement and quantum
   coherence difference in a double-cavity-optomagnomechanical system
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Quantum entanglement and quantum coherence generated from the optomagnomechanical system are important resources in quantum information and quantum computation. In this paper, a scheme for flexibly generating optomagnonic quantum entanglement and quantum coherence difference is proposed, based on a double-cavity-optomagnomechanical system. The parameter dependencies of the bipartite optomagnonic entanglement, the genuine tripartite optomagnonic entanglement, the quantum coherence difference, and the stability of the system, are investigated intensively. The results show that this scheme endows the magnon more flexibility to choose different mechanisms, under the condition of maintaining the system stable. This work is valuable for connecting different nodes in hybrid quantum networks and manipulating the magnon states with light in the future.

TI Simulating Quantum State Transfer Between Distributed Devices Using
   Noisy Interconnects
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB Scaling beyond individual quantum devices via distributed quantum computing relies critically on high-fidelity quantum state transfers between devices, yet the quantum interconnects needed for this are currently unavailable or expected to be significantly noisy. These limitations can be bypassed by simulating ideal state transfer using quasiprobability decompositions (QPDs). Wire cutting, for instance, allows this even without quantum interconnects. Nevertheless, QPD methods face drawbacks, requiring sampling from multiple circuit variants and incurring substantial sampling overhead. While prior theoretical work showed that incorporating noisy interconnects within QPD protocols could reduce sampling overhead relative to interconnect quality, a practical implementation for realistic conditions is lacking. Addressing this gap, this work presents a generalized and practical QPD for state transfer simulation using noisy interconnects to reduce sampling overhead. The QPD incorporates a single tunable parameter for straightforward calibration to any utilized interconnect. To lower practical costs, the work also explores reducing the number of distinct circuit variants required by the QPD. Experimental validation on contemporary quantum devices confirms the proposed QPD's practical feasibility and expected sampling overhead reduction under realistic noise. Notably, the results show higher effective state transfer fidelity than direct transfer over the underlying noisy interconnect.

AB We present a linear optical protocol for teleporting and correcting both temporal and frequency errors in two time-frequency qubit states. The first state is the frequency (or time-of-arrival) cat qubit, which is a single photon in a superposition of two frequencies (or time-of-arrival), while the second is the time-frequency Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) state, which is a single photon with a frequency comb structure. The proposed optical scheme could be valuable for reducing the error rate in quantum communication protocols involving one of these qubits.

TI Quantum machine learning with Qiskit: Evaluating regression accuracy and
   noise impact
SO IET QUANTUM COMMUNICATION
AB Quantum machine learning (QML) can be employed in solving complicated machine learning tasks although the performance in examining the regression processes is only barely understood. Knowledge gaps are intended to be closed by studying modelling performance of QML in regression tasks, with emphasis being dedicated to scaling up and ability to resist noise. The regression part offers the following functions that include straight line and complex operations. Furthermore, the authors employ quantum neural networks generated using Qiskit to perform experiments. The results demonstrate that QML has a remarkable level of accuracy in basic regressions, reaching a maximum of 97%. Nevertheless, there are difficulties in representing intricate functions, such as 5 x cos(x), which results in a noticeable decline in performance. The work deals with the influence of noise and IERs from imperfect hardware on the efficiency of QML algorithms providing insight into the core obstacles. The result of a detailed examination of the results that have tested the powers and limits of QML in the development of regression applications is represented. The future direction of research and development will be defined by the results obtained in it.

SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB Some quantum information processing protocols necessitate quantum operations that are invariant under complex conjugation. In this study, we analyze the non-local resources necessary for implementing conjugation-symmetric measurements on multipartite quantum networks. We derive conditions under which a given multipartite conjugation can have locally implementable symmetric measurements. In particular, a family of numbers called the 'magic-basis spectrum' comprehensively characterizes the local measurability of a given 2-qubit conjugation, as well as any other properties that are invariant under local unitary transformations. We also explore the non-local resources required for optimal measurements on known quantum sensor networks by using their conjugation symmetries as a guide.

TI Nonadiabatic quantum state engineering by time-dependent
   decoherence-free subspaces in open quantum systems
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB We extend the theory of quantum state engineering (QSE) to the open quantum systems which simultaneously suffer time-dependent decoherence and time-independent decoherence. A hybrid approach is proposed to effectively realize QSE by combination of time-dependent decoherence-free subspaces and shortcuts to adiabaticity theories. As an application, a concrete single-qubit QSE example with an open five-level system is presented. Numerical simulations confirm that the approach is reliable and robust against both of time-dependent decoherence and time-independent decoherence. Certain dissipation effects are no longer harmful but play a positive role in the QSE. In addition, the approach can be generalized to realize QSE in high-dimensional quantum systems. Therefore, this proposal is quite useful for quantum computation and quantum information processing in open systems.

TI Quantum teleportation in nonequilibrium environments and fixed-point
   fidelity
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Quantum teleportation, a fundamental protocol in quantum information science, enables the transfer of quantum states through entangled particle pairs and classical communication channels. While ideal quantum teleportation requires maximally entangled states as resources, real-world implementations inevitably face environmental noise and decoherence effects. In this work, we investigate quantum teleportation in nonequilibrium environments with different temperatures or chemical potentials. We employ the Bloch-Redfield equation to characterize the nonequilibrium dynamics in both bosonic and fermionic reservoirs. Our analysis reveals that nonequilibrium conditions, namely, the temperature difference and chemical potential difference, can significantly enhance the teleportation fidelity beyond what is achievable in equilibrium scenarios. Notably, under certain nonequilibrium conditions, the fidelities for all input states converge to the same value. We term this behavior the teleportation with a fixed-point fidelity. Importantly, at this fixed point, fidelity can be further enhanced by tuning the nonequilibrium parameters. These findings offer crucial insights for the implementation of quantum communication protocols in realistic environments, demonstrating that nonequilibrium conditions not only improve the fidelity but also present a promising avenue for simplifying practical quantum teleportation schemes.

TI Deciphering a Million-Plus RSA Integer with Ultralow Local Field
   Coefficient h and Coupling Coefficient J of the Ising Model by

SO TSINGHUA SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB This work is the first to determine that a real quantum computer (including generalized and specialized) can decipher million-scale RSA relying solely on quantum algorithms, showing the real attack potential of D-Wave machines. The influence of different column widths on RSA factorization results is studied on the basis of a multiplication table, and the optimal column method is determined by traversal experiments. The traversal experiment of integer factorization within 10 000 shows that the local field and coupling coefficients are 75%-93% lower than the research of Shanghai University in 2020 and more than 85% lower than that of Purdue University in 2018. Extremely low Ising model parameters are crucial to reducing the hardware requirements, prompting factoring 1 245 407 on the D-Wave 2000Q real machine. D-Wave advantage already has more than 5000 qubits and will be expanded to 7000 qubits during 2023-2024, with remarkable improvements in decoherence and topology. This machine is expected to promote the solution of large-scale combinatorial optimization problems. One of the contributions of this paper is the discussion of the long-term impact of D-Wave on the development of post-quantum cryptography standards.

SO LINEAR & MULTILINEAR ALGEBRA
AB Perfect quantum state transfer plays a crucial role in quantum information processing and quantum computation. There has been extensive study of perfect quantum state transfer on Cayley graphs over abelian groups. In this paper, we consider the existence of perfect quantum state transfer on Cayley graphs over semi-dihedral groups which are non-abelian groups. Using the representations of semi-dihedral groups, we provide some necessary and sufficient conditions for Cayley graphs over semi-dihedral groups admitting perfect quantum state transfer. By those conditions, we present examples of perfect quantum state transfer on Cayley graphs over semi-dihedral groups. In addition, we propose results about whether some new Cayley graphs over non-abelian groups admit perfect quantum state transfer.

TI Unraveling-paired dynamical maps recover the input of quantum channels
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB We explore algebraic and dynamical consequences of unraveling general time-local master equations. We show that the 'influence martingale', the paramount ingredient of a recently discovered unraveling framework, pairs any time-local master equation with a one parameter family of Lindblad-Gorini-Kossakowski-Sudarshan master equations. At any instant of time, the variance of the influence martingale provides an upper bound on the Hilbert-Schmidt distance between solutions of paired master equations. Finding the lowest upper bound on the variance of the influence martingale yields an explicit criterion of 'optimal pairing'. The criterion independently retrieves the measure of isotropic noise necessary for the structural physical approximation of the flow the time-local master equation with a completely positive flow. The optimal pairing also allows us to invoke a general result on linear maps on operators (the 'commutant representation') to embed the flow of a general master equation in the off-diagonal corner of a completely positive semi-group which in turn solves a time-local master equation that we explicitly determine. We use the embedding to reverse a completely positive evolution, a quantum channel, to its initial condition thereby providing a protocol to preserve quantum memory against decoherence. We thus arrive at a model of continuous-time error correction by a quantum channel.

TI Quantum Computing Integrated Patterns for Real-Time Cryptography in
   Assorted Domains
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Quantum computers use quantum-mechanical phenomena for knowledge manipulation and depend on quantum bits or qubits. A qubit can be created in several different ways, and out of this, one way of creating a quantum state is by using superconductivity. They must be held very cold to work on these superconductive qubits for long periods. The key to information storage and manipulation is the skill of all computer systems. Current traditional computers handle single bits stored in binary states of 0 and 1 form. Every temperature factor inside the device may be updated; thus, quantum computers are more excellent than the vacuum of space at temperatures similar to absolute null. Consider how the dilution refrigerator of a quantum computer consisting of over 2000 components provides a cold atmosphere for the inside of the qubits. Researchers from all around the world today are using actual quantum processors for validating algorithms for different fields of operation. Yet quantum computation was a strictly speculative topic a couple of decades ago. Quantum cryptography, also known as quantum encoding, uses quantum mechanics principles to encrypt messages in a way nobody else reads. It benefits quantum states, along with its "theory of no transition," which means that it cannot be disrupted unknowingly. Quantum-improved AI calculations are especially applicable to the area. This work focuses on the implementation patterns of quantum computing in real-time cryptography so that the overall communication will be secured and integrity aware.

TI Generation and robustness of quantum entanglement in spin graphs
SO QUANTUM INFORMATION PROCESSING
AB Entanglement is a crucial resource for quantum information processing, and so protocols to generate high-fidelity entangled states on various hardware platforms are in demand. While spin chains have been extensively studied to generate entanglement, graph structures also have such potential; however, only a few classes of graphs have been explored for this specific task. In this paper, we apply a particular coupling scheme involving two different coupling strengths to a graph of two interconnected 3x3 square graphs such that it effectively contains three defects. We show how this structure allows generation of a Bell state whose fidelity depends on the chosen coupling ratio. We apply partitioned graph theory in order to reduce the dimension of the graph and show that, using a reduced graph or a reduced chain, we can still simulate the same protocol with identical dynamics. Finally, we investigate how fabrication errors affect the entanglement generation protocol and how the different equivalent structures are affected, finding that for some specific coupling ratios they are extremely robust.

TI Prognostics and Health Management of Rotating Machinery via Quantum
   Machine Learning
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Prognostics and Health Management (PHM) concerns predicting machines' behavior to support maintenance decisions through failure modes diagnosis and prognosis. Diagnosis is broadly applied in the context of rotating machines' state classification using several traditional Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) methods. Recently, Quantum Computing (QC), a new and expanding research field, has contributed to different purposes and contexts, such as optimization, artificial intelligence, simulation, cybersecurity, pharmaceutics, and the energy sector. Despite the current limitations in terms of hardware, QC has been studied as an alternative for improving models' speed and computational efficiency. Specifically, this paper proposes a Quantum Machine Learning (QML) approach to diagnose rolling bearings, which are essential components in rotating machinery, based on vibration signals. We apply hybrid models involving the encoding and construction of parameterized quantum circuits (PQC) connected to a classical neural network, the Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP). We consider combinations of the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) framework with rotation gates and different entanglement (two-qubits) gates (CNOT, CZ and iSWAP). For each PQC configuration, we assess the impact of the number of layers (1, 5 and 10). We use two databases of different complexity levels not previously explored with QML, namely CWRU and JNU, with 10 and 12 failure modes, respectivel. For CWRU, all QML models presented higher accuracy than the classical MLP. For JNU, all QML models were superior to classical MLP as well. These results suggest that, despite the current limitations of quantum environments, QML models are promising tools to be further investigated in PHM.

TI Deterministic photonic quantum computation in a synthetic time dimension
SO OPTICA
AB Photonics offers unique advantages as a substrate for quantum information processing, but imposes fundamental scalability challenges. Nondeterministic schemes impose massive resource overheads, while deterministic schemes require prohibitively many identical quantum emitters to realize sizeable quantum circuits. Here we propose a scalable architecture for a photonic quantum computer that needs minimal quantum resources to implement any quantum circuit: a single coherently controlled atom. Optical switches endow a photonic quantum state with a synthetic time dimension by modulating photon-atom couplings. Quantum operations applied to the atomic qubit can be teleported onto photonic qubits via projective measurement, and arbitrary quantum circuits can be compiled into a sequence of these teleported operators. This design negates the need for many identical quantum emitters to be integrated into a photonic circuit and allows effective all-to-all connectivity between photonic qubits. The proposed device has a machine size that is independent of quantum circuit depth, does not require single-photon detectors, operates deterministically, and is robust to experimental imperfections.

TI Fundamental limitations on distillation of quantum channel resources
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Quantum channels underlie the dynamics of quantum systems, but in many practical settings it is the channels themselves that require processing. We establish universal limitations on the processing of both quantum states and channels, expressed in the form of no-go theorems and quantitative bounds for the manipulation of general quantum channel resources under the most general transformation protocols. Focusing on the class of distillation tasks - which can be understood either as the purification of noisy channels into unitary ones, or the extraction of state-based resources from channels - we develop fundamental restrictions on the error incurred in such transformations, and comprehensive lower bounds for the overhead of any distillation protocol. In the asymptotic setting, our results yield broadly applicable bounds for rates of distillation. We demonstrate our results through applications to fault-tolerant quantum computation, where we obtain state-of-the-art lower bounds for the overhead cost of magic state distillation, as well as to quantum communication, where we recover a number of strong converse bounds for quantum channel capacity. Several key tasks in quantum information processing can be regarded as channel manipulation. Here, focusing on the class of distillation protocols, the authors derive general bounds on resource overhead and incurred errors, showing application to magic state distillation and quantum channel capacities.

TI Requirements for upgrading trusted nodes to a repeater chain over 900 km
   of optical fiber
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB We perform a numerical study of the distribution of entanglement on a real-world fiber grid connecting the German cities of Bonn and Berlin. The connection is realized using a chain of processing-node quantum repeaters spanning roughly 900 kilometers. Their placement is constrained by the fiber grid we consider, resulting in asymmetric links. We investigate how minimal hardware requirements depend on the target application, as well as on the number of repeaters in the chain. We find that requirements for blind quantum computing are markedly different than those for quantum key distribution, with the required coherence time being around two and a half times larger for the former. Further, we observe a trade-off regarding how target secret-key rates are achieved when using different numbers of repeaters: comparatively low-quality entangled states generated at a high rate are preferred for higher numbers of repeaters, whereas comparatively high-quality states generated at a lower rate are favored for lower numbers of repeaters. To obtain our results we employ an extensive simulation framework implemented using NetSquid, a discrete-event simulator for quantum networks. These are combined with an optimization methodology based on genetic algorithms to determine minimal hardware requirements.

TI Quantum circuits from non-unitary sparse binary matrices
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Quantum computing leverages unitary matrices to perform reversible computations while preserving probability norms. However, many real-world applications involve non-unitary sparse matrices, posing a challenge for quantum implementation. This paper introduces a novel method for transforming a class of non-unitary sparse binary matrices into higher-dimensional permutation matrices, ensuring unitarity. Our approach is efficient in both space and time, ensuring practical applicability to large-scale problems. We demonstrate the utility of this transformation in constructing quantum gates and apply the method to model quantum finite state machines (QFSMs) derived from classical deterministic finite automata (DFAs). This work offers a practical pathway for integrating non-unitary transformations into quantum systems, with implications for the many applications that are based on sparse, non-unitary matrices. The significance of this work for automata theory and quantum computation is outlined.

TI Quantum Computing with Differentiable Quantum Transforms
SO ACM TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM COMPUTING
AB We present a framework for differentiable quantum transforms. Such transforms are metaprograms capable of manipulating quantum programs in a way that preserves their differentiability. We highlight their potential with a set of relevant examples across quantum computing (gradient computation, circuit compilation, and error mitigation), and implement them using the transform framework of PennyLane, a software library for differentiable quantum programming. In this framework, the transforms themselves are differentiable and can be parametrized and optimized, which opens up the possibility of improved quantum resource requirements across a spectrum of tasks.

We use the quantum phase estimation technique and the iterative one to execute the program on PPRC cluster and IBM devices, respectively. Our results obtained from executing the quantum circuits on the IBM classical devices show that our circuits succeed at simulating the system. However, duo to scattered results, we execute only the iterative phase estimation part of the circuit on the 5 qubit quantum devices to reduce the circuit size and obtain low-scattered results.

TI Unveiling quantum entanglement and correlation of sub-Ohmic and Ohmic
   baths for quantum phase transitions in dissipative systems
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB By employing the spin-boson model in a dense limit of environmental modes, quantum entanglement and correlation of sub-Ohmic and Ohmic baths for dissipative quantum phase transitions are numerically investigated based on the variational principle. With several measures borrowed from quantum information theory, three different types of singularities are found for the first-order, second-order, and Kosterlitz-Thouless phase transitions, respectively, and the values of transition points and critical exponents are accurately determined. Besides, the scaling form of the quantum discord in the Ohmic case is identified, quite different from that in the sub-Ohmic regime. In a two-spin model, two distinct behaviors of the quantum discord are uncovered: one is related to the quantum entanglement between two spins and the other is decided by the correlation function in the position space rather than the entanglement.

TI Schrödinger cat states of a nuclear spin qudit in silicon
SO NATURE PHYSICS
AB High-dimensional quantum systems are a valuable resource for quantum information processing. They can be used to encode error-correctable logical qubits, which has been demonstrated using continuous-variable states in microwave cavities or the motional modes of trapped ions. For example, high-dimensional systems can be used to realize 'Schr & ouml;dinger cat' states, which are superpositions of widely displaced coherent states that can be used to illustrate quantum effects at large scales. Recent proposals have suggested encoding qubits in high-spin atomic nuclei, which are finite-dimensional systems that can host hardware-efficient versions of continuous-variable codes. Here we demonstrate the creation and manipulation of Schr & ouml;dinger cat states using the spin-7/2 nucleus of an antimony atom embedded in a silicon nanoelectronic device. We use a multi-frequency control scheme to produce spin rotations that preserve the symmetry of the qudit, and we constitute logical Pauli operations for qubits encoded in the Schr & ouml;dinger cat states. Our work demonstrates the ability to prepare and control non-classical resource states, which is a prerequisite for applications in quantum information processing and quantum error correction, using our scalable, manufacturable semiconductor platform.

TI Enhancing satellite-to-ground communication using quantum key
   distribution
SO IET QUANTUM COMMUNICATION
AB Classical Cryptography has been in use for a long time. It has been the only way of securing people's communication. However, there are some flaws observed during the execution of classical cryptography. One of them being the staunch belief that the number composed of multiplication of two large prime numbers cannot be factorised easily, which is under a threat thanks to the computational power of the quantum computers. The next flaw is the non-detection of the hacker, both of which can be eliminated by using quantum mechanical principles for encryption purposes, which is known as quantum cryptography. Quantum Key Distribution, which provides an information-theoretically safe solution to the key exchange problem, is the most well-known example of quantum cryptography. The benefit of quantum cryptography is that it makes it possible to perform a variety of cryptographic operations that have been demonstrated or are hypothesised to be impractical when using solely traditional (i.e., non-quantum) communication. Free-space quantum communication has been successfully demonstrated across 300 m by the Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO) in March 2021. With this, ISRO is trying to achieve the same using a satellite-based communication mechanism, which would revolutionise the mode of modern communication. It is justified that the key generation rate depends on factors like the aperture diameter of the sender and receiver, distance between them, the quantum bit error rate, and many more. The results vary with the parameters in the discussion as explained in the upcoming sections. The avenue of different types of losses that occur while transmitting at large distances, such as Atmospheric Loss, Pointing Loss and Geometric Loss, is explored.

TI Multidimensional Bose quantum error correction based on neural network
   decoder
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Boson quantum error correction is an important means to realize quantum error correction information processing. In this paper, we consider the connection of a single-mode Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) code with a two-dimensional (2D) surface (surface-GKP code) on a triangular quadrilateral lattice. On the one hand, we use a Steane-type scheme with maximum likelihood estimation for surface-GKP code error correction. On the other hand, the minimum-weight perfect matching (MWPM) algorithm is used to decode surface-GKP codes. In the case where only the data GKP qubits are noisy, the threshold reaches sigma approximate to 0.5 ((p) over bar approximate to 12.3%). If the measurement is also noisy, the threshold is reached sigma approximate to 0.25 ((p) over bar approximate to 10.02%). More importantly, we introduce a neural network decoder. When the measurements in GKP error correction are noise-free, the threshold reaches sigma approximate to 0.78 ((p) over bar approximate to 15.12%). The threshold reaches sigma approximate to 0.34 ((p) over bar approximate to 11.37%) when all measurements are noisy. Through the above optimization method, multi-party quantum error correction will achieve a better guarantee effect in fault-tolerant quantum computing.

TI Quantum computation and quantum simulation with ultracold molecules
SO NATURE PHYSICS
AB Ultracold molecules confined in optical lattices or tweezer traps can be used to process quantum information and simulate the behaviour of many-body quantum systems. Molecules offer several advantages for these applications. They have a large set of stable states with strong transitions between them and long coherence times. Molecules can be prepared in a chosen state with high fidelity, and the state populations can be measured efficiently. Control over their long-range dipole-dipole interactions can enable the entanglement of pairs of molecules, generating interesting and technologically useful many-body states. This Review covers the advances made so far in the field of quantum simulation and computation with ultracold molecules and the challenges still to overcome.

AB Over the past decade, integrated quantum photonic technologies have shown great potential as a platform for studying quantum phenomena and realizing large-scale quantum information processing. Recently, there have been proposals for utilizing waveguide lattices to implement quantum gates, providing a more compact and robust solution compared to discrete implementation with directional couplers and phase shifters. We report on the first demonstration of precise control of single photon states on an 11-dimensional continuously-coupled programmable waveguide array. Through electro-optical control, the array is subdivided into decoupled subcircuits and the degree of on-chip quantum interference can be tuned with a maximum visibility of 0.962 +/- 0.013. Furthermore, we show simultaneous control of two subcircuits on a single device. Our results demonstrate the potential of using this technology as a building block for quantum information processing applications.

TI Quantum Machine Learning: A tutorial
SO NEUROCOMPUTING
AB This tutorial provides an overview of Quantum Machine Learning (QML), a relatively novel discipline that brings together concepts from Machine Learning (ML), Quantum Computing (QC) and Quantum Information (QI). The great development experienced by QC, partly due to the involvement of giant technological companies as well as the popularity and success of ML have been responsible of making QML one of the main streams for researchers working on fuzzy borders between Physics, Mathematics and Computer Science. A possible, although arguably coarse, classification of QML methods may be based on those approaches that make use of ML in a quantum experimentation environment and those others that take advantage of QC and QI to find out alternative and enhanced solutions to problems driven by data, oftentimes offering a considerable speedup and improved performances as a result of tackling problems from a complete different standpoint. Several examples will be provided to illustrate both classes of methods. (C) 2021 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

TI Hybrid Cat-Transmon Architecture for Scalable, Hardware-Efficient
   Quantum Error Correction
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Dissipative cat qubits are a promising physical platform for quantum computing, since their large noise bias can enable more hardware-efficient quantum error correction. In this work we theoretically study the long-term prospects of a hybrid cat-transmon quantum computing architecture where dissipative cat qubits play the role of data qubits, and error syndromes are measured using ancillary transmon qubits. The cat qubits' noise bias enables more hardware-efficient quantum error correction, and the use of transmons allows for practical, high-fidelity syndrome measurement. While correction of the dominant cat Z errors with a repetition code has recently been demonstrated in experiment, here we show how the architecture can be scaled beyond a repetition code. In particular, we propose a cat-transmon entangling gate that enables the correction of residual cat X errors in a thin rectangular surface code, so that logical error can be arbitrarily suppressed by increasing code distance. We numerically estimate logical memory performance, finding significant overhead reductions in comparison to architectures without biased noise. For example, with current state-of-the-art coherence, physical error rates of 10-3 and noise biases in the range 103-104 are achievable. With this level of performance, the qubit overhead required to reach algorithmically relevant logical error rates with the cat-transmon architecture matches that of an unbiased-noise architecture with physical error rates in the range 10-5-10-4.

TI Preparing narrow velocity distributions for quantum memories in
   room-temperature alkali-metal vapors
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Quantum memories are a crucial technology for enabling large-scale quantum networks through synchronization of probabilistic operations. Such networks impose strict requirements on quantum memory, such as storage time, retrieval efficiency, bandwidth, and scalability. On- and off-resonant ladder protocols on warm atomic vapor platforms are promising candidates, combining efficient high-bandwidth operation with low-noise on-demand retrieval. However, their storage time is severely limited by motion-induced dephasing caused by the broad velocity distribution of atoms composing the vapor. In this paper, we demonstrate velocity selective optical pumping to overcome this decoherence mechanism. This will increase the achievable memory storage time of vapor memories. This technique can also be used for preparing arbitrarily shaped absorption profiles, for instance, preparing an atomic frequency comb absorption feature.

TI Materials challenges for quantum technologies based on color centers in
   diamond
SO MRS BULLETIN
AB Emerging quantum technologies require precise control over quantum systems of increasing complexity. Defects in diamond, particularly the negatively charged nitrogen-vacancy center, are a promising platform with the potential to enable technologies ranging from ultra-sensitive nanoscale quantum sensors, to quantum repeaters for long distance quantum networks, to simulators of complex dynamical processes in many-body quantum systems, to scalable quantum computers. While these advances are due in large part to the distinct material properties of diamond, the uniqueness of this material also presents difficulties, and there is a growing need for novel materials science techniques for characterization, growth, defect control, and fabrication dedicated to realizing quantum applications with diamond. In this article we identify and discuss the major materials science challenges and opportunities associated with diamond quantum technologies.

TI Graphical structures for design and verification of quantum error
   correction
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB We introduce a high-level graphical framework for designing and analysing quantum error correcting codes, centred on what we term the coherent parity check (CPC). The graphical formulation is based on the diagrammatic tools of the ZX-calculus of quantum observables. The resulting framework leads to a construction for stabilizer codes that allows us to design and verify a broad range of quantum codes based on classical ones, and that gives a means of discovering large classes of codes using both analytical and numerical methods. We focus in particular on the smaller codes that will be the first used by near-term devices. We show how CSS codes form a subset of CPC codes and, more generally, how to compute stabilizers for a CPC code. As an explicit example of this framework, we give a method for turning almost any pair of classical [n,k,3] codes into a [[2n-k+2,k,3]] CPC code. Further, we give a simple technique for machine search which yields thousands of potential codes, and demonstrate its operation for distance 3 and 5 codes. Finally, we use the graphical tools to demonstrate how Clifford computation can be performed within CPC codes. As our framework gives a new tool for constructing small- to medium-sized codes with relatively high code rates, it provides a new source for codes that could be suitable for emerging devices, while its ZX-calculus foundations enable natural integration of error correction with graphical compiler toolchains. It also provides a powerful framework for reasoning about all stabilizer quantum error correction codes of any size.

TI Tensor networks for quantum machine learning
SO PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY A-MATHEMATICAL PHYSICAL AND ENGINEERING
   SCIENCES
AB Once developed for quantum theory, tensor networks (TNs) have been established as a successful machine learning (ML) paradigm. Now, they have been ported back to the quantum realm in the emerging field of quantum ML to assess problems that classical computers are unable to solve efficiently. Their nature at the interface between physics and ML makes TNs easily deployable on quantum computers. In this review article, we shed light on one of the major architectures considered to be predestined for variational quantum ML. In particular, we discuss how layouts like matrix product state, projected entangled pair states, tree tensor networks and multi-scale entanglement renormalization ansatz can be mapped to a quantum computer, how they can be used for ML and data encoding and which implementation techniques improve their performance.

TI Deterministic secure quantum communication with double-encoded single
   photons
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB Quantum communication is an important branch of quantum technology. It can safely transmit private information between legitimate parties and its unconditional security is guaranteed by quantum physics. So far, deterministic secure quantum communication without entanglement usually transmits single photons in two-way quantum channels. We propose a deterministic secure quantum communication proposal, and it requires a one-way quantum channel and a classical channel. In our protocol, a sender encodes logical bits by using two conjugate bases consisting of the polarization and time-bin degrees of freedom of a photon and transmits it to a receiver over a quantum channel. Upon receiving this photon, the receiver measures it randomly in two bases and can decode the bit deterministically with the help of the sender. Any attack from eavesdroppers will be detected by the legitimate parties. Furthermore, this protocol can be implemented with linear-optic elements and single-photon detectors.

TI Two-Excitation Routing via Linear Quantum Channels
SO ENTROPY
AB Routing quantum information among different nodes in a network is a fundamental prerequisite for a quantum internet. While single-qubit routing has been largely addressed, many-qubit routing protocols have not been intensively investigated so far. Building on a recently proposed many-excitation transfer protocol, we apply the perturbative transfer scheme to a two-excitation routing protocol on a network where multiple two-receivers block are coupled to a linear chain. We address both the case of switchable and permanent couplings between the receivers and the chain. We find that the protocol allows for efficient two-excitation routing on a fermionic network, although for a spin-12 network only a limited region of the network is suitable for high-quality routing.

TI Scalable Cryoelectronics for Superconducting Qubit Control and Readout
SO ADVANCED INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS
AB Quantum computing promises an exponentially higher computational power than classical computers; although all the building blocks have become available, certain constraints still prevent quantum advantage. The fundamental challenge in building a practical quantum computer is integrating thousands of highly coherent qubits with the control and readout electronics. The need for a high-coherence qubit drives the effort for quantum error correction algorithms to create fault-tolerant quantum systems. Error correction becomes tangible in a quantum processor only in large numbers of qubits. Thus, the other challenge is reducing the number of physical interconnects (coaxial lines) between the quantum-classical interface and bulky room-temperature electronics. To interface thousands of qubits, interconnects can be reduced by bringing the control and readout electronics near the quantum processor. Cryogenic complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) technology has been an ideal candidate for this purpose. Integrated control and readout at cryogenic temperatures require low power dissipation circuit designs and techniques such as frequency-division multiplexing (FDM) due to the finite cooling power of a dilution refrigerator. Herein, an overview of each building block in a superconducting quantum computer is provided, focusing on scalability. Furthermore, this article is concluded with an outlook discussing current challenges and future directions for the scalable superconducting control and readout.

TI Quantum Network: Security Assessment and Key Management
SO IEEE-ACM TRANSACTIONS ON NETWORKING
AB As an extension of quantum key distribution, secure communication among multiple users is a basic task in a quantum network. When the quantum network structure becomes complicated with a large number of users, it is important to investigate network issues, including security, key management, latency, reliability, scalability, and cost. In this work, we utilize the classical network theory and graph theory to address two critical issues in a quantum network, security and key management. First, we design a communication scheme with the highest security level that trusts a minimum number of intermediate nodes. Second, when the quantum key is a limited resource, we design key management and data scheduling schemes to optimize the utility of data transmission. Our results can be directly applied to the current metropolitan and free-space quantum network implementations and can potentially be a standard approach for future quantum network designs.

TI High-Efficiency Arbitrary Quantum Operation on a High-Dimensional
   Quantum System
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB The ability to manipulate quantum systems lies at the heart of the development of quantum technology. The ultimate goal of quantum control is to realize arbitrary quantum operations (AQUOs) for all possible open quantum system dynamics. However, the demanding extra physical resources impose great obstacles. Here, we experimentally demonstrate a universal approach of AQUO on a photonic qudit with the minimum physical resource of a two-level ancilla and a log(2)d-scale circuit depth for a d-dimensional system. The AQUO is then applied in a quantum trajectory simulation for quantum subspace stabilization and quantum Zeno dynamics, as well as incoherent manipulation and generalized measurements of the qudit. Therefore, the demonstrated AQUO for complete quantum control would play an indispensable role in quantum information science.

SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS A-MATHEMATICAL AND THEORETICAL
AB We study entanglement properties of hypergraph states in arbitrary finite dimension. We compute multipartite entanglement of elementary qudit hypergraph states, namely those endowed with a single maximum-cardinality hyperedge. We show that, analogously to the qubit case, also for arbitrary dimension there exists a lower bound for multipartite entanglement of connected qudit hypergraph states; this is given by the multipartite entanglement of an equal-dimension elementary hypergraph state featuring the same number of qudits as the largest-cardinality hyperedge. We highlight interesting differences between prime and non-prime dimension in the entanglement features.

TI Fast Multiqubit Gates through Simultaneous Two-Qubit Gates
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Near-term quantum computers are limited by the decoherence of qubits to only being able to run lowdepth quantum circuits with acceptable fidelity. This severely restricts what quantum algorithms can be compiled and implemented on such devices. One way to overcome these limitations is to expand the available gate set from single- and two-qubit gates to multiqubit gates, which entangle three or more qubits in a single step. Here, we show that such multiqubit gates can be realized by the simultaneous application of multiple two-qubit gates to a group of qubits where at least one qubit is involved in two or more of the two-qubit gates. Multiqubit gates implemented in this way are as fast as, or sometimes even faster than, the constituent two-qubit gates. Furthermore, these multiqubit gates do not require any modification of the quantum processor, but are ready to be used in current quantum-computing platforms. We demonstrate this idea for two specific cases: simultaneous controlled-Z gates and simultaneous iSWAP gates. We show how the resulting multiqubit gates relate to other well-known multiqubit gates and demonstrate through numerical simulations that they would work well in available quantum hardware, reaching gate fidelities well above 99%. We also present schemes for using these simultaneous two-qubit gates to swiftly create large entangled states like Dicke and Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger states.

TI Quantum Circuits for Exact Unitary t-Designs and Applications to

SO PRX QUANTUM
AB A unitary t-design is a powerful tool in quantum information science and fundamental physics. Despite its usefulness, only approximate implementations were known for general t. In this paper, we provide quantum circuits that generate exact unitary t-designs for any t on an arbitrary number of qubits. Our construction is inductive and is of practical use in small systems. We then introduce a tth-order generalization of randomized benchmarking (t-RB) as an application of exact 2t-designs. We particularly study the 2-RB in detail and show that it reveals self-adjointness of quantum noise, a metric related to the feasibility of quantum error correction (QEC). We numerically demonstrate that the 2-RB in one- and two-qubit systems is feasible, and experimentally characterize background noise of a superconducting qubit by the 2-RB. It is shown from the experiment that interactions with adjacent qubits induce the noise that may result in an obstacle toward a realization of QEC.

TI Demonstration of hypergraph-state quantum information processing
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Complex entangled states are the key resources for measurement-based quantum computations, which is realised by performing a sequence of measurements on initially entangled qubits. Executable quantum algorithms in the graph-state quantum computing model are determined by the entanglement structure and the connectivity of entangled qubits. By generalisation from graph-type entanglement in which only the nearest qubits interact to a new type of hypergraph entanglement in which any subset of qubits can be arbitrarily entangled via hyperedges, hypergraph states represent more general resource states that allow arbitrary quantum computation with Pauli universality. Here we report experimental preparation, certification and processing of complete categories of four-qubit hypergraph states under the principle of local unitary equivalence, on a fully reprogrammable silicon-photonic quantum chip. Genuine multipartite entanglement for hypergraph states is certificated by the characterisation of entanglement witness, and the observation of violations of Mermin inequalities without any closure of distance or detection loopholes. A basic measurement-based protocol and an efficient resource state verification by color-encoding stabilizers are implemented with local Pauli measurement to benchmark the building blocks for hypergraph-state quantum computation. Our work prototypes hypergraph entanglement as a general resource for quantum information processing.
   Usual multiqubit entangled states can be described using the graph formalism, where each edge connects only two qubits. Here, instead, the authors use a reprogrammable silicon photonics chip to showcase preparation, verification and processing of arbitrary four-qubit hypergraph states, where hyperedges describe entanglement within a subset of many qubits.

TI Noise is resource-contextual in quantum communication
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Estimating the information transmission capability of a quantum channel remains one of the fundamental problems in quantum information processing. In contrast to classical channels, the information-carrying capability of quantum channels is contextual. One of the most significant manifestations of this is the superadditivity of the channel capacity: the capacity of two quantum channels used together can be larger than the sum of the individual capacities. Here, we present a one-parameter family of channels for which, as the parameter increases, its one-way quantum and private capacities increase while its two-way capacities decrease. We also exhibit a oneparameter family of states with analogous behavior with respect to the one- and two-way distillable entanglement and secret key. Our constructions demonstrate that noise is context dependent in quantum communication.

TI Stand-alone mobile quantum memory system
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB We present the implementation and performance analysis of a portable rack-mounted stand-alone warm-vapor quantum memory system that also includes the laser package, control electronics, and dataprocessing hardware. The optical memory is based on long-lived hyperfine ground states of cesium, which are connected to an excited state via the D1 line at 895 nm in a A-configuration. The memory is operated with weak coherent pulses containing on average <1 photons per pulse. The long-term stability of the memory efficiency and storage fidelity is demonstrated at the single-photon level together with operation in a nonlaboratory environment.

TI On super quantum discord for high-dimensional bipartite state
SO QUANTUM INFORMATION PROCESSING
AB By quantifying the difference between quantum mutual information through weak measurement performed on a subsystem one is led to the notion of super quantum discord. The super version is also known to be difficult to compute as the quantum discord which was captured by the projective (strong) measurements. In this paper, we give effective bounds of the super quantum discord with or without phase damping channels for higher-dimensional bipartite quantum states, and found that the super version is always larger than the usual quantum discord as in the 2-dimensional case.

AB Quantum repeater networks play a crucial role in distributing entanglement. Various link architectures have been proposed to facilitate the creation of Bell pairs between distant nodes, with entangled photon sources emerging as a primary technology for building quantum networks. Our work advances the Memory-Source-Memory (MSM) link architecture, addressing the absence of practical implementation details. We conduct numerical simulations using the Quantum Internet Simulation Package (QuISP) to analyze the performance of the MSM link and contrast it with other link architectures. We observe a saturation effect in the MSM link, where additional quantum resources do not affect the Bell pair generation rate of the link. By introducing a theoretical model, we explain the origin of this effect and characterize the parameter region where it occurs. Our work bridges theoretical insights with practical implementation, which is crucial for robust and scalable quantum networks.

TI A Scheme for Quantum Teleportation and Remote Quantum State Preparation
   of IoT Multiple Devices
SO SENSORS
AB With the continuous development of the Internet of Things (IoT) technology, the industry's awareness of the security of the IoT is also increasing, and the adoption of quantum communication technology can significantly improve the communication security of various devices in the IoT. This paper proposes a scheme of controlled remote quantum state preparation and quantum teleportation based on multiple communication parties, and a nine-qubit entanglement channel is used to achieve secure communication of multiple devices in the IoT. The channel preparation, measurement operation, and unitary operation of the scheme were successfully simulated on the IBM Quantum platform, and the entanglement degree and reliability of the channel were verified through 8192 shots. The scheme's application in the IoT was analyzed, and the steps and examples of the scheme in the secure communication of multiple devices in the IoT are discussed. By simulating two different attack modes, the effect of the attack on the communication scheme in the IoT was deduced, and the scheme's high security and anti-interference ability was analyzed. Compared with other schemes from the two aspects of principle and transmission efficiency, it is highlighted that the advantages of the proposed scheme are that it overcomes the single fixed one-way or two-way transmission protocol form of quantum teleportation in the past and can realize quantum communication with multiple devices, ensuring both security and transmission efficiency.

TI High-fidelity universal quantum gates for hybrid systems via the
   practical photon scattering
SO CHINESE PHYSICS B
AB High-fidelity quantum logic gates are essential in quantum computation, and both photons and electron spins in quantum dots (QDs) have their own unique advantages in implementing quantum computation. It is of critical significance to achieve high-fidelity quantum gates for photon-QD hybrid systems. Here, we propose two schemes for implementing high-fidelity universal quantum gates including Toffoli gate and Fredkin gate for photon-QD hybrid systems, utilizing the practical scattering of a single photon off a QD-cavity system. The computation errors from the imperfections involved in the practical scattering are detected and prevented from arising in the final results of the two gates. Accordingly, the unity fidelity of each quantum gate is obtained in the nearly realistic condition, and the requirement for experimental realization is relaxed. Furthermore, the quantum circuits for the two gates are compact and no auxiliary qubits are required, which would also be the advantages regarding their experimental feasibility. These features indicate that our schemes may be useful in the practical quantum computation tasks.

TI Riemannian geometry and automatic differentiation for optimization
   problems of quantum physics and quantum technologies
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB Optimization with constraints is a typical problem in quantum physics and quantum information science that becomes especially challenging for high-dimensional systems and complex architectures like tensor networks. Here we use ideas of Riemannian geometry to perform optimization on the manifolds of unitary and isometric matrices as well as the cone of positive-definite matrices. Combining this approach with the up-to-date computational methods of automatic differentiation, we demonstrate the efficacy of the Riemannian optimization in the study of the low-energy spectrum and eigenstates of multipartite Hamiltonians, variational search of a tensor network in the form of the multiscale entanglement-renormalization ansatz, preparation of arbitrary states (including highly entangled ones) in the circuit implementation of quantum computation, decomposition of quantum gates, and tomography of quantum states. Universality of the developed approach together with the provided open source software enable one to apply the Riemannian optimization to complex quantum architectures well beyond the listed problems, for instance, to the optimal control of noisy quantum systems.

TI Experimental study of retrieval efficiency of Duan-Lukin-Cirac-Zoller
   quantum memory by optical cavity-enhanced
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB Long-distance entanglement distribution is an important task for quantum communication, but difficult to achieve due to the loss of photons in optical fiber transmission. Quantum repeater is a scheme to solve this problem. In this scheme, the long distance of entanglement distribution is divided into several small parts, the entanglement is established first at both ends of each part, then, the entanglement distance is extended through the entanglement exchange of adjacent interval parts, in order to achieve the long distance entanglement distribution. Of them, the Duan-Lukin-Cirac-Zoller (DLCZ) protocol based on the cold atom ensemble and the linear optics which can generate and store entanglement, is regarded as one of the most potential schemes. In the process of DLCZ, retrieval efficiency is an important index of the quantum repeater, because it will influence each entanglement exchange operation between adjacent quantum repeater nodes. Generally, the retrieval efficiency is improved by optimizing the reading pulse, increasing the optical depth (OD) of the atomic ensemble and the cavity enhancement. The ring cavity constrains the light field to increase the intensity of the interaction between light and atoms, and effectively improve the retrieval efficiency of the quantum memory.
   In this work, atomic ensembles are placed in a ring cavity. The cavity length is 3.3 m and the fineness is 13.5. The optical loss of all ring cavity is 21%, mainly including 15% loss of other optical elements and 6% loss of the cell. In order to increase the retrieval efficiency, we need to ensure the mode resonance of read-out photon, write-out photon and locking. The cavity needs two input beams of light: one comes from the path of read-out photon and the other from the path of write-out photon in the reverse direction. The two beams are locked at the same frequency as the write-out photon and the read-out photon respectively. The cavity length is adjusted by moving the cavity mirrors' positions through translating the frame, to make two light modes resonate. The acousto-optic modulator (AOM) is inserted into the path of the locking to control the frequency of the locking. By adjusting the AOM to change the frequency of the locking, the locking can be coincident with the write-out and read-out cavity modes. Then, the three-mode resonance can be achieved
   When the cavity mode resonates with the atomic line, it will lead the atomic formants to split. thereby affecting the enhancement effect of retrieval efficiency. In the experiment, the detuning of the read light will affect the frequency of the read-out photon, and further affect the detuning of the cavity mode with the resonance line of the atom. Thus, by increasing the detuning between the reading light and the atomic transition line, the frequency splitting between the two modes can be reduced, then enhance the retrieval efficiency. We study the relation between the enhancement factor of the retrieval efficiency and the detuning amount of the reading light relative to the atomic resonance line. The results show that when the detuning amount of reading light is 80 MHz, the intrinsic readout efficiency is 45%, and the readout efficiency is enhanced by 1.68 times.

TI Construction of a qudit using Schrodinger cat states and generation of
   hybrid entanglement between a discrete-variable qudit and a
   continuous-variable qudit
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We show that a continuous-variable (CV) qudit can be constructed using quasiorthogonal cat states of a bosonic mode, when the phase encoded in each cat state is chosen appropriately. With the constructed CV qudit and the discrete-variable (DV) qudit encoded with Fock states, we propose an approach to generate the hybrid maximally entangled state of a CV qudit and a DV qudit by using two microwave cavities coupled to a superconducting flux qutrit. This proposal relies on the initial preparation of a superposition of Fock states of one cavity and the initial preparation of a cat state of the other cavity. After the initial state of each cavity is prepared, this proposal requires only two basic operations, i.e., the first operation employs the dispersive coupling of both cavities with the qutrit while the second operation uses the dispersive coupling of only one cavity with the qutrit. The entangled state production is deterministic and the operation time decreases as the dimensional size of each qudit increases. In addition, during the entire operation, the coupler qutrit remains in the ground state and thus decoherence from the qutrit is significantly reduced. As an example, we further discuss the experimental feasibility for generating the hybrid maximally entangled state of a DV qutrit and a CV qutrit based on circuit QED. This proposal is universal and can be extended to accomplish the same task, by using two microwave or optical cavities coupled to a natural or artificial three-level atom.

SO IEEE OPEN JOURNAL OF THE COMMUNICATIONS SOCIETY
AB We propose a general framework for noncoherent communication using techniques from the field of quantum error correction (QEC). We first propose an approach for analyzing a classical communication channel as a quantum channel, and develop an extension of the QEC conditions to the classical case. We derive a quantum analogue of the noncoherent multiantenna wireless channel. Restricting to the case in which the number of transmitter and receiver antennas are equal and a power of two, we use the framework to develop a family of space-time block codes for noncoherent multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communication. Under a Rayleigh fading assumption, we derive the optimal decoder and bound the probability of symbol detection error. We compare our performance to comparable coherent and noncoherent approaches and achieve competitive performance for various antenna geometries and rates.

TI Quantum Walk
SO ACTA OPTICA SINICA
AB Significance Classical random walk involves the erratic motion of walkers along some random routes or areas, such as pollen's Brownian motion. Meanwhile, quantum walk is an extension of classical random walk in the quantum realm, and compared with the classical case, it is characterized by quantum superposition and entanglement. The diffusive quantum walk speed increases quadratically rather than linearly as in classical random walk, demonstrating an advantage over classical diffusion by spreading quantum information at a faster rate. Thus, quantum walk can be utilized to develop such quantum algorithms as quantum searching. Compared with classical algorithms, quantum-walk-based algorithms can provide quadratic enhancement. Additionally, as an effective model for describing micro-particle dynamics, quantum walk can serve as a universal platform to achieve arbitrary unitary evolutions, quantum state preparation, quantum logic gate operations, quantum measurements, etc. Finally, quantum walk can realize all key steps in quantum information processing.
   Progress Recently, many efforts have been devoted to exploring new mechanisms and applications of quantum walk. During a quantum walk, the walker carries quantum information and evolves in different positions. Thus, quantum walk is an effective way to achieve quantum communication and is extensively employed for developing quantum algorithms and achieving universal quantum computation. In addition, quantum walk can realize positive operator measurement and can be applied to quantum precision measurement.
   Specifically, by controlling various parameters like position, phase, and evolution time across multiple degrees of freedom during the quantum walk, the coin state can be restored to its initial state after a specific evolution time. This approach can be utilized for implementing quantum state transfer. Any arbitrarily high-dimensional quantum state can be prepared by loading a high-dimensional system state onto the walker position state and employing a position-dependent quantum-walk process. This can be adopted for high-dimensional quantum communication purposes. Additionally, quantum walk can also be employed for quantum secure communication, random number generation, and direct quantum communication.
   For quantum computation applications, both continuous-time quantum walks and discrete-time quantum walks have been proven to be applicable to universal quantum computation. Among them, continuous-time quantum walks have intuitive correspondences and natural advantages in solving such problems as searching for marked points on graphs. The presence of coin degrees of freedom in discrete-time quantum walks makes the dynamic evolution process easier to control. Therefore, discrete-time quantum walks also have unique advantages and wide applications in designing quantum algorithms. Meanwhile, quantum walk is universal in constructing different Hamiltonian and can be utilized for quantum simulation.
   By performing the orthogonal measurements on walker positions, the quantum walk can achieve coin state positive operator-valued measurements. This greatly reduces the experimental difficulty in implementing positive operator-valued measurements and improves their feasibility and scalability. During the quantum walk, the walker carrying coin states evolves at different positions, causing entanglement between coin states and different paths. Entanglement is an effective quantum resource for implementing precise quantum measurements, which makes quantum walk have great potential for applications in quantum metrology.
   Conclusions and Prospects Quantum walks provide a programmable and simple model for implementing many key steps in quantum information processing. In summary, quantum walk can be widely applied to quantum communications, quantum computation, and quantum measurements. The new mechanisms and applications of quantum walks attract the attention of many researchers in quantum information processing.

Moreover, the fidelity of a multi-qubit graph state and any network state cannot exceed 9/10. Similar results can also be established for a large class of multi-qudit graph states.

TI The two-qubit singlet/triplet measurement is universal for quantum
   computing given only maximally-mixed initial states
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB In order to delineate which minimalistic physical primitives can enable the full power of universal quantum computing, it has been fruitful to consider various measurement based architectures which reduce or eliminate the use of coherent unitary evolution, and also involve operations that are physically natural. In this context previous works had shown that the triplet-singlet measurement of two qubit angular momentum (or equivalently two qubit exchange symmetry) yields the power of quantum computation given access to a few additional different single qubit states or gates. However, Freedman, Hastings and Shokrian-Zini(1) recently proposed a remarkable conjecture, called the 'STP=BQP' conjecture, which states that the two-qubit singlet/triplet measurement is quantum computationally universal given only an initial ensemble of maximally mixed single qubits. In this work we prove this conjecture. This provides a method for quantum computing that is fully rotationally symmetric (i.e. reference frame independent), using primitives that are physically very-accessible, naturally resilient to certain forms of error, and provably the simplest possible.

TI Quantum information and quantum simulation of neutrino physics
SO EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL A
AB In extreme astrophysical environments such as core-collapse supernovae and binary neutron star mergers, neutrinos play a major role in driving various dynamical and microphysical phenomena, such as baryonicmatter outflows, the synthesis of heavy elements, and the supernova explosion mechanism itself. The interactions of neutrinos with matter in these environments are flavor-specific, which makes it of paramount importance to understand the flavor evolution of neutrinos. Flavor evolution in these environments can be a highly nontrivial problem thanks to a multitude of collective effects in flavor space, arising due to neutrino-neutrino (nu-nu) interactions in regions with high neutrino densities. A neutrino ensemble undergoing flavor oscillations under the influence of significant nu-nu interactions is somewhat analogous to a system of coupled spins with long-range interactions among themselves and with an external field ('long-range' in momentum-space in the case of neutrinos). As a result, it becomes pertinent to consider whether these interactions can give rise to significant quantum correlations among the interacting neutrinos, and whether these correlations have any consequences for the flavor evolution of the ensemble. In particular, one may seek to utilize concepts and tools from quantum information science and quantum computing to deepen our understanding of these phenomena. In this article, we attempt to summarize recent work in this field. Furthermore, we also present some new results in a three-flavor setting, considering complex initial states.

AB The field of quantum communications promises the faithful distribution of quantum information, quantum entanglement, and absolutely secret keys, however, the highest rates of these tasks are fundamentally limited by the transmission distance between quantum repeaters. The ultimate end-to-end rates of quantum communication networks are known to be achievable by an optimal entanglement distillation protocol followed by teleportation. In this work, we give a practical design for this achievability. Our ultimate design is an iterative approach, where each purification step operates on shared entangled states and detects loss errors at the highest rates allowed by physics. As a simpler design, we show that the first round of iterations can purify completely at high rates. We propose an experimental implementation using linear optics and photon-number measurements which is robust to inefficient operations and measurements, showcasing its near-term potential for real-world practical applications.

TI QKeyShield: A Practical Receiver-Device-Independent
   Entanglement-Swapping-Based Quantum Key Distribution
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Quantum key distribution, in principle, provides information-theoretic security based on the laws of quantum mechanics. Entanglement swapping offers a unique ability to create entanglement between qubits that have not previously interacted. Entanglement-swapping setup helps in building a side-channel-free Quantum key distribution. A receiver-device-independent quantum key distribution protocol based on this idea, QKeyShield, is proposed. It adopts the use of a biased operator choice, thus, increasing the rate of generated bits. Several measures have been integrated to protect the sent qubits. Furthermore, security analyses for a list of attacks allowed by quantum mechanics are provided showing that QKeyShield can securely and effectively allow Alice and Bob to agree on a secret key. QKeyShield has certain advantages over earlier protocols including the ability to achieve high usage efficiency and the potential of enabling conference quantum key distribution.

TI Shock wave quantum memory in shocked detector
SO MODERN PHYSICS LETTERS A
AB Usual uniformly accelerated frame, in Dray-'t Hooft spacetime, does not see the any quantum imprint on Unruh effect due to localized shock wave in Minkowski spacetime. Here, we argue that such non-appearance of quantum memory is specific to those particular observers which do not incorporate the presence of wave in their trajectory. In fact, a detector, associated with a frame which is affected by the shock, cannot be trivial in terms of its response. We explicitly show that the later type of frame detects particle in the shock wave Minkowski vacuum which is the effect of shock. Therefore, this quantum memory is very special to specific class of observers as far as Dray-'t Hooft spacetime is concerned. We analyze for a null like trajectory along which the detector is moving.

TI Feedback-based active reset of a spin qubit in silicon
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Feedback control of qubits is a highly demanded technique for advanced quantum information protocols such as fault-tolerant quantum error correction. Here we demonstrate active reset of a silicon spin qubit using feedback control. The active reset is based on quantum non-demolition (QND) readout of the qubit and feedback according to the readout results, which is enabled by hardware data processing and sequencing. We incorporate a cumulative readout technique to the active reset protocol, enhancing initialization fidelity above a limitation imposed by the single-shot QND readout fidelity. An analysis of the reset protocol implies a pathway to achieve the initialization fidelity sufficient for fault-tolerant quantum computation. These results provide a practical approach to high-fidelity qubit operations in realistic devices.

SO PHYSICA SCRIPTA
AB Two qubit density matrices which are of X-shape, are a natural generalization of Bell Diagonal States (BDSs) recently simulated on the IBM quantum device. We generalize the previous results and propose a quantum circuit for simulation of a general two qubit X-state, implement it on the same quantum device, and study its entanglement for several values of the extended parameter space. We also show that their X-shape is approximately robust against noisy quantum gates. To further physically motivate this study, we invoke the two-spin Heisenberg XYZ system and show that for a wide class of initial states, it leads to dynamical density matrices which are X-states. Due to the symmetries of this Hamiltonian, we show that by only two qubits, one can simulate the dynamics of this system on the IBM quantum computer.

TI Noise mitigation in quantum teleportation
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Permitting the transmission of unknown quantum states over long distances by using entanglement, quantum teleportation serves as an important building block for many quantum technologies. However, in the noisy intermediate-scale quantum era, the practical realization of quantum teleportation is inevitably challenged by the noise-induced decoherence. We here propose a noise-mitigation mechanism applicable in both the discrete- and continuous-variable quantum teleportation schemes. Via investigating the non-Markovian decoherence dynamics of the two types of quantum teleportation schemes, we find that, as long as a bound state is formed in the energy spectrum of the total system consisting of the involved subsystems and their respective reservoirs, the quantum superiority of the fidelity is persistently recovered. Supplying an insightful understanding of the noise-mitigation protocols, our result paves the way to the practical realization of noise-tolerant quantum teleportation.

TI Quantum algorithm for minimum dominating set problem with circuit design
SO CHINESE PHYSICS B
AB Using quantum algorithms to solve various problems has attracted widespread attention with the development of quantum computing. Researchers are particularly interested in using the acceleration properties of quantum algorithms to solve NP-complete problems. This paper focuses on the well-known NP-complete problem of finding the minimum dominating set in undirected graphs. To expedite the search process, a quantum algorithm employing Grover's search is proposed. However, a challenge arises from the unknown number of solutions for the minimum dominating set, rendering direct usage of original Grover's search impossible. Thus, a swap test method is introduced to ascertain the number of iterations required. The oracle, diffusion operators, and swap test are designed with achievable quantum gates. The query complexity is O(1.414 n ) and the space complexity is O(n). To validate the proposed approach, qiskit software package is employed to simulate the quantum circuit, yielding the anticipated results.

TI A Quantum Frequency-Domain Framework for Image Transmission with
   Three-Qubit Error Correction
SO ALGORITHMS
AB Quantum communication enables high-fidelity image transmission but is vulnerable to channel noise, and while advanced quantum error correction (QEC) can reduce such effects, its complexity and time-domain dependence limit practical efficiency. This paper presents a novel, low-complexity, and noise-resilient quantum image transmission framework that operates in the frequency domain using the quantum Fourier transform (QFT) combined with the three-qubit QEC code. In the proposed system, input images are first source-encoded (JPEG/HEIF) and mapped to quantum states using single-qubit superposition encoding. Three-qubit QEC is then applied for channel protection, effectively safeguarding the encoded data against quantum errors. The channel-encoded quantum data are subsequently transformed via QFT for transmission over noisy quantum channels. At the receiver, the inverse QFT recovers the frequency-domain representation, after which three-qubit error correction, quantum decoding, and corresponding source decoding are performed to reconstruct the image. Results are analyzed using bit error rate (BER), peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), structural similarity index measure (SSIM), and universal quality index (UQI). Experimental results show that the proposed quantum frequency-domain approach achieves up to 4 dB channel SNR gain over equivalent quantum time-domain methods and up to 10 dB over an equivalent-bandwidth classical communication system, regardless of the image format. These findings highlight the practical advantages of integrating QFT-based transmission with lightweight QEC, offering an efficient, scalable, and noise-tolerant solution for future quantum communication networks.

TI Implementation of Geometric Quantum Gates on Microwave-Driven
   Semiconductor Charge Qubits
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB A semiconductor-based charge qubit, confined in double quantum dots, can be a platform to implement quantum computing. However, it suffers severely from charge noises. Here, a theoretical framework to implement universal geometric quantum gates in this system is provided. It is found that, while the detuning noise can be suppressed by operating near its corresponding sweet spot, the tunneling noise, on the other hand, is amplified and becomes the dominant source of error for single-qubit gates, a fact previously insufficiently appreciated. It is demonstrated, through numerical simulation, that the geometric gates outperform the dynamical gates across a wide range of tunneling noise levels, making them particularly suitable to be implemented in conjunction with microwave driving. To obtain a nontrivial two-qubit gate, a hybrid system is introduced with charge qubits coupled by a superconducting resonator. When each charge qubit is in resonance with the resonator, it is possible to construct an entangling geometric gate with fidelity higher than that of the dynamical gate for experimentally relevant noise levels. Therefore, the results suggest that geometric quantum gates are powerful tools to achieve high-fidelity manipulation for the charge qubit.

TI Quantum-Logic Gate between Two Optical Photons with an Average
   Efficiency above 40%
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW X
AB Optical qubits uniquely combine information transfer in optical fibers with a good processing capability and are therefore attractive tools for quantum technologies. A large challenge, however, is to overcome the low efficiency of two-qubit logic gates. The experimentally achieved efficiency in an optical controlled NOT (cNoT) gate reached approximately 11% in 2003 and has seen no increase since. Here, we report on a new platform that was designed to surpass this long-standing record. The new scheme avoids inherently probabilistic protocols and, instead, combines aspects of two established quantum nonlinear systems: atom-cavity systems and Rydberg electromagnetically induced transparency. We demonstrate a CNOT gate between two optical photons with an average efficiency of 41.7(5)% at a postselected process fidelity of 81(2)%. Moreover, we extend the scheme to a CNOT gate with multiple target qubits and produce entangled states of presently up to five photons. All these achievements are promising and have the potential to advance optical quantum information processing in which almost all advanced protocols would profit from high-efficiency logic gates.

AB Variational Quantum Algorithms are hybrid classical-quantum algorithms where classical and quantum computation work in tandem to solve computational problems. These algorithms create interesting challenges for the design of suitable programming languages. In this paper we introduce Qimaera, which is a set of libraries for the Idris 2 programming language that enable the programmer to implement hybrid classical-quantum algorithms where the full power of the elegant Idris language works in synchrony with quantum programming primitives. The two key ingredients of Idris that make this possible are (1) dependent types which allow us to implement unitary quantum operations; and (2) linearity which allows us to enforce fine-grained control over the execution of quantum operations so that we may detect and reject many physically inadmissible programs. We also show that Qimaera is suitable for variational quantum programming by providing implementations of two prominent variational quantum algorithms - QAOA and VQE.

TI Optimal two-qubit circuits for universal fault-tolerant quantum
   computation
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB We study two-qubit circuits over the Clifford+CS gate set, which consists of the Clifford gates together with the controlled-phase gate CS = diag(1, 1, 1, i). The Clifford+CS gate set is universal for quantum computation and its elements can be implemented fault-tolerantly in most error-correcting schemes through magic state distillation. Since non-Clifford gates are typically more expensive to perform in a fault-tolerant manner, it is often desirable to construct circuits that use few CS gates. In the present paper, we introduce an efficient and optimal synthesis algorithm for two-qubit Clifford+CS operators. Our algorithm inputs a Clifford+CS operator U and outputs a Clifford+CS circuit for U, which uses the least possible number of CS gates. Because the algorithm is deterministic, the circuit it associates to a Clifford+CS operator can be viewed as a normal form for that operator. We give an explicit description of these normal forms and use this description to derive a worst-case lower bound of 5log(2)(1/epsilon)+O(1) on the number of CS gates required to epsilon-approximate elements of SU(4). Our work leverages a wide variety of mathematical tools that may find further applications in the study of fault-tolerant quantum circuits.

TI Quantum Error Mitigation Relying on Permutation Filtering
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON COMMUNICATIONS
AB Quantum error mitigation (QEM) is a class of promising techniques capable of reducing the computational error of variational quantum algorithms tailored for current noisy intermediate-scale quantum computers. The recently proposed permutation-based methods are practically attractive, since they do not rely on any a priori information concerning the quantum channels. In this treatise, we propose a general framework termed as permutation filters, which includes the existing permutation-based methods as special cases. In particular, we show that the proposed filter design algorithm always converge to the global optimum, and that the optimal filters can provide substantial improvements over the existing permutation-based methods in the presence of narrowband quantum noise, corresponding to large-depth, high-error-rate quantum circuits.

TI Optimizing Rydberg Gates for Logical-Qubit Performance
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Robust gate sequences are widely used to reduce the sensitivity of gate operations to experimental imperfections. Typically, the optimization minimizes the average gate error; however, recent work in quantum error correction has demonstrated that the performance of encoded logical qubits is sensitive to not only the average error rate but also the type of errors that occur. Here, we present a family of Rydberg-blockade gates for neutral-atom qubits that are robust against two common major imperfections: intensity inhomogeneity and Doppler shifts. These gates outperform existing gates for moderate or large imperfec-tions. We also consider the logical performance of these gates in the context of an erasure-biased qubit based on metastable 171Yb. In this case, we observe that the robust gates outperform existing gates for even very small values of the imperfections, because they maintain the native large bias toward erasure errors for these qubits. These results significantly reduce the laser stability and atomic temperature requirements to achieve fault-tolerant quantum computing with neutral atoms. The approach of optimizing gates for logical-qubit performance may be applied to other qubit platforms.

TI Chiral quantum network with giant atoms
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB In superconducting quantum circuits (SQCs), chiral routing quantum information is often realized with the ferrite circulators, which are usually bulky, lossy and require strong magnetic fields. To overcome those problems, we propose a novel method to realize chiral quantum networks by exploiting giant atom effects in SQC platforms. By assuming each coupling point being modulated with time, the interaction becomes momentum-dependent, and giant atoms will chirally emit photons due to interference effects. The chiral factor can approach 1, and both the emission direction and rate can be freely tuned by the modulating signals. We demonstrate that a high-fidelity state transfer between remote giant atoms can be realized. Our proposal can be integrated on the superconducting chip easily, and has the potential to work as a tunable toolbox for quantum information processing in future chiral quantum networks.

TI Dissipationless topological quantum computation for Majorana objects in
   the sparse-dense mixed encoding process
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Topological quantum computation based on Majorana objects is subject to a significant challenge because at least some of the two-qubit quantum gates rely on the fermion (either charge or spin) parity of the qubits. This dependency renders the quantum operations involving these gates probabilistic when attempting to advance quantum processes within the quantum circuit model. Such an approach leads to significant information loss whenever measurements yield the undesired fermion parity. To resolve the problem of wasting information, we devise topological operations that allow for the nondissipative correction of information from undesired fermion parity to the desired one. We will use the sparse-dense mixed encoding process for the controlled-NOT gate as an example to explain how corrections can be implemented without affecting the quantum information carried by the computational qubits. This correction process can be applied to either the undesired input qubits or the fermion parity-dependent quantum gates, and it works for both Majorana-zero-mode-based and Majorana-edgemode-based topological quantum computation.

TI Trellis Decoding for Qudit Stabilizer Codes and Its Application to Qubit
   Topological Codes
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM ENGINEERING
AB Trellis decoders are a general decoding technique first applied to qubit-based quantum error correction codes by Ollivier and Tillich in 2006. Here, we improve the scalability and practicality of their theory, show that it has strong structure, extend the results using classical coding theory as a guide, and demonstrate a canonical form from which the structural properties of the decoding graph may be computed. The resulting formalism is valid for any prime-dimensional quantum system. The modified decoder works for any stabilizer code S and separates into two parts: 1) a one-time offline computation that builds a compact graphical representation of the normalizer of the code, S perpendicular to and 2) a quick, parallel, online query of the resulting vertices using the Viterbi algorithm. We show the utility of trellis decoding by applying it to four high-density length-20 stabilizer codes for depolarizing noise and the well-studied Steane, rotated surface, and 4.8.8/6.6.6 color codes for Z only noise. Numerical simulations demonstrate a 20% improvement in the code-capacity threshold for color codes with boundaries by avoiding the mapping from color codes to surface codes. We identify trellis edge number as a key metric of difficulty of decoding, allowing us to quantify the advantage of single-axis (X or Z) decoding for Calderbank-Steane-Shor codes and block decoding for concatenated codes.

AB Quantum computing presents new market opportunities, but also significant challenges, particularly in areas such as cybersecurity. Although still in its infancy, quantum computing is maturing rapidly. If quantum computers can provide countries with new offensive capabilities- often in combination with artificial intelligence- it is arguably investment in the quantum communications agenda- in particular quantum networks- that can provide measures and actions to improve cyber defence.

TI Long-Lived Particles Anomaly Detection with Parametrized Quantum
   Circuits
SO PARTICLES
AB We investigate the possibility to apply quantum machine learning techniques for data analysis, with particular regard to an interesting use-case in high-energy physics. We propose an anomaly detection algorithm based on a parametrized quantum circuit. This algorithm was trained on a classical computer and tested with simulations as well as on real quantum hardware. Tests on NISQ devices were performed with IBM quantum computers. For the execution on quantum hardware, specific hardware-driven adaptations were devised and implemented. The quantum anomaly detection algorithm was able to detect simple anomalies such as different characters in handwritten digits as well as more complex structures such as anomalous patterns in the particle detectors produced by the decay products of long-lived particles produced at a collider experiment. For the high-energy physics application, the performance was estimated in simulation only, as the quantum circuit was not simple enough to be executed on the available quantum hardware platform. This work demonstrates that it is possible to perform anomaly detection with quantum algorithms; however, as an amplitude encoding of classical data is required for the task, due to the noise level in the available quantum hardware platform, the current implementation cannot outperform classic anomaly detection algorithms based on deep neural networks.

TI Multiplexed Quantum Communication with Surface and Hypergraph Product
   Codes
SO QUANTUM
AB Connecting multiple processors via quantum interconnect technologies could help overcome scalability issues in single- processor quantum computers. Transmission via these interconnects can be performed more efficiently using quantum multiplexing, where information is encoded in high-dimensional photonic degrees of freedom. We explore the effects of multiplexing on logical error rates in surface codes and hypergraph product codes. We show that, although multiplexing makes loss errors more damaging, assigning qubits to photons in an intelligent manner can minimize these effects, and the ability to encode higher-distance codes in a smaller number of photons can result in overall lower logical error rates. This multiplexing technique can also be adapted to quantum communication and multimode quantum memory with high-dimensional qudit systems.

TI A Secured Quantum Two-Bit Commitment Protocol for Communication Systems
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Bit commitment is an essential primitive in quantum cryptography. It is the basic building block of many cryptographic protocols in which it provides security over distrustful parties. This paper proposes a secured quantum two-bit commitment protocol for any two classical bits. The protocol contains two parties - a committer and a receiver - who share both quantum and classical communication channels. The main phases of this protocol are commitment and revealing phases where the concealing and binding conditions are proved in order to accept the commitment message. The proposed framework utilizes different security layers to hide specific quantum states in a superposition alongside trivial one qubit operations. The secured unitary transformations are applied by the two parties to meet the concealing and binding conditions. To verify the success of the proposed protocol, the measured output of the two parties are compared. The protocol operates under the assumption that the two parties might cheat and the possible existence of an eavesdropper.

TI Joint encryption and error correction for secure quantum communication
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Secure quantum networks are a bedrock requirement for developing a future quantum internet. However, quantum channels are susceptible to channel noise that introduce errors in the transmitted data. The traditional approach to providing error correction typically encapsulates the message in an error correction code after encryption. Such separate processes incur overhead that must be avoided when possible. We, consequently, provide a single integrated process that allows for encryption as well as error correction. This is a first attempt to do so for secure quantum communication and combines the Calderbank-Shor-Steane (CSS) code with the three-stage secure quantum communication protocol. Lastly, it allows for arbitrary qubits to be transmitted from sender to receiver making the proposed protocol general purpose.

TI Quantum outage probability for time-varying quantum channels
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Recent experimental studies have shown that the relaxation time T-1 and the dephasing time T-2 of superconducting qubits fluctuate considerably over time. Time-varying quantum channel (TVQC) models have been proposed in order to consider the time-varying nature of the parameters that define qubit decoherence. This dynamic nature of quantum channels causes a degradation of the performance of quantum error correction codes (QECCs) that is portrayed as a flattening of their error rate curves. In this article we introduce the concepts of quantum outage probability and quantum hashing outage probability as asymptotically achievable error rates by a QECC with the quantum rate RQ operating over a TVQC. We derive closed-form expressions for the family of time-varying amplitude damping channels and study their behavior for different scenarios. We quantify the impact of time variation as a function of the relative variation of T-1 around its mean. We conclude that the performance of QECCs is limited in many cases by the inherent fluctuations of their decoherence parameters and corroborate that parameter stability is crucial to maintain the excellent performance observed over static quantum channels.

TI Light storage by electromagnetically induced transparency for one second
   at the level of a single photon in Pr3+:Y2SiO5 prepared with multiple
   frequency ensembles
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB Efficient and long-term storage of quantum information encoded in single photons is crucial for applications of optical quantum technologies, e.g. quantum repeaters in communication networks. Obviously, the maximal storage time is an important benchmark for such memories, as it defines the distances covered by the network or the applicability of quantum communication protocols therein. In this paper, we present the implementation of an optical memory driven by electromagnetically induced transparency, permitting the storage of weak coherent pulses containing on average a single photon with a signal-to-noise ratio of 1.3(3) for a long storage time of one second. To achieve this goal, we apply decoherence control by static magnetic fields and robust dynamical decoupling sequences to prolong the coherence time in a rare-earth ion doped crystal to 14 s. A novel optical preparation scheme serves to increase the optical depth of the medium, which enables a light storage efficiency of 12.7(5)% at the single photon level and one second storage time.

TI Certification and applications of quantum nonlocal correlations
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS-PHOTONICS
AB Entanglement and Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) steering are nonlocal quantum correlations, which are relevant resources for quantum information protocols. EPR steering, or quantum steering, refers to the correlation where a party might 'steer', or modify, the state of another, which is spatially separated. Entanglement is a symmetric resource while steering is asymmetrical, since it depends on the direction of the effect. Due to these different characteristics and the therefore different possible applications, there has been both theoretical and experimental research on forms to certify the distinct quantum nonlocal correlations. In recent years, alongside the investigation on quantum correlations between two systems, there has been a great interest in investigating multipartite/multimode entanglement as well as steering, since they include a high dimension and it may be possible to store more information than in a single qubit. In this review, we will summarize the different criteria and measures that have been developed for the characterization of these two kinds of correlations. We first focus on bipartite entanglement and steering. We then review the progress that has been made in the investigation of multipartite quantum correlations. We revise the theoretical work in quantum nonlocal correlation witnesses and measures, which respectively allow one to certify that the system is entangled or presents EPR steering, and give a quantification of the content of these correlations in the system. Then, we briefly review the experiments that have been designed and that demonstrate multipartite quantum correlations. We also include applications in quantum information protocols, in particular in quantum teleportation and quantum cryptography.

TI Evaluating the potential of quantum machine learning in cybersecurity: A

SO COMPUTERS & SECURITY
AB Quantum computing promises to revolutionize our understanding of the limits of computation, and its implications in cryptography have long been evident. Today, cryptographers are actively devising post-quantum solutions to counter the threats posed by quantum-enabled adversaries. Meanwhile, quantum scientists are innovating quantum protocols to empower defenders. However, the broader impact of quantum computing and quantum machine learning (QML) on other cybersecurity domains still needs to be explored. In this work, we investigate the potential impact of QML on cybersecurity applications of traditional ML. First, we explore the potential advantages of quantum computing in machine learning problems specifically related to cybersecurity. Then, we describe a methodology to quantify the future impact of fault-tolerant QML algorithms on real-world problems. Asa case study, we apply our approach to standard methods and datasets in network intrusion detection, one of the most studied applications of machine learning in cybersecurity. Our results provide insight into the conditions for obtaining a quantum advantage and the need for future quantum hardware and software advancements.

TI Q1Synth: A Quantum Computer Musical Instrument
SO APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
AB This paper introduces Q1Synth, an unprecedented musical instrument that produces sounds from (a) quantum state vectors representing the properties of a qubit, and (b) its measurements. The instrument is presented on a computer screen (or mobile device, such as a tablet or smartphone) as a Bloch sphere, which is a visual representation of a qubit. The performer plays the instrument by rotating this sphere using a mouse. Alternatively, a gesture controller can be used, e.g., a VR glove. While the sphere is rotated, a continuously changing sound is produced. The instrument has a 'measure key'. When the performer activates this key, the instrument generates a program (also known as a quantum circuit) to create the current state vector. Then, it sends the program to a quantum computer over the cloud for processing, that is, measuring, in quantum computing terminology. The computer subsequently returns the measurement, which is also rendered into sound. Currently, Q1Synth uses three different techniques to make sounds: frequency modulation (FM), subtractive synthesis, and granular synthesis. The paper explains how Q1Synth works and details its implementation. A setup developed for a musical performance, Spinnings, with three networked Q1Synth instruments is also reported. Q1Synth and Spinnings are examples of how creative practices can open the doors to new application pathways for quantum computing technology. Additionally, they illustrate how such emerging technology is leading to new approaches to musical instrument design and musical creativity.

TI Advanced Equivalence Checking for Quantum Circuits
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON COMPUTER-AIDED DESIGN OF INTEGRATED CIRCUITS AND
   SYSTEMS
AB In the not-so-distant future, quantum computing will change the way we tackle certain problems. It promises to dramatically speed-up many chemical, financial, cryptographical, and machine-learning applications. However, in order to capitalize on those promises, complex design flows composed of steps, such as compilation, decomposition, mapping, or transpilation need to be employed before being able to execute a conceptual quantum algorithm on an actual device. This results in many descriptions at various levels of abstraction which may significantly differ from each other. The complexity of the underlying design problems makes it ever more important to not only provide efficient solutions for the single steps but also to verify that the originally intended functionality is preserved throughout all levels of abstraction. This motivates methods for equivalence checking of quantum circuits. However, most existing methods for this are inspired by equivalence checking in the classical realm and have merely been extended to support quantum circuits (i.e., circuits which do not only rely on 0's and 1's but also employ superposition and entanglement). In this work, we propose an advanced methodology that takes the different paradigms of quantum circuits not only as a burden but as an opportunity. In fact, the proposed methodology explicitly utilizes characteristics unique to quantum computing in order to overcome the shortcomings of existing approaches. We show that by exploiting the reversibility of quantum circuits, complexity can be kept feasible in many cases. Moreover, we show that, in contrast to the classical realm, simulation is very powerful in verifying quantum circuits. Experimental evaluations confirm that the resulting methodology allows one to conduct equivalence checking dramatically faster than ever before-in many cases just a single simulation run is sufficient. An implementation of the proposed equivalence checking flow is publicly available at https://iic.jku.at/eda/research/quantum_verification/.

TI Pure dephasing, quantum decoherence, and wave-particle duality
SO CHEMICAL PHYSICS REVIEWS
AB Ultrafast spectroscopy is a valuable tool for monitoring the timescales of interactions between systems and their environments, resulting in pure dephasing. The superposition of ground and excited states of a molecule in a condensed phase, created by field-matter interactions, loses its coherence due to fluctuations from surrounding molecules that interact differently with the ground and excited states. Recently, quantum decoherence has become an intense area of research due to its relevance to the quantum-to-classical transition and its critical role in developing quantum technologies, such as quantum computers and cryptography. Although both pure dephasing and quantum decoherence result from the same process of environmental monitoring of systems through quantum entanglement between the system and its environment, they have been studied and discussed in very different contexts with seemingly disparate terminologies. In this work, we present a detailed theoretical description of pure dephasing and quantum decoherence in bosonic environments coupled to a two-level system, compare them directly, and demonstrate their connections to the wave-particle duality of isolated systems and the wave-particle-entanglement triality of composite systems consisting of systems and their environments. It is believed that the present review will be helpful for gaining a deeper understanding of ultrafast spectroscopy from a quantum mechanical perspective and the wave-particle duality of quantum objects interacting with their surrounding environments.

TI Theory of quasi-exact fault-tolerant quantum computing and
   valence-bond-solid codes
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB In this work, we develop the theory of quasi-exact fault-tolerant quantum (QEQ) computation, which uses qubits encoded into quasi-exact quantum error-correction codes ('quasi codes'). By definition, a quasi code is a parametric approximate code that can become exact by tuning its parameters. The model of QEQ computation lies in between the two well-known ones: the usual noisy quantum computation without error correction and the usual fault-tolerant quantum computation, but closer to the later. Many notions of exact quantum codes need to be adjusted for the quasi setting. Here we develop quasi error-correction theory using quantum instrument, the notions of quasi universality, quasi code distances, and quasi thresholds, etc. We find a wide class of quasi codes which are called valence-bond-solid codes, and we use them as concrete examples to demonstrate QEQ computation.

TI Re-locative guided search optimized self-sparse attention enabled deep
   learning decoder for quantum error correction
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Heavy hexagonal coding is a type of quantum error-correcting coding in which the edges and vertices of a low-degree graph are assigned auxiliary and physical qubits. While many topological code decoders have been presented, it is still difficult to construct the optimal decoder due to leakage errors and qubit collision. Therefore, this research proposes a Re-locative Guided Search optimized self-sparse attention-enabled convolutional Neural Network with Long Short-Term Memory (RlGS2-DCNTM) for performing effective error correction in quantum codes. The integration of the self-sparse attention mechanism in the proposed model increases the feature learning ability of the model to selectively focus on informative regions of the input codes. In addition, the use of statistical features computes the statistical properties of the input, thus aiding the model to perform complex tasks effectively. For model tuning, this research utilizes the RIGS nature-inspired algorithm that mimics the re-locative, foraging, and hunting strategies, which avoids local optima problems and improves the convergence speed of the RlGS2-DCNTM for Quantum error correction. When compared with other methods, the proposed RlGS2-DCNTM algorithm offers superior efficacy with a Minimum Mean Squared Error (MSE) of 4.26, Root Mean Squared Error of 2.06, Mean Absolute Error of 1.14 and a maximum correlation and \documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$R<^>2$$\end{document} of 0.96 and 0.92 respectively, which shows that the proposed model is highly suitable for real-time error decoding tasks.

TI Enhancing quantum cryptography with quantum dot single-photon sources
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Quantum cryptography harnesses quantum light, in particular single photons, to provide security guarantees that cannot be reached by classical means. For each cryptographic task, the security feature of interest is directly related to the photons' non-classical properties. Quantum dot-based single-photon sources are remarkable candidates, as they can in principle emit deterministically, with high brightness and low multiphoton contribution. Here, we show that these sources provide additional security benefits, thanks to the tunability of coherence in the emitted photon-number states. We identify the optimal optical pumping scheme for the main quantum-cryptographic primitives, and benchmark their performance with respect to Poisson-distributed sources such as attenuated laser states and down-conversion sources. In particular, we elaborate on the advantage of using phonon-assisted and two-photon excitation rather than resonant excitation for quantum key distribution and other primitives. The presented results will guide future developments in solid-state and quantum information science for photon sources that are tailored to quantum communication tasks.

TI Quantum privacy-preserving service for secure lane change in vehicular
   networks
SO IET QUANTUM COMMUNICATION
AB Secure Multiparty Computation (SMC) enables multiple parties to cooperate securely without compromising their privacy. SMC has the potential to offer solutions for privacy obstacles in vehicular networks. However, classical SMC implementations suffer from efficiency and security challenges. To address this problem, two quantum communication technologies, Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) and Quantum Oblivious Key Distribution were utilised. These technologies supply symmetric and oblivious keys respectively, allowing fast and secure inter-vehicular communications. These quantum technologies are integrated with the Faster Malicious Arithmetic Secure Computation with Oblivious Transfer (MASCOT) protocol to form a Quantum Secure Multiparty Computation (QSMC) platform. A lane change service is implemented in which vehicles broadcast private information about their intention to exit the highway. The proposed QSMC approach provides unconditional security even against quantum computer attacks. Moreover, the communication cost of the quantum approach for the lane change use case has decreased by 97% when compared to the classical implementation. However, the computation cost has increased by 42%. For open space scenarios, the reduction in communication cost is especially important, because it conserves bandwidth in the free-space radio channel, outweighing the increase in computation cost.
   A Quantum Secure Multiparty Computation (QSMC) solution for lane change service in vehicular networks that uses two quantum technologies, Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) and Quantum Oblivious Key Distribution (QOKD) is proposed. This quantum-based approach is resistant to quantum computer attacks and requires less communication resources compared to classical methods.image

TI Dual-rail encoding with superconducting cavities
SO PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF
   AMERICA
AB The design of quantum hardware that reduces and mitigates errors is essential for practical quantum error correction (QEC) and useful quantum computation. To this end, we introduce the circuit-Quantum Electrodynamics (QED) dual-rail qubit in which our physical qubit is encoded in the single-photon subspace, {vertical bar 01 >, vertical bar 10 >}, of two superconducting microwave cavities. The dominant photon loss errors can be detected and converted into erasure errors, which are in general much easier to correct. In contrast to linear optics, a circuit-QED implementation of the dual-rail code offers unique capabilities. Using just one additional transmon ancilla per dual-rail qubit, we describe how to perform a gate-based set of universal operations that includes state preparation, logical readout, and parametrizable single and two-qubit gates. Moreover, first-order hardware errors in the cavities and the transmon can be detected and converted to erasure errors in all operations, leaving background Pauli errors that are orders of magnitude smaller. Hence, the dual-rail cavity qubit exhibits a favorable hierarchy of error rates and is expected to perform well below the relevant QEC thresholds with today's coherence times.

TI A Divide-And-Conquer Pebbling Strategy for Oracle Synthesis in Quantum
   Computing
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON COMPUTER-AIDED DESIGN OF INTEGRATED CIRCUITS AND
   SYSTEMS
AB Quantum oracles are quantum circuits that implement classical Boolean functions, frequently used as independent black boxes in quantum algorithm design. The hierarchical reversible logic synthesis approach, a scalable method for large-scale oracle synthesis, relies on ancilla qubits to store intermediate results. The sequence in which these results are computed and uncomputed, governed by the reversible pebble game, greatly affects both qubit usage and circuit gate count. This article introduces a novel divide-and-conquer pebbling strategy that reduces qubit count while maintaining a reasonable circuit gate count. Experimental results show up to a 90% reduction in qubits compared to the most commonly-used strategy, with an average increase of 3 to 4 times in quantum operations, all achieved within a reasonable runtime. In qubit-constrained tasks, our method achieves over 90% reduction in T-count. Additionally, we have incorporated our strategy into the hierarchical synthesis method and implemented it as a potential synthesizer for Qiskit, with experiments demonstrating that it outperforms the default synthesizer. The proposed approach shows promise in optimizing both qubit usage and circuit gate count for large-scale oracle synthesis problems.

TI Fast delivery of heralded atom-photon quantum correlation over 12 km
   fiber through multiplexing enhancement
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Distributing quantum entanglement between distant parties is a significant but difficult task in quantum information science, as it can enable numerous applications but suffers from exponential decay in the quantum channel. Quantum repeaters are one of the most promising approaches towards this goal. In a quantum repeater protocol, it is essential that the entanglement generation speed within each elementary link is faster than the memory decoherence rate, and this stringent requirement has not been implemented over a fiber of metropolitan scale so far. As a step towards this challenging goal, in this work we experimentally realize multiplexing-enhanced generation of heralded atom-photon quantum correlation over a 12 km fiber. We successively generate 280 pairs of atom-photon quantum correlations with a train of photonic time-bin pulses filling the long fiber, and read out the excited memory modes on demand with either fixed or variable storage time after successful heralding. With the multiplexing enhancement, the heralding rate of atom-photon correlation can reach 1.95 kHz, and the ratio between the quantum correlation generation rate to memory decoherence rate can be improved to 0.46 for a fiber length of 12 km. This work therefore constitutes an important step towards the realization of a large-scale quantum repeater network.
   Successfully implementing a quantum repeater would require an entanglement generation rate higher than the memory decoherence rate, but current implementations with atomic memories are still far from this goal. Here, the authors narrow this gap by exploiting spatial and time-bin multiplexing in an atomic DLCZ memory, and sending the frequency-converted signal photon through 12 km of telecom fiber.

TI Adaptive surface code for quantum error correction in the presence of
   temporary or permanent defects
SO QUANTUM
AB Whether it is at the fabrication stage or during the course of the quantum computation, e.g. because of high-energy events like cosmic rays, the qubits constituting an error correcting code may be rendered inoperable. Such defects may correspond to individual qubits or to clusters and could potentially disrupt the code sufficiently to generate logical errors. In this paper, we explore a novel adaptive approach for surface code quantum error correction on a defective lattice. We show that combining an appropriate defect detection algorithm and a quarantine of the identified zone allows one to preserve the advantage of quantum error correction at finite code sizes, at the cost of a qubit overhead that scales with the size of the defect. Our numerics indicate that the code's threshold need not be significantly affected; for example, for a certain scenario where small defects repeatedly arise in each logical qubit at a relatively high rate, the noise threshold is 2.7% (versus the defect-free case of 2.9%). We also confirm a strong sub-threshold scaling, with a code distance reduction of the order of the defect size only. These results pave the fects will be inevitable.

TI An Introduction to Quantum Machine Learning for Engineers
SO FOUNDATIONS AND TRENDS IN SIGNAL PROCESSING
AB In the current noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) era, quantum machine learning is emerging as a dominant paradigm to program gate-based quantum computers. In quantum machine learning, the gates of a quantum circuit are parameterized, and the parameters are tuned via classical optimization based on data and on measurements of the outputs of the circuit. Parameterized quantum circuits (PQCs) can efficiently address combinatorial optimization problems, implement probabilistic generative models, and carry out inference (classification and regression). This monograph provides a self-contained introduction to quantum machine learning for an audience of engineers with a background in probability and linear algebra. It first describes the necessary background, concepts, and tools necessary to describe quantum operations and measurements. Then, it covers parameterized quantum circuits, the variational quantum eigensolver, as well as unsupervised and supervised quantum machine learning formulations.

TI Application of the Diamond Gate in Quantum Fourier Transformations and
   Quantum Machine Learning
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB As we are approaching actual application of quantum technology, it is essential to exploit the current quantum resources in the best possible way. With this in mind, it might not be beneficial to use the usual standard gate sets, inspired by classical logic gates, while compiling quantum algorithms when other less standardized gates currently perform better. We, therefore, consider a promising native gate, which occurs naturally in superconducting circuits, known as the diamond gate. We show how the diamond gate can be decomposed into standard gates and, using single-qubit gates, can work as a controlled-NOT SWAP (CNS) gate. We then show how this CNS gate can create a controlled-phase gate. Controlled-phase gates are the backbone of the quantum Fourier-transform algorithm and we, therefore, show how to use the diamond gate to perform this algorithm. We also show how to use the diamond gate in quantum machine learning; namely, we use it to approximate nonlinear functions and classify two-dimensional data.

TI Analysis of the Vehicle Routing Problem Solved via Hybrid Quantum
   Algorithms in the Presence of Noisy Channels
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM ENGINEERING
AB The vehicle routing problem (VRP) is an NP-hard optimization problem that has been an interest of research for decades in science and industry. The objective is to plan routes of vehicles to deliver goods to a fixed number of customers with optimal efficiency. Classical tools and methods provide good approximations to reach the optimal global solution. Quantum computing and quantum machine learning provide a new approach to solving combinatorial optimization of problems faster due to inherent speedups of quantum effects. Many solutions of VRP are offered across different quantum computing platforms using hybrid algorithms, such as quantum approximate optimization algorithm and quadratic unconstrained binary optimization. In this work, we build a basic VRP solver for three and four cities using the variational quantum eigensolver on a fixed ansatz. The work is further extended to evaluate the robustness of the solution in several examples of noisy quantum channels. We find that the performance of the quantum algorithm depends heavily on what noise model is used. In general, noise is detrimental, but not equally so among different noise sources.

TI Quantum correlations and entanglement in coupled optomechanical
   resonators with photon hopping via Gaussian interferometric power
   analysis
SO CHINESE PHYSICS B
AB Quantum correlations that surpass entanglement are of great importance in the realms of quantum information processing and quantum computation. Essentially, for quantum systems prepared in pure states, it is difficult to differentiate between quantum entanglement and quantum correlation. Nonetheless, this indistinguishability is no longer holds for mixed states. To contribute to a better understanding of this differentiation, we have explored a simple model for both generating and measuring these quantum correlations. Our study concerns two macroscopic mechanical resonators placed in separate Fabry-P & eacute;rot cavities, coupled through the photon hopping process. this system offers a comprehensively way to investigate and quantify quantum correlations beyond entanglement between these mechanical modes. The key ingredient in analyzing quantum correlation in this system is the global covariance matrix. It forms the basis for computing two essential metrics: the logarithmic negativity ( E N m ) and the Gaussian interferometric power ( P G m ). These metrics provide the tools to measure the degree of quantum entanglement and quantum correlations, respectively. Our study reveals that the Gaussian interferometric power ( P G m ) proves to be a more suitable metric for characterizing quantum correlations among the mechanical modes in an optomechanical quantum system, particularly in scenarios featuring resilient photon hopping.

TI Single-step parity check gate set for quantum error correction
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB A key requirement for an effective quantum error correction (QEC) scheme is that the physical qubits have error rates below a certain threshold. The value of this threshold depends on the details of the specific QEC scheme, and its hardware-level implementation. This is especially important with parity-check circuits, which are the fundamental building blocks of QEC codes. The standard way of constructing the parity check circuit is using a universal set of gates, namely sequential CNOT gates, single-qubit rotations and measurements. We exploit the insight that a QEC code does not require universal logic gates, but can be simplified to perform the sole task of error detection and correction. By building gates that are fundamental to QEC, we can boost the threshold and ease the experimental demands on the physical hardware. We present a rigorous formalism for constructing and verifying the error behavior of these gates, linking the physical measurement of a process matrix to the abstract error models commonly used in QEC analysis. This allows experimentalists to directly map the gates used in their systems to thresholds derived for a broad-class of QEC codes. We give an example of these new constructions using the model system of two nuclear spins, coupled to an electron spin, showing the potential benefits of redesigning fundamental gate sets using QEC primitives, rather than traditional gate sets reliant on simple single and two-qubit gates.

TI Nonadiabatic geometric quantum gates that are insensitive to
   qubit-frequency drifts
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Quantum manipulation based on geometric phases provides a promising way towards robust quantum gates. However, in the current implementation of nonadiabatic geometric phases, operational and/or random errors tend to destruct the conditions that induce geometric phases, thereby smearing their noise-resilient feature. In a recent experiment [Y. Xu et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 124, 230503 (2020)], high-fidelity universal geometric quantum gates have been implemented in a superconducting circuit, which are robust to different types of errors under different configurations of the geometric evolution paths. Here, we apply the path-design strategy to explain in detail why both configurations can realize universal quantum gates in a single-loop way. Meanwhile, we purposefully induce our geometric manipulation by selecting the path configuration that is robust against the qubit-frequency-drift-induced error, which is the dominant error source on realistic superconducting circuits and has not been deliberately addressed. Moreover, our proposal can further integrate with the composite scheme to enhance the gate robustness, which is verified by numerical simulations. Therefore, our scheme provides a promising way towards practical realization of high-fidelity and robust nonadiabatic geometric quantum gates.

TI Temporal Quantum Memory and Non-Locality of Two Trapped Ions under the
   Effect of the Intrinsic Decoherence: Entropic Uncertainty, Trace Norm
   Nonlocality and Entanglement
SO SYMMETRY-BASEL
AB The engineering properties of trapped ions and their capacity to engender numerous quantum information resources determine many aspects of quantum information processing. We devise a setup of coherent and even coherent fields acting on two trapped ions to generate quantum memory, non-locality, and entanglement. Various effects, such as intrinsic decoherence, Lamb-Dicke regime, and dipole-dipole interaction are investigated. The inter-coupling of trapped ions, as well as the generation and dynamics of correlations between them, are analyzed. Using quantum memory assisted entropic uncertainty, trace-norm measurement induced non-locality, and concurrence, we find that the coherent and even coherent fields successfully generate non-local correlations in trapped-ions, with the latter being more resourceful for the dynamics and preservation of the non-local correlations. Furthermore, we observe that the entropic uncertainty and the trace norm induced non-locality present symmetrical dynamics. The dipole-dipole interaction improves correlation's generation, robustness, and entropic uncertainty suppression.

TI Frequency-tunable microwave quantum light source based on
   superconducting quantum circuits
SO CHIP
AB A non-classical light source is essential for implementing a wide range of quantum information processing protocols, including quantum computing, networking, communication and metrology. In the microwave regime, propagating photonic qubits, which transfer quantum information between multiple superconducting quantum chips, serve as building blocks for large-scale quantum computers. In this context, spectral control of propagating single photons is crucial for interfacing different quantum nodes with varied frequencies and bandwidths. Here a deterministic microwave quantum light source was demonstrated based on superconducting quantum circuits that can generate propagating single photons, time-bin encoded photonic qubits and qudits. In particular, the frequency of the emitted photons can be tuned in situ as large as 200 MHz. Even though the internal quantum efficiency of the light source is sensitive to the working frequency, it is shown that the fidelity of the propagating photonic qubit can be well preserved with the time-bin encoding scheme. This work thus demonstrates a versatile approach to realizing a practical quantum light source for future distributed quantum computing.

TI Two-qubit gate protocols with microwave-dressed Rydberg ions in a linear
   Paul trap
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB Ultracold trapped atomic ions excited into highly energetic Rydberg states constitute a promising platform for scalable quantum information processing. Elementary building blocks for such tasks are high-fidelity and sufficiently fast entangling two-qubit gates, which can be achieved via strong dipole-dipole interactions between microwave-dressed Rydberg ions, as recently demonstrated experimentally (Zhang et al 2020 Nature 580 345). We theoretically investigate the performance of three protocols leading to controlled-phase gate operations. Starting from a microscopic description of Rydberg ions in a linear Paul trap, we derive an effective Hamiltonian that faithfully captures the essential dynamics underlying the gate protocols. We then use an optimization scheme to fine-tune experimentally controllable parameters like laser detuning and Rabi frequency to yield maximal gate fidelity under each studied protocol. We show how non-adiabatic transitions resulting from fast laser driving relative to the characteristic time scales of the system detrimentally affect the fidelity. Despite this, we demonstrate that in the realistic scenario of Rydberg ions with finite radiative lifetimes, optimizing the best found gate protocol enables achievement of fidelities as high as 99.25% for a gate time of 0.2 mu s. This considerably undercuts entangling gate durations between ground state ions, for which gate times are typically limited by the comparably slower time scales of vibrational modes. Overall, this places trapped Rydberg ions into the regime where fast high-accuracy quantum computing and eventually quantum error correction become possible.

TI A universal fully reconfigurable 12-mode quantum photonic processor
SO MATERIALS FOR QUANTUM TECHNOLOGY
AB Photonic processors are pivotal for both quantum and classical information processing tasks using light. In particular, linear optical quantum information processing requires both large-scale and low-loss programmable photonic processors. In this paper, we report the demonstration of the largest universal quantum photonic processor to date: a low-loss 12-mode fully tunable linear interferometer with all-to-all mode coupling based on stoichiometric silicon nitride waveguides.

TI The Concept of a Quantum Edge Simulator: Edge Computing and Sensing in
   the Quantum Era
SO SENSORS
AB Sensors, enabling observations across vast spatial, spectral, and temporal scales, are major data generators for information technology (IT). Processing, storing, and communicating this ever-growing amount of data pose challenges for the current IT infrastructure. Edge computing-an emerging paradigm to overcome the shortcomings of cloud-based computing-could address these challenges. Furthermore, emerging technologies such as quantum computing, quantum sensing, and quantum communications have the potential to fill the performance gaps left by their classical counterparts. Here, we present the concept of an edge quantum computing (EQC) simulator-a platform for designing the next generation of edge computing applications. An EQC simulator is envisioned to integrate elements from both quantum technologies and edge computing to allow studies of quantum edge applications. The presented concept is motivated by the increasing demand for more sensitive and precise sensors that can operate faster at lower power consumption, generating both larger and denser datasets. These demands may be fulfilled with edge quantum sensor networks. Envisioning the EQC era, we present our view on how such a scenario may be amenable to quantification and design. Given the cost and complexity of quantum systems, constructing physical prototypes to explore design and optimization spaces is not sustainable, necessitating EQC infrastructure and component simulators to aid in co-design. We discuss what such a simulator may entail and possible use cases that invoke quantum computing at the edge integrated with new sensor infrastructures.

TI Geometric Algebra Jordan-Wigner Transformation for Quantum Simulation
SO ENTROPY
AB Quantum simulation qubit models of electronic Hamiltonians rely on specific transformations in order to take into account the fermionic permutation properties of electrons. These transformations (principally the Jordan-Wigner transformation (JWT) and the Bravyi-Kitaev transformation) correspond in a quantum circuit to the introduction of a supplementary circuit level. In order to include the fermionic properties in a more straightforward way in quantum computations, we propose to use methods issued from Geometric Algebra (GA), which, due to its commutation properties, are well adapted for fermionic systems. First, we apply the Witt basis method in GA to reformulate the JWT in this framework and use this formulation to express various quantum gates. We then rewrite the general one and two-electron Hamiltonian and use it for building a quantum simulation circuit for the Hydrogen molecule. Finally, the quantum Ising Hamiltonian, widely used in quantum simulation, is reformulated in this framework.

TI Fast spin-valley-based quantum gates in Si with micromagnets
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB An electron spin qubit in silicon quantum dots holds promise for quantum information processing due to the scalability and long coherence. An essential ingredient to recent progress is the employment of micromagnets. They generate a synthetic spin-orbit coupling (SOC), which allows high-fidelity spin manipulation and strong interaction between an electron spin and cavity photons. To scaled-up quantum computing, multiple technical challenges remain to be overcome, including controlling the valley degree of freedom, which is usually considered detrimental to a spin qubit. Here, we show that it is possible to significantly enhance the electrical manipulation of a spin qubit through the effect of constructive interference and the large spin-valley mixing. To characterize the quality of spin control, we also studied spin dephasing due to charge noise through spin-valley mixing. The competition between the increased control strength and spin dephasing produces two sweet-spots, where the quality factor of the spin qubit can be high. Finally, we reveal that the synthetic SOC leads to distinctive spin relaxation in silicon, which explains recent experiments.

TI A Survey on Continuous Variable Quantum Key Distribution for Secure Data
   Transmission: Toward the Future of Secured Quantum-Networks
SO QUANTUM INFORMATION & COMPUTATION
AB Quantum key distribution (QKD) represents a cornerstone of secure communication in the quantum era. While discrete-variable QKD (DV-QKD) protocols were historically the first to demonstrate secure key exchange, continuous-variable QKD (CV-QKD) has emerged as a more practical alternative due to its seamless compatibility with current telecommunications infrastructure. CV-QKD relies on coherent and squeezed states of light, offering significant advantages for integration into modern optical networks. This review comprehensively explores the theoretical underpinnings, technological advancements, and practical challenges of CV-QKD. Special attention is given to the role of photonic integrated circuits (PICs) in enabling scalable and efficient implementation of CV-QKD systems. Furthermore, recent advances in machine learning have been leveraged to optimize CV-QKD performance, with data-driven techniques enhancing noise estimation, parameter optimization, and system security. Additionally, tensor networks provide efficient computational tools for analyzing complex quantum correlations, improving the efficiency and robustness of quantum key distribution protocols. These developments, combined with ongoing improvements in quantum photonic integration, pave the way for the practical deployment of large-scale, high-speed quantum-secure networks.

TI Robust spin polarization by adiabatic dynamical decoupling
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB High-fidelity multiqubit initialization is vital for quantum simulation, quantum information processing, and quantum sensing. In diamond platforms, nuclear spin registers can be initialized through polarization transfer from a nearby electronic spin whose high gyromagnetic ratio enables efficient dynamical nuclear polarization (DNP). These hybrid systems are typically controlled using diabatic spin rotations, which require precise knowledge of all system parameters. Adiabatic DNP protocols, on the other hand, have less strict requirements and could enable robust and high-fidelity spin transfer. However, due to the slow adiabatic sweeps and limited electron spin coherence times, this approach has remained inaccessible. Here, we demonstrate adiabatic pulsed nuclear spin polarization at room temperature in diamond. We achieve enhanced polarization efficiency, a broad resonance window, and improved tolerance to hyperfine coupling uncertainties relative to conventional diabatic pulsed protocols. We also show how this approach can benefit the initialization of spin clusters. These results set the scene for enhanced qubit initialization in solid state through adiabatic pulsed driving, with applications in solid-state quantum sensor and quantum memory technologies.

TI Optical quantum memory for noble-gas spins based on spin-exchange
   collisions
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Optical quantum memories, which store and preserve the quantum state of photons, rely on a coherent mapping of the photonic state onto matter states that are optically accessible. Here we outline and characterize schemes to map the state of photons onto long-lived but optically inaccessible collective states of noble-gas spins. The mapping employs coherent spin-exchange interaction arising from random collisions with alkali vapor. We propose efficient storage strategies in two operating regimes and analyze their performance for several proposed experimental configurations.

TI Loss-tolerant concatenated Bell-state measurement with encoded
   coherent-state qubits for long-range quantum communication
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB The coherent-state qubit is a promising candidate for optical quantum information processing due to its nearly deterministic nature of the Bell-state measurement (BSM). However, its nonorthogonality incurs difficulties such as the failure of the BSM. One may use a large amplitude (alpha) for the coherent state to minimize the failure probability, but the qubit then becomes more vulnerable to dephasing by photon loss. We propose a hardware-efficient concatenated BSM (CBSM) scheme with modified parity encoding using coherent states with reasonably small amplitudes (vertical bar alpha vertical bar (sic) 2), which simultaneously suppresses both failures and dephasing in the BSM procedure. We numerically show that the CBSM scheme achieves a success probability arbitrarily close to unity for appropriate values of alpha and sufficiently low photon loss rates (e.g., (sic) 5%). Furthermore, we verify that the quantum repeater scheme exploiting the CBSM scheme for quantum error correction enables one to carry out efficient long-range quantum communication over 1000 km. We show that the performance is comparable to those of other up-to-date methods and even exceeds them in some cases. Finally, we present methods to prepare logical qubits under modified parity encoding, and we implement elementary logical operations, which consist of several physical-level ingredients such as generation of superpositions of coherent states (SCSs) and elementary gates under the coherent-state basis. We then estimate the effects of imperfect physical-level elements on the performance of the scheme. Our work demonstrates that the encoded coherent-state qubits in free-propagating fields provide an alternative route to fault-tolerant information processing, especially to long-range quantum communication.

TI Solving independent set problems with photonic quantum circuits
SO PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF
   AMERICA
AB An independent set (IS) is a set of vertices in a graph such that no edge connects any two vertices. In adiabatic quantum computation [E. Farhi, et al., Science 292, 472-475 (2001); A. Das, B. K. Chakrabarti, Rev. Mod. Phys. 80, 1061-1081 (2008)], a given graph G(V, E) can be naturally mapped onto a many-body Hamiltonian RG(V,E) IS , with edges E being the two-body interactions between adjacent vertices V. Thus, solving the IS problem is equivalent to finding all the computational basis ground states of RG(V,E) IS. Very recently, non-Abelian adiabatic mixing (NAAM) has been proposed to address this task, exploiting an emergent non-Abelian gauge symmetry of RG(V,E) IS [B. Wu, H. Yu, F. Wilczek, Phys. Rev. A 101, 012318 (2020)]. Here, we solve a representative IS problem G(8, 7) by simulating the NAAM digitally using a linear optical quantum network, consisting of three C-Phase gates, four deterministic two-qubit gate arrays (DGA), and ten single rotation gates. The maximum IS has been successfully identified with sufficient Trotterization steps and a carefully chosen evolution path. Remarkably, we find IS with a total probability of 0.875(16), among which the nontrivial ones have a considerable weight of about 31.4%. Our experiment demonstrates the potential advantage of NAAM for solving IS-equivalent problems.

TI Universal topological quantum computation with strongly correlated
   Majorana edge modes
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB Majorana-based quantum gates are not complete for performing universal topological quantum computation while Fibonacci-based gates are difficult to be realized electronically and hardly coincide with the conventional quantum circuit models. In reference Hu and Kane (2018 Phys. Rev. Lett. 120 066801), it has been shown that a strongly correlated Majorana edge mode in a chiral topological superconductor can be decomposed into a Fibonacci anyon tau and a thermal operator anyon epsilon in the tricritical Ising model. The deconfinement of tau and epsilon via the interaction between the fermion modes yields the anyon collisions and gives the braiding of either tau or epsilon. With these braidings, the complete members of a set of universal gates, the Pauli gates, the Hadamard gate and extra phase gates for one-qubit as well as controlled-NOT (CNOT) gate for two-qubits, are topologically assembled. Encoding quantum information and reading out the computation results can be carried out through electric signals. With the sparse-dense mixed encodings, we set up the quantum circuit where the CNOT gate turns out to be a probabilistic gate and design the corresponding devices with thin films of the chiral topological superconductor. As an example of the universal topological quantum computing, we show the application to Shor's integer factorization algorithm.

TI Optimizing quantum gates towards the scale of logical qubits
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB A foundational assumption of quantum error correction theory is that quantum gates can be scaled to large processors without exceeding the error-threshold for fault tolerance. Two major challenges that could become fundamental roadblocks are manufacturing high-performance quantum hardware and engineering a control system that can reach its performance limits. The control challenge of scaling quantum gates from small to large processors without degrading performance often maps to non-convex, high-constraint, and time-dynamic control optimization over an exponentially expanding configuration space. Here we report on a control optimization strategy that can scalably overcome the complexity of such problems. We demonstrate it by choreographing the frequency trajectories of 68 frequency-tunable superconducting qubits to execute single- and two-qubit gates while mitigating computational errors. When combined with a comprehensive model of physical errors across our processor, the strategy suppresses physical error rates by similar to 3.7x compared with the case of no optimization. Furthermore, it is projected to achieve a similar performance advantage on a distance-23 surface code logical qubit with 1057 physical qubits. Our control optimization strategy solves a generic scaling challenge in a way that can be adapted to a variety of quantum operations, algorithms, and computing architectures.

TI Storage of telecom wavelength heralded single photons in a fiber cavity
   quantum memory
SO OPTICA QUANTUM
AB We demonstrate the storage and retrieval of heralded single photons in a fiber-based cavity quantum memory. The photons are stored, and retrieved, from the memory using quantum frequency conversion which switches the photon into, and out of, resonance with the cavity. The photons, generated in the telecom O-band with a bandwidth of 81 GHz, are retrieved from the memory with a 1/e lifetime of 1.64 mu s, or 32.8 cavity round trips. We show that non-classical photon statistics remain for 70 round trips. The internal memory efficiency after 0.5 mu s of storage is 10.9 +/- 0.5%; a coupling efficiency of 60% into the memory cavity yields a total efficiency of 6.0 +/- 0.3%. These results mark a crucial step forward in the development of fiber-based quantum memories, and high-bandwidth memories operating at telecom wavelengths, with applications to photon source multiplexing and fiber-based quantum networking.

TI Telecom-wavelength quantum teleportation using frequency-converted
   photons from remote quantum dots
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB A global quantum internet is based on scalable networks, which require reliable quantum hardware. Among them are quantum light sources providing deterministic, high-brightness, high-fidelity entangled photons and quantum memories with coherence times exceeding the millisecond range. Long-distance operation demands quantum light sources emitting at telecommunication wavelengths. A cornerstone for such networks is the demonstration of quantum teleportation. Here, we realize full-photonic quantum teleportation employing semiconductor quantum dots, which can fulfill all the aforementioned requirements. Two remote GaAs quantum dots, emitting in the near-infrared, are used: one as an entangled-photon pair source and the other as a single-photon source. During the experiment, the single photon is prepared in conjugate polarization states and interfaced with the biexciton emission of the entangled pair employing a polarization-selective Bell state measurement. This process teleports the respective polarization state onto the exciton emission of the entangled pair. The frequency mismatch between the triggered sources is erased using two polarization-preserving quantum frequency converters, enabling remote two-photon interference at telecommunication wavelengths, yielding a visibility of 30(1)%. A post-selected teleportation fidelity up to 0.721(33), significantly above the classical limit, demonstrates successful quantum teleportation between light from distinct sources. These results mark an important development for semiconductor-based quantum light sources.

TI Bits to Qubits: A Comparative Study of Memory Management in Classical
   and Quantum Systems
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB In the near future, as quantum and classical systems coexist, managing hybrid systems will require efficient conversion between bits and qubits. Therefore, understanding memory management for both classical and quantum systems is essential. Along that line, this survey provides a comparative analysis of memory management in classical and quantum architectures. The traditional memory hierarchy and allocation strategies used in classical systems are examined along with caching and paging techniques which optimize performance and resource utilization. On the other hand, quantum memory management focuses on addressing unique challenges such as quantum decoherence and error correction using advanced techniques such as Shor's code, Surface codes, and other specialized error correction codes. This study explores Quantum Random Access Memory (QRAM) and its role in enabling efficient data retrieval in quantum systems. Quantum read/write operations and their impact on coherence and fidelity are analyzed, highlighting advancements in qubit state measurement and error mitigation. While classical systems take benefits of deterministic and hierarchical memory structures, quantum systems must overcome environmental noise and decoherence to maintain data stability. Furthermore, scalability issues and emerging trends in quantum architecture are discussed, emphasizing how advancements in Quantum Error Correction (QEC) and hybrid systems can address current limitations in memory management.

TI Global quantum discord and von Neumann entropy in multipartite two-level
   atomic systems
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB We have computed the global quantum discord (GQD) and von Neumann entropy (VNE) of multipartite two-level atomic systems interacting with a single-mode Fock field. We use Tavis-Cumming model. We have explored how quantum correlations and quantum entanglement evolve with time in such systems. The quantum system is prepared initially in a mixed state and different parameters are varied to see how they affect the information processing in the system. The dynamical character of the GQD and VNE show an interplay between classical and nonclassical correlations. Photons in this model play an important role to assist the GQD and VNE and we observed that the effects of the field on the GQD and VNE reside in the time evolution of the system indicating that both atom and field states have become entangled. The GQD is assisted in a nonlinear fashion with the number of photons in the system. The GQD and VNE show linear behavior with each other in the dynamics of the system. The effects of intrinsic decoherence on the dynamics of the GQD and VNE are also studied. We have extrapolated the results for a large photon number on the system. We have studied the effect of the change in the size of the system on the maximum value of GQD and VNE and we have estimated the scaling coefficients for this behavior.

TI Quantum technologies in space
SO EXPERIMENTAL ASTRONOMY
AB Recently, the European Commission supported by many European countries has announced large investments towards the commercialization of quantum technology (QT) to address and mitigate some of the biggest challenges facing today's digital era - e.g. secure communication and computing power. For more than two decades the QT community has been working on the development of QTs, which promise landmark breakthroughs leading to commercialization in various areas. The ambitious goals of the QT community and expectations of EU authorities cannot be met solely by individual initiatives of single countries, and therefore, require a combined European effort of large and unprecedented dimensions comparable only to the Galileo or Copernicus programs. Strong international competition calls for a coordinated European effort towards the development of QT in and for space, including research and development of technology in the areas of communication and sensing. Here, we aim at summarizing the state of the art in the development of quantum technologies which have an impact in the field of space applications. Our goal is to outline a complete framework for the design, development, implementation, and exploitation of quantum technology in space.

AB Quantum computation has made considerable progress in the last decade with multiple emerging technologies providing proof-of-principle experimental demonstrations of such calculations. However, these experimental demonstrations of quantum computation face technical challenges due to the noise and errors that arise from imperfect implementation of the technology. Here, we frame the concepts of computational accuracy, result reproducibility, device reliability and program stability in the context of quantum computation. We provide intuitive definitions for these concepts in the context of quantum computation that lead to operationally meaningful bounds on program output. Our assessment highlights the continuing need for statistical analyses of quantum computing program to increase our confidence in the burgeoning field of quantum information science.

TI Implementing arbitrary multimode continuous-variable quantum gates with
   fixed non-Gaussian states and adaptive linear optics
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Non-Gaussian quantum gates are essential components for optical quantum information processing. However, the efficient implementation of practically important multimode higher-order non-Gaussian gates has not been comprehensively studied. We propose a measurement-based method to directly implement general, multimode, and higher-order non-Gaussian gates using only fixed non-Gaussian ancillary states and adaptive linear optics. Compared to existing methods, our method allows for a more resource-efficient and experimentally feasible implementation of multimode gates that are important for various applications in optical quantum technology, such as the two-mode cubic quantum nondemolition gate or the three-mode continuous-variable Toffoli gate, and their higher-order extensions. Our results will expedite the progress toward fault-tolerant universal quantum computing with light.

TI Compact Quantum Circuit Design of PUFFIN and PRINT Lightweight Ciphers
   for Quantum Key Recovery Attack
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Quantum computing plays a vital role in the next generation computing platforms as researchers have achieved quantum supremacy by proving that quantum computers can outperform classical computers. These high performance computers will pose a serious threat to the security of the conventional cryptographic algorithms. The secret key of the conventional cryptographic algorithms when implemented by quantum circuits can be recovered easily with the help of Grover key search algorithm. The Grover's algorithm requires low cost quantum implementation of cryptographic algorithms in order to mount the quantum key recovery attack successfully. Hence the low cost quantum implementation of conventional cryptographic algorithms to mount quantum key recovery attack using Grover search algorithm is an active area of research. For the first time in literature, this work proposes a novel quantum circuit implementation of two lightweight block ciphers namely PUFFIN and PRINT. Inplace method is used to optimize the quantum resources in these two ciphers which helps to build compact quantum circuits without extra ancilla inputs. The performance metrics considered in this work to quantify the quantum resources of the proposed circuits are number of quantum gates, quantum cost, latency and number of qubits. In addition, the quantum resources are also estimated to mount the quantum key recovery attacks on the proposed quantum circuit implementations of PUFFIN and PRINT using Grover-based key search algorithm.

TI Meta-learning assisted robust control of universal quantum gates with
   uncertainties
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Achieving high-fidelity quantum gates is crucial for reliable quantum computing. However, decoherence and control pulse imperfections pose significant challenges in realizing the theoretical fidelity of quantum gates in practical systems. To address these challenges, we propose the meta-reinforcement learning quantum control algorithm (metaQctrl), which leverages a two-layer learning framework to enhance robustness and fidelity. The inner reinforcement learning network focuses on decision making for specific optimization problems, while the outer meta-learning network adapts to varying environments and provides feedback to the inner network. Our comparative analysis regarding the realization of universal quantum gates demonstrates that metaQctrl achieves higher fidelity with fewer control pulses than conventional methods in the presence of uncertainties. These results can contribute to the exploration of the quantum speed limit and facilitate the implementation of quantum circuits with system imperfections involved.

AB On the basis of classical computer, quantum computer has been developed. In dealing with some large-scale parallel problems, quantum computer is simpler and faster than traditional computer. Nowadays, physical qubit computers have many limitations. Classical computers have many ways to simulate quantum computing, the most effective of which are quantum superiority and quantum algorithm. Ensuring computational efficiency, accuracy, and precision is of great significance to the study of large-scale quantum computing. Compared with other algorithms, genetic algorithm has more advantages, so it can be more widely used. For example, strong adaptability and global optimization ability are the advantages of genetic algorithm. Through the research in Chapter 4, we can conclude that the variance of A2C is obviously smaller than that of PPO. Furthermore, it can be concluded that A2C has better robustness.

TI Quantum Contextuality Provides Communication Complexity Advantage
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Despite the conceptual importance of contextuality in quantum mechanics, there is a hitherto limited number of applications requiring contextuality but not entanglement. Here, we show that for any quantum state and observables of sufficiently small dimensions producing contextuality, there exists a commu-nication task with quantum advantage. Conversely, any quantum advantage in this task admits a proof of contextuality whenever an additional condition holds. We further show that given any set of observables allowing for quantum state-independent contextuality, there exists a class of communication tasks wherein the difference between classical and quantum communication complexities increases as the number of inputs grows. Finally, we show how to convert each of these communication tasks into a semi-device -independent protocol for quantum key distribution.

AB In this paper, we investigate the creation of quantum correlations such as entanglement, the Gaussian quantum discord and quantum steering in a quantum system under consideration via the linear beam splitter with squeezed thermal and a single-mode Gaussian states at the inputs. This quantum system generates bright entangled output two-mode light. Specifically, the quantum entanglement can be enhanced through increasing the purity of the Gaussian state and the squeezing parameter at the input states. The quantum correlations reveal similar characteristics for each case. That means when we increase the non-classicality, purity and squeezing parameter, the quantum correlations show enhanced profile. On the other hand, upon increasing the mean thermal photon number at the input, the quantum correlations indicate inverse relation.

We derive direct and converse bounds for the one-shot capacity region, represented by the smooth conditional entropies and the error tolerance. The proof is based on the randomized partial decoupling theorem, which is a generalization of the decoupling theorem. The two bounds match in the asymptotic limit of infinitely many uses of a memoryless channel and coincide with the previous result obtained by Hsieh and Wilde. Direct and converse bounds for various communication tasks are obtained as corollaries, both for the one-shot and asymptotic scenarios.

TI Transmission of light-matter entanglement over a metropolitan network
SO OPTICA QUANTUM
AB We report on the transmission of telecom photons entangled with a multimode solid-state quantum memory over a deployed optical fiber in a metropolitan area. Photon pairs were generated through spontaneous parametric down-conversion, with one photon stored in a rare-earth-based quantum memory, and the other, at telecommunication wavelengths, traveling through increasing distances of optical fiber, first in the laboratory and then outside in a deployed fiber loop. We measured highly non-classical correlations between the stored and the telecom photons for storage times up to 25 mu s and for a fiber separation up to 50 km. We also report light-matter entanglement with a two-qubit fidelity up to 88%, which remains constant within error bars for all fiber lengths, showing that the telecom qubit does not suffer decoherence during the transmission. Finally, we moved the detection stage of the telecom photons to a different location placed 16 km away, and confirmed the non-classical correlations between the two photons. Our system was adapted to provide the transmission of precise detection times and synchronization signals over long quantum communication channels, providing the first steps for a future quantum network involving quantum memories and non-classical states.

TI Quantum simulation of light-front parton correlators
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
AB The physics of high-energy colliders relies on the knowledge of different nonperturbative parton correlators, such as parton distribution functions, that encode the information on universal hadron structure and are thus the main building blocks of any factorization theorem of the underlying process in such collision. These functions are given in terms of gauge-invariant light-front operators, that are nonlocal in both space and real time, and thus intractable by standard lattice techniques due to the well-known sign problem. In this paper, we propose a quantum algorithm to perform a quantum simulation of these type of correlators, and illustrate it by considering a space-time Wilson loop.

TI Quantum correlations in a chain-type quantum network
SO COMMUNICATIONS IN THEORETICAL PHYSICS
AB A quantum network concerns several independent entangled resources and can create strong quantum correlations by performing joint measurements on some observers. In this paper, we discuss an n-partite chain network with each of two neighboring observers sharing an arbitrary Bell state and all intermediate observers performing some positive-operator-valued measurements with parameter lambda. The expressions of all post-measurement states between any two observers are obtained, and their quantifications of Bell nonlocality, Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen steering and entanglement with different ranges of lambda are respectively detected and analyzed.

TI Solid-State Qubit as an On-Chip Controller for Non-Classical Field
   States
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB A basic element of a quantum network based on two single-mode waveguides is proposed with different frequencies connected by a solid-state qubit. Using a simple example of a possible superconducting implementation, the usefulness of the simplifications used in the general theoretical consideration has been justified. The non-classical field in a single-mode with a frequency of omega 1$\omega _1$ is fed to the input of a qubit controller and transformed into a non-classical field in an output single-mode with a frequency of omega 2$\omega _2$. The interface can establish a quantum connection between solid-state and photonic flying qubits with adjustable pulse shapes and carrier frequencies. This allows quantum information to be transferred to other superconducting or atomic-based quantum registers or chips. The peculiarities of the wave-qubit interactions are described, showing how they help to control the quantum state of the non-classical field. On this basis, the operating principles of solid-state and flying qubits for the future quantum information platforms are considered.
   Current research in quantum matter is strongly focused on quantum communication and the quantum internet. The manuscript discusses a fundamental element of a quantum network consisting of two single-mode resonators of different frequencies connected by a solid-state qubit. The non-classical field in a single-mode resonator operating at frequency omega 1$\omega _1$ is directed to the input of a qubit controller and subsequently converted to a non-classical field in an output single-mode resonator operating at frequency omega 2$\omega _2$. This interface provides a quantum connection between solid-state and photonic flying qubits, offering tunable pulse shapes and carrier frequencies. image

TI Architectures for lattice surgery-based surface code quantum computing
   under 3-dimensional nearest-neighbor connectivity
SO QUANTUM INFORMATION PROCESSING
AB Efforts are being made to develop quantum processors beyond planar connectivity and quantum error correction codes suitable for 3-dimensional structures. In this study, we propose 3-dimensional architectures of logical data qubits and logical ancilla qubits based on surface codes using lattice surgery in situations where 3-dimensional nearest-neighbor connectivity between physical qubits is guaranteed. We also propose a method for performing CNOT operations on the proposed architecture. We present a physical qubit structure that stacks 2-dimensional physical qubit layers and adds several additional physical qubits for lattice surgery between adjacent layers. Our design permits the fast transversal application of CNOT operations between logical qubits in a nearest-neighbor relationship on adjacent layers, which is three times faster than the speed of standard lattice surgery CNOTs. Our design also permits the performance of CNOT operations between logical qubits that are far from each other using fast SWAP operations with transversal CNOT and lattice surgery. To demonstrate the advantages of our architecture, we present the required number of qubits and time for benchmark circuits on the proposed architecture and compare the required qubits and time on the checkerboard architecture and row-type architecture which are a 2-dimensional architectures to show the advantages of our architecture.

TI Heralding quantum entanglement between two room-temperature atomic
   ensembles
SO OPTICA
AB Establishing quantum entanglement between individual nodes is crucial for building large-scale quantum networks, enabling secure quantum communications, distributed quantum computing, enhanced quantum metrology, and fundamental tests of quantum mechanics. However, the shared entanglements have been merely observed in either extremely low-temperature or well-isolated systems, which limits quantum networks for real-life applications. Here, we report the realization of heralding quantum entanglement between two atomic ensembles at room temperature, which are contained in two spatially separated, centimeter-sized vapor cells. By mapping the atomic state onto a photonic state after the readout process, we measure the quantum interference of the Raman-scattered photons and reconstruct the entangled state, then we strongly verify the existence of a single excitation delocalized in two atomic ensembles. The demonstrated building block paves the way to construct quantum networks and distributing entanglement across multiple remote nodes at ambient conditions.

TI Effect of weak measurement reversal on quantum correlations in a
   correlated amplitude damping channel, with a neural network perspective
SO PHYSICA SCRIPTA
AB We study the evolution of quantum correlations in Bell, Werner, and maximally entangled mixed states of two qubits subjected to correlated amplitude-damping channels. Our primary focus is to evaluate the robustness of entanglement as a resource for quantum information protocols such as dense coding, teleportation, and Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) steering under the influence of noise. In addition, we investigate the behaviour of other quantum correlations, including quantum discord and coherence, and analyze their hierarchy under decoherence. To counteract the detrimental effects of the channels, we apply the weak measurement and quantum measurement reversal (WMR) protocol, comparing the effectiveness of single-qubit and two-qubit WMR techniques. Our results show that the two-qubit WMR protocol significantly outperforms the single-qubit approach in preserving quantum correlations. Furthermore, we employ a neural network model to enhance our analysis of the relationship between different quantum correlation measures during the evolution. Using a MATLAB-based artificial neural network with 80 neurons across three hidden layers and trained with the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm, we successfully predict trace distance discord from other correlations, achieving low prediction errors. Besides, our analysis of the neural network weights suggests that concurrence and EPR steering have the most positive influence on the accurate discord predictions.

TI Universal Framework for Quantum Error-Correcting Codes
SO ENTROPY
AB We present a universal framework for quantum error-correcting codes, i.e., a framework that applies to the most general quantum error-correcting codes. This framework is based on the group algebra, an algebraic notation associated with nice error bases of quantum systems. The nicest thing about this framework is that we can characterize the properties of quantum codes by the properties of the group algebra. We show how it characterizes the properties of quantum codes as well as generates some new results about quantum codes.

TI Optimal universal quantum error correction via bounded reference frames
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Error correcting codes with a universal set of transversal gates are a desideratum for quantum computing. Such codes, however, are ruled out by the Eastin-Knill theorem. Moreover, the theorem also rules out codes which are covariant with respect to the action of transversal unitary operations forming continuous symmetries. In this work, starting from an arbitrary code, we construct approximate codes which are covariant with respect to the entire group of local unitary gates in dimension d (<infinity), using quantum reference frames. We show that our codes are capable of efficiently correcting different types of erasure errors. When only a small fraction of the n qudits upon which the code is built are erased, our covariant code has an error that scales as 1/n(2), which is reminiscent of the Heisenberg limit of quantum metrology. When every qudit has a chance of being erased, our covariant code has an error that scales as 1/n. We show that the error scaling is optimal in both cases. Our approach has implications for fault-tolerant quantum computing, reference frame error correction, and the AdS-CFT duality.

TI Nuclear spin engineering for quantum information science
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS RESEARCH
AB Semiconductors are the backbone of modern technology, garnering decades of investment in high-quality materials and devices. Electron spin systems in semiconductors, including atomic defects and quantum dots, have been demonstrated in the last two decades to host quantum coherent spin qubits, often with coherent spin-photon interfaces and proximal nuclear spins. These systems are at the center of developing quantum technology. However, new material challenges arise when considering the isotopic composition of host and qubit systems. The isotopic composition governs the nature and concentration of nuclear spins, which naturally occur in leading host materials. These spins generate magnetic noise-detrimental to qubit coherence-but also show promise as local quantum memories and processors, necessitating careful engineering dependent on the targeted application. Reviewing recent experimental and theoretical progress toward understanding local nuclear spin environments in semiconductors, we show this aspect of material engineering as critical to quantum information technology.

TI A modular entanglement-based quantum computer architecture
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB We propose a modular quantum computation architecture based on utilizing multipartite entanglement. Each module consists of a small-scale quantum computer comprising data, memory and entangling qubits. Entangling qubits are used to selectively couple different modules by harnessing some non-controllable, distance-dependent interaction, which is effectively controlled and enhanced via a proper adjusting of the internal state of the qubits. In this way, multipartite entangled states with different entanglement topologies can be shared between modules. These states are stored in memory qubits where they can be further processed so they can eventually be used to deterministically perform certain classes of gates or circuits between modules on demand, including parallel controlled-Z gates with arbitrary interaction patterns, multi-qubit gates or whole Clifford circuits, depending on their entanglement structure. The usage of different kinds of multipartite entanglement rather than Bell pairs allows for more efficient and flexible coupling between modules, leading to a scalable quantum computation architecture.

TI Real-time ghost imaging of Bell-nonlocal entanglement between a photon
   and a quantum memory
SO QUANTUM
AB Certification of nonlocality of quantum mechanics is an important fundamental test that typically requires prolonged data collection and is only revealed in an in-depth analysis. These features are often particularly exposed in hybrid systems, such as interfaces between light and atomic ensembles. Certification of entanglement from images acquired with single-photon camera can mitigate this issue by exploiting multiplexed photon generation. Here we demonstrate this feature in a quantum memory (QM) operating in a real-time feedback mode. Through spatially-multimode spin-wave storage the QM enables operation of the real-time ghost imaging (GI) protocol. By properly preparing the spatial phase of light emitted by the atoms we enable observation of Bell-type nonlocality from a single image acquired in the far field as witnessed by the Bell parameter of S = 2.227 +/- 0.007 > 2. Our results are an important step towards fast and efficient utilization of multimode quantum memories both in protocols and in fundamental tests.

We show that the DQC1 model can be leveraged to develop an efficient method for estimating complex kernel functions. We demonstrate a simple relationship between coherence consumption and the kernel function, a crucial element in machine learning. The paper presents an implementation of a binary classification problem on IBM hardware using the DQC1 model and analyzes the impact of quantum coherence and hardware noise. The advantage of our proposal lies in its utilization of quantum discord, which is more resilient to noise than entanglement.

TI Quantum Computation via Multiport Discretized Quantum Fourier Optical
   Processors
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM ENGINEERING
AB The light's image is the primary source of information carrier in nature. Indeed, a single photon's image possesses a vast information capacity that can be harnessed for quantum information processing. Our scheme for implementing quantum information processing on a discretized photon wavefront via universal multiport processors employs a class of quantum Fourier optical systems composed of spatial phase modulators and 4f-processors with phase-only pupils having a characteristic periodicity that reduces the number of optical resources quadratically as compared to other conventional path-encoding techniques. In particular, this article employs quantum Fourier optics to implement some key quantum logical gates that can be instrumental in optical quantum computations. For instance, we demonstrate the principle by implementing the single-qubit Hadamard and the two-qubit controlled-not gates via simulation and optimization techniques. Due to various advantages of the proposed scheme, including the large information capacity of the photon wavefront, a quadratically reduced number of optical resources compared with other conventional path-encoding techniques, and dynamic programmability, the proposed scheme has the potential to be an essential contribution to linear optical quantum computing and optical quantum signal processing.

TI Fault-tolerant quantum error correction using error weight parities
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB In quantum error correction using imperfect primitives, errors of high weight arising from a few faults are major concerns since they might not be correctable by the quantum error correcting code. Fortunately, some errors of different weights are logically equivalent, and the same correction procedure is applicable to all equivalent errors; thus correcting high-weight errors is sometimes possible. In this work, we introduce a technique called weight parity error correction (WPEC) which can correct Pauli error of any weight in some stabilizer codes provided that the parity of the weight of the error is known. We show that the technique is applicable to concatenated codes constructed from the [[7, 1, 3]] Steane code or the [[23, 1, 7]] Golay code. We also provide a fault-tolerant error correction protocol using WPEC for the [[49, 1, 9]] concatenated Steane code which can correct up to three faults and requires only two ancillas.

AB Some of the most significant achievements of the modern era of particle physics, such as the discovery of the Higgs boson, have been made possible by the tremendous effort in building and operating large-scale experiments like the Large Hadron Collider or the Tevatron. In these facilities, the ultimate theory to describe matter at the most fundamental level is constantly probed and verified. These experiments often produce large amounts of data that require storing, processing, and analysis techniques that continually push the limits of traditional information processing schemes. Thus, the High-Energy Physics (HEP) field has benefited from advancements in information processing and the development of algorithms and tools for large datasets. More recently, quantum computing applications have been investigated to understand how the community can benefit from the advantages of quantum information science. Nonetheless, to unleash the full potential of quantum computing, there is a need to understand the quantum behavior and, thus, scale up current algorithms beyond what can be simulated in classical processors. In this work, we explore potential applications of quantum machine learning to data analysis tasks in HEP and how to overcome the limitations of algorithms targeted for Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices.

   Man-in-the-Middle Attack Mitigation
SO IEEE OPEN JOURNAL OF THE COMMUNICATIONS SOCIETY
AB The Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) protocol utilizes quantum mechanics principles for cryptographic key exchange, ensuring absolute secrecy. Current QKD techniques are susceptible to man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks due to the absence of an inherent mechanism for identity verification within the quantum channel. For authentication, these systems rely on classical or post-quantum cryptography, which diminishes the perfect security advantage provided by QKD. We present a Physical Unclonable Function (PUF)-based authenticated QKD protocol (PUF-AQKD), which avoids the necessity for authenticated classical channels and is useful in mitigating MITM attacks. The fundamental concept of PUF-AQKD is to implement a phase shift in the basis used for polarizing the transmitted qubits. The phase shift is dictated by PUFs, which are anticipated to result in analogous (correlated) responses for devices manufactured under similar conditions but dissimilar responses in different conditions. An adversary lacking a correlated PUF response shared by Alice and Bob would inadvertently increase the Quantum Bit Error Rates (QBER) observed at Bob's end. We present a mathematical model to assess the efficacy of the proposed PUF-AQKD method and perform simulations utilizing the NetSquid simulator. The mathematical analysis and simulation findings indicate that PUF-AQKD can efficiently identify eavesdroppers, even during incomplete measurements, without the necessity of an authorized classical channel.

TI Exoplanet discovery with variational quantum circuits
SO QUANTUM MACHINE INTELLIGENCE
AB This manuscript addresses the automatic identification of exoplanets with the data from the Kepler mission using variational quantum circuits (VQC) implemented with the Qiskit library. The system accuracy was assessed across various configurations, including different numbers of qubits, feature maps, ansatz structures, and training algorithms, providing valuable insights into the performance of VQCs. The results of the VQC-based approach were compared to those obtained using a classical artificial neural network, namely a multilayer perceptron. The findings demonstrate that VQCs are a viable and promising method for processing astronomical data and discovering exoplanets, offering a potential advantage over traditional machine learning techniques.

TI Extracting error thresholds through the framework of approximate quantum
   error correction condition
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB The robustness of quantum memory against physical noises is measured by two methods: the exact and approximate quantum error correction (QEC) conditions for error recoverability and the decoder-dependent error threshold which assesses if the logical error rate diminishes with system size. Here we unravel their relations and propose a unified framework to extract an intrinsic error threshold from the approximate QEC condition, which could upper bound other decoder-dependent error thresholds. Our proof establishes that relative entropy, effectively measuring deviations from exact QEC conditions, serves as the order parameter delineating the transition from asymptotic recoverability to unrecoverability. Consequently, we establish a unified framework for determining the error threshold across both exact and approximate QEC codes, addressing errors originating from noise channels as well as those from code space imperfections. This result sharpens our comprehension of error thresholds across diverse QEC codes and error models.

TI Guarantees on the structure of experimental quantum networks

AB Quantum networks connect and supply a large number of nodes with multi-party quantum resources for secure communication, networked quantum computing and distributed sensing. As these networks grow in size, certification tools will be required to answer questions regarding their properties. In this work we demonstrate a general method to guarantee that certain correlations cannot be generated in a given quantum network. We apply quantum inflation methods to data obtained in quantum group encryption experiments, guaranteeing the impossibility of producing the observed results in networks with fewer optical elements. Our results pave the way for scalable methods of obtaining device-independent guarantees on the network structure underlying multipartite quantum protocols.

TI Benchmarking Quantum Gates and Circuits
SO CHEMICAL REVIEWS
AB Accurate noise characterization in quantum gates and circuits is vital for the development of reliable quantum simulations for chemically relevant systems and fault-tolerant quantum computing. This paper reviews a variety of key benchmarking techniques, including Randomized Benchmarking, Quantum Process Tomography, Gate Set Tomography, Process Fidelity Estimation, Direct Fidelity Estimation, and Cross-Entropy Benchmarking. We evaluate each method's complexities, the resources they require, and their effectiveness in addressing coherent, incoherent, and state preparation and measurement (SPAM) errors. Furthermore, we introduce Deterministic Benchmarking (DB), a novel protocol that minimizes the number of experimental runs, exhibits resilience to SPAM errors, and effectively characterizes both coherent and incoherent errors. The implementation of DB is experimentally validated using a superconducting transmon qubit, and the results are substantiated with a simple analytical model and master equation simulations. With the addition of DB to the toolkit of available benchmarking methods, this article serves as a practical guide for choosing and applying benchmarking protocols to advance quantum computing technologies.

   entanglement
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS A-MATHEMATICAL AND THEORETICAL
AB For the maximal violation of all Bell inequalities by an arbitrary pure two-qudit state of any dimension, we derive a new lower bound expressed via the concurrence of this pure state. This new lower bound and the upper bound on the maximal Bell violation, found in Loubenets and Namkung (2022 J. Phys. A: Math. Theor. 55 285301) and also expressed via the concurrence, analytically quantify Bell nonlocality of a pure two-qudit state via its entanglement, in particular, prove explicitly that entanglement of a pure two-qudit state is necessary and sufficient for its Bell nonlocality. By re-visiting the pure two-qubit case, we also find and rigorously prove the new results on correlation properties of an arbitrary pure two-qubit state.

However, its physical implementation is currently plagued by substantial challenges. Recently, the fusion-based quantum computing scheme has garnered considerable attention. This scheme relies on periodically generated resource states, linking them into a fusion network via fusion measurements to achieve high fault-tolerant efficiency. This study introduces the fundamental principles, fault-tolerant performance, and resource state generation schemes of fusion-based quantum computing.

TI Measurement-based estimator scheme for continuous quantum error
   correction
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Canonical discrete quantum error correction (DQEC) schemes use projective von Neumann measurements on stabilizers to discretize the error syndromes into a finite set, and fast unitary gates are applied to recover the corrupted information. Quantum error correction (QEC) based on continuous measurement, known as continuous quantum error correction (CQEC), in principle, can be executed faster than DQEC and can also be resource efficient. However, CQEC requires meticulous filtering of noisy continuous measurement data to reliably extract error syndromes on the basis of which errors could be detected. In this paper, we show that by constructing a measurement-based estimator (MBE) of the logical qubit to be protected, which is driven by the noisy continuous measurement currents of the stabilizers, it is possible to accurately track the errors occurring on the physical qubits in real time. We use this MBE to develop a continuous quantum error correction (MBE-CQEC) scheme that can protect the logical qubit to a high degree, surpassing the performance of DQEC, and also allows QEC to be conducted either immediately or in delayed time with instantaneous feedbacks.

AB The rapid development of quantum computing devices promises powerful machines with the potential to confront a variety of problems that conventional computers cannot. Therefore, quantum computers generate new threats at unprecedented speed and scale and specifically pose an enormous threat to encryption. Lattice-based cryptography is regarded as the rival to a quantum computer attack and the future of post-quantum cryptography. So, cryptographic protocols based on lattices have a variety of benefits, such as security, efficiency, lower energy consumption, and speed. In this work, we study the most well-known lattice-based cryptosystems while a systematic evaluation and comparison is also presented.

TI Qubit Regularization and Qubit Embedding Algebras
SO SYMMETRY-BASEL
AB Qubit regularization is a procedure to regularize the infinite dimensional local Hilbert space of bosonic fields to a finite dimensional one, which is a crucial step when trying to simulate lattice quantum field theories on a quantum computer. When the qubit-regularized lattice quantum fields preserve important symmetries of the original theory, qubit regularization naturally enforces certain algebraic structures on these quantum fields. We introduce the concept of qubit embedding algebras (QEAs) to characterize this algebraic structure associated with a qubit regularization scheme. We show a systematic procedure to derive QEAs for the O(N) lattice spin models and the SU(N) lattice gauge theories. While some of the QEAs we find were discovered earlier in the context of the D-theory approach, our method shows that QEAs are far richer. A more complete understanding of the QEAs could be helpful in recovering the fixed points of the desired quantum field theories.

We also show limitations of quantum memory that suggests the attestation problem for quantum memory is fundamentally different to the attestation problem for classical memory, even when the devices can perform quantum computation. The identified problems are of interest for quantum-based security protocol designers in general, particularly those dealing with corrupt devices. Finally, we make use of the lessons learnt to design a quantum-based attestation system for classical memory with improved communication efficiency and security.

Alongside a comprehensive examination of the field, the study presents a concrete implementation of QRL tailored to foundational gym environments. Leveraging principles from Quantum Computing, experiments reveal QRL's potential in enhancing reinforcement learning tasks within these environments, showcasing notable space optimization for RL models. Quantitative results indicate a reduction in the number of trainable parameters by up to 90% when compared to classical approaches, significantly improving efficiency, mainly due to quantum principles of superposition and entanglement. This highlights the promising implications of integrating quantum computing techniques to address challenges and advance capabilities in fundamental reinforcement learning scenarios. Furthermore, the study discusses the adaptability of QRL algorithms to diverse problem domains, suggesting their potential for scalability and applicability beyond simple environments. Such versatility underscores the robustness and practical relevance of QRL methodologies in real-world scenarios, positioning them as valuable tools for tackling complex reinforcement learning challenges.

TI Quantum Machine Learning and Grover's Algorithm for Quantum Optimization
   of Robotic Manipulators
SO IEEE ROBOTICS AND AUTOMATION LETTERS
AB Optimizing high-degree-of-freedom robotic manipulators requires searching complex, high-dimensional configuration spaces, a task that is computationally challenging for classical methods. This letter introduces a quantum-native framework that integrates Quantum Machine Learning (QML) with Grover's algorithm to solve kinematic optimization problems efficiently. A parameterized quantum circuit is trained to approximate the forward kinematics model, which then constructs an oracle to identify optimal configurations. Grover's algorithm leverages this oracle to provide a quadratic reduction in search complexity. Demonstrated on simulated 1-DoF, 2-DoF, and dual-arm manipulator tasks, the method achieves significant speedups-up to 93x over classical optimizers like Nelder-Mead-as problem dimensionality increases. This work establishes a foundational, quantum-native framework for robot kinematic optimization, effectively bridging quantum computing and robotics problems.

TI Hybrid Rydberg quantum gate for quantum network
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB The high-fidelity storage, distribution, and processing of quantum information prefers qubits with different physical properties. Thus hybrid quantum gates interfacing different types of qubits are essential for the realization of complex quantum network structures. A Rydberg-atom-based physical quantum controlled-Z (CZ) gate is proposed to hybridly process the polarization-encoded single-photon optical qubit and the "Schrodinger cat" microwave qubit. The degradation of the fidelity under the influence of various noise channels, such as microwave cavity loss, spontaneous emission of atom states, and nonadiabaticity effect, etc., has been analyzed through detailed theoretical analysis by deriving the input-output relation of qubit fields. The feasibility and the challenges of the protocol within current technology are also discussed by analyzing the possible experimental parameter settings. Our work opens prospects for future large-scale quantum architecture based on hybrid quantum modules.

TI Noncyclic nonadiabatic holonomic quantum gates via shortcuts to
   adiabaticity
SO FRONTIERS OF PHYSICS
AB High-fidelity quantum gates are essential for large-scale quantum computation. However, any quantum manipulation will inevitably affected by noises, systematic errors and decoherence effects, which lead to infidelity of a target quantum task. Therefore, implementing high-fidelity, robust and fast quantum gates is highly desired. Here, we propose a fast and robust scheme to construct high-fidelity holonomic quantum gates for universal quantum computation based on resonant interaction of three-level quantum systems via shortcuts to adiabaticity. In our proposal, the target Hamiltonian to induce noncyclic non-Abelian geometric phases can be inversely engineered with less evolution time and demanding experimentally, leading to high-fidelity quantum gates in a simple setup. Besides, our scheme is readily realizable in physical system currently pursued for implementation of quantum computation. Therefore, our proposal represents a promising way towards fault-tolerant geometric quantum computation.

TI Parallel remote preparation of two-qubit hybrid states on four degrees
   of freedom via two-photon hyperentangled Bell state
SO EPJ QUANTUM TECHNOLOGY
AB Preparing quantum state remotely plays an important role in quantum communication network. Most of the previous protocols for parallel preparation quantum state remotely only consider parallel remote preparation of arbitrary single-qubit states. In this paper, we propose a protocol for parallel remote preparation of two-qubit hybrid states with a two-photon hyperentangled state. The arbitrary two-qubit hybrid states encoded in spatial-mode, frequency, polarization and time-bin degrees of freedom(DOFs) can be remotely prepared via hyperentangled state and optical elements. Moreover, we discuss parallel remote preparation of two-qubit hybrid states via partially hyperentangled state. The protocol for parallel remote preparation of two-qubit hybrid states has the advantage of having high channel capacity for long distance quantum communication by using hyperentangled state simultaneously entangled in spatial-mode, frequency, polarization and time-bin DOFs as the quantum channel.

TI Probabilistic resumable quantum teleportation in high dimensions
SO CHINESE PHYSICS B
AB Teleportation is a quantum information process without classical counterparts, in which the sender can disembodiedly transfer unknown quantum states to the receiver. In probabilistic teleportation through a partial entangled quantum channel, the transmission is exact (with fidelity 1), but may fail in a probability and the initial state is destroyed simultaneously. We propose a scheme for nondestructive probabilistic teleportation of high-dimensional quantum states. With the aid of an ancilla in the hands of the sender, the initial quantum information can be recovered when teleportation fails. The ancilla acts as a quantum apparatus to measure the sender's subsystem. Erasing the information recorded in it can resume the initial state.

TI A brief introduction to quantum algorithms
SO CCF TRANSACTIONS ON HIGH PERFORMANCE COMPUTING
AB Quantum algorithms are demonstrated to outperform classical algorithms for certain problems and thus are promising candidates for efficient information processing. Herein we aim to provide a brief and popular introduction to quantum algorithms for both the academic community and the general public with interest. We start from elucidating quantum parallelism, the basic framework of quantum algorithms and the difficulty of quantum algorithm design. Then we mainly focus on a historical overview of progress in quantum algorithm research over the past three to four decades. Finally, we clarify two common questions about the study of quantum algorithms, hoping to stimulate readers for further exploration.

TI Qubit Rate Modulation-Based Time Synchronization Mechanism for Multinode
   Quantum Networks
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM ENGINEERING
AB The combination of quantum and telecommunication networks enables to revolutionize the way information is used, offering unparalleled capabilities and making it an ideal choice for many critical applications. In this sense, quantum protocols generally have a unique requirement to have strict time synchronization in order to operate, which generally consume quantum resources of part of the exchanged qubits. Accordingly, work demonstrates and characterizes a temporal alignment mechanism for quantum networks based on frequency testing, allowing to preserve the quantum state of qubits. The time synchronization correction achieved is within 100 ns working at 5 MHz with temporal and relative frequency offsets commonly acquired in quantum links using conventional hardware clocks with temporal stability in the range of 10(-8) and 200-ns jitter.

TI Blind quantum computation with a client performing different
   single-qubit gates
SO CHINESE PHYSICS B
AB In the field of single-server blind quantum computation (BQC), a major focus is to make the client as classical as possible. To achieve this goal, we propose two single-server BQC protocols to achieve verifiable universal quantum computation. In these two protocols, the client only needs to perform either the gate T (in the first protocol) or the gates H and X (in the second protocol). With assistance from a single server, the client can utilize his quantum capabilities to generate some single-qubit states while keeping the actual state of these qubits confidential from others. By using these single-qubit states, the verifiable universal quantum computation can be achieved.

TI Optical nuclear electric resonance as single qubit gate for trapped
   neutral atoms
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS B-ATOMIC MOLECULAR AND OPTICAL PHYSICS
AB The precise control of nuclear spin states is crucial for a wide range of quantum technology applications. Here, we propose a fast and robust single-qubit gate in 87Sr utilizing the concept of optical nuclear electric resonance (ONER). ONER exploits the interaction between the quadrupole moment of a nucleus and the electric field gradient generated by its electronic environment, enabling spin level transitions via amplitude-modulated laser light. We investigate the hyperfine structure of the 5s 2 1S0 -> 5s5p 3P1 optical transition in neutral 87Sr and identify the magnetic field strengths and laser parameters necessary to drive spin transitions between the mI=-9/2 and mI=-5/2 hyperfine levels in the ground state. Our simulations show that ONER could enable faster spin operations compared to the state-of-the-art oscillations in this 'atomic qubit'. Moreover, we show that spin-flip operations exceeding 99.9% fidelity can be performed even in the presence of typical noise sources. These results pave the way for significant advances in nuclear spin control, opening new possibilities for quantum memories and other quantum technologies.

TI Quantum entanglement and interference at 3 μm
SO SCIENCE ADVANCES
AB Given the important advantages of the mid-infrared optical range (2.5 to 25 mu m) for biomedical sensing, optical communications, and molecular spectroscopy, extending quantum information technology to this region is highly attractive. However, the development of mid-infrared quantum information technology is still in its infancy. Here, we report on the generation of a time-energy entangled photon pair in the mid-infrared wavelength band. By using frequency upconversion detection technology, we observe the two-photon Hong-Ou-Mandel interference and demonstrate the time-energy entanglement between twin photons at 3082 nm via the Franson-type interferometer, verifying the indistinguishability and nonlocality of the photons. This work is very promising for future applications of optical quantum technology in the mid-infrared band, which will bring more opportunities in the fields of quantum communication, precision sensing, and imaging.

TI Assisted quantum simulation of open quantum systems
SO ISCIENCE
AB Universal quantum algorithms (UQA) implemented on fault-tolerant quantum computers are expected to achieve an exponential speedup over classical coun-terparts. However, the deep quantum circuits make the UQA implausible in the current era. With only the noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices in hand, we introduce the quantum-assisted quantum algorithm, which reduces the circuit depth of UQA via NISQ technology. Based on this framework, we present two quantum-assisted quantum algorithms for simulating open quantum sys-tems, which utilize two parameterized quantum circuits to achieve a short-time evolution. We propose a variational quantum state preparation method, as a sub-routine to prepare the ancillary state, for loading a classical vector into a quantum state with a shallow quantum circuit and logarithmic number of qubits. We demonstrate numerically our approaches for a two-level system with an ampli-tude damping channel and an open version of the dissipative transverse field Ising model on two sites.

TI Two-qubit entangling gates for superconducting quantum computers
SO RESULTS IN PHYSICS
AB Noisy intermediate-scale quantum computers (NISQ) have demonstrated superior performance compared to conventional computing schemes. Nonetheless, errors associated with two-qubit entangling gates remain a substantial obstacle in fully harnessing the potential of current superconducting quantum computers. The achievement of quantum computation and quantum information processing critically depends on the presence of entangled states. These states are indispensable for quantum computers to surpass classical computers in terms of computational power. This paper presents a comprehensive characterization of a two-qubit entangling gate, known as Dagwood Bumstead (DB) gate, to investigate the challenges posed by errors in the DB gate on NISQ devices. Firstly, we propose a scheme for the realization of the DB gate using two capacitively coupled Josephson Superconducting qubits, based on the experimental setup carried out in Bialczak et al. (2010). Additionally, we introduce and characterize a novel two-qubit quantum gate. Our proposed gate showcases an impressive average gate fidelity of 0.85450. The DB gate's performance is fully described through quantum process tomography (QPT) and quantum state tomography (QST) experiments conducted in three different environments: noisy, noiseless, and on a real IBM quantum computer. The process fidelity of the DB gate is measured to be 0.8069705, and the state fidelity is determined to be 0.8858750. This study offers valuable insights into the performance of the DB gate on a NISQ device, showcasing its potential for executing intricate algorithms and operations on an authentic quantum computer.

TI Topologically Protected Quantum Teleportation via Majorana Zero Modes: A
   Perspective on Scalability and Decoherence Immunity
SO QUANTUM REPORTS
AB We present a topologically protected teleportation protocol based on projective parity measurements between spatially separated Majorana zero modes (MZMs), eliminating the need for dynamic braiding. Unlike conventional teleportation schemes, our method preserves logical information through nonlocal encoding and suppresses decoherence exponentially with Majorana separation. We provide a rigorous mathematical framework that includes six theorems and a lemma, proving fidelity bounds, no entropy increase under ideal QND parity measurement under quantum non-demolition (QND) measurements, and compliance with the no-cloning theorem. We demonstrate that all correction operations lie within the Clifford group, enabling efficient, fault-tolerant implementation. Furthermore, we outline a scalable architecture for multi-qubit teleportation and relate our framework to recent experimental advances in quantum-dot-based Kitaev chains and superconducting nanowire platforms. These results position Majorana-based teleportation as a thermodynamically stable and experimentally viable approach to scalable quantum information transfer. All operations discussed are Clifford-only; achieving universality requires non-Clifford resources and lies outside our scope.

TI Quantum computing topological invariants of two-dimensional quantum
   matter
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Quantum algorithms provide a potential strategy for solving computational problems that are intractable by classical means. Computing the topological invariants of topological matter is one central problem in research on quantum materials, and a variety of numerical approaches for this purpose have been developed. However, the complexity of quantum many-body Hamiltonians makes calculations of topological invariants challenging for interacting systems. Here, we present two quantum circuits for calculating Chern numbers of two-dimensional quantum matter on quantum computers. Both circuits combine a gate-based adiabatic time evolution over the discretized Brillouin zone with particular phase estimation techniques. The first algorithm uses many qubits, and we analyze it using a tensor-network simulator of quantum circuits. The second circuit uses fewer qubits, and we implement it experimentally on a quantum computer based on superconducting qubits. Our results establish a method for computing topological invariants with quantum circuits, taking a step towards characterizing interacting topological quantum matter using quantum computers.

TI How to Wire a 1000-Qubit Trapped-Ion Quantum Computer
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB One of the most formidable challenges of scaling up quantum computers is that of control-signal delivery. Today's small-scale quantum computers typically connect each qubit to one or more separate external signal sources. This approach is not scalable due to the input/output (I/O) limitations of the qubit chip, necessitating the integration of control electronics. However, it is no small feat to shrink control electronics into a small package that is compatible with qubit-chip fabrication and operational constraints without sacrificing performance. This so-called "wiring challenge" is likely to impact the development of more powerful quantum computers even in the near term. In this paper, we address the wiring challenge of trapped-ion quantum computers. We describe a control architecture called WISE (Wiring using Integrated Switching Electronics), which significantly reduces the I/O requirements of ion-trap quantum computing chips without compromising performance. Our method relies on judiciously integrating simple switching electronics into the ion-trap chip-in a way that is compatible with its fabrication and operation constraints-while the complex electronics remain external. To demonstrate its power, we describe how the WISE architecture can be used to operate a fully connected 1000-qubit trapped-ion quantum computer using approximately 200 signal sources at a speed of approximately 40-2600 quantum gate layers per second.

TI Software tools for quantum control: improving quantum computer
   performance through noise and error suppression
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Effectively manipulating quantum computing (QC) hardware in the presence of imperfect devices and control systems is a central challenge in realizing useful quantum computers. Susceptibility to noise critically limits the performance and capabilities of today's so-called noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices, as well as any future QC technologies. Fortunately, quantum control enables efficient execution of quantum logic operations and quantum algorithms with built-in robustness to errors, and without the need for complex logical encoding. In this manuscript we introduce software tools for the application and integration of quantum control in QC research, serving the needs of hardware R&D teams, algorithm developers, and end users. We provide an overview of a set of Python-based classical software tools for creating and deploying optimized quantum control solutions at various layers of the QC software stack. We describe a software architecture leveraging both high-performance distributed cloud computation and local custom integration into hardware systems, and explain how key functionality is integrable with other software packages and quantum programming languages. Our presentation includes a detailed mathematical overview of key features including a flexible optimization toolkit, engineering-inspired filter functions for analyzing noise susceptibility in high-dimensional Hilbert spaces, and new approaches to noise and hardware characterization. Pseudocode is presented in order to elucidate common programming workflows for these tasks, and performance benchmarking is reported for numerically intensive tasks, highlighting the benefits of the selected cloud-compute architecture. Finally, we present a series of case studies demonstrating the application of quantum control solutions derived from these tools in real experimental settings using both trapped-ion and superconducting quantum computer hardware.

TI New design of three-qubit system with three transmons and a single
   fixed-frequency resonator coupler
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB The transmon, which has a short gate time and remarkable scalability, is the most commonly utilized superconducting qubit, based on the Cooper pair box as a qubit or coupler in superconducting quantum computers. Lattice and heavy-hexagon structures are well-known large-scale configurations for transmon-based quantum computers that classical computers cannot simulate. These structures share a common feature: a resonator coupler that connects two transmon qubits. Although significant progress has been made in implementing quantum error correction and quantum computing using quantum error mitigation, fault-tolerant quantum computing remains unachieved due to the inherent vulnerability of these structures. This raises the question of whether the transmon-resonator-transmon structure is the best option for constructing a transmon-based quantum computer. To address this, we demonstrate that the average fidelity of CNOT gates can exceed 0.98 in a structure where a resonator coupler mediates the coupling of three transmon qubits. This result suggests that our novel structure could be a key method for increasing the number of connections among qubits while preserving gate performance in a transmon-based quantum computer.

TI Classical channel bandwidth requirements in continuous variable quantum
   key distribution systems
SO IET QUANTUM COMMUNICATION
AB The reconciliation method for continuous variable quantum key distribution systems is usually chosen based on its reconciliation efficiency. Nonetheless, one must also consider the requirements of each reconciliation method in terms of the amount of information transmitted on the classical channel. Such may limit the achievable key rates. For instance, multidimensional reconciliation of dimension 8 demands a classical channel bandwidth 43 times greater than that of the quantum channel baud rate. Decreasing the dimension to 4 halves the required bandwidth, allowing for higher quantum channel baud rates and higher key rates for shorter transmission distances, despite the lesser reconciliation performance.

TI Demonstration of quantum volume 64 on a superconducting quantum
   computing system
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB We improve the quality of quantum circuits on superconducting quantum computing systems, as measured by the quantum volume (QV), with a combination of dynamical decoupling, compiler optimizations, shorter two-qubit gates, and excited state promoted readout. This result shows that the path to larger QV systems requires the simultaneous increase of coherence, control gate fidelities, measurement fidelities, and smarter software which takes into account hardware details, thereby demonstrating the need to continue to co-design the software and hardware stack for the foreseeable future.

TI Compiling Conditional Quantum Gates without Using Helper Qubits
SO PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACM ON PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES-PACMPL
CT ACM SIGPLAN Conference on Programming Languages Design and
   Implementation (PLDI)
CY JUN 24-28, 2024
CL Copenhagen, DENMARK
AB We present a compilation scheme for conditional quantum gates. Our scheme compiles a multi-qubit conditional to a linear number of two-qubit conditionals. This can be done straightforwardly with helper qubits, but we show how to do it without using helper qubits and with much fewer gates than in previous work. Specifically, our scheme requires 1/3 as many gates as the previous best scheme without using helper qubits, which is essential for practical use. Our experiments show that several quantum-circuit optimizers have little impact on the compiled code from the previous best scheme, confirming the need for our new scheme. Our experiments with Grover's algorithm and quantum walk also show that our scheme has a major impact on the reliability of the compiled code.

TI Optimized measurement-free and fault-tolerant quantum error correction
   for neutral atoms
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB A major challenge in performing quantum error correction (QEC) is implementing reliable measurements and conditional feed-forward operations. In quantum computing platforms supporting unconditional qubit resets, or a constant supply of fresh qubits, alternative schemes which do not require measurements are possible. In such schemes, the error correction is realized via crafted coherent quantum feedback. We propose implementations of small measurement-free QEC schemes, which are fault tolerant to circuit-level noise. These implementations are guided by several heuristics to achieve fault tolerance: redundant syndrome information is extracted, and additional single-shot flag qubits are used. By carefully designing the circuit, the additional overhead of these measurement-free schemes is moderate compared to their conventional measurement and feed-forward counterparts. We highlight how this alternative approach paves the way towards implementing resource-efficient measurement-free QEC on neutral-atom arrays.

TI Simulation of Shor Algorithm for Discrete Logarithm Problems With
   Comprehensive Pairs of Modulo $p$ and Order q
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM ENGINEERING
AB The discrete logarithm problem (DLP) over finite fields, commonly used in classical cryptography, has no known polynomial-time algorithm on classical computers. However, Shor has provided its polynomial-time algorithm on quantum computers. Nevertheless, there are only few examples simulating quantum circuits that operate on general pairs of modulo $p$ and order $q$. In this article, we constructed such quantum circuits and solved DLPs for all 1860 possible pairs of $p$ and $q$ up to 32 qubits using a quantum simulator with PRIMEHPC FX700. From this, we obtained and verified values of the success probabilities, which had previously been heuristically analyzed by Eker & aring; (2019). As a result, the detailed waveform shape of the success probability of Shor's algorithm for solving the DLP, known as a periodic function of order $q$, was clarified. In addition, we generated 1015 quantum circuits for larger pairs of $p$ and $q$, extrapolated the circuit sizes obtained, and compared them for $p=2048$ bits between safe-prime groups and Schnorr groups. While in classical cryptography, the cipher strength of safe-prime groups and Schnorr groups is the same if $p$ is equal, we quantitatively demonstrated how much the strength of the latter decreases to the bit length of $p$ in the former when using Shor's quantum algorithm. In particular, it was experimentally and theoretically shown that when a basic adder is used in the addition circuit, the cryptographic strength of a Schnorr group with $p=2048$ bits under Shor's algorithm is almost equivalent to that of a safe-prime group with $p=1024$ bits.

TI Quantum error correction with dissipatively stabilized squeezed-cat
   qubits
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Noise-biased qubits are a promising route toward significantly reducing the hardware overhead associated with quantum error correction. The squeezed-cat code, a nonlocal encoding in phase space based on squeezed coherent states, is an example of a noise-biased (bosonic) qubit with exponential error bias. Here we propose and analyze the error correction performance of a dissipatively stabilized squeezed-cat qubit. We find that for moderate squeezing the bit-flip error rate gets significantly reduced in comparison with the ordinary cat qubit while leaving the phase-flip rate unchanged. Additionally, we find that the squeezing enables faster and higherfidelity gates.

TI Teaching Quantum Computing to High-School-Aged Youth: A Hands-On
   Approach
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM ENGINEERING
AB Quantum computing is aninterdisciplinary field that lies at the intersection of mathematics, quantum physics, and computer science, and finds applications in areas including optimization, machine learning, and simulation of chemical, physical, and biological systems. It has the potential to help solve problems that so far have no satisfying method solving them, and to provide significant speedup to solutions when compared with their best classical approaches. In turn, quantum computing may allow us to solve problems for inputs that so far are deemed practically intractable. With the computational power of quantum computers and the proliferation of quantum development kits, quantum computing is anticipated to become mainstream, and the demand for a skilled workforce in quantum computing is expected to increase significantly. Therefore, quantum computing education is ramping up. This article describes our experiences in designing and delivering quantum computing workshops for youth (Grades 9-12). We introduce students to the world of quantum computing in innovative ways, such as newly designed unplugged activities for teaching basic quantum computing concepts. We also take a programmatic approach and introduce students to the IBM Quantum Experience using Qiskit and Jupyter notebooks. Our contributions are as follows. First, we present creative ways to teach quantum computing to youth with little or no experience in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics areas; second, we discuss diversity and highlight various pathways into quantum computing from quantum software to quantum hardware; and third, we discuss the design and delivery of online and in-person motivational, introductory, and advanced workshops for youth.

TI Improving quantum state transfer: correcting non-Markovian and
   distortion effects
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Quantum state transfer is a key operation for quantum information processing. The original pitch-and-catch protocols rely on flying qubits or single photons with engineered wavepacket shapes to achieve a deterministic, fast and high-fidelity transfer. Yet, these protocols overlook two important factors, namely, the distortion of the wavepacket during the propagation and non-Markovian effects during the emission and reabsorption processes due to time-dependent controls. Here we address both difficulties in a general quantum-optical model and propose a correction strategy to improve quantum state transfer protocols. Including non-Markovian effects in our theoretical description, we show how to derive control pulses that imprint phases on the wavepacket that compensate the distortion caused by propagation. Our theoretical results are supported by detailed numerical simulations showing that a suitable correction strategy can improve state transfer fidelities up to three orders of magnitude.

TI Deterministic preparation of hybrid GHZ entangled states with a
   superconducting qubit and multiple photonic qubits
SO CHINESE OPTICS LETTERS
AB Hybrid entangled states are essential quantum resources not only for hybrid quantum communication but also for creating robust hybrid quantum networks and processors. By considering a circuit-cavity quantum electrodynamics (QED) system composed of a superconducting (SC) qutrit (a three-level quantum system) and n microwave cavities, we here present a method to prepare hybrid Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) entangled states of n+1 qubits. The use of a single SC qutrit as the coupler leads to a significant saving in circuit hardware resources. The GHZ state preparation is deterministic without measurement. The operation time for the GHZ state preparation is independent of the number of qubits. Decoherence from the highest energy level of the SC qutrit is suppressed because this level remains unoccupied during the GHZ state preparation. Our numerical simulations demonstrate that the high-fidelity generation of hybrid GHZ states of an SC qubit and three photonic qubits is achievable within current circuit-QED technology. The proposed scheme possesses universality and is suitable for preparing hybrid GHZ states of a matter qubit (e.g., atomic qubit, trapped ion, quantum dot, magnon, NV center, and SC qubit with various types) and multiple photonic qubits across a wide range of physical systems.

TI Characterizing the Reproducibility of Noisy Quantum Circuits
SO ENTROPY
AB The ability of a quantum computer to reproduce or replicate the results of a quantum circuit is a key concern for verifying and validating applications of quantum computing. Statistical variations in circuit outcomes that arise from ill-characterized fluctuations in device noise may lead to computational errors and irreproducible results. While device characterization offers a direct assessment of noise, an outstanding concern is how such metrics bound the reproducibility of a given quantum circuit. Here, we first directly assess the reproducibility of a noisy quantum circuit, in terms of the Hellinger distance between the computational results, and then we show that device characterization offers an analytic bound on the observed variability. We validate the method using an ensemble of single qubit test circuits, executed on a superconducting transmon processor with well-characterized readout and gate error rates. The resulting description for circuit reproducibility, in terms of a composite device parameter, is confirmed to define an upper bound on the observed Hellinger distance, across the variable test circuits. This predictive correlation between circuit outcomes and device characterization offers an efficient method for assessing the reproducibility of noisy quantum circuits.

TI Synthesis of energy-conserving quantum circuits with XY
   interaction
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB We study quantum circuits constructed from root iSWAP gates and, more generally, from the entangling gates that can be realized with the XX + YY interaction alone. Such gates preserve the Hamming weight of states in the computational basis, which means they respect the global U(1) symmetry corresponding to rotations around the z axis. Equivalently, assuming that the intrinsic Hamiltonian of each qubit in the system is the Pauli Z operator, they conserve the total energy of the system. We develop efficient methods for synthesizing circuits realizing any desired energy-conserving unitary using XX + YY interaction with or without single-qubit rotations around the z axis. Interestingly, implementing generic energy-conserving unitaries, such as CCZ and Fredkin gates, with two-local energy-conserving gates requires the use of ancilla qubits. When single-qubit rotations around the z-axis are permitted, our scheme requires only a single ancilla qubit, whereas with the XX+YY interaction alone, it requires two ancilla qubits. In addition to exact realizations, we also consider approximate realizations and show how a general energy-conserving unitary can be synthesized using only a sequence of root iSWAP gates and two ancillary qubits, with arbitrarily small error, which can be bounded via the Solovay-Kitaev theorem. Our methods are also applicable for synthesizing energy-conserving unitaries when, rather than the XX + YY interaction, one has access to any other energy-conserving two-body interaction that is not diagonal in the computational basis, such as the Heisenberg exchange interaction. We briefly discuss the applications of these circuits in the context of quantum computing, quantum thermodynamics, and quantum clocks.

TI Quantum annealing for nearest neighbour compliance problem
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Quantum Computing has emerged as a promising alternative, utilising quantum mechanics for faster computations. This paper explores the nearest neighbour compliance (NNC) Problem in Gate-based Quantum Computers, where quantum gates are constrained to operate on physically adjacent qubits. The NNC problem aims to optimise the insertion of SWAP-gates to ensure compliance with these constraints while minimising their count. This work introduces Quantum Annealing to tackle the NNC problem, proposing two Quadratic Unconstrained Optimisation Problem formulations. The formulations are tested on a contemporary Quantum Annealer, and their performance is compared with previous methods. It shows that the prospect of using Quantum Annealing is promising, however, the current state of the hardware makes that finding the embedding is the limiting factor.

TI Efficient Entanglement Swapping in Quantum Networks for Multi-User
   Scenarios
SO ENTROPY
AB Entanglement swapping is a crucial step in quantum communication, generating long-distance entanglements between quantum users for quantum network applications, such as distributed quantum computing. This study focuses on the efficiency of entanglement swapping strategies in quantum networks, particularly in multi-user concurrent quantum communication. Since multi-user concurrent quantum communication consists of multiple point-to-point quantum communications, we first analyze the challenges faced by existing entanglement swapping strategies in this scenario and then propose Parallel Segment Entanglement Swapping (PSES) to address them. PSES utilizes a tree-like model to divide the path into segments and execute entanglement swapping in parallel across them, thereby enhancing the generation rate of long-distance entanglement. Furthermore, we analyze the impact of resource contention on entanglement swapping in multi-user concurrent quantum communication and propose Multi-user PSES (M-PSES) to alleviate this negative impact. M-PSES leverages the entanglement swapping trigger signal and resource locking mechanisms to mitigate resource contention. The simulation results show that PSES performs superiorly to existing entanglement swapping strategies in point-to-point quantum communication, and M-PSES can achieve better performance than PSES in multi-user concurrent quantum communication.

TI Approximate symmetries and quantum error correction
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Quantum error correction (QEC) is a key concept in quantum computation as well as many areas of physics. There are fundamental tensions between continuous symmetries and QEC. One vital situation is unfolded by the Eastin-Knill theorem, which forbids the existence of QEC codes that admit transversal continuous symmetry actions (transformations). Here, we systematically study the competition between continuous symmetries and QEC in a quantitative manner. We first define a series of meaningful measures of approximate symmetries motivated from different perspectives, and then establish a series of trade-off bounds between them and QEC accuracy utilizing multiple different methods. Remarkably, the results allow us to derive general quantitative limitations of transversally implementable logical gates, an important topic in fault-tolerant quantum computation. As concrete examples, we showcase two explicit types of quantum codes, obtained from quantum Reed-Muller codes and thermodynamic codes, respectively, that nearly saturate our bounds. Finally, we discuss several potential applications of our results in physics.

TI Fock state-enhanced expressivity of quantum machine learning models
SO EPJ QUANTUM TECHNOLOGY
AB The data-embedding process is one of the bottlenecks of quantum machine learning, potentially negating any quantum speedups. In light of this, more effective data-encoding strategies are necessary. We propose a photonic-based bosonic data-encoding scheme that embeds classical data points using fewer encoding layers and circumventing the need for nonlinear optical components by mapping the data points into the high-dimensional Fock space. The expressive power of the circuit can be controlled via the number of input photons. Our work sheds some light on the unique advantages offered by quantum photonics on the expressive power of quantum machine learning models. By leveraging the photon-number dependent expressive power, we propose three different noisy intermediate-scale quantum-compatible binary classification methods with different scaling of required resources suitable for different supervised classification tasks.

TI Deterministic and Universal Quantum Squeezing Gate with a
   Teleportation-Like Protocol
SO LASER & PHOTONICS REVIEWS
AB Squeezing transformation as an essential component of quantum information processing, gives rise to the possibility to perform various tasks such as distributed quantum computation and the quantum-logic gate. However, the reported squeezing gate with best performance so far is realized with low success probability, while the performance of the deterministic ones is currently circumscribed by the limited squeezing degree of the nonclassical ancilla. To address this issue, a new scheme of deterministic and universal quantum squeezing gate with the property of nonlocal operation owing to the teleportation-like protocol is developed and demonstrated. A high-fidelity squeezing operation, even when the level of target squeezing being up to 10 dB, is demonstrated where a squeezed state with nonclassical noise reduction of 6.5 dB is directly observed. Moreover, a high-fidelity complex operation including a Fourier transformation and a phase squeezing gate are performed, exploring the potential of implementing the complex task of quantum information processing with the presented functional unit. The method can be applied to distributed quantum processor, the creation of exotic nonclassical states, and quantum error correction.

AB Quantum computing has recently emerged as a promising computing paradigm for many application domains. However, the size of quantum circuits that can be run with high fidelity is constrained by the limited quantity and quality of physical qubits. Recently proposed schemes, such as wire cutting and qubit reuse, mitigate the problem but produce sub-optimal results as they address the problem individually. In addition, gate cutting, an alternative circuit-cutting strategy that is suitable for circuits computing expectation values, has not been fully explored in the field.
   In this paper, we propose QRCC, an integrated approach that exploits qubit reuse and circuit-cutting (including wire cutting and gate cutting) to run large circuits on small quantum computers. Circuit-cutting techniques introduce non-negligible post-processing overhead, which increases exponentially with the number of cuts. QRCC exploits qubit reuse to find better cutting solutions to minimize the cut numbers and thus the post-processing overhead. Our evaluation results show that on average we reduce the number of cuts by 29% and additional reduction when considering gate cuts.

TI Enhancing Generative Models via Quantum Correlations
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW X
AB Generative modeling using samples drawn from the probability distribution constitutes a powerful approach for unsupervised machine learning. Quantum mechanical systems can produce probability distributions that exhibit quantum correlations which are difficult to capture using classical models. We show theoretically that such quantum-inspired correlations provide a powerful resource for generative modeling. In particular, we provide an unconditional proof of separation in expressive power between a class of widely used generative models, known as Bayesian networks, and its minimal quantum-inspired extension. We show that this expressivity enhancement is associated with quantum nonlocality and quantum contextuality. Furthermore, we numerically test this separation on standard machine-learning data sets and show that it holds for practical problems. The possibility of quantum-inspired enhancement demonstrated in this work not only sheds light on the design of useful quantum machine-learning protocols but also provides inspiration to draw on ideas from quantum foundations to improve purely classical algorithms.

TI Entropic Proofs of Singleton Bounds for Quantum Error-Correcting Codes
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION THEORY
AB We show that a relatively simple reasoning using von Neumann entropy inequalities yields a robust proof of the quantum Singleton bound for quantum error-correcting codes (QECC). For entanglement-assisted quantum error-correcting codes (EAQECC) and catalytic codes (CQECC), a type of generalized quantum Singleton bound [Brun et al., IEEE Trans. Inf. Theory 60(6):3073-3089 (2014)] was believed to hold for many years until recently one of us found a counterexample [MG, Phys. Rev. A 103, 020601 (2021)]. Here, we rectify this state of affairs by proving the correct generalized quantum Singleton bound, extending the above-mentioned proof method for QECC; we also prove information-theoretically tight bounds on the entanglement-communication tradeoff for EAQECC. All of the bounds relate block length n and code length k for given minimum distance d and we show that they are robust, in the sense that they hold with small perturbations for codes which only correct most of the erasure errors of less than d letters. In contrast to the classical case, the bounds take on qualitatively different forms depending on whether the minimum distance is smaller or larger than half the block length. We also provide a propagation rule: any pure QECC yields an EAQECC with the same distance and dimension, but of shorter block length.

TI A quantum state readout method based on a single ancilla qubit
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB Quantum state measurement is essential for reading-out a quantum computing outcome. Meanwhile, the readout results are always affected by the large noise of quantum measurements in physical implementation, which also hinders the large-scale expansion of quantum computing. In light of this, we present an indirect quantum state readout method based on a single ancilla qubit that can avoid the large noise of multiple-qubit measurements. The theoretical analysis and simulations indicate that our method is more robust against the measurement noise and promises to become a method of large-scale quantum error correction and high-fidelity quantum state readout.

TI Extending the coherence of spin defects in hBN enables advanced qubit
   control and quantum sensing
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Negatively-charged boron vacancy centers (V-B(-)) in hexagonal Boron Nitride (hBN) are attracting increasing interest since they represent optically-addressable qubits in a van der Waals material. In particular, these spin defects have shown promise as sensors for temperature, pressure, and static magnetic fields. However, their short spin coherence time limits their scope for quantum technology. Here, we apply dynamical decoupling techniques to suppress magnetic noise and extend the spin coherence time by two orders of magni-tude, approaching the fundamental T-1 relaxation limit. Based on this improvement, we demonstrate advanced spin control and a set of quantum sensing protocols to detect radiofrequency signals with sub-Hz resolution. The corresponding sensitivity is benchmarked against that of state-of-the-art NV-diamond quantum sensors. This work lays the foundation for nanoscale sensing using spin defects in an exfoliable material and opens a promising path to quantum sensors and quantum networks integrated into ultra-thin structures.

TI Unitary mechanical metamaterials with embedded one-qubit logic
SO EXTREME MECHANICS LETTERS
AB A class of lattice metamaterials characterized by a transfer matrix that updates polarization of a static sinusoidal displacement wave along a material coordinate in accordance with a unitary transformation is conceptualized. Specific material designs are discussed where the unitary transfer matrix takes the forms of the commonly used one-qubit quantum gates, such as the Pauli-X, Hadamard and others, depending on the unit cell geometry. Also, polarization parameters of the displacement wave are shown to form a Pauli spinor, a two-component complex vector representing the qubit state. Unitary metamaterials can be realized in practice as certain planar structures, or 3D lattices in a state of deformation similar to the continuum plain strain. Their potential application in human-scale mechanical platforms for simulating the quantum computation logic is discussed.

TI Quantum reinforcement learning Comparing quantum annealing and
   gate-based quantum computing with classical deep reinforcement learning
SO QUANTUM INFORMATION PROCESSING
AB In this paper, we present implementations of an annealing-based and a gate-based quantum computing approach for finding the optimal policy to traverse a grid and compare them to a classical deep reinforcement learning approach. We extended these three approaches by allowing for stochastic actions instead of deterministic actions and by introducing a new learning technique called curriculum learning. With curriculum learning, we gradually increase the complexity of the environment and we find that it has a positive effect on the expected reward of a traversal. We see that the number of training steps needed for the two quantum approaches is lower than that needed for the classical approach.

TI Experimental demonstration of entanglement delivery using a quantum
   network stack
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Scaling current quantum communication demonstrations to a large-scale quantum network will require not only advancements in quantum hardware capabilities, but also robust control of such devices to bridge the gap in user demand. Moreover, the abstraction of tasks and services offered by the quantum network should enable platform-independent applications to be executed without the knowledge of the underlying physical implementation. Here we experimentally demonstrate, using remote solid-state quantum network nodes, a link layer, and a physical layer protocol for entanglement-based quantum networks. The link layer abstracts the physical-layer entanglement attempts into a robust, platform-independent entanglement delivery service. The system is used to run full state tomography of the delivered entangled states, as well as preparation of a remote qubit state on a server by its client. Our results mark a clear transition from physics experiments to quantum communication systems, which will enable the development and testing of components of future quantum networks.

TI Deployed measurement-device independent quantum key distribution and
   Bell-state measurements coexisting with standard internet data and
   networking equipment
SO COMMUNICATIONS PHYSICS
AB The forthcoming quantum Internet is poised to allow new applications not possible with the conventional Internet. The ability for both quantum and conventional networking equipment to coexist on the same fiber network would facilitate the deployment and adoption of coming quantum technology. Most quantum networking tasks, like quantum repeaters and the connection of quantum processors, require nodes for multi-qubit quantum measurements (often Bell-State measurements), and their real-world coexistence with the conventional Internet has yet to be shown. Here we field deploy a Measurement-Device Independent Quantum Key Distribution (MDI-QKD) system, containing a Bell-State measurement node, over the same fiber connection as multiple standard Internet Protocol (IP) data networks, between three nearby cities in the Netherlands. We demonstrate over 10 Gb/s classical data communication rates simultaneously with our next-generation QKD system, and estimate 200 GB/s of classical data transmission would be easily achievable without significantly affecting QKD performance. Moreover, as the system ran autonomously for two weeks, this shows an important step towards the coexistence and integration of quantum networking into the existing telecommunication infrastructure.
   Quantum key distribution (QKD) for information-theoretic secure distribution of cryptographic keys is one of the best known applications that will be enabled by the Quantum Internet. Here, the authors deploy the protocol of measurement-device-independent quantum key distribution into a realistic network environment, testing its field performances and showing the co-existing of this QKD protocol and the classical network infrastructure.

It seems to us that the only question is that quantum computers will be introduced in the next decade or in some years later. Anyhow, we should prepare to teach a radically new paradigm, the quantum algorithms, in informatics. Quantum algorithm can be demonstrated with quantum simulators. The present paper shows an educational material, which facilitates the teaching of this new field. Besides summarising the basic concepts and methods of quantum informatics, the working of a quantum algorithm on a quantum simulator will be also illustrated with the discussion of an exciting quantum physical phenomenon (the teleportation).

AB The integration of qubits with long coherence times and functional quantum devices on a single chip, and thus the realization of an allsolid-state quantum computing chip, is an important goal in current experimental research on quantum information processing. Among various quantum platforms, a series of significant progresses have been made in photonic quantum chips and superconducting quantum chips, while both the number of qubits and the complexity of quantum circuits have been increasing. Although these two chip platforms have respective unique advantages and potentials, their shortcomings have been gradually revealed and need to be solved. By introducing phonon-integrated devices, it is possible to combine all unsuspended cally on the same chip to achieve coherent coupling among them. Here, we provide a prospect and a short review on the integrated photonic, superconducting, and hybrid quantum chips for quantum information processing.

TI Improving transmon qudit measurement on IBM Quantum hardware
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB The Hilbert space of a physical qubit typically features more than two energy levels. Using states outside the qubit subspace can provide advantages in quantum computation. To benefit from these advantages, individual states of the d-dimensional qudit Hilbert space have to be discriminated during readout. We propose and analyze two measurement strategies that improve the distinguishability of transmon qudit states. Based on a model describing the readout of a transmon qudit coupled to a resonator, we identify the regime in hardware parameter space where each strategy is optimal. We discuss these strategies in the context of a practical implementation of the default measurement of a ququart on IBM Quantum hardware whose states are prepared by employing higher-order X gates that make use of two-photon transitions.

TI Quantum Computer Simulation of Molecules in Optical Cavity
SO PRECISION CHEMISTRY
AB Various phenomena have been observed in molecule-cavity coupled systems, which are believed to hold potential for applications in transistors, lasers, and computational units, among others. However, theoretical methods for simulating molecules in optical cavities still require further development due to the complex couplings between electrons, phonons, and photons within the cavity. In this study, motivated by recent advances in quantum algorithms and quantum computing hardware, we propose a quantum computing algorithm tailored for molecules in optical cavities. Our method, based on a variational quantum algorithm and variational boson encoders, has its effectiveness validated on both quantum simulators and hardware. For aggregates within the cavity, described by the Holstein-Tavis-Cummings model, our approach demonstrates clear advantages over other quantum and classical methods, as proved by numerical benchmarks. Additionally, we apply this method to study the H2 molecule in a cavity using a superconducting quantum computer and the Pauli-Fierz model. To enhance accuracy, we incorporate error mitigation techniques, such as readout and reference-state error mitigation, resulting in an 86% reduction in the average error.

The cell is designed to be filled with atomic vapour and used as a component in photonic quantum technologies, with applications in quantum memory and optical switching. We achieve a total insertion loss of 0.6(2) dB at 780 nm wavelength via graded index fibre to ensure efficient mode matching coupled with anti-reflection coatings to minimise loss at the SMF-HCF interfaces. We also present numerical modelling of these interfaces, which can be undertaken efficiently without the need for finite element simulation. We encapsulate the HCF core by coupling to the SMF inside a support capillary, enhancing durability and facilitating seamless integration into existing fibre platforms.

TI A generalized reconstruction model in circuit cutting and
   nonlocal-gate-based distributed quantum computation
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB In the current noisy intermediate-scale quantum era, the limited number of high-fidelity qubits and restricted circuit depth pose significant challenges for large-scale quantum computation. Fortunately, distributed quantum computing (DQC) provides a feasible solution by dividing large quantum circuits into smaller subcircuits that can be executed on existing quantum processors. In this work, we propose a generalized model of circuit reconstruction (GMCR), which is capable of handling complex cutting patterns such as U-type structures to recover the output of the original circuit from the subcircuit results. In addition to the number of nonlocal gates and execution rounds, we introduce a new objective function in multi-objective simulated annealing (MOSA)-based cutting algorithm, the number of required SWAP operations in the subsequent mapping from logical qubits to physical qubits, which is used to satisfy the hardware connectivity constraints and to further decrease the complexity of quantum circuit compiling. We verified the GMCR model by cutting five circuits: encoding circuit for the Steane 7-qubit code, circuit of Shor's algorithm, quantum supremacy circuit, quantum circuit of Bernstein-Vazirani algorithm, and circuit of approximate quantum Fourier transform. In the case of the Steane 7-qubit code, the number of reconstruction rounds was reduced from 337 to 156 under a fixed nonlocal gate count of two, while the number of SWAP operations was also reduced from 10 to 7 compared with the earlier MOSA-based algorithm. For the U-type subcircuits, using the GMCR model, the original results can be obtained, but cannot be obtained by the dynamic definition, approximate reconstruction algorithm, and fast reconstruction algorithm. This work plays an important role in implementing large-scale DQC, a typical application of future quantum Internet.

TI Ultrafast quantum key distribution using fully parallelized quantum
   channels
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB The field of quantum information processing offers secure communication protected by the laws of quantum mechanics and is on the verge of finding wider application for the information transfer of sensitive data. To improve cost-efficiency, extensive research is being carried out on the various components required for high data throughput using quantum key distribution (QKD). Aiming for an application-oriented solution, we report the realization of a multichannel QKD system for plug-and-play high-bandwidth secure communication at telecom wavelengths. We designed a rack-sized multichannel superconducting nanowire single photon detector (SNSPD) system, as well as a highly parallelized time-correlated single photon counting (TCSPC) unit. Our system is linked to an FPGA-controlled QKD evaluation setup for continuous operation, allowing us to achieve high secret key rates using a coherent-one-way protocol.

TI One decade of quantum optimal control in the chopped random basis
SO REPORTS ON PROGRESS IN PHYSICS
AB The chopped random basis (CRAB) ansatz for quantum optimal control has been proven to be a versatile tool to enable quantum technology applications such as quantum computing, quantum simulation, quantum sensing, and quantum communication. Its capability to encompass experimental constraints-while maintaining an access to the usually trap-free control landscape-and to switch from open-loop to closed-loop optimization (including with remote access-or RedCRAB) is contributing to the development of quantum technology on many different physical platforms. In this review article we present the development, the theoretical basis and the toolbox for this optimization algorithm, as well as an overview of the broad range of different theoretical and experimental applications that exploit this powerful technique.

TI A fiber array architecture for atom quantum computing
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Arrays of single atoms trapped in optical tweezers are increasingly recognized as a promising platform for scalable quantum computing. In both the fault-tolerant and NISQ eras, the ability to individually control qubits is essential for the efficient execution of quantum circuits. Time-division multiplexed control schemes based on atom shuttling or beam scanning have been employed to build programmable neutral atom quantum processors, but achieving high-rate, highly parallel gate operations remains a challenge. Here, we propose a fiber array architecture for atom quantum computing capable of fully independent control of individual atoms. The trapping and addressing lasers for each individual atom are emitted from the same optical waveguide, enabling robust control through common-mode suppression of beam pointing noise. Using a fiber array, we experimentally demonstrate the trapping and independent control of ten single atoms in two-dimensional optical tweezers, achieving individually addressed single-qubit gates with an average fidelity of 0.9966(3). More significantly, we perform simultaneous arbitrary single-qubit gates on four randomly selected qubits, resulting in an average fidelity of 0.9961(4). Our work paves the way for time-efficient execution of quantum algorithms on neutral atom quantum computers.

TI Quantum gates for Majoranas zero modes in topological superconductors in
   one-dimensional geometry
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB We propose and analyze a physical system capable of performing topological quantum computation with Majorana zero modes (MZMs) in a one-dimensional topological superconductor (1DTS). One of the leading methods to realize quantum gates in a 1DTS is to use T junctions, which allows one to maneuver MZMs in such a manner as to achieve braiding. In this paper, we propose a scheme for implementing quantum logical gates in a purely one-dimensional geometry without T junctions, instead replacing it with an auxiliary qubit. This has the additional benefit of introducing a non-Clifford gate, corresponding to one- and two-logical-qubit Z rotations. We first design a topologically protected logical Z gate based entirely on local interactions within the 1DTS. Using an auxiliary qubit coupled to the topological superconductors, we extend the Z gate to non-Clifford single- and multiqubit arbitrary rotations with partial topological protection. Finally, to perform universal quantum computing, we introduce a scheme for performing arbitrary unitary rotations, albeit without topological protection. We develop a formalism based on unitary braids which creates transitions between different topological phases of the 1DTS system. The unitary formalism can be simply converted to an equivalent adiabatic scheme, which we numerically simulate, and we show that high-fidelity operations should be possible with reasonable parameters.

TI Slowing down light in a qubit metamaterial
SO APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS
AB The rapid progress in quantum information processing leads to a rising demand for devices to control the propagation of electromagnetic wave pulses and to ultimately realize universal and efficient quantum memory. While in recent years, significant progress has been made to realize slow light and quantum memories with atoms at optical frequencies, superconducting circuits in the microwave domain still lack such devices. Here, we demonstrate slowing down electromagnetic waves in a superconducting metamaterial composed of eight qubits coupled to a common waveguide, forming a waveguide quantum electrodynamics system. We analyze two complementary approaches, one relying on dressed states of the Autler-Townes splitting and the other based on a tailored dispersion profile using the qubits tunability. Our time-resolved experiments show reduced group velocities of down to a factor of about 1500 smaller than in vacuum. Depending on the method used, the speed of light can be controlled with an additional microwave tone or an effective qubit detuning. Our findings demonstrate high flexibility of superconducting circuits to realize custom band structures and open the door to microwave dispersion engineering in the quantum regime.

TI Quantum computer formulation of the FKP-operator eigenvalue problem for
   probabilistic learning on manifolds
SO COMPUTER METHODS IN APPLIED MECHANICS AND ENGINEERING
AB We present a quantum computing formulation to address a challenging problem in the development of probabilistic learning on manifolds (PLoM). It involves solving the spectral problem of the high-dimensional Fokker-Planck (FKP) operator, which remains beyond the reach of classical computing. Our ultimate goal is to develop an efficient approach for practical computations on quantum computers. For now, we focus on an adapted formulation tailored to quantum computing. The methodological aspects covered in this work include the construction of the FKP equation, where the invariant probability measure is derived from a training dataset, and the formulation of the eigenvalue problem for the FKP operator. The eigen equation is transformed into a Schr & ouml;dinger equation with a potential V, a non-algebraic function that is neither simple nor a polynomial representation. To address this, we propose a methodology for constructing a multivariate polynomial approximation of V, leveraging polynomial chaos expansion within the Gaussian Sobolev space. This approach preserves the algebraic properties of the potential and adapts it for quantum algorithms. The quantum computing formulation employs a finite basis representation, incorporating second quantization with creation and annihilation operators. Explicit formulas for the Laplacian and potential are derived and mapped onto qubits using Pauli matrix expressions. Additionally, we outline the design of quantum circuits and the implementation of measurements to construct and observe specific quantum states. Information is extracted through quantum measurements, with eigenstates constructed and overlap measurements evaluated using universal quantum gates.

TI Simulating Nonlinear Radiation Diffusion Through Quantum Computing
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF THEORETICAL PHYSICS
AB The recent success of the fusion ignition experiment at Lawrence-Livermore National Laboratory has renewed excitement for inertial confinement fusion. Designing such experiments relies on computational modeling using radiation hydrodynamic codes run on massively parallel supercomputers which simulate hydrodynamic flows, radiation diffusion, and thermonuclear burn. Constructing a quantum algorithm for radiation hydrodynamics that provides a quantum speedup is of great interest. A recent quantum algorithm that solves the Navier-Stokes equations of hydrodynamics with a quadratic speedup marks a first step towards this goal. Here we take the next step and present a quantum algorithm for nonlinear radiation diffusion that also has a quadratic speedup. To verify the algorithm we consider radiation striking a cold, optically thick target that generates a Marshak wave in the target. Results of numerical simulation of the quantum algorithm are compared with those of a standard partial differential equation solver and excellent agreement is found.

TI Q-Pandora Unboxed: Characterizing Resilience of Quantum Error Correction
   Codes Under Biased Noise
SO APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
AB Quantum error correction codes (QECCs) are essential for reliable quantum computing as they protect quantum states against noise and errors. Limited research has explored the resilience of QECCs to biased noise, critical for selecting optimal codes. We examine how different noise types impact QECCs, considering the varying susceptibility of quantum systems to specific errors. Our goal is to identify opportunities to minimize the resources-or overhead-needed for effective error correction. We conduct a detailed study on two QECCs-rotated and unrotated surface codes-under various noise models using simulations. Rotated surface codes generally perform better due to their simplicity and lower qubit overhead. They exceed the noise threshold of current quantum processors, making them more effective at lower error rates. This study highlights a hierarchy in surface code implementation based on resource demand, consistently observed across both code types. Our analysis ranks the code-capacity model as the most pessimistic and the circuit-level model as the most realistic, mapping error thresholds that show surface code advantages. Additionally, higher code distances improve performance without excessively increasing qubit overhead. Tailoring surface codes to align with the target logical error rate and the biased physical error profile is crucial for optimizing reliability and resource use.

AB Designing efficient quantum processor topologies is pivotal for advancing scalable quantum computing architectures. The communication overhead, a critical factor affecting the execution fidelity of quantum circuits, arises from inevitable qubit routing that brings interacting qubits into physical proximity by the means of serial SWAP gates to enable the direct two-qubit gate application. Characterizing the qubit movement across the processor is crucial for tailoring techniques for minimizing the SWAP gates. This work presents a comparative analysis of the resulting communication overhead among three processor topologies: star, heavy-hexagon lattice, and square lattice topologies, according to performance metrics of communication to -computation ratio, mean qubit hotspotness, and temporal burstiness, showcasing that the square lattice layout is favourable for quantum computer architectures at a scale.

TI iSOMA swarm intelligence algorithm in synthesis of quantum computing
   circuits
SO APPLIED SOFT COMPUTING
AB In the present paper, we demonstrate the possibilities of designing quantum computing circuits using a specific swarm intelligence algorithm - iSOMA in the form of three experiments. All simulations are based on a simple sample of a quantum computing circuit from the Qiskit environment, which was used as a comparison circuit with the results of the three experiments already mentioned. In the first experiment, we try to find an arbitrary functional solution using iSOMA with minimal constraints on this circuit's design. It can be said that in this experiment, iSOMA showed the highest degree of "creativity". In the second experiment, we focused on whether iSOMA can be used to find a circuit identical to the one designed by a human or equivalent with the positions of the measurement gates fixed. In the last experiment, we highlight iSOMA's ability to avoid unnecessary qubit usage by adding redundant qubits to a possible circuit and fixing the measurement gates to the last two qubits in the scheme. In all three experiments, we see that iSOMA can find efficient functional and often astonishing solutions - the proposed method applied to a classical circuit founded a new one preserving required properties while saving one ancilla (redundant, useless, non-used)1 qubit. All computations are implemented in the IBM Qiskit2 environment. Although these are relatively simple experiments, the results show that evolutionary algorithms can successfully design more complex quantum circuits.

TI Classification of quantum correlations via quantum-inspired machine
   learning
SO QUANTUM MACHINE INTELLIGENCE
AB Quantum information theory, and in particular, the theory of quantum state discrimination, has enabled the development of a supervised multi-class classification algorithm. Inspired by the Pretty Good Measurement (PGM), a quantum-inspired classifier named the PGM Classifier has been designed, capable of classifying among multiple classes without resorting to the One versus One or One versus Rest strategy. In the recent past, several approaches of quantum machine learning have been introduced to classify entangled and separable states. In this article, we apply the PGM Classifier to discriminate among factorized states, separable states, and entangled states. We analyze from the simplest case (2 qubits) up to a system of (5 qubits) and offer a comparison between our quantum-inspired classifier and other classical classifiers. Finally, we propose a refined classification of non-locality based on the violation of the Mermin and Svetlichny inequalities.

In most QEC codes(2-8), a logical qubit is encoded in some discrete variables, for example photon numbers, so that the encoded quantum information can be unambiguously extracted after processing. Over the past decade, repetitive QEC has been demonstrated with various discrete-variable-encoded scenarios(9-17). However, extending the lifetimes of thus-encoded logical qubits beyond the best available physical qubit still remains elusive, which represents a break-even point for judging the practical usefulness of QEC. Here we demonstrate a QEC procedure in a circuit quantum electrodynamics architecture(18), where the logical qubit is binomially encoded in photon-number states of a microwave cavity(8), dispersively coupled to an auxiliary superconducting qubit. By applying a pulse featuring a tailored frequency comb to the auxiliary qubit, we can repetitively extract the error syndrome with high fidelity and perform error correction with feedback control accordingly, thereby exceeding the break-even point by about 16% lifetime enhancement. Our work illustrates the potential of hardware-efficient discrete-variable encodings for fault-tolerant quantum computation(19).

AB Quantum annealing (QA) and Quantum Alternating Operator Ansatz (QAOA) are both heuristic quantum algorithms intended for sampling optimal solutions of combinatorial optimization problems. In this article we implement a rigorous direct comparison between QA on D-Wave hardware and QAOA on IBMQ hardware. These two quantum algorithms are also compared against classical simulated annealing. The studied problems are instances of a class of Ising models, with variable assignments of +1 or -1, that contain cubic ZZZ interactions (higher order terms) and match both the native connectivity of the Pegasus topology D-Wave chips and the heavy hexagonal lattice of the IBMQ chips. The novel QAOA implementation on the heavy hexagonal lattice has a CNOT depth of 6 per round and allows for usage of an entire heavy hexagonal lattice. Experimentally, QAOA is executed on an ensemble of randomly generated Ising instances with a grid search over 1 and 2 round angles using all 127 programmable superconducting transmon qubits of ibm washington. The error suppression technique digital dynamical decoupling is also tested on all QAOA circuits. QA is executed on the same Ising instances with the programmable superconducting flux qubit devices D-Wave Advantage system4.1 and Advantage system6.1 using modified annealing schedules with pauses. We find that QA outperforms QAOA on all problem instances. We also find that dynamical decoupling enables 2-round QAOA to marginally outperform 1-round QAOA, which is not the case without dynamical decoupling.

TI Logical Operations with a Dynamical Qubit in Floquet-Bacon-Shor Code
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Quantum error correction (QEC) protects quantum systems against inevitable noises and control inaccuracies, providing a pathway toward fault-tolerant (FT) quantum computation. Stabilizer codes, including surface code and color code, have long been the focus of research and have seen significant experimental progress in recent years. Recently proposed time-dynamical QEC, including Floquet codes and generalized time-dynamical code implementations, opens up new opportunities for FT quantum computation. By employing a periodic schedule of low-weight parity checks, Floquet codes can generate additional dynamical logical qubits, offering enhanced error correction capabilities and, potentially, higher code performance. Here, we experimentally implement the Floquet-Bacon-Shor code on a superconducting quantum processor. We encode a dynamical logical qubit within a 3 x 3 lattice of data qubits alongside a conventional static logical qubit. We demonstrate FT encoding and measurement of the two-qubit logical states and stabilize these states using repeated error detection. We showcase universal single-qubit logical gates on the dynamical qubit. Furthermore, by implementing a logical controlled-NOT (CNOT) gate, we entangle the dynamical and static logical qubits, generating an error-detected logical Bell state with a fidelity of 75.9%. Our results highlight the potential of Floquet codes for resource-efficient FT quantum computation.

TI Quantum Error Correction with Metastable States of Trapped Ions Using
   Erasure Conversion
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Erasures, or errors with known locations, are a more favorable type of error for quantum error-correcting codes than Pauli errors. Converting physical noise into erasures can significantly improve the performance of quantum error correction. Here, we apply the idea of performing erasure conversion by encoding qubits into metastable atomic states, proposed by Wu, Kolkowitz, Puri, and Thompson [Nat. Comm. 13, 4657 (2022)], to trapped ions. We suggest an erasure-conversion scheme for metastable trapped-ion qubits and develop a detailed model of various types of errors. We then compare the logical performance of ground and metastable qubits on the surface code under various physical constraints and conclude that metastable qubits may outperform ground qubits when the achievable laser power is higher for metastable qubits.

TI Improving Quantum Computation by Optimized Qubit Routing
SO JOURNAL OF OPTIMIZATION THEORY AND APPLICATIONS
AB In this work we propose a high-quality decomposition approach for qubit routing by swap insertion. This optimization problem arises in the context of compiling quantum algorithms formulated in the circuit model of computation onto specific quantum hardware. Our approach decomposes the routing problem into an allocation subproblem and a set of token swapping problems. This allows us to tackle the allocation part and the token swapping part separately. Extracting the allocation part from the qubit routing model of Nannicini et al. (Optimal qubit assignment and routing via integer programming, 2021, ), we formulate the allocation subproblem as a binary linear program. Herein, we employ a cost function that is a lower bound on the overall routing problem objective. We strengthen the linear relaxation by novel valid inequalities. For the token swapping part we develop an exact branch-and-bound algorithm. In this context, we improve upon known lower bounds on the token swapping problem. Furthermore, we enhance an existing approximation algorithm which runs much faster than the exact approach and typically is able to determine solutions close to the optimum. We present numerical results for the fully integrated allocation and token swapping problem. Obtained solutions may not be globally optimal due to the decomposition and the usage of an approximation algorithm. However, the solutions are obtained fast and are typically close to optimal. In addition, there is a significant reduction in the number of artificial gates and output circuit depth when compared to various state-of-the-art heuristics. Reducing these figures is crucial for minimizing noise when running quantum algorithms on near-term hardware. As a consequence, using the novel decomposition approach leads to compiled algorithms with improved quality. Indeed, when compiled with the novel routing procedure and executed on real hardware, our experimental results for quantum approximate optimization algorithms show an significant increase in solution quality in comparison to standard routing methods.

TI 6-qubit optimal Clifford circuits
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Clifford group lies at the core of quantum computation-it underlies quantum error correction, its elements can be used to perform magic state distillation and they form randomized benchmarking protocols, Clifford group is used to study quantum entanglement, and more. The ability to utilize Clifford group elements in practice relies heavily on the efficiency of their circuit-level implementation. Finding short circuits is a hard problem; despite Clifford group being finite, its size grows quickly with the number of qubits n, limiting known optimal implementations to n = 4 qubits. For n = 6, the number of Clifford group elements is about 2.1 x 10(23). In this paper, we report a set of algorithms, along with their C++ implementation, that implicitly synthesize optimal circuits for all 6-qubit Clifford group elements by storing a subset of the latter in a database of size 2.1TB (1kB = 1024B). We demonstrate how to extract arbitrary optimal 6-qubit Clifford circuit in 0.0009358 and 0.0006274 s using consumer- and enterprise-grade computers (hardware) respectively, while relying on this database. We use this implementation to establish a new example of quantum advantage by Clifford circuits over CNOT gate circuits and find optimal Clifford 2-designs for up to 4 qubits.

TI Enhancing quantum teleportation fidelity under decoherence via weak
   measurement with flips
SO EPJ QUANTUM TECHNOLOGY
AB Noiseless quantum channels are critical to share a pure maximally entangled state for performing an ideal teleportation protocol. However, in reality the shared entanglement severely degraded due to decoherence. In this paper, we propose a quantum teleportation channel protection scheme to enhance the teleportation fidelity in presence of decoherence. Before the entangled pair enters the decoherence channel, the weak measurement and flip operations are applied to transfer the qubit to a more robust state to the effects of the noise. After the decoherence channel the reversed flip operations and weak measurement reversal are applied to recover the initial state. We illustrate our protected teleportation scheme and compare it with a protocol based on weak measurement reversal. The numerical results show that the average teleportation fidelity of our proposed scheme can be significantly improved. Although the proposed entanglement protection scheme is probabilistic, after a successful entanglement transmission, we use the standard teleportation protocol which has probability one.

TI Heralded quantum multiplexing entanglement between stationary qubits via
   distribution of high-dimensional optical entanglement
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Quantum entanglement between pairs of remote quantum memories (QMs) is a prerequisite for realizing many applications in quantum networks. Here, we present a heralded protocol for the parallel creation of quantum entanglement among multiple pairs of QMs placed in spatially separated nodes, where each QM, encoding a stationary qubit, couples to an optical cavity and deterministically interacts with single photons. Our protocol utilizes an entangled photon pair encoded in the high-dimensional time-bin degree of freedom to simultaneously entangle multiple QM pairs, and is efficient in terms of reducing the time consumption and photon loss during transmission. Furthermore, our approach can be extended to simultaneously support spatial-temporal multiplexing, as its success is heralded by the detection of single photons. These distinguishing features make our protocol particularly useful for long-distance quantum communication and large-scale quantum networks.

TI Hong-Ou-Mandel interference of single-photon-level pulses stored in
   independent room-temperature quantum memories
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Quantum repeater networks require independent absorptive quantum memories capable of storing and retrieving indistinguishable photons to perform high-repetition entanglement swapping operations. The ability to perform these coherent operations at room temperature is of prime importance for the realization of scalable quantum networks. We perform Hong-Ou-Mandel (HOM) interference between photonic polarization states and single-photon-level pulses stored and retrieved from two sets of independent room-temperature quantum memories. We show that the storage and retrieval of polarization states from quantum memories does not degrade the HOM visibility for few-photon-level polarization states in a dual-rail configuration. For single-photon-level pulses, we measure the HOM visibility with various levels of background in a single polarization, single-rail QM, and investigate its dependence on the signal-to-background ratio. We obtain an HOM visibility of 43%, compared to the 48% no-memory limit of our set-up. These results allow us to estimate a 33% visibility for polarization qubits under the same conditions. These demonstrations lay the groundwork for future applications using large-scale memory-assisted quantum networks.

TI Comparative study of quantum error correction strategies for the
   heavy-hexagonal lattice
SO QUANTUM
AB Topological quantum error correction is a milestone in the scaling roadmap of quantum computers, which targets circuits with trillions of gates that would allow running quantum algorithms for real-world problems. The square- lattice surface code has become the workhorse to address this challenge, as it poses milder requirements on current devices both in terms of required error rates and small local connectivities. In some platforms, however, the connectivities are kept even lower in order to minimise gate errors at the hardware level, which limits the error correcting codes that can be directly implemented on them. In this work, we make a comparative study of possible strategies to overcome this limitation for the heavy-hexagonal lattice, the architecture of current IBM superconducting quantum computers. We explore two complementary strategies: the search for an efficient embedding of the surface code into the heavy-hexagonal lattice, as well as the use of codes whose connectivity requirements are naturally tailored to this architecture, such as subsystem-type and Floquet codes. Using noise models of increased complexity, we assess the performance of these strategies for IBM devices in terms of their error thresholds and qubit footprints. An optimized SWAP-based embedding of the surface code is found to be the most promising strategy towards a near-term demonstration of quantum error correction advantage.

TI Variational Methods in Optical Quantum Machine Learning
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB The computing world is rapidly evolving and advancing, with new ground-breaking technologies emerging. Quantum Computing and Quantum Machine Learning have opened up new possibilities, providing unprecedented computational power and problem-solving capabilities while offering a deeper understanding of complex systems. Our research proposes new variational methods based on a deep learning system based on an optical quantum neural network applied to Machine Learning models for point classification. As a case study, we considered the binary classification of points belonging to a certain geometric pattern (the Two-Moons Classification problem) on a plane. We think it is reasonable to expect benefits from using hybrid deep learning systems (classical + quantum), not just in terms of accelerating computation but also in understanding the underlying phenomena and mechanisms. This will result in the development of new machine-learning paradigms and a significant advancement in the field of quantum computation. The selected dataset is a set of 2D points creating two interleaved semicircles and is based on a 2D binary classification generator, which aids in evaluating the performance of particular methods. The two coordinates of each unique point, x(1) and x(2), serve as the features since they present two disparate data sets in a two-dimensional representation space. The goal was to create a quantum deep neural network that could recognise and categorise points accurately with the fewest trainable parameters possible.

TI The T-Complexity Costs of Error Correction for Control Flow in
   Quantum Computation
SO PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACM ON PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES-PACMPL
CT ACM SIGPLAN Conference on Programming Languages Design and
   Implementation (PLDI)
CY JUN 24-28, 2024
CL Copenhagen, DENMARK
AB Numerous quantum algorithms require the use of quantum error correction to overcome the intrinsic unreliability of physical qubits. However, quantum error correction imposes a unique performance bottleneck, known as T-complexity, that can make an implementation of an algorithm as a quantum program run more slowly than on idealized hardware. In this work, we identify that programming abstractions for control flow, such as the quantum if-statement, can introduce polynomial increases in the T-complexity of a program. If not mitigated, this slowdown can diminish the computational advantage of a quantum algorithm.
   To enable reasoning about the costs of control flow, we present a cost model that a developer can use to accurately analyze the T-complexity of a program under quantum error correction and pinpoint the sources of slowdown. To enable the mitigation of these costs, we present a set of program-level optimizations that a developer can use to rewrite a program to reduce its T-complexity, predict the T-complexity of the optimized program using the cost model, and then compile it to an efficient circuit via a straightforward strategy.
   We implement the program-level optimizations in Spire, an extension of the Tower quantum compiler. Using a set of 11 benchmark programs that use control flow, we empirically show that the cost model is accurate, and that Spire's optimizations recover programs that are asymptotically efficient, meaning their runtime T-complexity under error correction is equal to their time complexity on idealized hardware.
   Our results show that optimizing a program before it is compiled to a circuit can yield better results than compiling the program to an inefficient circuit and then invoking a quantum circuit optimizer found in prior work. For our benchmarks, only 2 of 8 tested quantum circuit optimizers recover circuits with asymptotically efficient T-complexity. Compared to these 2 optimizers, Spire uses 54x-2400x less compile time.

TI Classical certification of quantum gates under the dimension assumption
SO QUANTUM
AB The rapid advancement of quantum hardware necessitates the development of reliable methods to certify its correct functioning. However, existing certification tests fall short, as they either suffer from systematic errors or do not guarantee that only a correctly functioning quantum device can pass the test. We introduce a certification method for quantum gates tailored for a practical server-user scenario, where a classical user tests the results of exact quantum computations performed by a quantum server. This method is free from the systematic state preparation and measurement (SPAM) errors. For single-qubit gates, including those that form a universal set for single-qubit quantum computation, we demonstrate that our approach offers soundness guarantees based solely on the dimension assumption. Additionally, for a highly-relevant phase gate which corresponds experimentally to a pi/2-pulse we prove that the method's sample complexity scales as O(epsilon-1) relative to the average gate infidelity epsilon. By combining the SPAM-error-free and sound notion of certification with practical applicability, our approach paves the way for promising research into efficient and reliable certification methods for fullscale quantum computation.

TI Towards interpretable quantum machine learning via single-photon quantum
   walks
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Variational quantum algorithms represent a promising approach to quantum machine learning where classical neural networks are replaced by parametrized quantum circuits. However, both approaches suffer from a clear limitation, that is a lack of interpretability. Here, we present a variational method to quantize projective simulation (PS), a reinforcement learning model aimed at interpretable artificial intelligence. Decision making in PS is modeled as a random walk on a graph describing the agent's memory. To implement the quantized model, we consider quantum walks of single photons in a lattice of tunable Mach-Zehnder interferometers trained via variational algorithms. Using an example from transfer learning, we show that the quantized PS model can exploit quantum interference to acquire capabilities beyond those of its classical counterpart. Finally, we discuss the role of quantum interference for training and tracing the decision making process, paving the way for realizations of interpretable quantum learning agents.

TI Splitting an Arbitrary Three-Qubit State via a Five-Qubit Cluster State
   and a Bell State
SO ENTROPY
AB Quantum information splitting (QIS) provides an idea for transmitting the quantum state through a classical channel and a preshared quantum entanglement resource. This paper presents a new scheme for QIS based on a five-qubit cluster state and a Bell state. In this scheme, the sender transmits the unknown three-qubit secret state to two agents by the quantum channel with the Bell basis measurement three times and broadcasts the measurement results to the agents through the classical channel. The agent who restores the secret state can successfully recover the initial information to be transmitted through the appropriate unitary operation with the help of the other party. Firstly, our scheme's process can be accurately realized by performing the applicable Bell basis measurement, single-qubit measurement, and local unitary operation instead of a multiparticle joint measurement. The splitting process of quantum information is realized through a convenient operation. Secondly, compared with some previous schemes, the efficiency of the total scheme has been improved in principle, and the qubit consumption is reduced. Finally, the security of the quantum information splitting scheme is analyzed from the perspectives of external attacks and participant attacks. It is proved that our scheme can effectively resist internal participant attacks and external eavesdropper attacks.

AB Entangled quantum communication is advancing rapidly, with laboratory and metropolitan testbeds under development, but to date there is no unifying Quantum Internet architecture. We propose a Quantum Internet architecture centered around the Quantum Recursive Network Architecture (QRNA), using RuleSet-based connections established using a two-pass connection setup. Scalability and internetworking (for both technological and administrative boundaries) are achieved using recursion in naming and connection control. In the near term, this architecture will support end-to-end, two-party entanglement on minimal hardware, and it will extend smoothly to multiparty entanglement and the use of quantum error correction on advanced hardware in the future. For a network internal gateway protocol, we recommend (but do not require) qDijkstra with seconds per Bell pair as link cost for routing; the external gateway protocol is designed to build recursively. The strength of our architecture is shown by assessing extensibility and demonstrating how robust protocol operation can be confirmed using the RuleSet paradigm.

TI A New Framework Containing Convolution and Pooling Circuits for Image
   Processing and Deep Learning Applications with Quantum Computing
   Implementation
SO TRAITEMENT DU SIGNAL
AB The resource need for deep learning and quantum computers' high computing power potential encourage collaboration between the two fields. Today, variational quantum circuits are used to perform the convolution operation with quantum computing. However, the results produced by variational circuits do not show a direct resemblance to the classical convolution operation. Because classical data is encoded into quantum data with their exact values in value-encoded methods, in contrast to variational quantum circuits, arithmetical operations can be applied with high accuracy. In this study, value-encoded quantum circuits for convolution and pooling operations are proposed to apply deep learning in quantum computers in a traditional and proven way. To construct the convolution and pooling operations, some modules such as addition, multiplication, division, and comparison are created. In addition, a window-based framework for quantum image processing applications is proposed. The generated convolution and pooling circuits are simulated on the IBM QISKIT simulator in parallel thanks to the proposed framework. The obtained results are verified by the expected results. Due to the limitations of quantum simulators and computers in the NISQ era, the used grayscale images are resized to 8x8 and the resolution of the images is reduced to 3 qubits. With developing the quantum technologies, the proposed approach can be applied for bigger and higher resolution images. Although the proposed method causes more qubit usage and circuit depth compared to variational convolutional circuits, the results they produce are exactly the same as the classical convolution process.

TI Erasure Tolerant Quantum Memory and the Quantum Null Energy Condition in
   Holographic Systems
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Investigating principles for storage of quantum information at finite temperature with minimal need for active error correction is an active area of research. We bear upon this question in two-dimensional holographic conformal field theories via the quantum null energy condition that we have shown earlier to implement the restrictions imposed by quantum thermodynamics on such many-body systems. We study an explicit encoding of a logical qubit into two similar chirally propagating excitations of finite von Neumann entropy on a finite temperature background whose erasure can be implemented by an appropriate inhomogeneous and instantaneous energy-momentum inflow from an infinite energy memoryless bath due to which the system transits to a thermal state. Holographically, these fast erasure processes can be depicted by generalized AdS-Vaidya geometries described previously in which no assumption of specific form of bulk matter is needed. We show that the quantum null energy condition gives analytic results for the minimal finite temperature needed for the deletion which is larger than the initial background temperature in consistency with Landauer's principle. In particular, we find a simple expression for the minimum final temperature needed for the erasure of a large number of encoding qubits. We also find that if the encoding qubits are localized over an interval shorter than a specific localization length, then the fast erasure process is impossible, and furthermore this localization length is the largest for an optimal amount of encoding qubits determined by the central charge. We estimate the optimal encoding qubits for realistic protection against fast erasure. We discuss possible generalizations of our study for novel constructions of faulttolerant quantum gates operating at finite temperature.

We review developments from 2018 to 2025, summarizing quantum algorithms, quantum-machine-learning models and XAI techniques applied to drug discovery, disease diagnosis, patient monitoring and biomarker identification. We introduce a taxonomy of hybrid and quantum-explainable approaches, evaluate NISQ hardware and encoding constraints, and compare interpretability methods (SHAP, LIME, QSHAP, QLRP, TSBA). Two case studies (doxorubicin cardiotoxicity prediction and pre-symptomatic IBD flare forecasting) demonstrate hybrid variational-quantum pipelines wrapped with SHAP-based explanations. We identify practical barriers (noise, data encoding, regulation, privacy) and outline research directions to benchmark clinical quantum advantage and develop scalable, transparent QXAI frameworks. The survey aims to guide interdisciplinary efforts toward trustworthy, scalable quantum-enabled precision healthcare.

AB Gate-based quantum computation describes algorithms as quantum circuits. These can be seen as a set of quantum gates acting on a set of qubits. To be executable, the circuit requires complex transformations to comply with the physical constraints of the machines. This process is known as transpilation, where qubits' layout initialisation is one of its first and most challenging steps, usually done by considering the device error properties. As the size of the quantum algorithm increases, the transpilation becomes increasingly complex and time-consuming. This constitutes a bottleneck towards agile, fast, and error-robust quantum computation. This work proposes an evolutionary deep neural network that learns the qubits' layout initialisation of the most advanced and complex IBM heuristic used in today's quantum machines. The aim is to progressively replace weakly scalable transpilation heuristics with machine learning models. Previous work using machine learning models for qubits' layout initialisation suffers from some shortcomings in the proposal's correctness and generalisation as well as benchmarks diversity, utility, and availability. The present work solves those flaws by (I) devising a complete Machine Learning pipeline including the ETL component and the evolutionary deep neural model using the linkage learning algorithm P3, (II) a modelling applicable to any quantum algorithm with a special interest to both optimisation and machine learning ones, (III) diverse and fresh benchmarks using calibration data of four real IBM quantum computers collected over 10months (Dec. 2022 and Oct. 2023) and training dataset built using four types of quantum optimisation and machine learning algorithms, as well as random ones. The proposal has been proven to be more efficient and simple than state-of-the-art deep neural models in the literature.

TI Quantum computing based high-energy nuclear physics
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB High-energy nuclear physics aims to explore and understand the physics of matter composed of quarks and gluons. However, it is intrinsically difficult to simulate high-energy nuclear physics from the first principle based quantum chromodynamics by using classical computers. In recent years, quantum computing has received intensive attention because it is expected to provide an ultimate solution for simulating high-energy nuclear physics. In this paper, we firstly review recent advances in quantum simulation of high-energy nuclear physics. Then we introduce some standard quantum algorithms, such as state preparation and measurements of light -cone correlation function. Finally, we demonstrate the advantage of quantum computing for solving the real-time evolution and the sign problems by studying hadronic scattering amplitude and phase structure of finite -temperature and finite-density matter, respectively.

TI Quantum Features of the Thermal Two-Qubit Quantum Rabi Model in Ultra-
   and Deep-Strong Regimes
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB Quantum correlations and non-classical states are indispensable resources for advancing quantum technologies, and their resilience at finite temperatures is crucial for practical experimental implementations. The two-qubit quantum Rabi model (2QQRM), a natural extension of the quantum Rabi model, describes two qubits coupled to a single bosonic mode and is extensively studied in cavity quantum electrodynamics, superconducting circuits, and quantum information science. In this work, the persistence of quantum correlations and non-classical states in the 2QQRM at thermal equilibrium is investigated, focusing on the ultrastrong and deep strong coupling regimes. Through a systematic analysis of quantumness quantifiers, the emergence of long-lived quantum correlations is demonstrated, even in the presence of thermal noise. Notably, striking phenomena arising from the interplay between detuning and deep strong-coupling are uncovered: in the high-frequency limit, where the qubit energy exceeds the cavity-mode energy, quantum criticality emerges, leading to a high degree of photon squeezing. In contrast, the opposite regime is characterized by robust qubit-qubit quantum correlations. Importantly, it is shown that both dispersive regimes exhibit quantum features that are remarkably robust to parameter fluctuations, making them advantageous for maintaining quantum coherence. These results highlight the exceptional resilience of quantum resources in the 2QQRM and provide valuable insights for developing quantum technologies operating under realistic, finite-temperature conditions.

TI Expanding the quantum photonic toolbox in AlGaAsOI
SO APL PHOTONICS
AB Aluminum gallium arsenide-on-insulator (AlGaAsOI) exhibits large chi(2) and chi(3) optical nonlinearities, a wide tunable bandgap, low waveguide propagation loss, and a large thermo-optic coefficient, making it an exciting platform for integrated quantum photonics. With ultrabright sources of quantum light established in AlGaAsOI, the next step is to develop the critical building blocks for chip-scale quantum photonic circuits. Here we expand the quantum photonic toolbox for AlGaAsOI by demonstrating edge couplers, 3 dB splitters, tunable interferometers, and waveguide crossings with performance comparable to or exceeding silicon and silicon-nitride quantum photonic platforms. As a demonstration, we de-multiplex photonic qubits through an unbalanced interferometer, paving the route toward ultra-efficient and high-rate chip-scale demonstrations of photonic quantum computation and information applications.

TI Mixed-State Quantum Phases: Renormalization and Quantum Error Correction
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW X
AB Open system quantum dynamics can generate a variety of long-range entangled mixed states, yet it has been unclear in what sense they constitute phases of matter. To establish that two mixed states are in the same phase, as defined by their two-way connectivity via local quantum channels, we use the renormalization group (RG) and decoders of quantum error correcting codes. We introduce a real-space RG scheme for mixed states based on local channels which ideally preserve correlations with the complementary system, and we prove this is equivalent to the reversibility of the channel's action. As an application, we demonstrate an exact RG flow of finite temperature toric code in two dimensions to infinite temperature, thus proving it is in the trivial phase. In contrast, for toric code subject to local dephasing, we establish a mixed-state toric code phase using local channels obtained by truncating an RG-type decoder and the minimum weight perfect matching decoder. We also discover a precise relation between mixedstate phase and decodability, by proving that local noise acting on toric code cannot destroy logical information without bringing the state out of the toric code phase.

TI Long-Lived Solid-State Optical Memory for High-Rate Quantum Repeaters
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB We argue that long optical storage times are required to establish entanglement at high rates over large distances using memory-based quantum repeaters. Triggered by this conclusion, we investigate the 795.325 nm3 H6 <-> 3H4 transition of Tm : Y3Ga5O12 (Tm:YGG). Most importantly, we find that the optical coherence time can reach 1.1 ms, and, using laser pulses, we demonstrate optical storage based on the atomic frequency comb protocol during up to 100 mu s as well as a memory decay time T,n of 13.1 mu s. Possibilities of how to narrow the gap between the measured value of T,n and its maximum of 275 mu s are discussed. In addition, we demonstrate multiplexed storage, including with feed-forward selection, shifting and filtering of spectral modes, as well as quantum state storage using members of nonclassical photon pairs. Our results show the potential of Tm:YGG for creating multiplexed quantum memories with long optical storage times, and open the path to repeater-based quantum networks with high entanglement distribution rates.

TI Surpassing millisecond coherence in on chip superconducting quantum
   memories by optimizing materials and circuit design
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB The performance of superconducting quantum circuits for quantum computing has advanced tremendously in recent decades; however, a comprehensive understanding of relaxation mechanisms does not yet exist. In this work, we utilize a multimode approach to characterizing energy losses in superconducting quantum circuits, with the goals of predicting device performance and improving coherence through materials, process, and circuit design optimization. Using this approach, we measure significant reductions in surface and bulk dielectric losses by employing a tantalum-based materials platform and annealed sapphire substrates. With this knowledge we predict the relaxation times of aluminum- and tantalum-based transmon qubits, and find that they are consistent with experimental results. We additionally optimize device geometry to maximize coherence within a coaxial tunnel architecture, and realize on-chip quantum memories with single-photon Ramsey times of 2.0-2.7 ms, limited by their energy relaxation times of 1.0-1.4 ms. These results demonstrate an advancement towards a more modular and compact coaxial circuit architecture for bosonic qubits with reproducibly high coherence.
   Understanding loss mechanisms in superconducting circuits is crucial for improving qubit coherence. Here the authors use a multimode resonator to study loss mechanisms in thin-film superconducting circuits and demonstrate on-chip quantum memories with lifetimes exceeding 1ms, using Ta thin-films and high-temperature substrate annealing

AB Recent advances in quantum computing introduce the ability to reuse qubits through mid-circuit measurements, thereby enhancing the efficiency of quantum devices with limited computational resources. However, identifying optimal reuse opportunities in quantum circuits remains challenging due to the intricate dependencies between quantum gates. Existing frameworks address this by either directly searching for reuse opportunities or converting circuits into directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). Unfortunately, these frameworks may require exponential search complexity or may not always ensure optimal results due to their non-deterministic property. To overcome these challenges, we propose QR-Map (Qubit Reuse Map), a map-based framework that abstracts computational dependencies for efficient qubit reuse. By extracting and aligning two-qubit gates, QR-Map facilitates dependency detection and ensures qubit savings without incurring excessive idle time. This approach achieves an optimal balance between gate serialization depth and crosstalk reduction. Evaluations with various quantum circuit benchmarks demonstrate that quantum circuits optimized with QR-Map achieve average reductions of 20% in qubit usage, 25% in circuit depth, and 22% in SWAP insertions compared to those optimized with the state-of-the-art framework.

TI Quantum communication networks with optical vortices
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Quantum communications introduce a paradigm change in internet security by using quantum resources to establish secure keys between parties. Present-day quantum communication networks are mainly point to point and use trusted nodes and key management systems to relay the keys. Future quantum networks, including the quantum internet, will have complex topologies in which groups of users are connected and communicate with each other. Here we investigate several architectures for quantum communication networks. We show that photonic orbital angular momentum (OAM) can be used to route quantum information between different nodes. Starting from a simple point-to-point network, we will gradually develop more complex architectures: point-tomultipoint, fully connected, and entanglement-distribution networks. As a particularly important result, we show that an n-node fully connected network can be constructed with a single OAM sorter and n - 1 OAM values. Our results pave the way to construct complex quantum communication networks with minimal resources.

SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB In state-of-the-art quantum key distribution systems, the main limiting factor in increasing the key generation rate is the timing resolution in detecting photons. Here, we present and experimentally demonstrate a strategy to overcome this limitation, also for high-loss and long-distance implementations. We exploit the intrinsic wavelength correlations of entangled photons using wavelength multiplexing to generate a quantum secure key from polarization entanglement. The presented approach can be integrated into both fiber- and satellite-based quantum-communication schemes, without any changes to most types of entanglement sources. This technique features a huge scaling potential allowing to increase the secure key rate by several orders of magnitude as compared to non-multiplexed schemes.

TI Entanglement Purification and Protection in a Superconducting Quantum
   Network
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB High-fidelity quantum entanglement is a key resource for quantum communication and distributed quantum computing, enabling quantum state teleportation, dense coding, and quantum encryption. Any sources of decoherence in the communication channel, however, degrade entanglement fidelity, thereby increasing the error rates of entangled state protocols. Entanglement purification provides a method to alleviate these nonidealities by distilling impure states into higher-fidelity entangled states. Here we demonstrate the entanglement purification of Bell pairs shared between two remote superconducting quantum nodes connected by a moderately lossy, 1-meter long superconducting communication cable. We use a purification process to correct the dominant amplitude damping errors caused by transmission through the cable, with fractional increases in fidelity as large as 25%, achieved for higher damping errors. The best final fidelity the purification achieves is 94.09 1 0.98%. In addition, we use both dynamical decoupling and Rabi driving to protect the entangled states from local noise, increasing the effective qubit dephasing time by a factor of 4, from 3 to 12 mu s. These methods demonstrate the potential for the generation and preservation of very high-fidelity entanglement in a superconducting quantum communication network.

TI Review of intermediate representations for quantum computing
SO JOURNAL OF SUPERCOMPUTING
AB Intermediate representations (IRs) are fundamental to classical and quantum computing, bridging high-level quantum programming languages and the hardware-specific instructions required for execution. This paper reviews the development of quantum IRs, focusing on their evolution and the need for abstraction layers that facilitate portability and optimization. Monolithic quantum IRs, such as QIR (Lubinski et al. in Front Phys 10:940293, 2022. https://doi.org/10.3389/fphy.2022.940293), QSSA (Peduri et al. in Proceedings of the 31st ACM SIGPLAN international conference on compiler construction. CC 2022. Association for Computing Machinery, New York, 2022), or Q-MLIR (McCaskey and Nguyen in Proceedings-2021 IEEE International Conference on Quantum Computing and Engineering, QCE, 2021), their effectiveness in handling abstractions, and their hybrid support between quantum-classical operations are evaluated. However, a key limitation is their inability to address qubit locality, an essential feature for distributed quantum computing (DQC). To overcome this, InQuIR (Nishio and Wakizaka in InQuIR: Intermediate Representation for Interconnected Quantum Computers, 2023. https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.00267) was introduced as an IR specifically designed for distributed systems, providing explicit control over qubit locality and inter-node communication. While effective in managing qubit distribution, InQuIR's dependence on manual manipulation of communication protocols increases complexity for developers. NetQIR (V & aacute;zquez-P & eacute;rez et al. in NetQIR: An Extension of QIR for Distributed Quantum Computing, 2024. https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03712), an extension of QIR for DQC, emerges as a solution to achieve the abstraction of quantum communications protocols. This review emphasizes the need for further advancements in IRs for distributed quantum systems, which will play a crucial role in the scalability and usability of future quantum networks.

TI Dependence of retrieval efficiency on waist ratio of read beam to
   anti-Stokes photon mode in cavity-enhanced quantum memory
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB Quantum communication is promising for absolutely safe information transmission. However, the direct transmission distance of quantum states is limited by the no-cloning theorem and transmission loss. To solve these problems, Duan et al. proposed a promising quantum repeater scheme, DLCZ protocol (Duan L M, Lukin M D, Cirac J I, Zoller P 2001 Nature 414 413), in which linear optics and atomic ensembles are used to combine entanglement generation and quantum memory into a single node. A quantum memory with highly retrieval efficiency is beneficial to increasing the rate of entanglement swapping, and also achieving high-speed entanglement distribution. Up to now, high-efficiency quantum memories have been realized by using high-optical-depth atomic ensembles or by coupling atomic ensembles with a medium-finesse optical cavity. However, the effect of the waist ratio of read beam mode and anti-Stokes photon mode on intrinsic retrieval efficiency has not been studied in detail. Here, we study the dependence of intrinsic retrieval efficiency on the waist ratio of read beam mode to anti-Stokes photon mode in cavity-enhanced quantum memory.
   In this work, an Rb-87 atomic ensemble, that is placed at the center of a passively stabilized polarization interferometer (BD1,2), is used as quantum memory. Firstly, the ensemble is captured through magneto-optical trapping (MOT) and prepared into the Zeeman sub-level of ground state |5S(1/2),F=1,m=0 >. Then, a weak write pulse with frequency red-detuned from the |5S(1/2),F=1,m=0 >->|5P1/2,F '=1,m=1 > transition by 110 MHz, illuminates the atoms and induces spontaneous Raman scattering out a Stokes photon. In this regime of weak excitation, the detection of a Stokes photon heralds the storage of a single spin wave |5S(1/2),F=1,m=0 ><->|5S(1/2),F=2,m=0 > (|5S(1/2),F=1,m=0 >|5S(1/2),F=2,m=2 >|5S(1/2),=1,=0 ><->|5S1/2,=2,=2 >) distributed among the whole ensemble. After a programmable delay, a read pulse that generates a 110 MHz red-detuning from the |5S1/2,F=2,m=0 >->|5P1/2,F '=2,m=-1 >|5S1/2,=2,=0 >->|5P1/2,'=2,=-1 > transition converts this spin wave into an anti-Stokes photon. We detect the Stokes photons and anti-Stokes photons with polarization sigma++, which means that all the spin-waves are stored in a magnetic-field-insensitive state to reduce the decoherence caused by the stray magnetic fields. In order to increase the intrinsic retrieval efficiency, the atomic ensemble is placed in a ring cavity. The cavity length is 4 m, the finesse is measured to be similar to 15, and the escape efficiency of ring cavity is 52.9%. Both Stokes and anti-Stokes photon qubits are required to resonate with the ring cavity. To meet this requirement, a cavity-locking beam is injected into the cavity to stabilize the cavity length by using a Pound-Drever-Hall locking scheme. Finally, we fix the Stokes (anti-Stokes) photon mode waist and change the waist ratio through changing the write beam (read beam) waist.
   The experimental results show that when the waist ratio of read beam mode to anti-Stokes photon mode is 3, the intrinsic retrieval efficiency reaches to 68.9%+/- 1.6%68.9%+/- 1.6% and normalized cross-correlation function g(2)(2) can achieve 26.5 +/- 1.926.5 +/- 1.9. We build a theoretical model, which shows that the intrinsic retrieval efficiency reaches the peak when the waist ratio is 3, and the intrinsic retrieval efficiency tends to be stable when the waist ratio continues to increase. The experimental results accord with the theoretical results. In the future, we will improve the intrinsic retrieval efficiency by enhancing the fineness of the optical cavity with optimal cavity parameters.

TI Optical and spin manipulation of non-Kramers rare-earth ions in a weak
   magnetic field for quantum memory applications
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Rare-earth ion doped crystals have proven to be solid platforms for implementing quantum memories. Their potential use for integrated photonics with large multiplexing capability and unprecedented coherence times is at the core of their attractiveness. The best performances of these ions are, however, usually obtained when subjected to a DC magnetic field, but consequences of such fields on the quantum memory protocols have only received little attention. In this paper, we focus on the effect of DC bias magnetic field on the population manipulation of non-Kramers ions with nuclear quadrupole states, both in the spin and optical domains, by developing a simple theoretical model. We apply this model to explain experimental observations in a Eu-151:Y2SiO5 crystal, and highlight specific consequences on the atomic frequency comb spin-wave protocol. The developed analysis should allows predicting optimal magnetic field configurations for various protocols.

TI Quantum computation with hybrid parafermion-spin qubits

AB We propose a universal set of single- and two-qubit quantum gates acting on a hybrid qubit formed by coupling a quantum dot spin qubit to a Z2m parafermion qubit with arbitrary integer m. The special case m = 1 reproduces the results previously derived for Majorana qubits. Our formalism utilizes Fock parafermions, facilitating a transparent treatment of hybrid parafermion-spin systems. Furthermore, we highlight the previously overlooked importance of particle-hole symmetry in these systems. We give concrete examples how the hybrid qubit system could be realized experimentally for Z4 and Z6 parafermions. In addition, we discuss a simple readout scheme for the fractional parafermion charge via the measurement of the spin-qubit resonant frequency.

   carbide qubits
SO NATURE MATERIALS
AB Room-temperature shallow defect spin qubits acting as a quantum sensor with favourable properties towards the biological environment are sought after, with promising impacts on bioimaging, radical detection and nanoscale nuclear spin sensing. Here we show that alkene-terminated silicon carbide hosting divacancy qubits located a few nanometres below the surface leads to a stable operation with superior sensitivity in which the host is a bioinert semiconductor with existing wafer-scale chip technology. The read-out of the qubit occurs at near-infrared wavelengths, which exhibit a minimum absorption by the organic molecules or water. We show that the divacancy qubit can realize multiple quantum sensor schemes under ambient conditions in which the suggested surface termination can be readily tailored towards the desired application. The combination of the paramount host, surface functionalization and qubit properties may significantly advance room-temperature quantum sensing, as well as provide a platform for quantum simulation and optoelectronic devices.

TI Qutrit-Inspired Fully Self-Supervised Shallow Quantum Learning Network
   for Brain Tumor Segmentation
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NEURAL NETWORKS AND LEARNING SYSTEMS
AB Classical self-supervised networks suffer from convergence problems and reduced segmentation accuracy due to forceful termination. Qubits or bilevel quantum bits often describe quantum neural network models. In this article, a novel self-supervised shallow learning network model exploiting the sophisticated three-level qutrit-inspired quantum information system, referred to as quantum fully self-supervised neural network (QFS-Net), is presented for automated segmentation of brain magnetic resonance (MR) images. The QFS-Net model comprises a trinity of a layered structure of qutrits interconnected through parametric Hadamard gates using an eight-connected second-order neighborhood-based topology. The nonlinear transformation of the qutrit states allows the underlying quantum neural network model to encode the quantum states, thereby enabling a faster self-organized counterpropagation of these states between the layers without supervision. The suggested QFS-Net model is tailored and extensively validated on the Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA) dataset collected from the Nature repository. The experimental results are also compared with state-of-the-art supervised (U-Net and URes-Net architectures) and the self-supervised QIS-Net model and its classical counterpart. Results shed promising segmented outcomes in detecting tumors in terms of dice similarity and accuracy with minimum human intervention and computational resources. The proposed QFS-Net is also investigated on natural gray-scale images from the Berkeley segmentation dataset and yields promising outcomes in segmentation, thereby demonstrating the robustness of the QFS-Net model.

TI Wireless quantum key distribution at terahertz frequencies:
   Opportunities and challenges
SO IET QUANTUM COMMUNICATION
AB Quantum key distribution (QKD) is one of the major applications of quantum information technology. It can provide ultra-secure key distribution with security guaranteed by the laws of quantum physics. Quantum key distribution is necessary to protect data transmission from quantum computing attacks in future communication networks. The laws of quantum mechanics dictate that as opposed to microwave frequencies, quantum coherence is preserved at room temperatures for terahertz (THz) frequencies. This makes the THz band a promising solution for room-temperature QKD implementation in future wireless communication networks. The authors present the principles of continuous variable QKD (CV-QKD) systems and review the latest developments in the design and analysis of CV-QKD systems operating at microwave and THz frequencies. The authors also discuss how multiple-input multiple-output transmission can be incorporated into the quantum communications framework to improve the secret key rates and increase the coverage distances of the THz CV-QKD system.

TI Entanglement of photonic modes from a continuously driven two-level
   system
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB The ability to generate entangled states of light is a key primitive for quantum communication and distributed quantum computation. Continuously driven sources, including those based on spontaneous parametric downconversion, are usually probabilistic, whereas deterministic sources require accurate timing of the control fields. Here, we experimentally generate entangled photonic modes by continuously exciting a quantum emitter - a superconducting qubit - with a coherent drive, taking advantage of mode matching in the time and frequency domain. Using joint quantum state tomography and logarithmic negativity, we show that entanglement is generated between modes extracted from the two sidebands of the resonance fluorescence spectrum. Because the entangled photonic modes are perfectly orthogonal, they can be transferred into distinct quantum memories. Our approach can be utilized to distribute entanglement at a high rate in various physical platforms, with applications in waveguide quantum electrodynamics, distributed quantum computing, and quantum networks.

TI Universal quantum gates by nonadiabatic holonomic evolution for the
   surface electron
SO FRONTIERS IN PHYSICS
AB The nonadiabatic holonomic quantum computation based on the geometric phase is robust against the built-in noise and decoherence. In this work, we theoretically propose a scheme to realize nonadiabatic holonomic quantum gates in a surface electron system, which is a promising two-dimensional platform for quantum computation. The holonomic gate is realized by a three-level structure that combines the Rydberg states and spin states via an inhomogeneous magnetic field. After a cyclic evolution, the computation bases pick up different geometric phases and thus perform a holonomic gate. Only the electron with spin up experiences the holonomic gate, while the electron with spin down is decoupled from the state-selective driving fields. The arbitrary controlled-U gate encoded on the Rydberg states and spin states can then be realized. The fidelity of the output state exceeds 0.99 with experimentally achievable parameters.

TI Optimizing Grover's Algorithm for Routing in Quantum Wireless
   Communication Networks
SO JOURNAL OF INTERNET TECHNOLOGY
AB This paper presents a novel approach to optimizing Grover's algorithm for addressing the routing problem in quantum wireless communication networks. We begin by conducting a comprehensive analysis of key quantum communication technologies, including quantum teleportation and quantum entanglement swapping, and subsequently construct a quantum wireless communication network model grounded in these principles. Building on this foundation, we design and implement a multi-level quantum wireless network information transmission mechanism, incorporating quantum channels for identity authentication to ensure secure communication. Focusing on the routing challenges in quantum wireless communication networks, we propose innovative applications and optimizations of Grover's quantum search algorithm. Specifically, we introduce an improved algorithm that efficiently searches for routing paths with maximal metrics within a limited number of hops. This enhancement not only significantly increases routing efficiency but also mitigates the risk of quantum channel disconnection caused by the depletion of entangled quantum pairs, thereby improving the overall success rate of communication. Simulation and experimental results demonstrate that the proposed optimization algorithm substantially enhances the routing performance of quantum wireless communication networks while maintaining robust security measures. This study offers a new solution to the routing challenges in quantum wireless communication networks and significantly optimizes Grover's algorithm, contributing to the development of more efficient and reliable quantum communication networks.

TI Strong polygamy of multi-party q-expected quantum correlations
SO QUANTUM INFORMATION PROCESSING
AB We show that the polygamous nature of multi-party quantum correlations can be characterized in a stronger form based on Tsallis q-entropy and q-expectation value; we establish a class of strong polygamy inequalities of multi-party entanglement in terms of Tsallis q-entropy and q-expectation value for q >= 1. Our new class of inequalities is tighter than the usual polygamy inequalities of multi-party entanglement, and the tightness is explicitly illustrated by an example. Moreover, our new class of inequalities is concerned with the entanglement distributed between a single party and any possible subsets of the rest parties, whereas the usual polygamy inequality only considers the entanglement between one party and another. We further establish the equivalence between strong polygamy of quantum entanglement and quantum discord distributed in multi-party quantum systems.

TI Exploring Non-Gaussianity Reduction in Quantum Channels
SO ENTROPY
AB The quantum relative entropy between a quantum state and its Gaussian equivalent is a quantifying function of the system's non-Gaussianity, a useful resource in several applications, such as quantum communication and computation. One of its most fundamental properties is to be monotonically decreasing under Gaussian evolutions. In this paper, we develop the conditions for a non-Gaussian quantum channel to preserve the monotonically decreasing property. We propose a necessary condition to classify between Gaussian and non-Gaussian channels and use it to define a class of quantum channels that decrease the system's non-Gaussianity. We also discuss how this property, combined with a restriction on the states at the channel's input, can be applied to the security analysis of continuous-variable quantum key distribution protocols.

TI Tunable Anisotropic Quantum Rabi Model via a Magnon-Spin-Qubit Ensemble
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB The ongoing rapid progress towards quantum technologies relies on new hybrid platforms optimized for specific quantum computation and communication tasks, and researchers are striving to achieve such platforms. We study theoretically a spin qubit exchange-coupled to an anisotropic ferromagnet that hosts magnons with a controllable degree of intrinsic squeezing. We find this system to physically realize the quantum Rabi model from the isotropic to the Jaynes-Cummings limit with coupling strengths that can reach the deep-strong regime. We demonstrate that the composite nature of the squeezed magnon enables concurrent excitation of three spin qubits coupled to the same magnet. Thus, three-qubit GreenbergerHorne-Zeilinger and related states needed for implementing Shor's quantum error-correction code can be robustly generated. Our analysis highlights some unique advantages offered by this hybrid platform, and we hope that it will motivate corresponding experimental efforts.

TI One-to-Many Simultaneous Secure Quantum Information Transmission
SO CRYPTOGRAPHY
AB This paper presents a new quantum protocol designed to transmit information from one source to many recipients simultaneously. The proposed protocol, which is based on the phenomenon of entanglement, is completely distributed and is provably information-theoretically secure. Numerous existing quantum protocols guarantee secure information communication between two parties but are not amenable to generalization in situations where the source must transmit information to two or more recipients. Hence, they must be executed sequentially two or more times to achieve the desired goal. The main novelty of the new protocol is its extensibility and generality to situations involving one party that must simultaneously communicate different, in general, messages to an arbitrary number of spatially distributed parties. This is achieved in the special way employed to encode the transmitted information in the entangled state of the system, one of the distinguishing features compared with previous protocols. This protocol can prove expedient whenever an information broker, say, Alice, must communicate distinct secret messages to her agents, all in different geographical locations, in one go. Due to its relative complexity compared with similar cryptographic protocols, as it involves communication among n parties and relies on |GHZn & rang; tuples, we provide an extensive and detailed security analysis so as to prove that it is information-theoretically secure. Finally, in terms of its implementation, the prevalent characteristics of the proposed protocol are its uniformity and simplicity, because it only requires CNOT and Hadamard gates and the local quantum circuits are identical for all information recipients.

TI Scalable qubit representations of neutrino mixing matrices
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
AB Oscillating neutrino beams exhibit quantum coherence over distances of thousands of kilometers. Their unambiguously quantum nature suggests an appealing test system for direct quantum simulation. Such techniques may enable presently analytically intractable calculations involving multineutrino entangle-ments, such as collective neutrino oscillations in supernovas, but only once oscillation phenomenology is properly reexpressed in the language of quantum circuits. Here we resolve outstanding conceptual issues regarding encoding of arbitrarily mixed neutrino flavor states in the Hilbert space of an n-qubit quantum computer. We introduce algorithms to encode mixing and oscillation of any number of flavor-mixed neutrinos, both with and without CP-violation, with an efficient number of prescriptive input parameters in terms of subrotations of the Pontecorvo-Maki-Nakagawa-Sakata matrix in standard form. Examples encoded for an IBM-Q quantum computer are shown to converge to analytic predictions both with and without CP-violation.

TI Quantum discord and entropic measures of two relativistic fermions
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS A-MATHEMATICAL AND THEORETICAL
AB In the present work, we study the interplay between relativistic effects and quantumness in the system of two relativistic fermions. In particular, we explore entropic measures of quantum correlations and quantum discord before and after application of a boost and subsequent Wigner rotation. We also study the positive operator-valued measurements (POVMs) invasiveness before and after the boosts. While the relativistic principle is universal and requires Lorentz invariance of quantum correlations in the entire system, we have found specific partitions where quantum correlations stored in particular subsystems are not invariant. We calculate quantum discords corresponding of the states before and after applying a boost, and observe that the state gains extra discord after the boost. When analyzing the invasiveness of the POVMs, we have found that the POVM applied to the initial entangled state reduces the discord to zero. However, discord of the boosted state survives after the same POVM. Thus we conclude that the quantum discord generated by Lorentz boost is robust concerning the protective POVM, while the measurement exerts an invasive effect on the discord of the initial state. Finally, we discuss potential implementation of the ideas of this work using top quarks as a benchmark scenario.

AB Integrated thin-film lithium niobate (TFLN) photonics has emerged as a powerful platform for quantum information science, offering its outstanding nonlinear, electro-optic (EO), and integration capabilities. In this review, we present the latest advances in TFLN-based integrated photonics tailored to quantum technologies. We first explore state-of-the-art quantum light sources realized in both straight waveguide and resonator configuration, including high-brightness photon pair generations, squeezed light, and versatile entanglement schemes. Next, we detail progress in integrated photonic processors, with a focus on programmable interferometric networks, ultrafast EO modulators, and essential passive components for photonic qubit processing. We then address critical challenges in optical interfacing and detection technologies, discussing recent innovations in low-loss fiber-to-chip and grating coupler designs, as well as the integration of on-chip single photon detectors. This review provides a forward-looking perspective on scalable quantum photonic systems that could underpin future advances in quantum communication, computing, and sensing.

TI Requirements for a processing-node quantum repeater on a real-world
   fiber grid
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB We numerically study the distribution of entanglement between the Dutch cities of Delft and Eindhoven realized with a processing-node quantum repeater and determine minimal hardware requirements for verifiable blind quantum computation using color centers and trapped ions. Our results are obtained considering restrictions imposed by a real-world fiber grid and using detailed hardware-specific models. By comparing our results to those we would obtain in idealized settings, we show that simplifications lead to a distorted picture of hardware demands, particularly on memory coherence and photon collection. We develop general machinery suitable for studying arbitrary processing-node repeater chains using NetSquid, a discrete-event simulator for quantum networks. This enables us to include time-dependent noise models and simulate repeater protocols with cut-offs, including the required classical control communication. We find minimal hardware requirements by solving an optimization problem using genetic algorithms on a high-performance-computing cluster. Our work provides guidance for further experimental progress, and showcases limitations of studying quantum-repeater requirements in idealized situations.

TI Dynamical-decoupling-protected nonadiabatic holonomic quantum
   computation
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB The main obstacles to the realization of high-fidelity quantum gates are the control errors arising from inaccurate manipulation of a quantum system and the decoherence caused by the interaction between the quantum system and its environment. Nonadiabatic holonomic quantum computation allows for high-speed implementation of whole-geometric quantum gates, making quantum computation robust against control errors. Dynamical decoupling provides an effective method to protect quantum gates against environment-induced decoherence, regardless of collective decoherence or independent decoherence. In this paper, we put forward a protocol of nonadiabatic holonomic quantum computation protected by dynamical decoupling. Due to the combination of nonadiabatic holonomic quantum computation and dynamical decoupling, our protocol not only possesses the intrinsic robustness against control errors but also protects quantum gates against environment-induced decoherence.

TI Quantifying entanglement preservability of experimental processes
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Preserving entanglement is a crucial dynamical process for entanglement-based quantum computation and quantum-information processes, such as one-way quantum computing and quantum key distribution. However, the problem of quantifying the ability of an experimental process to preserve two-qubit entanglement in experimentally feasible ways is not well understood. Accordingly, herein, we consider the use of two measures, namely composition and robustness, for quantitatively characterizing the ability of a process to preserve entanglement, referred to henceforth as entanglement preservability. A fidelity benchmark is additionally derived to identify the ability of a process to preserve entanglement. We show that the measures and introduced benchmark are experimentally feasible and require only local measurements on single qubits and preparations of separable states. Moreover, they are applicable to all physical processes that can be described using the general theory of quantum operations, e.g., qubit dynamics in photonic and superconducting systems. Our method extends the existing tools for analyzing channels, e.g., channel resource theory, to quantify entanglement preservability for non-trace-preserving quantum processes. The results are of significant interest for applications in quantum-information processing in which entanglement preservation is required.

TI The Entanglement-Assisted Communication Capacity Over Quantum
   Trajectories
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS
AB The unique and often-weird properties of quantum mechanics allow an information carrier to propagate through multiple trajectories of quantum channels simultaneously. This ultimately leads us to quantum trajectories with an indefinite causal order of quantum channels. It has been shown that indefinite causal order enables the violation of bottleneck capacity, which bounds the amount of the transferable classical and quantum information through a classical trajectory with a well-defined causal order of quantum channels. In this treatise, we investigate this beneficial property in the realm of both entanglement-assisted classical and quantum communications. To this aim, we derive closed-form capacity expressions of entanglement-assisted classical and quantum communication for arbitrary quantum Pauli channels over classical and quantum trajectories. We show that by exploiting the indefinite causal order of quantum channels, we obtain capacity gains over classical trajectory as well as the violation of bottleneck capacity for various practical scenarios. Furthermore, we determine the operating region where entanglement-assisted communication over quantum trajectory obtains capacity gain against classical trajectory and where the entanglement-assisted communication over quantum trajectory violates the bottleneck capacity.

AB Ant colony optimisation (ACO) is a commonly used meta-heuristic to solve complex combinatorial optimisation problems like the travelling salesman problem (TSP), vehicle routing problem (VRP) etc. However, classical ACO algorithms provide better optimal solutions but do not reduce computation time overhead to a significant extent. Algorithmic speed-up can be achieved by using parallelism offered by quantum computing. Existing quantum algorithms to solve ACO are either quantum-inspired classical algorithms or hybrid quantum-classical algorithms. Since all these algorithms need the intervention of classical computing, leveraging the true potential of quantum computing on real quantum hardware remains a challenge. This study's main contribution is to propose a fully quantum algorithm to solve ACO, enhancing the quantum information processing toolbox in the fault-tolerant quantum computing (FTQC) era. We have solved the single source single destination (SSSD) shortest-path problem using our proposed adaptive quantum circuit for representing the dynamic pheromone-updating strategy in real IBMQ devices. Our quantum ACO technique can be further used as a quantum ORACLE to solve complex optimisation problems in a fully quantum setup with significant speed up upon the availability of more qubits.

TI Single-Atom Verification of the Noise-Resilient and Fast Characteristics
   of Universal Nonadiabatic Noncyclic Geometric Quantum Gates
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Quantum gates induced by geometric phases are intrinsically robust against noise due to the global properties of their evolution paths. Compared to conventional nonadiabatic geometric quantum computation, the recently proposed nonadiabatic noncyclic geometric quantum computation (NNGQC) works in a faster fashion while still remaining the robust feature of the geometric operations. Here, we experimentally implement the NNGQC in a single trapped ultracold Ca-40(+) ion to verify the noise-resilient and fast feature. By performing unitary operations under imperfect conditions, we witness the advantages of the NNGQC with measured fidelities by quantum process tomography in comparison to other two quantum gates by conventional nonadiabatic geometric quantum computation and by straightforward dynamical evolution. Our results provide the first evidence confirming the possibility of accelerated quantum information processing with limited systematic errors even in an imperfect situation.

TI Quantum gate-assisted teleportation in noisy environments: robustness
   and fidelity improvement
SO COMMUNICATIONS IN THEORETICAL PHYSICS
AB Quantum teleportation as the key strategy for quantum communication requires pure maximally shared entangled states among quantum nodes. In practice, quantum decoherence drastically degrades the shared entanglement during entanglement distribution, which is a serious challenge for the development of quantum networks. However, most of the decoherence control strategies proposed thus far are either resource-intensive or time-consuming. To overcome this obstacle, we enable noise-resistant teleportation through a noisy channel with a limited number of qubits and without applying time-consuming weak measurements. We apply a quantum gate control unit consisting of a controlled NOT gate and a rotation gate after the original teleportation protocol is accomplished. Furthermore, we demonstrate that a teleportation fidelity of unity is attainable when environment-assisted measurement is added to the proposed teleportation protocol via quantum gates. Moreover, we present an entanglement distribution process by employing the designed quantum gate control unit followed by the deterministic standard teleportation protocol to improve teleportation fidelity by establishing improved shared entanglement. Our performance analysis indicates that the proposed teleportation schemes offer a competitive fidelity and success probability compared with the conventional schemes and a recent weak measurement-based teleportation protocol.

TI Enhancing the Security of Classical Communication with Post-Quantum
   Authenticated-Encryption Schemes for the Quantum Key Distribution
SO COMPUTERS
AB This research aims to establish a secure system for key exchange by using post-quantum cryptography (PQC) schemes in the classic channel of quantum key distribution (QKD). Modern cryptography faces significant threats from quantum computers, which can solve classical problems rapidly. PQC schemes address critical security challenges in QKD, particularly in authentication and encryption, to ensure the reliable communication across quantum and classical channels. The other objective of this study is to balance security and communication speed among various PQC algorithms in different security levels, specifically CRYSTALS-Kyber, CRYSTALS-Dilithium, and Falcon, which are finalists in the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Post-Quantum Cryptography Standardization project. The quantum channel of QKD is simulated with Qiskit, which is a comprehensive and well-supported tool in the field of quantum computing. By providing a detailed analysis of the performance of these three algorithms with Rivest-Shamir-Adleman (RSA), the results will guide companies and organizations in selecting an optimal combination for their QKD systems to achieve a reliable balance between efficiency and security. Our findings demonstrate that the implemented PQC schemes effectively address security challenges posed by quantum computers, while keeping the the performance similar to RSA.

TI Thermal quantum memory, Bell-non-locality, and entanglement behaviors in
   a two-spin Heisenberg chain model
SO ALEXANDRIA ENGINEERING JOURNAL
AB This paper explores thermal quantum memory-assisted entropic uncertainty, Bell-non -locality, and entanglement in a two-qubit Heisenberg XXX chain with x-directional Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) and Kaplan-Shekhtman-Entin-Wohlman-Aharony (KSEA) interac-tions in thermal equilibrium. We find this crucial that the initial degree of nonlocality and entangle-ment in the two-qubit state entirely depends upon the temperature, orientation, and strength of the DM and KSEA interaction of the magnetic field. Among many other situations, the magnetic field characterized by DM interaction with minimal temperature, exchange coupling strength, and KSEA interaction is the most reliable for generating and maintaining maximal nonlocality and entanglement while completely suppressing entropic uncertainty. On the other hand, repeated revi-vals and non-Markovian dynamics have been observed when the magnetic field is characterized by exchange coupling constant, DM and KSEA interaction with a higher temperature limit. Except for temperature-based magnetic fields, we show that maximal entanglement and nonlocality are gener-ated and preserved in the two qubits with zero-order entropic uncertainty, which we believe is a bet-ter result than previous studies.(c) 2022 THE AUTHORS.

TI Quantum Computing with Exciton Qubits in Colloidal Semiconductor
   Nanocrystals
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY C
AB The present work evaluates the feasibility of quantum computing with exciton qubits in coupled colloidal semiconductor nanocrystals (NCs). A strategy for manipulating two-qubit states of colloidal NC hetero-dimers is described. We show that a sequence of laser pulses with the same photon energy can bring excitonic states of a nanocrystal hetero-dimer into entanglement and perform arbitrary qubit rotations (quantum gates). Our simulations of a realistic two-particle assembly of CdSe/CdS core/shell NCs demonstrate that such two-qubit gate operations can be driven by optical parametric oscillators with a theoretical error of 0.1%. A strategy for upscaling two-qubit hetero-dimers to N-qubit exciton gates in semiconductor NC assemblies is discussed.

TI Quantum voting protocol without quantum memory
SO FRONTIERS IN PHYSICS
AB Most of the quantum voting protocols are impractical due to the currently limited quantum storage capabilities. In this article, based on the interference principle of light, we proposed a new quantum voting protocol without quantum memory. In our protocol, the ballot is a sequence of non-orthogonal coherent states, the voting information is encoded by implying different phase shifts on the coherent states, and the vote counting is carried out by performing USD measurement on the coherent states. Particularly, the design of USD measurement on coherent states eliminates the need for quantum storage. Our protocol satisfies the general security requirements of quantum voting protocols and can resist various attacks. In addition, our protocol can be implemented by only linear optics and thus can be experimentally achieved with current technology.

TI The semiclassical limit of a quantum Zeno dynamics
SO LETTERS IN MATHEMATICAL PHYSICS
AB Motivated by a quantum Zeno dynamics in a cavity quantum electrodynamics setting, we study the asymptotics of a family of symbols corresponding to a truncated momentum operator, in the semiclassical limit of vanishing Planck constant h -> 0 and large quantum number N -> infinity, with hN kept fixed. In a suitable topology, the limit is the discontinuous symbol p chi(D) (x, p) where chi(D) is the characteristic function of the classically permitted region D in phase space. A refined analysis shows that the symbol is asymptotically close to the function p chi((N))(D) (x, p), where chi((N))(D) is a smooth version of chi(D) related to the integrated Airy function. We also discuss the limit from a dynamical point of view.

TI Non-Hermitian unidirectional routing of photonic qubits
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB Efficient and tunable qubit unidirectional routers and spin-wave diodes play an important role in classical and quantum information processing domains. Here we reveal that multilevel neutral cold atoms can mediate both dissipative and coherent couplings. Interestingly, we investigate and practically implement this paradigm in experiments, successfully synthesizing a system with dual functionality as both a photonic qubit unidirectional router and a spin-wave diode. By manipulating the helicity of the field, we can effectively balance the coherent coupling and the dissipative channel, thereby ensuring the unidirectional transfer of photonic qubits. The qubit fidelity exceeds (97.49 +/- 0.39)%, and the isolation ratio reaches 16.8 +/- 0.11 dB, while the insertion loss is lower than 0.36 dB. Furthermore, we show that the spin-wave diode can effectively achieve unidirectional information transfer by our appropriately setting the coherentcoupling parameters. Our work not only provides ideas for the design of extensive components in quantum network but also opens up possibilities for non-Hermitian quantum physics, complex quantum networks, and unidirectional quantum information transfer.

TI Quantum state transfer and maximal entanglement between distant qubits
   using a minimal quasicrystal pump
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB Coherent quantum state transfer over macroscopic distances between non-neighboring elements in quantum circuits is a crucial component to increase connectivity and simplify quantum information processing. To facilitate such transfers, an efficient and easily controllable quantum pump would be highly beneficial. In this work, we demonstrate such a quantum pump based on a one-dimensional quasicrystal Fibonacci chain (FC). In particular, we utilize the unique properties of quasicrystals to pump the edge-localized winding states between the two distant ends of the chain by only minimal manipulation of the FC at its end points. We establish the necessary conditions for successful state transfer within a fully time-dependent picture and also demonstrate robustness of the transfer protocol against disorder. We then couple external qubits to each end of the FC and establish highly adaptable functionality as a quantum bus with both on-demand switching of the qubit states and generation of maximally entangled Bell states between the qubits. Thanks to the minimal control parameters, the setup is well-suited for implementation across diverse experimental platforms, thus establishing quasicrystals as an efficient platform for versatile quantum information processing.

TI Robustly decorrelating errors with mixed quantum gates
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Coherent errors in quantum operations are ubiquitous. Whether arising from spurious environmental couplings or errors in control fields, such errors can accumulate rapidly and degrade the performance of a quantum circuit significantly more than an average gate fidelity may indicate. As Hastings (2017 Quantum Inf. Comput. 17 488) and Campbell (2017 Phys. Rev. A 95 042306) have recently shown, by replacing the deterministic implementation of a quantum gate with a randomized ensemble of implementations, one can dramatically suppress coherent errors. Our work begins by reformulating the results of Hastings and Campbell as a quantum optimal control problem. We then discuss a family of convex programs able to solve this problem, as well as a set of secondary objectives designed to improve the performance, implementability, and robustness of the resulting mixed quantum gates. Finally, we implement these mixed quantum gates on a superconducting qubit and discuss randomized benchmarking results consistent with a marked reduction in the coherent error.

TI Cryogenic CMOS Circuits and Systems: Challenges and Opportunities in

SO IEEE MICROWAVE MAGAZINE
AB Quantum computing could potentially offer faster solutions for some of today's classically intractable problems using quantum processors as computational support for quantum algorithms [1]. Quantum processors, in the most frequent embodiment, comprise an array of quantum bits (qubits), the fundamental computational unit of a quantum computer. Unlike conventional bits, qubits can take a coherent state ranging from |0 > to |1 > on a continuous sphere, known as the Bloch sphere (Figure 1). When the state of the qubit, represented by a vector on the Bloch sphere, is on the equator of such a sphere, qubits are said to be in maximum superposition. Entanglement is the second important quantum mechanical property of qubit states, where knowing the state of one qubit implies knowing the state of the other one as well.

SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Quantum key distribution (QKD) provides information theoretically secure key exchange requiring authentication of the classic data processing channel via pre-sharing of symmetric private keys to kick-start the process. In previous studies, the lattice-based postquantum digital signature algorithm Aigis-Sig, combined with public-key infrastructure (PKI), was used to achieve high-efficiency quantum security authentication of QKD, and we have demonstrated its advantages in simplifying the MAN network structure and new user entry. This experiment further integrates the PQC algorithm into the commercial QKD system, the Jinan field metropolitan QKD network comprised of 14 user nodes and 5 optical switching nodes, and verifies the feasibility, effectiveness and stability of the post-quantum cryptography (PQC) algorithm and advantages of replacing trusted relays with optical switching brought by PQC authentication large-scale metropolitan area QKD network.

TI Increasing quantum communication rates using hyperentangled photonic
   states
SO OPTICA QUANTUM
AB Quantum communication is based on the generation of quantum states and exploitation of quantum resources for communication protocols. Currently, photons are considered as the optimal carriers of information, because they enable long-distance transition with resilience to decoherence and they are relatively easy to create and detect. Entanglement is a fundamental resource for quantum communication and information processing, and it is of particular importance for quantum repeaters. Hyperentanglement, a state where parties are entangled with two or more degrees of freedom (DoFs) simultaneously, provides an important additional resource because it increases data rates and enhances error resilience. However, in photonics, the channel capacity, i.e., the ultimate throughput, is fundamentally limited when dealing with linear elements. We propose a technique for achieving higher transmission rates for quantum communication by using hyperentangled states, based on multiplexing multiple DoFs on a single photon, transmitting the photon, and eventually demultiplexing the DoFs to different photons at the destination, using Bell state measurements. Following our scheme, one can generate two entangled qubit pairs by sending only a single photon. The proposed transmission scheme lays the groundwork for novel quantum communication protocols with higher transmission rates and refined control over scalable quantum technologies.

TI Realizing multi-qubit controlled nonadiabatic holonomic gates with
   connecting systems
SO AAPPS BULLETIN
AB Multi-qubit controlled gates are frequently used in quantum information processing. Although they can be built with gates from the universal set of one- and two-qubit gates, this procedure typically becomes very demanding as the number of such gates rapidly grows with the size of the computational problem. Thus, finding a way to realize them with fewer steps and therefore with reduced decoherence errors is important. Particularly, quantum information is entering noisy intermediate-scale quantum era and in this era, quantum computers do not have enough resources for full fault tolerance and therefor can only support the computation with a short duration. This makes the reduction of the steps even more important. Here, we propose the realization of multi-qubit controlled nonadiabatic holonomic gates with connecting systems. Our proposal can efficiently reduce the operation steps of the realization, thereby reducing the affection from decoherence and increasing the precision of the computation. So, it is useful to realize efficient and robust quantum information processors.

TI The Concept of Quantum Teleportation for Remote Control of a Car-like
   Mobile Robot
SO ROBOTICS
AB We describe a quantum teleportation protocol for exchanging data between a mobile robot and its control station. Because of the high cost of quantum network systems, we use MATLAB software to simulate the teleportation of data. Our simulation models the dynamic motion of a car-like mobile robot (CLMR), considering its mass and inertia and the environmental viscosity. Our remote control method accurately reproduces a mathematical model of the CLMR's real-world motion. The CLMR's trajectory is represented by differential equations, with the velocity calculated using the Jacobian matrix. The velocity inputs are teleported from the control station to the CLMR, enabling it to move. Nevertheless, physical constraints cause the deviation of the robot's trajectory from the predicted trajectory. To correct this deviation, the CLMR's current position is teleported to the control station. Before implementing this protocol, we calculate the quantum teleportation circuit, and we use quantum gates in matrix form to simulate the data teleportation process. The protocol's accuracy is assessed by comparing the original data and teleported data, and a good match is obtained. This study demonstrates the feasibility of quantum teleportation for remotely controlling real-time robotic systems over long distances and in environments that interfere with classical wireless communication.

TI Conveyor-mode single-electron shuttling in Si/SiGe for a scalable
   quantum computing architecture
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Small spin-qubit registers defined by single electrons confined in Si/SiGe quantum dots operate successfully and connecting these would permit scalable quantum computation. Shuttling the qubit carrying electrons between registers is a natural choice for high-fidelity coherent links provided the overhead of control signals stays moderate. Our proof-of-principle demonstrates shuttling of a single electron by a propagating wave-potential in an electrostatically defined 420 nm long Si/SiGe quantum-channel. This conveyor-mode shuttling approach requires independent from its length only four sinusoidal control signals. We discuss the tuning of the signal parameters, detect the smoothness of the electron motion enabling the mapping of potential disorder and observe a high single-electron shuttling fidelity of 99.42 +/- 0.02% including a reversal of direction. Our shuttling device can be readily embedded in industrial fabrication of Si/SiGe qubit chips and paves the way to solving the signal-fanout problem for a fully scalable semiconductor quantum-computing architecture.

TI Simulating optically active spin defects with a quantum computer
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB There is a pressing need for more accurate computational simulations of the optoelectronic properties of defects in materials to aid in the development of quantum sensing platforms. In this work, we explore how quantum computers could be effectively utilized for this purpose. Specifically, we develop fault-tolerant quantum algorithms to simulate optically active defect states and their radiative emission rates. We employ quantum defect embedding theory to translate the Hamiltonian of a defect-containing supercell into a smaller, effective Hamiltonian that accounts for dielectric screening effects. Our approach integrates block-encoding of the dipole operator with quantum phase estimation to selectively sample the optically active excited states that exhibit the largest dipole transition amplitudes. We also provide estimates of the quantum resources required to simulate a negatively charged boron vacancy in a hexagonal boron nitride cluster. We conclude by offering a forward-looking perspective on the potential of quantum computers to enhance quantum sensor capabilities and identify specific scenarios where quantum computing can resolve problems traditionally challenging for classical computers.

TI Discrete-Modulated Continuous-Variable Quantum Key Distribution in
   Satellite-to-Ground Communication
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB Satellite-to-ground quantum communication constitutes the cornerstone of the global quantum network, heralding the advent of the future of quantum information. Continuous-variable quantum key distribution is a strong candidate for the space-ground quantum communication due to its simplicity, stability, and ease of implementation, especially for the robustness of space background light noise. Recently, the discrete-modulated continuous-variable protocol has garnered increased attention, owing to its lower implementation requirements, acceptable security key rate, and pronounced compatibility with extant infrastructures. Here, key rates are derived for discrete-modulated continuous-variable quantum key distribution protocols in free-space channel environments across various conditions through numerical simulation, revealing the viability of its application in satellite-to-ground communication.
   Discrete-modulated continuous-variable quantum key distribution protocols have significant application potential, as they inherit the compatibility of modern optical facilities from Gaussian-modulation protocols while reducing the requirements on modulation devices. This study investigates the feasibility of utilizing these protocols in satellite-based communication, leading toward the exciting prospect of a global quantum network. image

TI Efficient quantum circuits for machine learning activation functions
   including constant T-depth ReLU
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB In recent years, Quantum Machine Learning (QML) has increasingly captured the interest of researchers. Among the components in this domain, activation functions hold a fundamental and indispensable role. Our research focuses on the development of activation functions quantum circuits for integration into fault-tolerant quantum computing architectures, with an emphasis on minimizing T-depth. Specifically, we present novel implementations of ReLU and leaky ReLU activation functions, achieving constant T-depths of 4 and 8, respectively. Leveraging quantum lookup tables, we extend our exploration to other activation functions such as the sigmoid. This approach enables us to customize precision and T-depth by adjusting the number of qubits, making our results more adaptable to various application scenarios. This study represents a significant advancement towards enhancing the practicality and application of quantum machine learning.

TI Penning micro-trap for quantum computing
SO NATURE
AB Trapped ions in radio-frequency traps are among the leading approaches for realizing quantum computers, because of high-fidelity quantum gates and long coherence times1-3. However, the use of radio-frequencies presents several challenges to scaling, including requiring compatibility of chips with high voltages4, managing power dissipation5 and restricting transport and placement of ions6. Here we realize a micro-fabricated Penning ion trap that removes these restrictions by replacing the radio-frequency field with a 3 T magnetic field. We demonstrate full quantum control of an ion in this setting, as well as the ability to transport the ion arbitrarily in the trapping plane above the chip. This unique feature of the Penning micro-trap approach opens up a modification of the quantum charge-coupled device architecture with improved connectivity and flexibility, facilitating the realization of large-scale trapped-ion quantum computing, quantum simulation and quantum sensing.

TI Transmission of quantum information through quantum fields in curved

SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS A-MATHEMATICAL AND THEORETICAL
AB We construct a relativistic quantum communication channel between two localized qubit systems, mediated by a relativistic quantum field, that can achieve the theoretical maximum for the quantum capacity in arbitrary curved spacetimes using the Unruh-DeWitt detector formalism. Using techniques from algebraic quantum field theory, we express the quantum capacity of the quantum communication channel purely in terms of the correlation functions of the field and the causal propagator for the wave equation. Consequently, the resulting quantum channel, and hence the quantum capacity, are by construction manifestly covariant, respect the causal structure of spacetime, and are independent of the details of the background geometry, topology, and the choice of Hilbert space (quasifree) representations of the field.

TI Astronomical interferometry using continuous variable quantum
   teleportation
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB We propose a method to build an astronomical interferometer using continuous-variable quantum teleportation to overcome transmission loss between distant telescopes. The scheme relies on two-mode squeezed states shared by distant telescopes as entanglement resources, which are distributed using continuous-variable quantum repeaters. We find the optimal measurement on the teleported states, which uses beam splitters and photon-number-resolved detection. Compared to prior proposals relying on discrete states, our scheme has the advantages of using linear optics to implement it without wasting stellar photons, and making use of multiphoton events, which are regarded as noise in previous discrete schemes. We also outline the parameter regimes in which our scheme outperforms the direct detection method, schemes utilizing distributed discrete-variable entangled states, and local heterodyne techniques.

SO QUANTUM REPORTS
AB We demonstrate a quantum processor based on a 3D linear Paul trap that uses Yb+171 ions with eight individually controllable four-level qudits (ququarts), which is computationally equivalent to a sixteen-qubit quantum processor. The design of the developed ion trap provides high secular frequencies and a low heating rate, which, together with individual addressing and readout optical systems, allows executing quantum algorithms. In each of the eight ions, we use four electronic levels coupled by E2 optical transition at 435 nm for qudit encoding. We present the results of single- and two-qubit operations benchmarking and realizing basic quantum algorithms, including the Bernstein-Vazirani and Grover's search algorithms as well as H2 and LiH molecular simulations. Our results pave the way to scalable qudit-based quantum processors using trapped ions.

TI Molecular Energy Landscapes of Hardware-Efficient Ansa?tze in Quantum

SO JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL THEORY AND COMPUTATION
AB Rapid advances in quantum computing have opened up new opportunities for solving the central electronic structure problem in computational chemistry. In the noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) era, where qubit coherence times are limited, it is essential to exploit quantum algorithms with sufficiently short quantum circuits to maximize qubit efficiency. The procedural construction of hardware efficient ansa''tze provides one approach to design such circuits. However, refining the accuracy of the global minimum by increasing circuit depth may lead to a proliferation of local minima that hinders global optimization. To investigate this phenomenon, we explore the energy landscapes of hardware-efficient circuits to identify ground-state energies of the hydrogen, lithium hydride, and beryllium hydride molecules. We also propose a simple dimensionality reduction procedure that reduces quantum gate depth while retaining high accuracy for the global minimum, simplifying the energy landscape, and hence speeding up optimization from both software and hardware perspectives.

AB The effective use of current Noisy IntermediateScale Quantum (NISQ) devices is often limited by the noise which is caused by interaction with the environment and affects the fidelity of quantum gates. In transmon qubit systems, the quantum gate fidelity can be improved by applying control pulses that can minimize the effects of the environmental noise. In this work, we employ physics-guided quantum optimal control strategies to design optimal pulses driving quantum gates on superconducting qubit systems. We test our results by conducting experiments on the IBM quantum hardware using their OpenPulse API. We compare the performance of our pulse-optimized quantum gates against the default quantum gates and show that the optimized pulses improve the fidelity of the quantum gates, in particular the single-qubit gates. We discuss the challenges we encountered in our work and point to possible future improvements.

TI EntangleNetSat: A Satellite-Based Entanglement Resupply Network
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB In the practical context of quantum networks, quantum teleportation plays a key role in transmitting quantum information. In the process of teleportation, a maximally entangled pair is consumed. Through this paper, an efficient scheme of re-establishing entanglement between different nodes in a quantum network is explored. A hybrid land-satellite network is considered, where the land-based links are used for short-range communication, and the satellite links are used for transmissions between distant nodes. This new scheme explores many different possibilities of resupplying the land nodes with entangled pairs, depending on: the position of the satellites, the number of pairs available and the distance between the nodes themselves. As to make the entire process as efficient as possible, we consider the situations of direct transmissions of entangled photons and also the transmissions making use of entanglement swapping. An analysis is presented for concrete scenarios, sustained by numerical data.

TI Deploying an Inter-European Quantum Network
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB Around 40 years have passed since the first pioneering works introduced the possibility of using quantum physics to enhance communications safety. Nowadays, quantum key distribution (QKD) exited the physics laboratories to become a mature technology, triggering the attention of States, military forces, banks, and private corporations. This work takes on the challenge of bringing QKD closer to a consumer technology: deployed optical fibers by telecommunication companies of different States have been used to realize a quantum network, the first-ever connecting three different countries. This work also emphasizes the necessity of networks where QKD can come up besides classical communications, whose coexistence currently represents the main limitation of this technology. This network connects Trieste to Rijeka and Ljubljana via a trusted node in Postojna. A key rate of over 3 kbps in the shortest link and a 7-hour-long measurement demonstrate the system's stability and reliability. The network has been used to present the QKD at the G20 Digital Ministers' Meeting in Trieste. The experimental results, together with the interest that one of the most important events of international politics has attracted, showcase the maturity of the QKD technology bundle, placing it in the spotlight for consumer applications in the near term.

TI A flexible continuous-wave quantum cryptography scheme with zero-trust
   security for Internet of Things
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISTRIBUTED SENSOR NETWORKS
AB As quantum computing techniques develop rapidly, the security of classical communication, which is usually based on public key encryption algorithm, is under great threat. Therefore, a key establishment method with physics base is demanding, especially for Internet of Things devices, where energy and computational power is quite limited. In this article, we present a flexible continuous-wave quantum cryptography scheme for Internet of Things systems. In this configuration, the IoT controller contains a narrow linewidth laser as a real local oscillator. Thus, it is capable of working as either a host or a client in quantum key distribution with remote servers, and efficiently generating quantum random numbers for quantum key distribution, as well as one time pad communication with deployed sensors. The security of the scheme is analyzed under the assumption of collective attacks in the asymptotic regime, and feasibility is theoretically verified with typical channel and commercial device parameters.

TI Correcting Coherent Errors by Random Operation on Actual Quantum
   Hardware
SO ENTROPY
AB Characterizing and mitigating errors in current noisy intermediate-scale devices is important to improve the performance of the next generation of quantum hardware. To investigate the importance of the different noise mechanisms affecting quantum computation, we performed a full quantum process tomography of single qubits in a real quantum processor in which echo experiments are implemented. In addition to the sources of error already included in the standard models, the obtained results show the dominant role of coherent errors, which we practically corrected by inserting random single-qubit unitaries in the quantum circuit, significantly increasing the circuit length over which quantum computations on actual quantum hardware produce reliable results.

AB Energy storage systems and home energy management and control systems will play an important role in reaching the Paris Agreement on climate change. Underlying scheduling mechanisms will lead to a computational burden when the size of the systems and the size of the control space increase. One, upcoming alternative to overcome this computational burden is quantum computing. Here a quantum computer is used to solve the scheduling problems. In this paper an approach of using the D-Wave quantum annealing to solve an energy storage scheduling problem is proposed and used to solve a small example. The example shows the potential that quantum computing can have in this area in the future.

AB Quantum sensing electronic sensing is opening up new cutting -edge possibilities to take advantage of complex quantum mechanical variables to make incredibly sensitive assessments of an array of parameters. Concurrently, there are new prospects for quantum sensing electronics to be used to enhance the processes involved in creating, distributing, and utilizing energy. To use this technology efficiently, it is necessary to handle issues related to sensing material such as stability and operation, reliable monitoring, and precision in sensing and assessment. In this direction, the present is an overview of existing and new quantum sensing materials and methods, along with the related sensing frameworks that have been created to support their advanced translational applications.

AB Superconducting quantum devices are a leading technology for quantum computation, but they face several challenges. Gate errors, coherence errors and a lack of connectivity all contribute to low fidelity results. In particular, connectivity restrictions enforce a gate set that requires three-qubit gates to be decomposed into one- or two-qubit gates. This substantially increases the number of two-qubit gates that need to be executed. However, many quantum devices have access to higher energy levels. We can expand the qubit abstraction of vertical bar 0 > and vertical bar 1 > to a ququart which has access to the vertical bar 2 > and vertical bar 3 > state, but with shorter coherence times. This allows for two qubits to be encoded in one ququart, enabling increased virtual connectivity between physical units from two adjacent qubits to four fully connected qubits. This connectivity scheme allows us to more efficiently execute three-qubit gates natively between two physical devices.
   We present direct-to-pulse implementations of several three-qubit gates, synthesized via optimal control, for compilation of three-qubit gates onto a superconducting-based architecture with access to four-level devices with the first experimental demonstration of four-level ququart gates designed through optimal control. We demonstrate strategies that temporarily use higher level states to perform Toffoli gates and always use higher level states to improve fidelities for quantum circuits. We find that these methods improve expected fidelities with increases of 2x across circuit sizes using intermediate encoding, and increases of 3x for fully-encoded ququart compilation.

TI Filter-enhanced adiabatic quantum computing on a digital quantum
   processor
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Eigenstate filters underpin near-optimal quantum algorithms for ground-state preparation. Their realization on current quantum computers, however, poses a challenge as the filters are typically represented by deep quantum circuits. Additionally, since the filters are created probabilistically, their circuits need to be rerun many times when the associated success probability is small. Here, we describe a strategy to implement a ground-state filter on quantum hardware in the presence of noise by prepending the filter with digitized adiabatic quantum computing. The adiabatically prepared input state increases the success probability of the filter and also reduces its circuit depth requirements. At the same time, the filter enhances the accuracy of the adiabatically prepared ground state. We compare the approach to the purely adiabatic protocol through numerical simulations and experiments on the Quantinuum H1-1 quantum computer. We demonstrate a significant improvement in groundstate accuracies for paradigmatic quantum spin models.

TI Markov chain Monte Carlo enhanced variational quantum algorithms
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Variational quantum algorithms have the potential for significant impact on high-dimensional optimization, with applications in classical combinatorics, quantum chemistry, and condensed matter. Nevertheless, the optimization landscape of these algorithms is generally nonconvex, leading the algorithms to converge to local, rather than global, minima and the production of suboptimal solutions. In this work, we introduce a variational quantum algorithm that couples classical Markov chain Monte Carlo techniques with variational quantum algorithms, allowing the former to provably converge to global minima and thus assure solution quality. Due to the generality of our approach, it is suitable for a myriad of quantum minimization problems, including optimization and quantum state preparation. Specifically, we devise a Metropolis-Hastings method that is suitable for variational quantum devices and use it, in conjunction with quantum optimization, to construct quantum ensembles that converge to Gibbs states. These performance guarantees are derived from the ergodicity of our algorithm's state space and enable us to place analytic bounds on its time-complexity. We demonstrate both the effectiveness of our technique and the validity of our analysis through quantum circuit simulations for MaxCut instances, solving these problems deterministically and with perfect accuracy, as well as large-scale quantum Ising and transverse field spin models of up to 50 qubits. Our technique stands to broadly enrich the field of variational quantum algorithms, improving and guaranteeing the performance of these promising, yet often heuristic, methods.

TI Statistical Signatures of Quantum Contextuality
SO ENTROPY
AB Quantum contextuality describes situations where the statistics observed in different measurement contexts cannot be explained by a measurement of the independent reality of the system. The most simple case is observed in a three-dimensional Hilbert space, with five different measurement contexts related to each other by shared measurement outcomes. The quantum formalism defines the relations between these contexts in terms of well-defined relations between operators, and these relations can be used to reconstruct an unknown quantum state from a finite set of measurement results. Here, I introduce a reconstruction method based on the relations between the five measurement contexts that can violate the bounds of non-contextual statistics. A complete description of an arbitrary quantum state requires only five of the eight elements of a Kirkwood-Dirac quasiprobability, but only an overcomplete set of eleven elements provides an unbiased description of all five contexts. A set of five fundamental relations between the eleven elements reveals a deterministic structure that links the five contexts. As illustrated by a number of examples, these relations provide a consistent description of contextual realities for the measurement outcomes of all five contexts.

TI Fault-Tolerant Stabilizer Measurements in Surface Codes with Three-Qubit
   Gates
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Stabilizer quantum error correction (QEC) codes, in particular topological surface codes, are prime candidates to enable practical quantum computing. While it is widely believed that strictly fault-tolerant protocols can only be implemented using single- and two-qubit gates, several quantum computing platforms, including trapped ions, neutral atoms, and superconducting qubits, support native multi-qubit operations. In this Letter, we show that stabilizer measurement circuits for unrotated surface codes can be fault tolerant using single auxiliary qubits and three-qubit gates. These gates enable lower-depth circuits with fewer fault locations and potentially shorter QEC cycle times. We find that in an optimistic parameter regime where fidelities of three-qubit gates are the same as those of two-qubit gates, the logical error rate can be up to one order of magnitude lower and the threshold significantly higher, increasing from approximate to 0.63% to approximate to 0.83%. Our results, applicable to a wide range of platforms, motivate further investigation into multiqubit gates for fault-tolerant QEC as they can offer substantial time and physical qubit resource advantages to reach a given target logical error rate.

TI Quantum computing and the implementation of precision medicine
SO NPJ GENOMIC MEDICINE
AB Precision medicine aims to tailor healthcare by integrating individual genetic, epigenetic, transcriptomic, proteomic, and clinical data, collectively referred to as multi-omic data. However, the scale and complexity of such multi-omics datasets challenge classical computing approaches. Quantum computing, which leverages superposition and entanglement (quantum-level correlations between particles), offers a fundamentally new paradigm for accelerating molecular simulations, biomarker discovery, and high-dimensional data analysis. This review explores the convergence of quantum computing and it's potential to provide unmet needs in precision biomedicine research, with emphasis on applications in diagnostic modeling, multi-omic data integration and drug discovery. We highlight early proof-of-concept studies demonstrating the use of quantum machine learning for disease prediction, quantum algorithms for protein folding, and quantum generative models for novel drug design. Hybrid quantum-classical workflows are also already enabling gene network inference and prioritization of variants of uncertain significance, the latter of which is a major focus of multi-omic research worldwide. Emerging directions include digital twin simulations and real-time clinical decision support powered by quantum models. Looking ahead, the long-term vision for quantum computing in biomedicine involves in silico modeling of entire biological systems to simulate cellular responses to perturbations like drug treatments, enabling clinicians to test therapies in virtual patients before real-world application. Despite these advances, practical implementation remains limited by hardware constraints, qubit decoherence, algorithm scalability, and regulatory barriers. Nonetheless, as quantum hardware evolves and AI-aligned quantum algorithms mature, their integration holds transformative potential. Quantum computing may eventually shorten diagnostic timelines, improve therapeutic precision, and make biomedical innovation more globally accessible. We outline a roadmap for translating these technologies into next-generation precision medicine.

TI Detection of entanglement during pure dephasing evolutions for systems
   and environments of any size
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We generalize the scheme for detection of qubit-environment entanglement to qudit-environment systems. This is of relevance for many-qubit systems and the quantification of the operation of quantum algorithms under the influence of external noise, since only decoherence that is not entangling in its nature can be effectively described by quantum channels and similar methods in more complicated scenarios. The generalization involves an increase in the class of entangled states which are not detected by the scheme, but the type of entanglement which cannot be detected is also least likely to qualitatively influence decoherence. We exemplify the operation of the scheme on a realistically modeled nitrogen-vacancy-center spin qutrit interacting with an environment of nuclear spins.

TI Deterministic generation of high-dimensional entanglement between
   distant atomic memories via multiphoton exchange
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Promising access to high-speed quantum networks relies on the creation of high-dimensional entangled memories that provide quantum communication with higher capacity of noisy quantum channels, thereby reducing the transmission time of information. Yet, the distribution of multidimensional entanglement between remote memory nodes is still faintly investigated. We propose an experimentally feasible protocol of deterministic generation of high-dimensional entanglement between distant multilevel atoms confined in high-finesse optical cavities and driven by laser pulses. Three-dimensional entanglement is generated deterministically between remote atoms by triggering a two-photon wave packet, which mediates a superposition of states chosen by the laser pulse parameters. The efficient transfer of atomic states between remote nodes allows the construction of a three-dimensional quantum repeater, where the successful creation of entanglement can be verified by a simple method for reliable measurement of atomic ground Zeeman states.

TI CMOS-based cryogenic control of silicon quantum circuits
SO NATURE
AB The most promising quantum algorithms require quantum processors that host millions of quantum bits when targeting practical applications(1). A key challenge towards large-scale quantum computation is the interconnect complexity. In current solid-state qubit implementations, an important interconnect bottleneck appears between the quantum chip in a dilution refrigerator and the room-temperature electronics. Advanced lithography supports the fabrication of both control electronics and qubits in silicon using technology compatible with complementary metal oxide semiconductors (CMOS)(2). When the electronics are designed to operate at cryogenic temperatures, they can ultimately be integrated with the qubits on the same die or package, overcoming the 'wiring bottleneck'(3-6). Here we report a cryogenic CMOS control chip operating at 3 kelvin, which outputs tailored microwave bursts to drive silicon quantum bits cooled to 20 millikelvin. We first benchmark the control chip and find an electrical performance consistent with qubit operations of 99.99 per cent fidelity, assuming ideal qubits. Next, we use it to coherently control actual qubits encoded in the spin of single electrons confined in silicon quantum dots(7-9) and find that the cryogenic control chip achieves the same fidelity as commercial instruments at room temperature. Furthermore, we demonstrate the capabilities of the control chip by programming a number of benchmarking protocols, as well as the Deutsch-Josza algorithm(10), on a two-qubit quantum processor. These results open up the way towards a fully integrated, scalable silicon-based quantum computer.
   A cryogenic CMOS control chip operating at 3 K is used to demonstrate coherent control and simple algorithms on silicon qubits operating at 20 mK.

TI Compact quantum kernel-based binary classifier
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Quantum computing opens exciting opportunities for kernel-based machine learning methods, which have broad applications in data analysis. Recent works show that quantum computers can efficiently construct a model of a classifier by engineering the quantum interference effect to carry out the kernel evaluation in parallel. For practical applications of these quantum machine learning methods, an important issue is to minimize the size of quantum circuits. We present the simplest quantum circuit for constructing a kernel-based binary classifier. This is achieved by generalizing the interference circuit to encode data labels in the relative phases of the quantum state and by introducing compact amplitude encoding, which encodes two training data vectors into one quantum register. When compared to the simplest known quantum binary classifier, the number of qubits is reduced by two and the number of steps is reduced linearly with respect to the number of training data. The two-qubit measurement with post-selection required in the previous method is simplified to single-qubit measurement. Furthermore, the final quantum state has a smaller amount of entanglement than that of the previous method, which advocates the cost-effectiveness of our method. Our design also provides a straightforward way to handle an imbalanced data set, which is often encountered in many machine learning problems.

TI Two Quantum Proxy Blind Signature Schemes Based on Controlled Quantum
   Teleportation
SO ENTROPY
AB We present a scheme for teleporting an unknown, two-particle entangled state with a message from a sender (Alice) to a receiver (Bob) via a six-particle entangled channel. We also present another scheme for teleporting an unknown one-particle entangled state with a message transmitted in a two-way form between the same sender and receiver via a five-qubit cluster state. One-way hash functions, Bell-state measurements, and unitary operations are adopted in these two schemes. Our schemes use the physical characteristics of quantum mechanics to implement delegation, signature, and verification processes. Moreover, a quantum key distribution protocol and a one-time pad are adopted in these schemes.

TI Generalizing multipartite concentratable entanglement for practical
   applications: mixed, qudit and optical states
SO PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY A-MATHEMATICAL PHYSICAL
   AND ENGINEERING SCIENCES
AB The controlled SWAP test for detecting and quantifying entanglement applied to pure qubit states is robust to small errors in the states and efficient for large multi-qubit states (Foulds et al. 2021 Quantum Sci. Technol. 6, 035002 (doi:10.1088/2058-9565/abe458)). We extend this, and the related measure concentratable entanglement (CE), to enable important practical applications in quantum information processing. We investigate the lower bound of concentratable entanglement given in (Beckey et al. 2023 Phys. Rev. A 107, 062425 (doi:10.1103/physreva.107.062425)) and conjecture an upper bound of the mixed-state concentratable entanglement that is robust to c-SWAP test errors. Since experimental states are always slightly mixed, our work makes the c-SWAP test and CE measure suitable for application in experiments to characterize entanglement. We further present the CE of some key higher-dimensional states such as qudit states and entangled optical states to validate the CE as a higher-dimensional measure of entanglement.This article is part of the theme issue 'The quantum theory of light'.

AB Entanglement routing (ER) in quantum networks must guarantee entanglement fidelity, a property that is crucial for applications such as quantum key distribution, quantum computation, and quantum sensing. Conventional ER approaches assume that network links can only generate entanglements with a fixed fidelity, and then they rely on purification to improve endto-end fidelities. However, recent advances in entanglement generation technologies show that quantum links can be configured by choosing among different fidelity/entanglement-rate combinations (defined in this paper as link configurations), hence enabling a more flexible assignment of quantum-network resources for meeting specific application requirements. To exploit this opportunity, we introduce the problem of link configuration for fidelity-constrained routing and purification (LC-FCRP) in Quantum Networks. We first formulate a simplified FCRP version as a Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) model, where the link fidelity can be adjusted within a finite set. Then, to explore the full space of possible link configurations, we propose a link configuration algorithm based on a novel shortest-pathbased fidelity determination (SPFD) algorithm w/o Bayesian Optimization, which can be applied on top of any existing ER algorithm. Numerical results demonstrate that link configuration improves the acceptance ratio of existing ER algorithms by 87%.

TI Distributed quantum computing across an optical network link
SO NATURE
AB Distributed quantum computing (DQC) combines the computing power of multiple networked quantum processing modules, ideally enabling the execution of large quantum circuits without compromising performance or qubit connectivity1,2. Photonic networks are well suited as a versatile and reconfigurable interconnect layer for DQC; remote entanglement shared between matter qubits across the network enables all-to-all logical connectivity through quantum gate teleportation (QGT)3,4. For a scalable DQC architecture, the QGT implementation must be deterministic and repeatable; until now, no demonstration has satisfied these requirements. Here we experimentally demonstrate the distribution of quantum computations between two photonically interconnected trapped-ion modules. The modules, separated by about two metres, each contain dedicated network and circuit qubits. By using heralded remote entanglement between the network qubits, we deterministically teleport a controlled-Z (CZ) gate between two circuit qubits in separate modules, achieving 86% fidelity. We then execute Grover's search algorithm5-to our knowledge, the first implementation of a distributed quantum algorithm comprising several non-local two-qubit gates-and measure a 71% success rate. Furthermore, we implement distributed iSWAP and SWAP circuits, compiled with two and three instances of QGT, respectively, demonstrating the ability to distribute arbitrary two-qubit operations6. As photons can be interfaced with a variety of systems, the versatile DQC architecture demonstrated here provides a viable pathway towards large-scale quantum computing for a range of physical platforms.

TI Resilience-runtime tradeoff relations for quantum algorithms
SO REPORTS ON PROGRESS IN PHYSICS
AB A leading approach to algorithm design aims to minimize the number of operations in an algorithm's compilation. One intuitively expects that reducing the number of operations may decrease the chance of errors. This paradigm is particularly prevalent in quantum computing, where gates are hard to implement and noise rapidly decreases a quantum computer's potential to outperform classical computers. Here, we find that minimizing the number of operations in a quantum algorithm can be counterproductive, leading to a noise sensitivity that induces errors when running the algorithm in non-ideal conditions. To show this, we develop a framework to characterize the resilience of an algorithm to perturbative noises (including coherent errors, dephasing, and depolarizing noise). Some compilations of an algorithm can be resilient against certain noise sources while being unstable against other noises. We condense these results into a tradeoff relation between an algorithm's number of operations and its noise resilience. We also show how this framework can be leveraged to identify compilations of an algorithm that are better suited to withstand certain noises.

TI Qudit Shadow Estimation Based on the Clifford Group and the Power of a
   Single Magic Gate
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Shadow estimation is a sample-efficient protocol for learning the properties of a quantum system using randomized measurements, but the current understanding of qudit shadow estimation is quite limited compared with the qubit setting. Here, we clarify the sample complexity of qudit shadow estimation based on the Clifford group, where the local dimension d is an odd prime. Notably, we show that the overhead of qudit shadow estimation over the qubit counterpart is only O(d), which is independent of the qudit number n, although the set of stabilizer states may deviate exponentially from a 3-design with respect to the third moment operator. Furthermore, by adding one layer of magic gates, we propose a simple circuit that can significantly boost the efficiency. Actually, a single magic gate can already eliminate the O(d) overhead in qudit shadow estimation and bridge the gap from the qubit setting.

TI Broadcast of a restricted set of qubit and qutrit states
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB The no-cloning theorem forbids the distribution of an unknown state to more than one receiver. However, if the sender knows the state, and the state is chosen from a restricted set of possibilities, a procedure known as remote state preparation can be used to broadcast a state. Here we examine a remote state preparation protocol that can be used to send the state of a qubit, confined to the equator of the Bloch sphere, to an arbitrary number of receivers. The entanglement cost is less than that of using teleportation to accomplish the same task. We present a number of variations on this task, probabilistically sending an unknown qubit state to two receivers, sending different qubit states to two receivers, and sending qutrit states to two receivers. Finally, we discuss some applications of these protocols.

TI Nonunitary quantum machine learning
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB We introduce several probabilistic quantum algorithms that overcome the normal unitary restrictions in quantum machine learning by leveraging the linear combination of unitaries (LCU) method. We cover three distinct topics, beginning with quantum native implementations of residual networks (ResNets). We demonstrate that while residual connections between layers of a variational Ansatz can prevent barren plateaus in models, this approach is accompanied by a trade-off in success probability. Second, we implement a quantum analogue of average-pooling layers from convolutional networks using single-qubitcontrolled basic arithmetic operators and show that the LCU success probability remains stable for the Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology (MNIST) database. This method can be further generalized to convolutional filters, while using exponentially fewer controlled unitaries than previous approaches. Finally, we propose a general framework for applying a linear combination of irreducible-subspace projections on quantum encoded data for any finite group. This enables a quantum state to remain within an exponentially large space, while selectively amplifying specific subspaces relative to others, alleviating simulability concerns that arise when fully projecting to a polynomially sized subspace. We demonstrate improved classification performance for partially amplified permutation-invariant encoded point-cloud data when compared to noninvariant or fully permutation-invariant encodings. We also demonstrate a novel rotationally invariant encoding for point-cloud data via Schur-Weyl duality. These quantum computing frameworks are all constructed using the LCU method, suggesting that further novel quantum machine-learning (QML) algorithms could be created by utilizing the LCU technique.

TI A Verified Optimizer for Quantum Circuits
SO ACM TRANSACTIONS ON PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES AND SYSTEMS

Quantum circuits are expressed as programs in a simple, low-level language called sqir, a small quantum intermediate representation, which is deeply embedded in Coq. Optimizations and other transformations are expressed as Coq functions, which are proved correct with respect to a semantics of sqir programs. sqir programs denote complex-valued matrices, as is standard in quantum computation, but we treat matrices symbolically to reason about programs that use an arbitrary number of quantum bits. sqir's careful design and our provided automation make it possible to write and verify a broad range of optimizations in voqc, including full-circuit transformations from cutting-edge optimizers.

AB This paper presents the development and implementation of a versatile ad-hoc metropolitan-range quantum key distribution (QKD) network. The approach presented integrates various types of physical channels and QKD protocols, and a mix of trusted nodes and intermodal coupling. Unlike conventional QKD networks that predominantly depend on either fiber-based or free-space optical (FSO) links, the testbed presented incorporates FSO and fiber-based links, thereby overcoming some inherent limitations. Various network deployment strategies have been considered, including permanent infrastructure and provisional ad-hoc links to eradicate coverage gaps. Furthermore, the ability to rapidly establish a network using portable FSO terminals and to investigate diverse link topologies is demonstrated. The study also showcases the successful establishment of a quantum-secured link to a cloud server.

AB Port-based teleportation (PBT) represents a variation of the standard quantum teleportation and is currently being employed and explored within the field of quantum information processing owing to its various applications. In this study, we focus on PBT protocol when the resource state is disrupted by local Pauli noises. Here, we fully characterise the channel of the noisy PBT protocol using Krauss representation. Especially, by exploiting the application of PBT for entanglement distribution necessary in realizing quantum networks, we investigate entanglement transmission through this protocol for each qubit considering noisy resource states, denoted as port-based entanglement teleportation (PBET). Finally, we derive upper and lower bounds for the teleported entanglement as a function of the initial entanglement and the noises. Our study demonstrates that quantum entanglement can be efficiently distributed by protocols utilizing large-sized resource states in the presence of noise and is expected to serve as a reliable guide for developing optimized PBET protocols. To obtain these results, we address that the order of entanglement of two qubit states is preserved through the local Pauli channel, and identify the boundaries of entanglement loss through this teleportation channel.

TI Complexity analysis of quantum teleportation via different entangled
   channels in the presence of noise
SO IET QUANTUM COMMUNICATION
AB Quantum communication is an integral part of quantum computing, where teleportation of a quantum state has gained significant attention from researchers. Many teleportation schemes have been introduced in the recent past. In this study, the authors compare the teleportation of a single-qubit message among different entangled channels such as the two-qubit Bell channel, three-qubit GHZ channel, two/three-qubit cluster states, a highly entangled five-qubit state (Brown et al.) and the six-qubit state (Borras et al.). The authors calculate and compare the quantum costs for these channels. The authors also study the effects of six noise models: bit-flip noise, phase-flip noise, bit-phase-flip noise, amplitude damping, phase damping and depolarising error. These noise models may affect the communication channel used for teleportation. An investigation of the variation of the initial state's fidelity is performed for the teleported state in the presence of the noise model. It is observed that the fidelity decreases in all the entangled channels as the noise parameter eta increases in the range [0, 0.5] for all the noise models. The fidelity shows an upward trend in the Bell, GHZ and three-qubit cluster state channels, as eta varies in the range [0.5, 1.0] for all the noise models. However, in the rest of the three channels, the fidelity substantially decreases in the case of amplitude damping, phase damping and depolarising noise, and even it reaches zero for eta = 1 in Brown et al. and Borras et al. channels.

TI High-dimensional quantum key distribution with Qubit-like states
SO COMMUNICATIONS PHYSICS
AB Quantum key distribution (QKD) protocols most often use two conjugate bases in order to verify the security of the quantum channel. In the majority of protocols, these bases are mutually unbiased to one another, which is to say they are formed from balanced superpositions of the entire set of states in the opposing basis. Here, we introduce a high-dimensional QKD protocol using qubit-like states, referred to as Fourier-qubits (or F-qubits). In our scheme, each F-qubit is a superposition of only two computational basis states with a relative phase that can take d distinct values, where d is the dimension of the computational basis. This non-mutually-unbiased approach allows us to bound the information leaked to an eavesdropper, maintaining security in high-dimensional quantum systems despite the states' seemingly two-dimensional nature. By simplifying state preparation and measurement, our protocol offers a practical alternative for secure high-dimensional quantum communications. We experimentally demonstrate this protocol for a noisy high-dimensional QKD channel using the orbital angular momentum degree of freedom of light and discuss the potential benefits for encoding in other degrees of freedom.

TI Efficient quantum algorithm for solving structured problems via
   multistep quantum computation
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB In classical computation, a problem can be solved in multiple steps where the calculated results of each step can be copied and used repeatedly. However, in quantum computation, it is difficult to realize a similar multistep computation process because the no-cloning theorem forbids making copies of an unknown quantum state perfectly. We find a method based on a quantum resonant transition to protect and reuse an unknown quantum state that encodes the calculated results of an intermediate step without copying it, and present a quantum algorithm that solves a problem via multistep quantum computation. We demonstrate that this algorithm can solve a type of structured search problems efficiently.

TI Quantum Machine Learning for Credit Scoring
SO MATHEMATICS
AB This study investigates the integration of quantum circuits with classical neural networks for enhancing credit scoring for small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). We introduce a hybrid quantum-classical model, focusing on the synergy between quantum and classical rather than comparing the performance of separate quantum and classical models. Our model incorporates a quantum layer into a traditional neural network, achieving notable reductions in training time. We apply this innovative framework to a binary classification task with a proprietary real-world classical credit default dataset for SMEs in Singapore. The results indicate that our hybrid model achieves efficient training, requiring significantly fewer epochs (350) compared to its classical counterpart (3500) for a similar predictive accuracy. However, we observed a decrease in performance when expanding the model beyond 12 qubits or when adding additional quantum classifier blocks. This paper also considers practical challenges faced when deploying such models on quantum simulators and actual quantum computers. Overall, our quantum-classical hybrid model for credit scoring reveals its potential in industry, despite encountering certain scalability limitations and practical challenges.

TI Quantum Finance: Exploring the Implications of Quantum Computing on
   Financial Models
SO COMPUTATIONAL ECONOMICS
AB Quantum computing is revolutionizing computational methods in finance by enhancing efficiency and accuracy in financial modeling and risk management. This review explores the impact of quantum computing in finance, focusing on derivative pricing, risk management, and portfolio optimization. It analyzes the benefits, limitations, and future implications of integrating quantum technologies with classical financial systems. A comprehensive review of quantum Monte Carlo methods, quantum algorithms, and their financial applications was conducted. Theoretical foundations, including Chebyshev's inequality and Grover's search method, were evaluated for their role in enhancing sampling efficiency and predictive accuracy. Empirical studies and use cases demonstrate the practical implications of quantum computing in pricing financial derivatives and managing risk through Value at Risk and Conditional Value at Risk assessments. The critical findings reveal that Quantum Monte Carlo algorithms provide substantial efficiency gains, reducing sample size requirements by up to fourfold compared to classical methods. Techniques employed in prior studies highlight the effectiveness of Quantum Amplitude Estimation for derivative pricing and risk analysis. However, challenges persist in scalability, data quality, integration with classical systems, and compliance with regulatory standards. This research contributes to the current body of knowledge by providing a comprehensive analysis of quantum algorithms' practical applications in derivative pricing, risk management, and portfolio optimization, demonstrating the efficiency gains and limitations of quantum approaches. Future research should explore hybrid quantum-classical frameworks, quantum applications in blockchain, and enhanced quantum cryptography to ensure secure and efficient financial transactions.

TI Signatures of Open and Noisy Quantum Systems in Single-Qubit Quantum
   Annealing
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB We propose a quantum annealing protocol that effectively probes the dynamics of a single qubit on D-Wave's quantum annealing hardware. This protocol uses D-Wave's h-gain schedule functionality, which allows the rapid suppression of the longitudinal magnetic field at arbitrary points during the anneal. This feature enables us to distinguish between open and closed-system dynamics as well as the presence and absence of longitudinal magnetic field noise. We show that thermal fluctuations alone are not sufficient to explain the system's dynamics and that a prominent role is played by magnetic field fluctuations, which need to be included in an open quantum system description. Moreover, our protocol only requires single-qubit measurements, which makes it suitable as an exploration and calibration tool for large-scale quantum annealing hardware.

SO MICRO AND NANO ENGINEERING
AB Multilayer surface-electrode ion traps provide a scalable platform for quantum processors. In this paper we present a demonstrator chip designed to implement an 8-qubit shuttling-based quantum processor with chip-integrated microwave control for quantum gates. The design is based on a linear Paul trap geometry. All-to-all connectivity will be implemented through ion swapping. The production of the trap chip is carried out with multistep microfabrication. The 2-layer ion trap chip with two storage registers and an interaction zone has a size of 5 mm x 10 mm. Flexibility in signal routing is improved through the use of thick and planarised metal-dielectric layers.

TI Measurement-Device-Independent Verification of a Quantum Memory
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB In this Letter we report an experiment that verifies an atomic-ensemble quantum memory via a measurement-device-independent scheme. A single photon generated via Rydberg blockade in one atomic ensemble is stored in another atomic ensemble via electromagnetically induced transparency. After storage for a long duration, this photon is retrieved and interfered with a second photon to perform a joint Bell-state measurement (BSM). The quantum state for each photon is chosen based on a quantum random number generator, respectively, in each run. By evaluating correlations between the random states and BSM results, we certify that our memory is genuinely entanglement preserving.

TI Optical transmittance based store and forward routing in satellite
   networks
SO INFOCOMMUNICATIONS JOURNAL
AB Quantum computing will play a crucial part in our security infrastructure for the coming years. Quantum networks can consist of direct optical fiber or free-space links. With the use of satellite channels, we can create a quantum network with higher coverage than using optical fibers where the distances are limited due to the properties of the fiber. One of the highest drivers of cost for satellite networks, apart from the cost of the technology needed for such systems, are the costs of launching and maintaining said satellites. By minimizing the satellites needed for a well-functioning quantum network, we can decrease said network's cost, thus enabling a cheaper quantum internet. In this paper, we present an optical transmittance-based routing algorithm with which it is possible to conduct successful quantum entanglement transfer between terrestrial nodes.

TI Statistical complexity of quantum circuits
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB In theoretical machine learning, the statistical complexity is a notion that measures the richness of a hypothesis space. In this work, we apply a particular measure of statistical complexity, namely, the Rademacher complexity, to the quantum circuit model in quantum computation and study how the statistical complexity depends on various quantum circuit parameters. In particular, we investigate the dependence of the statistical complexity on the resources, depth, width, and the number of input and output registers of a quantum circuit. To study how the statistical complexity scales with resources in the circuit, we introduce a magic resource measure based on the (p, q) group norm, which quantifies the amount of magic resource in the quantum channels associated with the circuit. These dependencies are investigated in the following two settings: (i) where the entire quantum circuit is treated as a single quantum channel, and (ii) where each layer of the quantum circuit is treated as a separate quantum channel. The bounds we obtain can be used to constrain the capacity of quantum neural networks in terms of their depths and widths as well as the resources in the network.

TI Evaluation of parameterized quantum circuits: on the relation between
   classification accuracy, expressibility, and entangling capability
SO QUANTUM MACHINE INTELLIGENCE
AB An active area of investigation in the search for quantum advantage is quantum machine learning. Quantum machine learning, and parameterized quantum circuits in a hybrid quantum-classical setup in particular, could bring advancements in accuracy by utilizing the high dimensionality of the Hilbert space as feature space. But is the ability of a quantum circuit to uniformly address the Hilbert space a good indicator of classification accuracy? In our work, we use methods and quantifications from prior art to perform a numerical study in order to evaluate the level of correlation. We find a moderate to strong correlation between the ability of the circuit to uniformly address the Hilbert space and the achieved classification accuracy for circuits that entail a single embedding layer followed by 1 or 2 circuit designs. This is based on our study encompassing 19 circuits in both 1- and 2-layer configurations, evaluated on 9 datasets of increasing difficulty. We also evaluate the correlation between entangling capability and classification accuracy in a similar setup, and find a weak correlation. Future work will focus on evaluating if this holds for different circuit designs.

TI Optimizing Multidimensional Pooling for Variational Quantum Algorithms
SO ALGORITHMS
AB Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have proven to be a very efficient class of machine learning (ML) architectures for handling multidimensional data by maintaining data locality, especially in the field of computer vision. Data pooling, a major component of CNNs, plays a crucial role in extracting important features of the input data and downsampling its dimensionality. Multidimensional pooling, however, is not efficiently implemented in existing ML algorithms. In particular, quantum machine learning (QML) algorithms have a tendency to ignore data locality for higher dimensions by representing/flattening multidimensional data as simple one-dimensional data. In this work, we propose using the quantum Haar transform (QHT) and quantum partial measurement for performing generalized pooling operations on multidimensional data. We present the corresponding decoherence-optimized quantum circuits for the proposed techniques along with their theoretical circuit depth analysis. Our experimental work was conducted using multidimensional data, ranging from 1-D audio data to 2-D image data to 3-D hyperspectral data, to demonstrate the scalability of the proposed methods. In our experiments, we utilized both noisy and noise-free quantum simulations on a state-of-the-art quantum simulator from IBM Quantum. We also show the efficiency of our proposed techniques for multidimensional data by reporting the fidelity of results.

TI Linear-depth quantum circuits for loading Fourier approximations of
   arbitrary functions
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB The ability to efficiently load functions on quantum computers with high fidelity is essential for many quantum algorithms, including those for solving partial differential equations and Monte Carlo estimation. In this work, we introduce the Fourier series loader (FSL) method for preparing quantum states that exactly encode multi-dimensional Fourier series using linear-depth quantum circuits. Specifically, the FSL method prepares a (Dn)-qubit state encoding the 2(Dn) -point uniform discretization of a D-dimensional function specified by a D-dimensional Fourier series. A free parameter, m, which must be less than n, determines the number of Fourier coefficients, 2(D(m+1)) , used to represent the function. The FSL method uses a quantum circuit of depth at most 2(n-2)+ inverted right perpendicular log(2)(n-m)inverted left perpendicualr +2(D(m+1)+2)-2D(m+1) , which is linear in the number of Fourier coefficients, and linear in the number of qubits (Dn) despite the fact that the loaded function's discretization is over exponentially many (2(Dn) ) points. The FSL circuit consists of at most Dn+2(D(m+1)+1)-1 single-qubit and Dn(n+1)/2+2(D(m+1)+1)-3D(m+1)-2 two-qubit gates; we present a classical compilation algorithm with runtime O(2(3D(m+1))) to determine the FSL circuit for a given Fourier series. The FSL method allows for the highly accurate loading of complex-valued functions that are well-approximated by a Fourier series with finitely many terms. We report results from noiseless quantum circuit simulations, illustrating the capability of the FSL method to load various continuous 1D functions, and a discontinuous 1D function, on 20 qubits with infidelities of less than 10(-6) and 10(-3), respectively. We also demonstrate the practicality of the FSL method for near-term quantum computers by presenting experiments performed on the Quantinuum H1-1 and H1-2 trapped-ion quantum computers: we loaded a complex-valued function on 3 qubits with a fidelity of over 95% , as well as various 1D real-valued functions on up to 6 qubits with classical fidelities approximate to 99%, and a 2D function on 10 qubits with a classical fidelity approximate to 94%.

TI Facial expression recognition on a quantum computer
SO QUANTUM MACHINE INTELLIGENCE
AB We address the problem of facial expression recognition and show a possible solution using a quantum machine learning approach. In order to define an efficient classifier for a given dataset, our approach substantially exploits quantum interference. By representing face expressions via graphs, we define a classifier as a quantum circuit that manipulates the graphs adjacency matrices encoded into the amplitudes of some appropriately defined quantum states. We discuss the accuracy of the quantum classifier evaluated on the quantum simulator available on the IBM Quantum Experience cloud platform, and compare it with the accuracy of one of the best classical classifier.

TI Qubit dynamics driven by dipole field in thermal noise environment
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB Quantum computing is a new way to process quantum information by using superposition and entanglement of the quantum system. Quantum state's vast Hilbert space allows it to perform operations that classical computers cannot. The quantum computing has unique advantages in dealing with some complex problems, so it has attracted wide attention. Computing a single qubit is the first of seven fundamental stages needed to achieve a large-scale quantum computer that is universal, scalable and fault-tolerant. In other words, the primary task of quantum computing is the careful preparation and precise regulation of qubits. At present, the physical systems that can be used as qubits include superconducting qubits, semiconductor qubits, ion trap systems and nitrogen-vacancy (NV) color centers. These physical systems have made great progress of decoherence time and scalability. Owing to the vulnerability of qubits, ambient thermal noise can cause quantum decoherence, which greatly affects the fidelity of qubits. Improving the fidelity of qubits is therefore a key step towards large-scale quantum computing. Based on the dipole field driven qubit, the stochastic dynamic structure decomposition method is adopted and the Kubo-Einstein fluctuation-dissipation theorem is used to study the qubit control in a thermal noise environment. The dipole field has components in three directions, not just in one plane, which allows more flexible control of quantum states. Without considering the noise, the quantum state can reach the target state 100%. In the noisy environment, thermal noise will cause the deviation between the actual final state and the target final state caused by thermal fluctuation, which becomes the main factor affecting the quantum fidelity. The influence of thermal noise is related to temperature and the evolution trajectory of quantum state. Therefore, this paper proposes an optimal scheme to improve the qubit fidelity in the thermal noise environment. The feasibility of this method is verified by numerical calculation, which can provide a new solution for further guiding and evaluating the experiment. The scheme is suitable for qubit systems of various physical control fields, such as semiconductor qubits and nitrogen vacancy center qubits. This work may have more applications in the development of quantum manipulation technology and can also be extended to multi-qubit systems, the details of which will appear in the future work.

TI On-chip quantum key distribution over field-deployed fiber using lithium

SO APL PHOTONICS
AB Quantum key distribution (QKD) systems have proven their theoretically unconditional security by quantum mechanics, but the scalability and cost barriers limit the rapid growth of the QKD system industry. The integration of QKD systems on chips has enabled their widespread adoption in secure quantum communication technologies, but the optimized platforms and designs are still being studied. Herein, we fabricated monolithic quantum photonic circuits for the BB84 QKD protocol using thin-film lithium niobate (TFLN), which enables flexible design in organizing both active and passive elements on one chip based on its superior material properties. The proposed circuit design for both transmitter and receiver parts are identical, which facilitates stable operation and mass production. Using our device, we demonstrated QKD over a field-deployed quantum channel, and its performance is comparable to state-of-the-art. This result proved the potential of TFLN for quantum communication technology.

AB In the rapidly advancing domain of quantum optimization, the confluence of quantum algorithms such as Quantum Annealing (QA) and the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) with robust optimization methodologies presents a cutting-edge frontier. Although it seems natural to apply quantum algorithms when facing uncertainty, this has barely been approached.
   In this paperwe adapt the aforementioned quantum optimization techniques to tackle robust optimization problems. By leveraging the inherent stochasticity of quantum annealing and adjusting the parameters and evaluation functions within QAOA, we present two innovative methods for obtaining robust optimal solutions. These heuristics are applied on two use cases within the energy sector: the unit commitment problem, which is central to the scheduling of power plant operations, and the optimization of charging electric vehicles including electricity from photovoltaic to minimize costs. These examples highlight not only the potential of quantum optimization methods to enhance decision-making in energy management but also the practical relevance of the young field of quantum computing in general. Through careful adaptation of quantum algorithms, we lay the foundation for exploring ways to achieve more reliable and efficient solutions in complex optimization scenarios that occur in the real-world.

TI Identifying genuine quantum teleportation
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB An unknown quantum state can be teleported by using quantum measurements and the maximally entangled Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) pair. It is well known that the usual nonclassical teleportation that cannot be simulated by the seminal classical measure-prepare strategy can be demonstrated with all entangled states. Herein, we propose a benchmark which reveals that not all such nonclassical teleportations are truly quantum mechanical. Rather, there exists a more robust classical-teleportation model, which includes the measure-prepare mimicry as a special case, that can describe certain nonclassical teleportations. Invalidating such a general classical model indicates genuine quantum teleportation wherein both the pair state and the measurement are truly quantum mechanical. We prove that EPR steering empowers genuine quantum teleportations, rather than entanglement. The benchmark can be readily used in practical experiments for ensuring that genuine quantum teleportation is implemented. The results presented herein provide strict criteria for implementing quantum-information processing where genuine quantum teleportation is indispensable.

TI Photonic scheme for implementing quantum square root controlled Z gate

SO IET OPTOELECTRONICS
AB Quantum logic gate operates on a number of qubits, where a controlled Z gate operates on two qubit data. Similarly, the square root of controlled Z (SRCZ) operates also on two qubit data. The SRCZ gate is very much advantageous in quantum computing. Different quantum gates are implemented by using the physical properties of light such as phase, polarization, intensity, and frequency. Here, the authors propose a photonic scheme for implementing quantum SRCZ logic gate using phase as well as intensity encoding. The non-linear property of Pockels material with proper external biasing voltage is used to develop the scheme.

SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF RISK REGULATION
AB The rapid advancement of quantum computing presents unparalleled opportunities and challenges for the legal field. This article investigates the key legal implications of quantum computing, focusing on intellectual property, data security, regulation, and ethical considerations. The unique characteristics of quantum algorithms and hardware pose significant challenges for the existing patent system, necessitating a clear and consistent framework for protecting quantum innovations while fostering collaboration. The threat of quantum computing to current encryption methods highlights the urgent need for forward-looking data protection policies and the adoption of post-quantum cryptography. As quantum technologies continue to evolve, policymakers must work closely with stakeholders to develop adaptive, principles-based regulations that strike a balance between promoting innovation and mitigating risks. Moreover, the societal and ethical impacts of quantum computing cannot be overlooked; prioritising applications that deliver significant social good and establishing robust ethical guidelines will be crucial. Preparing the legal workforce for the quantum era requires a concerted effort to develop quantum literacy and expertise. By adopting a proactive, interdisciplinary approach, the legal community can play a vital role in shaping the quantum future, ensuring that this transformative technology upholds the rule of law, protects individual rights, and promotes the greater good of society.

TI Non-classical correlations over 1250 modes between telecom photons and
   979-nm photons stored in
   171Yb3+:Y2SiO5
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Multimode operation would greatly improve the performances of quantum repeaters. Here, the authors demonstrate a fixed-delay atomic frequency comb quantum memory, based on a Y2SiO5 crystal doped with Ytterbium ions, with a time-domain mode capacity of 1250 modes and a bandwidth of 100 MHz.
   Quantum repeaters based on heralded entanglement require quantum nodes that are able to generate multimode quantum correlations between memories and telecommunication photons. The communication rate scales linearly with the number of modes, yet highly multimode quantum storage remains challenging. In this work, we demonstrate an atomic frequency comb quantum memory with a time-domain mode capacity of 1250 modes and a bandwidth of 100 MHz. The memory is based on a Y2SiO5 crystal doped with Yb-171(3+) ions, with a memory wavelength of 979 nm. The memory is interfaced with a source of non-degenerate photon pairs at 979 and 1550 nm, bandwidth-matched to the quantum memory. We obtain strong non-classical second-order cross correlations over all modes, for storage times of up to 25 mu s. The telecommunication photons propagated through 5 km of fiber before the release of the memory photons, a key capability for quantum repeaters based on heralded entanglement and feed-forward operations. Building on this experiment should allow distribution of entanglement between remote quantum nodes, with enhanced rates owing to the high multimode capacity.

TI Towards metropolitan free-space quantum networks
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Quantum communication has seen rapid progress towards practical large-scale networks, with quantum key distribution (QKD) spearheading this development. While fibre-based systems have been shown to be well suited for metropolitan scales, suitable fibre infrastructure may not always be in place. Here, we make the case for an entanglement-based free-space quantum network as a practical and efficient alternative for metropolitan applications. We developed a deployable free-space QKD system and demonstrated its use in realistic scenarios. For a representative 1.7-km free-space link, we showcase its ad hoc deployability and achieve secure key rates of up to 5.7 kbps, with 2.5 kbps in direct noon sunlight. By extrapolating experimental data, we show that kbps key rates are achievable even for 10-km distances and multi-user scenarios. We anticipate that our work will establish free-space networks as a viable solution for metropolitan applications and an indispensable complementary building block in the future global quantum internet.

TI Toward Useful Quantum Kernels
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB Supervised machine learning is a popular approach to the solution of many real-life problems. This approach is characterized by the use of labeled datasets to train algorithms for classifying data or predicting outcomes accurately. The question of the extent to which quantum computation can help improve existing classical supervised learning methods is the subject of intense research in the area of quantum machine learning. The debate centers on whether an advantage can be achieved already with current noisy quantum computer prototypes or it is strictly dependent on the full power of a fault-tolerant quantum computer. The current proposals can be classified into methods that can be suitably implemented on near-term quantum computers but are essentially empirical, and methods that use quantum algorithms with a provable advantage over their classical counterparts but only when implemented on the still unavailable fault-tolerant quantum computer.It turns out that, for the latter class, the benefit offered by quantum computation can be shown rigorously using quantum kernels, whereas the approach based on near-term quantum computers is very unlikely to bring any advantage if implemented in the form of hybrid algorithms that delegate the hard part (optimization) to the far more powerful classical computers.
   The hybrid approach to Quantum Supervised Machine Learning is compatible with Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices but hardly useful. Pure quantum kernels requiring fault-tolerant quantum computers are more promising. Examples are kernels computed by means of the Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT) and kernels defined via the calculation of Betti curves by means of a quantum algorithm, or via the calculation of a link invariant by means of topological quantum computation. image

TI Realizing nonadiabatic holonomic quantum computation beyond the
   three-level setting
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Nonadiabatic holonomic quantum computation (NHQC) provides a method to implement error resilient gates and that has attracted considerable attention recently. Since it was proposed, three-level A systems have become the typical building block for NHQC and a number of NHQC schemes have been developed based on such systems. In this paper, we investigate the realization of NHQC beyond the standard three-level setting. The central idea of our proposal is to improve NHQC by enlarging the Hilbert space of the building block system and letting it have a bipartite graph structure in order to ensure purely holonomic evolution. Our proposal not only improves conventional qubit-based NHQC by efficiently reducing its duration, but also provides implementations of qudit-based NHQC. Therefore, our proposal provides a further development of NHQC that can contribute significantly to the physical realization of efficient quantum information processors.

TI Optimal and scalable entanglement distribution over crossbar quantum

SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Crossbar networks are a cornerstone of network architectures, capable of operating both as standalone interconnections or as integral switching components in complex, multi-stage systems. The main advantages of crossbar networks are their non-blocking operation and unparalleled minimal latency. With the advent of large scale quantum networks, crossbars might be an important asset towards the Quantum Internet. This study proposes a solution for the problem of distributing entanglement within crossbar quantum networks. Entangled particles are a consumable resource in quantum networks, and are being used by most quantum protocols. By ensuring that nodes within quantum networks are being supplied with entanglement, the reliability and efficiency of the network is maintained. By providing an efficient, scalable framework that can be used to achieve optimal entanglement distribution within crossbar quantum networks, this study offers a theoretical achievement which can be also used for enhancing quantum network performance. An algorithm for selecting an optimal entanglement distribution configuration is proposed and fully tested on realistic possible configurations.

TI Asynchronous entanglement routing for the quantum internet
SO AVS QUANTUM SCIENCE
AB With the emergence of the Quantum Internet, the need for advanced quantum networking techniques has significantly risen. Various models of quantum repeaters have been presented, each delineating a unique strategy to ensure quantum communication over long distances. We focus on repeaters that employ entanglement generation and swapping. This revolves around establishing remote end-to-end entanglement through repeaters, a concept we denote as the "quantum-native" repeaters (also called "first-generation" repeaters in some literature). The challenges in routing with quantum-native repeaters arise from probabilistic entanglement generation and restricted coherence time. Current approaches use synchronized time slots to search for entanglement-swapping paths, resulting in inefficiencies. Here, we propose a new set of asynchronous routing protocols for quantum networks by incorporating the idea of maintaining a dynamic topology in a distributed manner, which has been extensively studied in classical routing for lossy networks, such as using a destination-oriented directed acyclic graph or a spanning tree. The protocols update the entanglement-link topology asynchronously, identify optimal entanglement-swapping paths, and preserve unused direct-link entanglements. Our results indicate that asynchronous protocols achieve a larger upper bound with an appropriate setting and significantly higher entanglement rate than existing synchronous approaches, and the rate increases with coherence time, suggesting that it will have a much more profound impact on quantum networks as technology advances.

TI Isolation of individual Er quantum emitters in anatase TiO2
   on Si photonics
SO APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS
AB Defects and dopant atoms in solid state materials are a promising platform for realizing single photon sources and quantum memories, which are the basic building blocks of quantum repeaters needed for long distance quantum networks. In particular, trivalent erbium (Er3+) is of interest because it couples C-band telecom optical transitions with a spin-based memory platform. In order to produce quantum repeaters at the scale required for quantum networks it is imperative to integrate these necessary building blocks with mature and scalable semiconductor processes. In this work, we demonstrate the optical isolation of single Er3+ ions in CMOS-compatible titanium dioxide (TiO2) thin films monolithically integrated on a silicon-on-insulator photonics platform. Our results demonstrate an initial step toward the realization of a monolithically integrated and scalable quantum photonics package based on Er3+ doped thin films.

AB We present a complete set of rewrite rules for n-qutrit Clifford circuits where n is any non-negative integer. This is the first completeness result for any fragment of quantum circuits in odd prime dimensions. We first generalize Selinger's normal form for n-qubit Clifford circuits to the qutrit setting. Then, we present a rewrite system by which any Clifford circuit can be reduced to this normal form. We then simplify the rewrite rules in this procedure to a small natural set of rules, giving a clean presentation of the group of qutrit Clifford unitaries in terms of generators and relations.

TI Experimental Realization of Two Qutrits Gate with Tunable Coupling in
   Superconducting Circuits
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Gate-based quantum computation has been extensively investigated using quantum circuits based on qubits. In many cases, such qubits are actually made out of multilevel systems but with only two states being used for computational purpose. While such a strategy has the advantage of being in line with the common binary logic, it in some sense wastes the ready-for-use resources in the large Hilbert space of these intrinsic multidimensional systems. Quantum computation beyond qubits (e.g., using qutrits or qudits) has thus been discussed and argued to be more efficient than its qubit counterpart in certain scenarios. However, one of the essential elements for qutrit-based quantum computation, two-qutrit quantum gate, remains a major challenge. In this Letter, we propose and demonstrate a highly efficient and scalable two-qutrit quantum gate in superconducting quantum circuits. Using a tunable coupler to control the cross-Kerr coupling between two qutrits, our scheme realizes a two-qutrit conditional phase gate with fidelity 89.3% by combining simple pulses applied to the coupler with single-qutrit operations. We further use such a two-qutrit gate to prepare an EPR state of two qutrits with a fidelity of 95.5%. Our scheme takes advantage of a tunable qutrit-qutrit coupling with a large on:off ratio. It therefore offers both high efficiency and low crosstalk between qutrits, thus being friendly for scaling up. Our Letter constitutes an important step toward scalable qutrit-based quantum computation.

TI Assessing the potential of quantum computing in agriculture
SO COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE
AB With increasing computational demands in agriculture and life sciences, quantum computing is emerging as a potential alternative to classical computing. Unlike classical computers, which utilize binary bits, quantum computers utilize quantum bits (qubits) with unique properties such as superposition and entanglement, enabling them to solve certain computational problems more efficiently and achieve significant speed-ups in specific applications. In this manuscript, we evaluate the potential of quantum computing in agriculture and life sciences by reviewing computational challenges suitable for quantum computing and exploring exemplary domain applications. We examine optimization problems in agrifood supply chains, large-scale linear equation systems in animal breeding, quantum-based network architectures for machine learning in classifying satellite images for land-use analysis, quantum simulations for resource recovery from agriculture waste streams, and quantum search algorithms for genome assembly. Each computational problem type presents unique opportunities and challenges, underscoring the need for tailored quantum algorithms. Furthermore, we provide a critical assessment of the broader potential of quantum computing, discussing its challenges, limitations, and how to facilitate a potential implementation. While current quantum hardware remains limited, developing quantum algorithms is still valuable - not only to prepare for future advancements but also to foster innovation through interdisciplinary collaboration. Rather than replacing traditional computing, we foresee quantum computing complementing classical systems, offering novel solutions to previously intractable problems. Continued research and interdisciplinary collaborations are essential to realize the full potential of quantum computing, paving the way for pioneering advancements in agriculture and life sciences.

TI Quantum computation in fermionic thermal field theories
SO JOURNAL OF HIGH ENERGY PHYSICS
AB Thermal properties of quantum fields at finite temperature are crucial to understanding strongly interacting matter and recent development in quantum computing has provided an alternative and promising avenue of study. In this work, we study thermal field theories involving only fermions using quantum algorithms. We first delve into the presentations of fermion fields via qubits on digital quantum computers alongside the quantum algorithms such as quantum imaginary time evolutions employed to evaluate thermal properties of generic quantum field theories. Specifically, we show numerical results such as the thermal distribution and the energy density of thermal field theories for Majorana fermions in 1+1 dimensions using quantum simulators. In addition to free field theory, we also study the effects of interactions resulting from coupling with a spatially homogeneous Majorana field. In both cases, we show analytically that thermal properties of the system can be described using phase-space distributions, and the quantum simulation results agree with analytical and semiclassical expectations. Our work is an important step to understand thermal fixed points, preparing for quantum simulation of thermalization in real time.

TI Encoding molecular structures in quantum machine learning
SO MACHINE LEARNING-SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Quantum machine learning (QML) has great potential for the analysis of chemical datasets. However, conventional quantum data-encoding schemes, such as fingerprint encoding, are generally unfeasible for the accurate representation of chemical moieties in such datasets. In this contribution, we introduce the quantum molecular structure encoding (QMSE) scheme, which encodes the molecular bond orders and interatomic couplings expressed as a hybrid Coulomb-adjacency matrix, directly as one- and two-qubit rotations within parametrised circuits. We show that this strategy provides an efficient and interpretable method in improving state separability between encoded molecules compared to other fingerprint encoding methods, which is especially crucial for the success in preparing feature maps in QML workflows. To benchmark our method, we train a parametrised ansatz on molecular datasets to perform classification of state phases and regression on boiling points, demonstrating the competitive trainability and generalisation capabilities of QMSE. We further prove a fidelity-preserving chain-contraction theorem that reuses common substructures to cut qubit counts, with an application to long-chain fatty acids. We expect this scalable and interpretable encoding framework to greatly pave the way for practical QML applications of molecular datasets.

TI Quantum correlations in the frustrated XY model on the honeycomb lattice
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB We have investigated the spin-1/2 XY frustrated antiferromagnetic Heisenberg honeycomb model, which features an intermediate region in its ground state phase diagram that is not well understood. The two dominant phases in the diagram are the quantum spin-liquid (QSL) and the antiferromagnetic Ising order. Quantum correlations suggest that the QSL phase is likely to exhibit entanglement. To explore this possibility, we utilized numerical Lanczos and density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) methods to calculate concurrence, quantum discord (QD), and entanglement entropy. The results of our study indicate the existence of quantum entanglement within the intermediate region, implying a greater probability for the dominance of the quantum spin-liquid (QSL) phase over the antiferromagnetic Ising order. This discovery underscores the importance of considering quantum correlations in comprehending the model's behavior and provides insight into the complex nature of quantum systems.

TI Decomposition of matrix product states into shallow quantum circuits
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Tensor networks (TNs) are a family of computational methods built on graph-structured factorizations of large tensors, which have long represented state-of-the-art methods for the approximate simulation of complex quantum systems on classical computers. The rapid pace of recent advancements in numerical computation, notably the rise of GPU and TPU hardware accelerators, have allowed TN algorithms to scale to even larger quantum simulation problems, and to be employed more broadly for solving machine learning tasks. The 'quantum-inspired' nature of TNs permits them to be mapped to parametrized quantum circuits (PQCs), a fact which has inspired recent proposals for enhancing the performance of TN algorithms using near-term quantum devices, as well as enabling joint quantum-classical training frameworks that benefit from the distinct strengths of TN and PQC models. However, the success of any such methods depends on efficient and accurate methods for approximating TN states using realistic quantum circuits, which remains an unresolved question. This work compares a range of novel and previously-developed algorithmic protocols for decomposing matrix product states (MPS) of arbitrary bond dimension into low-depth quantum circuits consisting of stacked linear layers of two-qubit unitaries. These protocols are formed from different combinations of a preexisting analytical decomposition method together with constrained optimization of circuit unitaries, with initialization by the former method helping to avoid poor-quality local minima in the latter optimization process. While all of these protocols have efficient classical runtimes, our experimental results reveal one particular protocol employing sequential growth and optimization of the quantum circuit to outperform all others, with even greater benefits in the setting of limited computational resources. Given these promising results, we expect our proposed decomposition protocol to form a useful ingredient within any joint application of TNs and PQCs, further unlocking the rich and complementary benefits of classical and quantum computation.

AB Continuous Variable (CV) non-Gaussian resources are fundamental in the realization of quantum error correction for CV-based quantum communications and CV-based computing. In this work, we investigate the use of CV non-Gaussian states as quantum teleportation resource states in the context of the transmission of coherent and squeezed states through noisy channels. We consider an array of different non-Gaussian resource states, and compute the fidelity of state teleportation achieved for each resource. Our results show that the use of non-Gaussian states presents a significant advantage compared to the traditional resource adopted for CV teleportation; the Gaussian two-mode squeezed vacuum state. In fiber-based quantum communications, the range of quantum teleportation is increased by approximately 40% via the use of certain non-Gaussian states. In satellite-to-ground quantum communications, for aperture configurations consistent with the Micius satellite, the viable range of quantum teleportation is increased from 700 km to over 1200 km. These results represent a significant increase in the performance of pragmatic and realizable quantum communications in both terrestrial and space-based networks.

TI Device-independent characterization of entanglement based on bell
   nonlocality
SO FUNDAMENTAL RESEARCH
AB Quantum entanglement, has been acknowledged as a precious resource due to its inherent nonclassical correla-tions between subsystems. These quantum correlations have the potential for many quantum processes, includ-ing canonical ones: quantum cryptography, quantum teleportation, and dense coding. To exploit the advantages of quantum entanglement, two essential premises are required, i.e., to prepare high-quality entanglement and characterize quality level of prepared entanglement. Thus far, quantum entanglement can be produced in various quantum systems; however, it appears that this new resource is complex and difficult to characterize. The standard methods to characterize multipartite entanglement, e.g., entanglement witness, state tomography, or quantum state verification, require full knowledge of the Hilbert space dimension and precise calibration of measurement devices, which are usually difficult to acquire in experiment. The most radical way to overcome these problems is to detect entanglement solely based on the Bell-like correlations of measurement outcomes collected in the exper-iment, namely, device-independent characterization of entanglement. This article reviews the recently developed device-independent methods to characterize entanglement, including self-testing and device-independent certi-fication of entanglement. These approaches can be widely applied in kinds of quantum information processing, especially for those with security demands.

TI Enhancing quantum annealing accuracy through replication-based error
   mitigation
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Quantum annealers like those manufactured by D-Wave Systems are designed to find high quality solutions to optimization problems that are typically hard for classical computers. They utilize quantum effects like tunneling to evolve toward low-energy states representing solutions to optimization problems. However, their analog nature and limited control functionalities present challenges to correcting or mitigating hardware errors. As quantum computing advances towards applications, effective error suppression is an important research goal. We propose a new approach called replication based mitigation (RBM) based on parallel quantum annealing (QA). In RBM, physical qubits representing the same logical qubit are dispersed across different copies of the problem embedded in the hardware. This mitigates hardware biases, is compatible with limited qubit connectivity in current annealers, and is well-suited for currently available noisy intermediate-scale quantum annealers. Our experimental analysis shows that RBM provides solution quality on par with previous methods while being more flexible and compatible with a wider range of hardware connectivity patterns. In comparisons against standard QA without error mitigation on larger problem instances that could not be handled by previous methods, RBM consistently gets better energies and ground state probabilities across parameterized problem sets.

TI Wavelength conversion for single-photon polarization qubits through
   continuous-variable quantum teleportation
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB A quantum internet connects remote quantum processors that need to interact and exchange quantum signals over a long distance through photonic channels. However, these quantum nodes operate at the wavelength ranges unsuitable for long-distance transmission. Therefore, quantum wavelength conversion to telecom bands is crucial for long-distance quantum networks based on optical fiber. Here, we propose wavelength conversion devices for single-photon polarization qubits using continuous-variable quantum teleportation that can efficiently convert qubits between near-infrared (780???795 nm suitable for interacting with atomic quantum nodes) and telecom wavelength (1300???1500 nm suitable for long-distance transmission). The teleportation uses entangled photon fields (i.e., nondegenerate two-mode squeezed state) that can be generated by four-wave mixing in a rubidium atomic gas using a diamond configuration of atomic transitions. The entangled fields can be emitted in two orthogonal polarizations with locked relative phase, making them especially suitable for interfacing with single photon polarization qubits. Our work may pave the way for the realization of long-distance quantum networks.

Recent works have shown that QML models can effectively generalize from limited training data samples. This capability has led to an increased interest in deploying these models to address practical, real-world problems, resulting in the emergence of Quantum Machine Learning as a Service (QMLaaS). QMLaaS represents a hybrid model that utilizes both classical and quantum computing resources. Classical computers play a crucial role in this setup, handling initial pre-processing and subsequent post-processing of data to compensate for the current limitations of quantum hardware. Since this is a new area, very little work exists to paint the whole picture of QMLaaS in the context of known security threats in the domain of classical and quantum machine learning. This SoK paper is aimed to bridge this gap by outlining the complete QMLaaS workflow, which includes both the training and inference phases and highlighting security concerns involving untrusted classical and quantum providers. QML models contain several sensitive assets, such as the model architecture, training data, encoding techniques, and trained parameters. Unauthorized access to these components could compromise the model's integrity and lead to intellectual property (IP) theft. We pinpoint the critical security issues that must be considered to pave the way for a secure QMLaaS deployment.

TI Quantum algorithms for Schrieffer-Wolff transformation
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB The Schrieffer-Wolff transformation aims to solve degenerate perturbation problems and give an effective Hamiltonian that describes the low-energy dynamics of the exact Hamiltonian in the low-energy subspace of an unperturbed Hamiltonian. This unitary transformation decoupling the low-energy and high-energy subspaces for the transformed Hamiltonian can be realized by quantum circuits. We give a fully quantum algorithm for realizing the SW transformation. We also propose a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm for finding the effective Hamiltonian on NISQ hardware, where a general cost function is used to indicate the decoupling degree. Numerical simulations without or with noise and experiments on quantum computer ibmq_manila are implemented for a Heisenberg chain model. Our results verify the algorithm and show its validity on near-term quantum computers.

TI Quantum discord of thermal two-photon orbital angular momentum state:
   mimicking teleportation to transmit an image
SO LIGHT-SCIENCE & APPLICATIONS
AB We formulate a density matrix to fully describe two-photon state within a thermal light source in the photon orbital angular momentum (OAM) Hilbert space. We prove the separability, i.e., zero entanglement of the thermal two-photon state. Still, we reveal the hidden quantum correlations in terms of geometric measures of discord. By mimicking the original protocol of quantum teleportation, we demonstrate that the non-zero quantum discord can be utilized to transmit a high-dimensional OAM state at the single-photon level. It is found that albeit the low fidelity of teleportation due to the inherent component of maximally mixed state, the information of all parameters that characterize the original state can still be extracted from the teleported one. Besides, we demonstrate that the multiple repetitions of the protocol, enable the transmission of a complex-amplitude light field, e.g., an optical image, regardless of being accompanied with a featureless background. We also distinguish our scheme of optical image transmission from that of ghost imaging.

TI Monogamy properties of quantum correlations in neutrino oscillations
SO EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL C
AB The monogamy relation of quantum states has limited the shareability properties of quantum resources in multiparty quantum systems. It plays a vital role in information distribution and transformation over many sites in quantum communications. Here, we focus on the monogamy relations of quantum correlations in the context of three-flavor neutrino oscillations, related to the squared entanglement of formation, the squared of quantum discord and its geometric variant. The monogamy relations in terms of the squared entanglement of formation work for the electron and muon antineutrino oscillations, suggesting that the bipartite entanglement measured by squared entanglement of formation of the three-flavor neutrino system set a limitation to the sum of pairwise squared entanglement of formation. Furthermore, we found that the squared quantum discord is also monogamous in three-flavor neutrino system. As a comparison, we test the monogamy of the quantum discord in neutrino oscillations with the result that the quantum discord is not monogamous. In addition, it is found that the bipartite geometric quantum discord of three-flavor systems is equal to the sum of the pairwise geometric quantum discord, i.e., the monogamy relation for geometric quantum discord is saturated for three-flavor neutrino system. These monogamy relations of quantum correlations provide a way for studying the distribution of quantum resources in neutrino oscillations, which is of significance to explore the further applications of neutrino oscillations in quantum communications.

TI Resilience Optimization of Post-Quantum Cryptography Key Encapsulation
   Algorithms
SO SENSORS
AB Recent developments in quantum computing have shed light on the shortcomings of the conventional public cryptosystem. Even while Shor's algorithm cannot yet be implemented on quantum computers, it indicates that asymmetric key encryption will not be practicable or secure in the near future. The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has started looking for a post-quantum encryption algorithm that is resistant to the development of future quantum computers as a response to this security concern. The current focus is on standardizing asymmetric cryptography that should be impenetrable by a quantum computer. This has become increasingly important in recent years. Currently, the process of standardizing asymmetric cryptography is coming very close to being finished. This study evaluated the performance of two post-quantum cryptography (PQC) algorithms, both of which were selected as NIST fourth-round finalists. The research assessed the key generation, encapsulation, and decapsulation operations, providing insights into their efficiency and suitability for real-world applications. Further research and standardization efforts are required to enable secure and efficient post-quantum encryption. When selecting appropriate post-quantum encryption algorithms for specific applications, factors such as security levels, performance requirements, key sizes, and platform compatibility should be taken into account. This paper provides helpful insight for post-quantum cryptography researchers and practitioners, assisting in the decision-making process for selecting appropriate algorithms to protect confidential data in the age of quantum computing.

TI A study of polarization compensation for quantum networks
SO EPJ QUANTUM TECHNOLOGY
AB The information-theoretic unconditional security offered by quantum key distribution has spurred the development of larger quantum communication networks. However, as these networks grow so does the strong need to reduce complexity and overheads. Polarization-based entanglement distribution networks are a promising approach due to their scalability and no need for trusted nodes. Nevertheless, they are only viable if the birefringence of all-optical distribution fibres in the network is compensated to preserve the polarization-based quantum state. The brute force approach would require a few hundred fibre polarization controllers for even a moderately sized network. Instead, we propose and investigate four different realizations of polarization compensation schemes that can be used in quantum networks. We compare them based on the type of reference signals, complexity, effort, level of disruption to network operations and performance on a four-user quantum network.

TI On the Security of Quantum Key Distribution Networks
SO CRYPTOGRAPHY
AB The main purpose of a quantum key distribution network is to provide secret keys to any users or applications requiring a high level of security, ideally such as to offer the best protection against any computational attack, even of a quantum nature. The keys shared through a point-to-point link between a source and a detector using a quantum key distribution protocol can be proven information-theoretically secure based on the quantum information theory. However, evaluating the security of a quantum key distribution network, especially if it is based on relay nodes, goes far beyond the quantum security of its single quantum links, involving aspects of conventional security for devices and their communication channels. In this contribution, we perform a rigorous threat analysis based on the most recent recommendations and practical network deployment security issues. We show that, at least in the current state of our understanding of quantum cryptography, quantum key distribution networks can only offer computational security and that their security in practical implementations in the shorter term requires resorting to post-quantum cryptography.

TI Tripartite Quantum Entanglement with Squeezed Optomechanics
SO LASER & PHOTONICS REVIEWS
AB The ability to engineer entangled states that involve macroscopic objects is of particular importance for a wide variety of quantum-enabled technologies, ranging from quantum information processing to quantum sensing. Here how to achieve coherent manipulation and enhancement of quantum entanglement in a hybrid optomechanical system, which consists of a Fabry-P & eacute;rot cavity with two movable mirrors, an optical parametric amplifier (OPA), and an injected squeezed vacuum reservoir is proposed. It is shown that the advantages of this system are twofold: 1) one can effectively regulate the light-mirror interactions by introducing a squeezed intracavity mode via the OPA; 2) when properly matching the squeezing parameters between the squeezed cavity mode and the injected squeezed vacuum reservoir, the optical input noises can be suppressed completely. These peculiar features of this system allow the generation and manipulation of quantum entanglement in a coherent and controllable way. More importantly, it is also found that such controllable entanglement, under some specific squeezing parameters, can be considerably enhanced in comparison with those of the conventional optomechanical system. The work, providing a promising method to regulate and tailor the light-mirror interaction, is poised to serve as a useful tool for engineering various quantum effects which are based on cavity optomechanics.
   Quantum entanglement, providing an appealing resource for a variety of nascent quantum technologies, is fragile to thermal noises induced by system-bath interaction. Here, the study presents that a squeezed optomechanical system, which can enhance the light-motion interaction while suppressing the system-bath interaction simultaneously, provides a promising platform to achieve highly entangled states in a coherent and tunable way, as well as protect the states from thermal noises. image

AB Practical applications of quantum computers require millions of physical qubits and it will be challenging for individual quantum processors to reach such qubit numbers. It is therefore timely to investigate the resource requirements of quantum algorithms in a distributed setting, where multiple quantum processors are interconnected by a coherent network. We introduce an extension of the Message Passing Interface (MPI) to enable high-performance implementations of distributed quantum algorithms. In turn, these implementations can be used for testing, debugging, and resource estimation. In addition to a prototype implementation of quantum MPI, we present a performance model for distributed quantum computing, SENDQ. The model is inspired by the classical LogP model, making it useful to inform algorithmic decisions when programming distributed quantum computers. Specifically, we consider several optimizations of two quantum algorithms for problems in physics and chemistry, and we detail their effects on performance in the SENDQ model.

TI Vector-towards quantum key distribution with small satellites
SO EPJ QUANTUM TECHNOLOGY
AB A satellite-constellation based global quantum network could allow secure quantum communication between remote users worldwide. Such a constellation could be formed of micro- or even nanosatellites, which have the advantage of being more cost-effective than larger expensive spacecrafts. At the same time, the features of quantum communication impose a number of technical requirements that are more difficult to meet when using small satellites. Full-fledged quantum communication has been demonstrated with neither a micro- nor a nanosatellite so far. The authors took up this challenge and have developed a 6U CubeSat weighting 9.5 kg. The satellite is to be launched in 2023 and has already successfully passed all the pre-flight tests. The mission is not yet intended for fully quantum communication. Nevertheless, the authors are testing such key functional elements as polarization reference-frame synchronization and acquisition, pointing and tracking system on it. Besides that, the payload accommodates a full-duplex telecommunication system operating at a bit rate of 50 Mbit/s: an up- and a downlink at wavelengths of 808 and 850 nm. After the satellite is launched, the main goal to be achieved is to demonstrate stable connection between it and an optical ground station and carry out multiple communication sessions. In quantum communication, generating secret keys from raw measurement data implies two-way exchange of significant amount of information and therefore availability of a classical communication channel with a high bandwidth is one of the crucial things. In the following mission, which envisages an overall quantum key distribution system, we plan to use the free-space optical link for such an exchange of data, whereas the RF link will only be used for telemetry and telecommand.

AB Quantum computers promise to solve finite-temperature properties of quantum many-body systems, which is generally challenging for classical computers due to high computational complexities. Here, we report experimental preparations of Gibbs states and excited states of Heisenberg XX and XXZ models by using a 5-qubit programmable superconducting processor. In the experiments, we apply a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm to generate finite temperature states with classical probability models and variational quantum circuits. We reveal that the Hamiltonians can be fully diagonalized with optimized quantum circuits, which enable us to prepare excited states at arbitrary energy density. We demonstrate that the approach has a self-verifying feature and can estimate fundamental thermal observables with a small statistical error. Based on numerical results, we further show that the time complexity of our approach scales polynomially in the number of qubits, revealing its potential in solving large-scale problems.

However, the security proof of such protocols against all attacks can be tricky because of the attenuation in the communication channel that can be exploited by an eavesdropper. In this work, an attack on the subcarrier wave quantum cryptography protocol has been built, which generalizes the photon number splitting attack. The efficiency of the attack has been analyzed, in particular, for the case where the eavesdropper does not have quantum memory.

TI Quantum readout error mitigation via deep learning
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB Quantum computing devices are inevitably subject to errors. To leverage quantum technologies for computational benefits in practical applications, quantum algorithms and protocols must be implemented reliably under noise and imperfections. Since noise and imperfections limit the size of quantum circuits that can be realized on a quantum device, developing quantum error mitigation techniques that do not require extra qubits and gates is of critical importance. In this work, we present a deep learning-based protocol for reducing readout errors on quantum hardware. Our technique is based on training an artificial neural network (NN) with the measurement results obtained from experiments with simple quantum circuits consisting of singe-qubit gates only. With the NN and deep learning, non-linear noise can be corrected, which is not possible with the existing linear inversion methods. The advantage of our method against the existing methods is demonstrated through quantum readout error mitigation experiments performed on IBM five-qubit quantum devices.

TI Emergence of realism through quantum discord suppression in photonic
   weak measurements
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB The emergence of realism from the quantum domain, often associated with the suppression of quantum features, is a key aspect of the quantum-to-classical transition. In this work, we implement an experiment with Werner states subjected to weak measurements to investigate how quantum correlations influence the emergence of realism. Maximally entangled twin photons, generated via spontaneous parametric down-conversion, are used to prepare Werner states. We employ a monitoring model that smoothly transitions between weak and strong nonselective measurements, along with an irrealism measure. Our findings demonstrate that quantum discord suppression induced by weak measurements, known as weak quantum discord, drives the emergence of realism. Additionally, our findings highlight the robustness of the irrealism measure in quantum correlation-based scenarios.

TI Advancing quantum technology workforce: industry insights into
   qualification and training needs
SO EPJ QUANTUM TECHNOLOGY
AB The transition of second-generation quantum technologies from a research topic to a topic of industrial relevance has led to a growing number of quantum companies and businesses that are exploring quantum technologies. Examples would include a start-up building a quantum key distribution device, a large company working on integrating a quantum sensing core into a product, or a company providing quantum computing consultancy. They all face different challenges and needs in terms of building their quantum workforce and training in quantum concepts, technologies and how to derive value from them. With the study documented in this paper, we aim to identify these needs and provide a picture of the industry's requirements in terms of workforce development and (external) training and materials. We discuss, for example, the shortage of engineers and jobs relevant to the quantum industry, the challenge of getting people interested in quantum, and the need for training at different levels and in different formats - from awareness raising and self-learning materials to university courses in quantum systems engineering. The findings are based on 34 semi-structured interviews with industry representatives and a follow-up questionnaire to validate some of the issues raised in the interviews. These results have influenced activities in EU projects, including an update of the European Competence Framework for Quantum Technologies.

TI A Multi-Classification Hybrid Quantum Neural Network Using an All-Qubit
   Multi-Observable Measurement Strategy
SO ENTROPY
AB Quantum machine learning is a promising application of quantum computing for data classification. However, most of the previous research focused on binary classification, and there are few studies on multi-classification. The major challenge comes from the limitations of near-term quantum devices on the number of qubits and the size of quantum circuits. In this paper, we propose a hybrid quantum neural network to implement multi-classification of a real-world dataset. We use an average pooling downsampling strategy to reduce the dimensionality of samples, and we design a ladder-like parameterized quantum circuit to disentangle the input states. Besides this, we adopt an all-qubit multi-observable measurement strategy to capture sufficient hidden information from the quantum system. The experimental results show that our algorithm outperforms the classical neural network and performs especially well on different multi-class datasets, which provides some enlightenment for the application of quantum computing to real-world data on near-term quantum processors.

AB Recent demonstrations of superconducting quantum computers by Google and IBM and trapped-ion computers from IonQ fueled new research in quantum algorithms, compilation into quantum circuits, and empirical algorithmics. While online access to quantum hardware remains too limited to meet the demand, simulating quantum circuits on conventional computers satisfies many needs. We advance Schrodinger-style simulation of quantum circuits that is useful standalone and as a building block in layered simulation algorithms, both cases are illustrated in our results. Our algorithmic contributions show how to simulate multiple quantum gates at once, how to avoid floating-point multiplies, how to best use data-level and thread-level parallelism as well as CPU cache, and how to leverage these optimizations by reordering circuit gates. While not described previously, these techniques implemented by us supported published high-performance distributed simulations up to 64 qubits. To show additional impact, we benchmark our simulator against Microsoft, IBM and Google simulators on hard circuits from Google.

TI Quantum simulation of Pauli channels and dynamical maps: Algorithm and
   implementation
SO PLOS ONE
AB Pauli channels are fundamental in the context of quantum computing as they model the simplest kind of noise in quantum devices. We propose a quantum algorithm for simulating Pauli channels and extend it to encompass Pauli dynamical maps (parametrized Pauli channels). A parametrized quantum circuit is employed to accommodate for dynamical maps. We also establish the mathematical conditions for an N-qubit transformation to be achievable using a parametrized circuit where only one single-qubit operation depends on the parameter. The implementation of the proposed circuit is demonstrated using IBM's quantum computers for the case of one qubit, and the fidelity of this implementation is reported.

TI Differentiable Quantum Programming with Unbounded Loops
SO ACM TRANSACTIONS ON SOFTWARE ENGINEERING AND METHODOLOGY
AB The emergence of variational quantum applications has led to the development of automatic differentiation techniques in quantum computing. Existing work has formulated differentiable quantum programming with bounded loops, providing a framework for scalable gradient calculation by quantum means for training quantum variational applications. However, promising parameterized quantum applications, e.g., quantum walk and unitary implementation, cannot be trained in the existing framework due to the natural involvement of unbounded loops. To fill in the gap, we provide the first differentiable quantum programming framework with unbounded loops, including a newly designed differentiation rule, code transformation, and their correctness proof. Technically, we introduce a randomized estimator for derivatives to deal with the infinite sum in the differentiation of unbounded loops, whose applicability in classical and probabilistic programming is also discussed. We implement our framework with Python and Q# and demonstrate a reasonable sample efficiency. Through extensive case studies, we showcase an exciting application of our framework in automatically identifying close-to-optimal parameters for several parameterized quantum applications.

TI Satellite-based entanglement distribution and quantum teleportation with
   continuous variables
SO COMMUNICATIONS PHYSICS
AB Advances in satellite quantum communications aim at reshaping the global telecommunication network by increasing the security of the transferred information. Here, we study the effects of atmospheric turbulence in continuous-variable entanglement distribution and quantum teleportation in the optical regime between a ground station and a satellite. More specifically, we study the degradation of entanglement due to various error sources in the distribution, namely, diffraction, atmospheric attenuation, turbulence, and detector inefficiency, in both downlink and uplink scenarios. As the fidelity of a quantum teleportation protocol using these distributed entangled resources is not sufficient, we include an intermediate station for either state generation, or beam refocusing, in order to reduce the effects of atmospheric turbulence and diffraction, respectively. The results show the feasibility of free-space entanglement distribution and quantum teleportation in downlink paths up to the LEO region, but also in uplink paths with the help of the intermediate station. Finally, we complete the study with microwave-optical comparison in bad weather situations, and with the study of horizontal paths in ground-to-ground and inter-satellite quantum communication.
   Quantum networks require a synergistic integration of terrestrial infrastructure employing optical fibers and wireless free-space communication technologies. In their study, the authors numerically investigate a satellite-based entanglement distribution and quantum teleportation across diverse freespace communication channels, such as diffraction or turbulence, finding that entanglement preservation endures throughout the downlink (satellite-to-ground) propagation for over 1000 km.

AB None of the quantum computing applications imagined will ever become a reality without quantum software. Quantum programmes have, to date, been coded with ad hoc techniques. Researchers in the field of quantum software engineering are, therefore, now demanding more systematic techniques and methods with which to produce software with sufficient quality. One of the challenges and lessons learned from classic software engineering is the need for high-level, abstract and technology-independent representations with which to design software before it is coded. This paper specifically addresses this challenge for quantum software design. Since UML is a well-proven modelling language that has been widely employed by industry for some time, we propose a UML extension for the representation of quantum algorithms. Our proposal comprises the definition of a UML profile based on various stereotypes that can be applied to the existing UML activity diagrams in order to represent quantum circuits. The advantage of this representation is that UML quantum circuits can be interrelated with other UML elements and diagrams, which will make it possible to represent various concerns and viewpoints of the so-called hybrid information systems. This will consequently enable classical and quantum aspects to be modelled together in integrated designs in a technological-agnostic manner that is already supported by a considerable number of existing software design tools.

TI Expressivity of Variational Quantum Machine Learning on the Boolean Cube
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM ENGINEERING
AB Categorical data play an important part in machine learning research and appears in a variety of applications. Models that can express large classes of real-valued functions on the Boolean cube are useful for problems involving discrete-valued data types, including those which are not Boolean. To this date, the commonly used schemes for embedding classical data into variational quantum machine learning models encode continuous values. Here, we investigate quantum embeddings for encoding Boolean-valued data into parameterized quantum circuits used for machine learning tasks. We narrow down representability conditions for functions on the n-dimensional Boolean cube with respect to previously known results, using two quantum embeddings: a phase embedding and an embedding based on quantum random access codes. We show that for any real-valued function on the n-dimensional Boolean cube, there exists a variational linear quantum model based on a phase embedding using n qubits that can represent it and an ensemble of such models using d < n qubits that can express any function with degree at most d. Additionally, we prove that variational linear quantum models that use the quantum random access code embedding can express functions on the Boolean cube with degree d <= [n/3] using [n/3] qubits, and that an ensemble of such models can represent any function on the Boolean cube with degree d <= [n/3]. Furthermore, we discuss the potential benefits of each embedding and the impact of serial repetitions. Finally, we demonstrate the use of the embeddings presented by performing numerical simulations and experiments on IBM quantum processors using the Qiskit machine learning framework.

TI One-step implementation of a multi-target-qubit controlled-phase gate
   with photonic qubits encoded via eigenstates of the photon-number parity
   operator
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB In recent years, quantum state engineering and quantum information processing using microwave fields and photons have received increasing attention. In addition, multiqubit gates play an important role in quantum information processing. In this work, we propose to encode a photonic qubit via two arbitrary orthogonal eigenstates (with eigenvalues +/- 1, respectively) of the photon-number parity operator. With such encoding, we then present a single-step method to realize a multi-target-qubit controlled-phase gate with one photonic qubit simultaneously controlling n - 1 target photonic qubits, by employing n microwave cavities coupled to one superconducting flux qutrit. This proposal can be applied not only to implement nonhybrid multi-target-qubit controlled-phase gates using photonic qubits with various encodings, but also to realize hybrid multi-target-qubit controlled-phase gates using photonic qubits with different encodings. The gate realization requires only a single-step operation. The gate operation time does not increase with the number of target qubits. Because the qutrit remains in the ground state during the entire operation, decoherence from the qutrit is greatly suppressed. As an application, we show how to apply this gate to generate a multicavity Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) entangled state with general expression. Depending on the specific encodings, we further discuss the preparation of several nonhybrid and hybrid GHZ entangled states of multiple cavities. We numerically investigate the circuit-QED experimental feasibility of creating a three-cavity spin-coherent hybrid GHZ state. This proposal can be extended to accomplish the same tasks in a wide range of physical systems, such as multiple microwave or optical cavities coupled to a three-level natural or artificial atom.

TI Noise-tolerant quantum speedups in quantum annealing without fine tuning
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Quantum annealing is a powerful alternative model of quantum computing, which can succeed in the presence of environmental noise even without error correction. However, despite great effort, no conclusive demonstration of a quantum speedup (relative to state of the art classical algorithms) has been shown for these systems, and rigorous theoretical proofs of a quantum advantage (such as the adiabatic formulation of Grover's search problem) generally rely on exponential precision in at least some aspects of the system, an unphysical resource guaranteed to be scrambled by experimental uncertainties and random noise. In this work, we propose a new variant of quantum annealing, called RFQA, which can maintain a scalable quantum speedup in the face of noise and modest control precision. Specifically, we consider a modification of flux qubit-based quantum annealing which includes low-frequency oscillations in the directions of the transverse field terms as the system evolves. We show that this method produces a quantum speedup for finding ground states in the Grover problem and quantum random energy model, and thus should be widely applicable to other hard optimization problems which can be formulated as quantum spin glasses. Further, we explore three realistic noise channels and show that the speedup from RFQA is resilient to 1/f-like local potential fluctuations and local heating from interaction with a sufficiently low temperature bath. Another noise channel, bath-assisted quantum cooling transitions, actually accelerates the algorithm and may outweigh the negative effects of the others. We also detail how RFQA may be implemented experimentally with current technology.

TI Rapid training of quantum recurrent neural networks
SO QUANTUM MACHINE INTELLIGENCE
AB Time series prediction is essential for human activities in diverse areas. A common approach to this task is to harness recurrent neural networks (RNNs). However, while their predictions are quite accurate, their learning process is complex and, thus, time and energy consuming. Here, we propose to extend the concept of RRNs by including continuous-variable quantum resources in it and to use a quantum-enhanced RNN to overcome these obstacles. The design of the continuous-variable quantum RNN (CV-QRNN) is rooted in the continuous-variable quantum computing paradigm. By performing extensive numerical simulations, we demonstrate that the quantum network is capable of learning-time dependence of several types of temporal data and that it converges to the optimal weights in fewer epochs than a classical network. Furthermore, for a small number of trainable parameters, it can achieve lower losses than its classical counterpart. CV-QRNN can be implemented using commercially available quantum-photonic hardware.

The attached plate connected to ground electrostatically interacts with two fixed plates. Two angle positions phi = 0, pi are made stable by applying a voltage difference between the attached plate and the two fixed plates. We assign phi = 0 and pi to the qubit states divide 0 and divide 1. Then, considering a chain of rotators, we construct the arbitrary phase-shift gate, the NOT gate and the Ising gate, which constitute a set of universal quantum gates. They are executed by controlling the voltage between various plates.

TI Probabilistic and Hierarchical Quantum Information Splitting Based on
   the Non-Maximally Entangled Cluster State
SO CMC-COMPUTERS MATERIALS & CONTINUA
AB With the emergence of classical communication security problems, quantum communication has been studied more extensively. In this paper, a novel probabilistic hierarchical quantum information splitting protocol is designed by using a non-maximally entangled four-qubit cluster state. Firstly, the sender Alice splits and teleports an arbitrary one-qubit secret state invisibly to three remote agents Bob, Charlie, and David. One agent David is in high grade, the other two agents Bob and Charlie are in low grade. Secondly, the receiver in high grade needs the assistance of one agent in low grade, while the receiver in low grade needs the aid of all agents. While introducing an ancillary qubit, the receiver's state can be inferred from the POVM measure-ment result of the ancillary qubit. Finally, with the help of other agents, the receiver can recover the secret state probabilistically by performing certain unitary operation on his own qubit. In addition, the security of the proto-col under eavesdropping attacks is analyzed. In this proposed protocol, the agents need only single-qubit measurements to achieve probabilistic hierarchi-cal quantum information splitting, which has appealing advantages in actual experiments. Such a probabilistic hierarchical quantum information splitting protocol hierarchical is expected to be more practical in multipartite quantum cryptography.

In this work, we obtain tripartite quantum-memory-assisted entropic uncertainty relations for multiple measurements and show that the lower bounds of these relations have three terms that depend on the complementarity of the observables, the conditional von-Neumann entropies, the Holevo quantities, and the mutual information. The saturation of these inequalities is analyzed.

TI Generation and verification of 27-qubit Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger
   states in a superconducting quantum computer
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS COMMUNICATIONS
AB Generating and detecting genuine multipartite entanglement (GME) of sizeable quantum states prepared on physical devices is an important benchmark for highlighting the progress of near-term quantum computers. A common approach to certify GME is to prepare a Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) state and measure a GHZ fidelity of at least 0.5. We measure the fidelities using multiple quantum coherences of GHZ states on 11 to 27 qubits prepared on the IBM Quantum ibmq_montreal device. Combinations of quantum readout error mitigation (QREM) and parity verification error detection are applied to the states. A fidelity of 0.546 +/- 0.017 was recorded for a 27-qubit GHZ state when QREM was used, demonstrating GME across the full device with a confidence level of 98.6%. We benchmarked the effect of parity verification on GHZ fidelity for two GHZ state preparation embeddings on the heavy-hexagon architecture. The results show that the effect of parity verification, while relatively modest, led to a detectable improvement of GHZ fidelity.

AB Block-encodings of matrices have become an essential element of quantum algorithms derived from the quantum singular value transformation. This includes a variety of algorithms ranging from the quantum linear systems problem to quantum walk, Hamiltonian simulation, and quantum machine learning. Many of these algorithms achieve optimal complexity in terms of black box matrix oracle queries, but so far the problem of computing quantum circuit implementations for block-encodings of matrices has been under-appreciated. In this paper we propose FABLE, a method to generate approximate quantum circuits for block-encodings of matrices in a fast manner. FABLE circuits have a simple structure and are directly formulated in terms of one- and two-qubit gates. For small and structured matrices they are feasible in the NISQ era, and the circuit parameters can be easily generated for problems up to fifteen qubits. Furthermore, we show that FABLE circuits can be compressed and sparsified. We provide a compression theorem that relates the compression threshold to the error on the block-encoding. We benchmark our method for Heisenberg and Hubbard Hamiltonian, and Laplacian operators to illustrate that they can be implemented with a reduced gate complexity without approximation error.

TI Security of quantum key distribution with source and detection
   imperfections
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB In practice, the device imperfections might introduce deviations from the idealized models used in the security proofs of quantum key distribution (QKD). This requires the refined security analysis for practical QKD. However, in most of previous analysis, the imperfections are individually considered with different models. Here, we derive a security analysis which takes both the source and detection imperfections into account. Particularly, the efficiency mismatch in the detection and a number of flaws in the source (such as, inaccuracy of encoded quantum state, side-channel of source, distinguishable decoy states, Trojan-horse, and so on) are analyzed in a general security model. Then the performance of the QKD system with the devices imperfections is evaluated. Our results present an important step toward the practical security of QKD wit realistic devices.

AB As part of the National Agenda for Quantum Technology, QuTech (TU Delft and TNO) has agreed to make quantum technology accessible to society and industry via its full-stack prototype: Quantum Inspire. This system includes two different types of programmable quantum chips: circuits made from superconducting materials (transmons), and circuits made from silicon-based materials that localize and control single-electron spins (spin qubits). Silicon-based spin qubits are a natural match to the semiconductor manufacturing community, and several industrial fabrication facilities are already producing spin-qubit chips. Here, we discuss our latest results in spin-qubit technology and highlight where the semiconducting community has opportunities to drive the field forward. Specifically, developments in the following areas would enable fabrication of more powerful spin-qubit based quantum computing devices: circuit design rules implementing cryogenic device physics models, high-fidelity gate patterning of low resistance or superconducting metals, gate-oxide defect mitigation in relevant materials, silicon-germanium heterostructure optimization, and accurate magnetic field generation from on-chip micromagnets.

TI Quantum reading of quantum information
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS A-MATHEMATICAL AND THEORETICAL
AB We extend the notion of quantum reading to the case where the information to be retrieved, which is encoded into a set of quantum channels, is of quantum nature. We use two-qubit unitaries describing the system-environment interaction, with the initial environment state determining the system's input-output channel and hence the encoded information. The performance of the most relevant two-qubit unitaries is determined with two different approaches: (i) one-shot quantum capacity of the channel arising between environment and system's output; (ii) estimation of parameters characterizing the initial quantum state of the environment. The obtained results are mostly in (qualitative) agreement, with some distinguishing features that include the CNOT unitary.

TI Boosting quantum amplitude exponentially in variational quantum
   algorithms
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB We introduce a family of variational quantum algorithms, which we coin as quantum iterative power algorithms (QIPAs), and demonstrate their capabilities as applied to global-optimization numerical experiments. Specifically, we demonstrate the QIPA based on a double exponential oracle as applied to ground state optimization of the H 2 molecule, search for the transmon qubit ground-state, and biprime factorization. Our results indicate that QIPA outperforms quantum imaginary time evolution (QITE) and requires a polynomial number of queries to reach convergence even with exponentially small overlap between an initial quantum state and the final desired quantum state, under some circumstances. We analytically show that there exists an exponential amplitude amplification at every step of the variational quantum algorithm, provided the initial wavefunction has non-vanishing probability with the desired state and that the unique maximum of the oracle is given by lambda(1)>0 , while all other values are given by the same value 0<lambda(2)<lambda(1 )(here lambda can be taken as eigenvalues of the problem Hamiltonian). The generality of the global-optimization method presented here invites further application to other problems that currently have not been explored with QITE-based near-term quantum computing algorithms. Such approaches could facilitate identification of reaction pathways and transition states in chemical physics, as well as optimization in a broad range of machine learning applications. The method also provides a general framework for adaptation of a class of classical optimization algorithms to quantum computers to further broaden the range of algorithms amenable to implementation on current noisy intermediate-scale quantum computers.

TI Large gradients via correlation in random parameterized quantum circuits
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Scaling of variational quantum algorithms to large problem sizes requires efficient optimization of random parameterized quantum circuits. For such circuits with uncorrelated parameters, the presence of exponentially vanishing gradients in cost function landscapes is an obstacle to optimization by gradient descent methods. In this work, we prove that reducing the dimensionality of the parameter space by utilizing circuit modules containing spatially or temporally correlated gate layers can allow one to circumvent the vanishing gradient phenomenon. Examples are drawn from random separable circuits and asymptotically optimal variational versions of Grover's algorithm based on the quantum alternating operator ansatz. In the latter scenario, our bounds on cost function variation imply a transition between vanishing gradients and efficient trainability as the number of layers is increased toward O(2n/2)<i, the optimal oracle complexity of quantum unstructured search.

AB Complementarity relations impose constraints on different aspects of quantum states. We study the complementarity relation within a multipath interferometer that includes detectors and quantum memory. We consider mixed states as the input states. We establish a duality relation between the visibility and the path distinguishability. Based on this duality, two triality relations are derived, one related to visibility, path distinguishability, and mixedness and the other related to visibility, path distinguishability, and entanglement. Therefore, the role of entanglement in multipath interferometer is characterized quantitatively. These complementarity relations are all complete for the two-path interferometer.

TI Waveguide-coupled deterministic quantum light sources and post-growth
   engineering methods for integrated quantum photonics
SO CHIP
AB Integrated photonic quantum circuits (IPQCs) have attracted increasing attention in recent years due to their widespread applications in quantum information science. While the most envisioned quantum technologies such as quantum communications, quantum computer and quantum simulations have placed a strict constraint on the scalability of chip-integrated quantum light sources. By introducing sizeconfined nanostructures or crystal imperfections, low-dimensional semiconductors have been broadly explored as chip-scale deterministic single-photon sources (SPSs). Thus far a variety of chip-integrated deterministic SPSs have been investigated across both monolithic and hybrid photonic platforms, including molecules, quantum dots, color centers and two-dimensional materials. With the rapid development of the chip-scale generation of single photons with deterministic quantum emitters, the field of IPQCs has raised new challenges and opportunities. In this paper, we highlight recent progress in the development of waveguide-coupled deterministic SPSs towards scalable IPQCs, and review the post-growth tuning techniques that are specifically developed to engineer the optical properties of these WG-coupled SPSs. Future prospects on stringent requirement for the quantum engineering toolbox in the burgeoning field of integrated photonics are also discussed.

AB In the universal blind quantum computation problem, a client wants to make use of a single quantum server to evaluate C vertical bar 0 > where C is an arbitrary quantum circuit while keeping C secret. The client's goal is to use as few resources as possible. This problem, first raised by Broadbent, Fitzsimons and Kashefi [FOCS 2009], has become fundamental to the study of quantum cryptography, not only because of its own importance, but also because it provides a testbed for new techniques that can be later applied to related problems (for example, quantum computation verification). Known protocols on this problem are mainly either information-theoretically (IT) secure or based on trapdoor assumptions (public key encryptions).
   In this paper we study how the availability of symmetric-key primitives, modeled by a random oracle, changes the complexity of universal blind quantum computation. We give a new universal blind quantum computation protocol. Similar to previous works on IT-secure protocols (for example, Broadbent-Fitzsimons-Kashefi), our protocol can be divided into two phases. In the first phase the client prepares some quantum gadgets with relatively simple quantum gates and sends them to the server, and in the second phase the client is entirely classical - it does not even need quantum storage. Crucially, the protocol's first phase is succinct, that is, its complexity is independent of the circuit size. Given the security parameter kappa, its complexity is only a fixed polynomial of kappa, and can be used to evaluate any circuit (or several circuits) of size up to a subexponential of kappa. In contrast, known schemes either require the client to perform quantum computations that scale with the size of the circuit, or require trapdoor assumptions.

TI Studying phonon coherence with a quantum sensor
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Nanomechanical oscillators offer numerous advantages for quantum technologies. Their integration with superconducting qubits shows promise for hardware-efficient quantum error-correction protocols involving superpositions of mechanical coherent states. Limitations of this approach include mechanical decoherence processes, particularly two-level system (TLS) defects, which have been widely studied using classical fields and detectors. In this manuscript, we use a superconducting qubit as a quantum sensor to perform phonon number-resolved measurements on a piezoelectrically coupled phononic crystal cavity. This enables a high-resolution study of mechanical dissipation and dephasing in coherent states of variable size ( n <overline> similar or equal to 1 - 10 \documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$\bar{n}\simeq 1-10$$\end{document} phonons). We observe nonexponential relaxation and state size-dependent reduction of the dephasing rate, which we attribute to TLS. Using a numerical model, we reproduce the dissipation signatures (and to a lesser extent, the dephasing signatures) via emission into a small ensemble (N = 5) of rapidly dephasing TLS. Our findings comprise a detailed examination of TLS-induced phonon decoherence in the quantum regime.
   Understanding decoherence in mechanical resonators in the quantum regime is crucial for realizing their potential in hybrid quantum devices. Cleland et al. study dissipation and dephasing induced by tunnelling defects in a nanomechanical resonator coupled to a transmon qubit, which serves as a quantum sensor.

TI 2-designs and redundant syndrome extraction for quantum error correction
SO QUANTUM INFORMATION PROCESSING
AB Imperfect measurement can degrade a quantum error correction scheme. A solution that restores fault tolerance is to add redundancy to the process of syndrome extraction. In this work, we show how to optimize this process for an arbitrary ratio of data qubit error probability to measurement error probability. The key is to design the measurements so that syndromes that correspond to different errors are separated by the maximum distance in the signal space, in close analogy to classical error correction codes. We find that the mathematical theory of 2-designs, appropriately modified, is the right tool for this. Analytical and simulation results for the bit-flip code, the 5-qubit code, and the Steane code are presented. The results show that design-based redundancy protocols show improvement in both cost and performance relative to conventional fault-tolerant error-correction schemes in situations, quite important in practice, where measurement errors are common. In the near term, the construction of a fault-tolerant logical qubit with a small number of noisy physical qubits will benefit from targeted redundancy in syndrome extraction.

TI Universal Parity Quantum Computing
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB We propose a universal gate set for quantum computing with all-to-all connectivity and intrinsic robustness to bit-flip errors based on parity encoding. We show that logical controlled phase gate and Rz rotations can be implemented in parity encoding with single-qubit operations. Together with logical Rx rotations, implemented via nearest-neighbor controlled-NOT gates and an Rx rotation, these form a universal gate set. As the controlled phase gate requires only single-qubit rotations, the proposed scheme has advantages for several cornerstone quantum algorithms, e.g., the quantum Fourier transform. We present a method to switch between different encoding variants via partial on-the-fly encoding and decoding.

TI Improved readout of qubit-coupled Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill states
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB The Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill encoding of a qubit in a harmonic oscillator is a promising building block towards fault-tolerant quantum computation. Recently, this encoding was experimentally demonstrated for the first time in trapped-ion and superconducting circuit systems. However, these systems lack some of the Gaussian operations which are critical to efficiently manipulate the encoded qubits. In particular, homodyne detection, which is the go-to method for efficient readout of the encoded qubit in the vast majority of theoretical work, is not readily available, heavily limiting the readout fidelity. Here, we present an alternative read-out strategy designed for qubit-coupled systems. Our method can improve the readout fidelity with several orders of magnitude for such systems and, surprisingly, even surpass the fidelity of homodyne detection in the low squeezing regime.

It is promising to reduce run times on large datasets in machine learning (ML). Meanwhile, k-nearest neighbor (kNN) is a simple ML algorithm that can be translated to a quantum version (QkNN) to perform classification tasks efficiently. Here, we show a new version of QkNN which has a speed up in time complexity by using a new design of quantum circuits called integrated swap test. This quantum circuit can load two N - dimensional states and calculate the fidelity between them. Results show that QkNN allows us to take a different approach to the ML field.

TI Exploring nonlocal correlations in arbitrarily high-dimensional systems
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB The utilization of higher-dimensional systems holds promise for unveiling novel phenomena and enhancing the efficacy of practical tasks, such as entanglement-based quantum cryptography. However, detecting quantum correlations within qudit systems poses a formidable challenge. In this study, we delve into the intricacies of Bell's nonlocality within higher-dimensional systems. We introduce a novel correlation function and leverage it to construct a family of Bell inequalities adapted for quantum systems of arbitrary dimensionality. By gauging the probability of local realism violation under random measurements as our primary metric, we explore the relation between pure state entanglement and nonlocality. Our findings align closely with predictions derived from the comprehensive polytope analysis via linear programming methods. While our focus predominantly centers on the two-qudit scenario, our methodology readily extends to the N-partite case, accommodating an arbitrary number of measurements per party.

TI Measurement-based quantum computation using two-component BECs
SO PHYSICA SCRIPTA
AB Measurement-based quantum computation (MBQC) using two-component Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) is proposed in this paper. An arbitrary state for one logical qubit is obtained by three-body measurement. Furthermore, a method is proposed for implementing controlled-Z gates for logical qubits in a graph state using BEC qubits and controlled-Z gates for BEC-type encoding. Results showed that the state after a measurement depends on the number of particles. These results pave the way for a novel quantum computing process based on particle control.

TI Parallel circuit implementation of variational quantum algorithms
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB We present a framework to split quantum circuits of variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) to allow for parallel training and execution to solve problems larger than the number of available qubits in a quantum device. We apply this method to combinatorial optimization problems, where inherent structures can be identified, and show how to implement these parallelized quantum circuits. We show how to formulate an objective function for the classical optimizer to guide the optimization towards meaningful solutions. We test our framework by creating a parallelized version of the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm and a variational version of quantum annealing and explain how our framework applies to other quantum optimization algorithms. We provide results obtained both from simulation and experiments on real hardware. Our results show that the information lost by splitting the quantum circuits can be partially recovered by optimizing a global objective function evaluated with the separate circuit samples.

TI Test Points for Online Monitoring of Quantum Circuits
SO ACM JOURNAL ON EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES IN COMPUTING SYSTEMS
AB Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) computers consisting of tens of inherently noisy quantum bits (qubits) suffer from reliability problems. Qubits and their gates are susceptible to various types of errors. Due to limited numbers of qubits and high error rates, quantum error correction cannot be applied. Physical constraints of quantum hardware including the error rates are used to guide the design and the layout of quantum circuits. The error rates determine the selection of qubits and their operations. The resulting circuit is executed on the quantum computer.
   This study explores the risk of unexpected changes in the error rates of NISQ computers post-calibration. We show that unexpected changes in error rates can alter the output state of a quantum circuit. To detect these changes, we propose the insertion of test points into the quantum circuit to enable online monitoring of the physical qubit behavior. We utilize classical, superposition, and uncompute test points. Furthermore, we use a gate error coverage metric to assess the quality of the tests. We verify the effectiveness of the proposed scheme on different IBM quantum computers (IBM Q), in addition to a noisy simulation that shows the scalability of the proposed approach.

TI Spooky action at a global distance: analysis of space-based entanglement
   distribution for the quantum internet
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Recent experimental breakthroughs in satellite quantum communications have opened up the possibility of creating a global quantum internet using satellite links. This approach appears to be particularly viable in the near term, due to the lower attenuation of optical signals from satellite to ground, and due to the currently short coherence times of quantum memories. The latter prevents ground-based entanglement distribution using atmospheric or optical-fiber links at high rates over long distances. In this work, we propose a global-scale quantum internet consisting of a constellation of orbiting satellites that provides a continuous, on-demand entanglement distribution service to ground stations. The satellites can also function as untrusted nodes for the purpose of long-distance quantum-key distribution. We develop a technique for determining optimal satellite configurations with continuous coverage that balances both the total number of satellites and entanglement-distribution rates. Using this technique, we determine various optimal satellite configurations for a polar-orbit constellation, and we analyze the resulting satellite-to-ground loss and achievable entanglement-distribution rates for multiple ground station configurations. We also provide a comparison between these entanglement-distribution rates and the rates of ground-based quantum repeater schemes. Overall, our work provides the theoretical tools and the experimental guidance needed to make a satellite-based global quantum internet a reality.

TI Demonstration of hardware efficient photonic variational quantum
   algorithm
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Quantum computing has changed the paradigm of computer science, where quantum technologies have promised to outperform classical ones. Such an advantage was only demonstrated for tasks with no application or out of reach for the state-of-the-art quantum technologies. In this context, a promising strategy to find practical use of quantum computers exploits hybrid models, where a quantum device estimates a hard-to-compute quantity, while a classical optimizer trains the parameters. In this work, we demonstrate that single photons and linear optical networks are sufficient for implementing variational quantum algorithms, when the problem specification (ansatz) is tailored to this specific platform. We show this by a proof-of-principle demonstration to tackle an instance of a factorization task, whose solution is encoded in the ground state of a suitable Hamiltonian. This work, which combines Variational Quantum Algorithms with hardware efficient ans & auml;tze for linear optics, showcases a promising pathway toward practical applications for photonic quantum platforms.

TI Extending Qutes: a practical high-level language for quantum computing
SO COMPUTER JOURNAL
AB Quantum computing offers transformative capabilities by exploiting quantum mechanical principles to solve problems that are intractable for classical systems, particularly in areas like cryptography, optimization, and data analysis. However, most current quantum programming languages operate at a low level, requiring in-depth expertise in quantum mechanics and circuit theory, which presents a barrier to wider adoption. In this work, we introduce Qutes, a high-level quantum programming language that simplifies the development of quantum algorithms while preserving the flexibility needed for advanced applications. Qutes abstracts low-level quantum operations through intuitive syntax and high-level constructs, enabling developers to express complex algorithms without detailed circuit knowledge. Built atop Qiskit, Qutes transpiles seamlessly into executable code, ensuring compatibility with real quantum hardware. We present the architecture, language design, and hybrid classical-quantum integration of Qutes, and demonstrate its use through implementations of canonical quantum algorithms. Our results highlight Qutes' potential to democratize quantum programming by lowering the entry threshold and accelerating prototyping for researchers and developers alike.

TI Characterizing Quantum Instruments: From Nondemolition Measurements to
   Quantum Error Correction
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB In advanced quantum processors, quantum operations are increasingly processed along multiple insequence measurements that result in classical data and affect the rest of the computation. Because of the information gain of classical measurements, nonunitary dynamical processes can affect the system, which common quantum channel descriptions fail to describe faithfully. Quantum measurements are correctly treated by so-called quantum instruments, capturing both classical outputs and postmeasurement quantum states. Here we present a general recipe for characterizing quantum instruments and demonstrate its experimental implementation and analysis. Thereby the full dynamics of a quantum instrument can be captured, exhibiting details of the quantum dynamics that would be overlooked with standard techniques. For illustration, we apply our characterization technique to a quantum instrument used for the detection of qubit loss and leakage, which was recently implemented as a building block in a quantum error-correction (QEC) experiment [Nature 585, 207 (2020)]. Our analysis reveals unexpected and in-depth information about the failure modes of the implementation of the quantum instrument. We then numerically study the implications of these experimental failure modes on QEC performance, when the instrument is employed as a building block in QEC protocols on a logical qubit. Our results highlight the importance of careful characterization and modeling of failure modes in quantum instruments, as compared to simplistic hardware-agnostic phenomenological noise models, which fail to predict the undesired behavior of faulty quantum instruments. The presented methods and results are directly applicable to generic quantum instruments and will be beneficial to many complex and high-precision applications.

TI Measurement-Free Quantum Error Correction Optimized for Biased Noise
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB In this paper, we derive optimized measurement-free protocols for quantum error correction and the implementation of a universal gate set optimized for an error model that is noise biased. The noise bias is adapted for neutral-atom platforms, where two- and multi-qubit gates are realized with Rydberg interactions and are thus expected to be the dominant source of noise. Careful design of the gates allows us to further reduce the noise model to Pauli-Z errors. In addition, the presented circuits are robust to arbitrary single-qubit gate errors, and we demonstrate that the break-even point can be significantly improved compared to fully fault-tolerant measurement-free schemes. The obtained logical qubits with their suppressed error rates on logical gate operations can then be used as building blocks in a first step of error correction in order to push the effective error rates below the threshold of a fully fault-tolerant and scalable quantum error-correction scheme.

TI Variational quantum anomaly detection: Unsupervised mapping of phase
   diagrams on a physical quantum computer
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB One of the most promising applications of quantum computing is simulating quantum many-body systems. However, there is still a need for methods to efficiently investigate these systems in a native way, capturing their full complexity. Here we propose variational quantum anomaly detection, an unsupervised quantum machine learning algorithm to analyze quantum data from quantum simulation. The algorithm is used to extract the phase diagram of a system with no prior physical knowledge and can be performed end-to-end on the same quantum device where the system is simulated on. We showcase its capabilities by mapping out the phase diagram of the one-dimensional extended Bose-Hubbard model with dimerized hoppings, which exhibit a symmetry protected topological phase. Further, we show that it can be used with readily accessible devices today by performing the algorithm on a real quantum computer.

TI A Verified Optimizer for Quantum Circuits
SO PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACM ON PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES-PACMPL
AB We present VOQC, the first fully verified optimizer for quantum circuits, written using the Coq proof assistant. Quantum circuits are expressed as programs in a simple, low-level language called SQIR, a simple quantum intermediate representation, which is deeply embedded in Coq. Optimizations and other transformations are expressed as Coq functions, which are proved correct with respect to a semantics of SQIR programs. SQIR uses a semantics of matrices of complex numbers, which is the standard for quantum computation, but treats matrices symbolically in order to reason about programs that use an arbitrary number of quantum bits. SQIR'S careful design and our provided automation make it possible to write and verify a broad range of optimizations in VOQC, including full-circuit transformations from cutting-edge optimizers.

TI Factoring an integer with three oscillators and a qubit
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB A common starting point of traditional quantum algorithm design is the notion of a universal quantum computer with a scalable number of qubits. This convenient abstraction mirrors classical computations manipulating bits. It allows for a device-independent development of algorithmic primitives. Here we argue that an alternative approach centered on the physical setup can yield great benefits. As an example, we consider hybrid qubit-oscillator systems with linear optics operations augmented by certain qubit-controlled Gaussian unitaries. The continuous variable Fourier transform and certain arithmetic operations have native realizations in such systems. We put this to algorithmic use and give a polynomial-time quantum factoring algorithm which uses only one qubit and three oscillators, independent of the number being factored.

AB Internet of Vehicles (IoV) is a hot research issue at home and abroad. However, with the development of intelligent, sharing and network connection of IoV technology, the security protection of IoV communication has become a focus. Traditional encryption technology relies on encryption systems, whose security relies on the difficulty of solving mathematical problems and cannot resist quantum computing attacks. The security of classical encryption-based data transmission has been challenged. Therefore, it is imperative to realize secure transmission in IoV based on quantum technologies such as quantum teleportation. In this paper, based on the secure transmission of shared secret states, the author has designed a model for the secure transmission of data among multiple vehicles, Which does not require trusted client nodes and thus improves the performance against node attacks. Further, considering the communication distance in practical situations, the quantum repeater is introduced to construct a quantum state transmission model based on the quantum repeater in IoV to realize secure communication among multiple vehicles. Compared with traditional data transmission, the quantum state transmission data is more secure and unbreakable, which provides a new idea for constructing secure communication in IoV.

TI Single-component gradient rules for variational quantum algorithms
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Many near-term quantum computing algorithms are conceived as variational quantum algorithms, in which parameterized quantum circuits are optimized in a hybrid quantum-classical setup. Examples are variational quantum eigensolvers, quantum approximate optimization algorithms as well as various algorithms in the context of quantum-assisted machine learning. A common bottleneck of any such algorithm is constituted by the optimization of the variational parameters. A popular set of optimization methods work on the estimate of the gradient, obtained by means of circuit evaluations. We will refer to the way in which one can combine these circuit evaluations as gradient rules. This work provides a comprehensive picture of the family of gradient rules that vary parameters of quantum gates individually. The most prominent known members of this family are the parameter shift rule (PSR) and the finite differences method. To unite this family, we propose a generalized PSR that expresses all members of the aforementioned family as special cases, and discuss how all of these can be seen as providing access to a linear combination of exact first- and second-order derivatives. We further prove that a PSR with one non-shifted evaluation and only one shifted circuit evaluation does not exist, and introduce a novel perspective for approaching new gradient rules.

TI A Quantum Approach for Exploring the Numerical Results of the Heat
   Equation
SO ALGORITHMS
AB This paper presents a quantum algorithm for solving the one-dimensional heat equation with Dirichlet boundary conditions. The algorithm utilizes discretization techniques and employs quantum gates to emulate the heat propagation operator. Central to the algorithm is the Trotter-Suzuki decomposition, enabling the simulation of the time evolution of the temperature distribution. The initial temperature distribution is encoded into quantum states, and the evolution of these states is driven by quantum gates tailored to mimic the heat propagation process. As per the literature, quantum algorithms exhibit an exponential computational speedup with increasing qubit counts, albeit facing challenges such as exponential growth in relative error and cost functions. This study addresses these challenges by assessing the potential impact of quantum simulations on heat conduction modeling. Simulation outcomes across various quantum devices, including simulators and real quantum computers, demonstrate a decrease in the relative error with an increasing number of qubits. Notably, simulators like the simulator_statevector exhibit lower relative errors compared to the ibmq_qasm_simulator and ibm_osaka. The proposed approach underscores the broader applicability of quantum computing in physical systems modeling, particularly in advancing heat conductivity analysis methods. Through its innovative approach, this study contributes to enhancing modeling accuracy and efficiency in heat conduction simulations across diverse domains.

AB Quantum key distribution (QKD) offers unconditional information security by allowing two distant users to establish a common encryption key resilient to hacking. Resultingly, QKD networks interconnecting critical infrastructure and enabling the secure exchange of classified information, can provide a solution to the increasing number of successful cyberattacks. To efficiently deploy quantum networks, the technology must be integrated over existing communication infrastructure, such as optical fibre links. Yet, QKD poses stringent requirements on the conditions of the network over which it is deployed. This work demonstrates the first quantum communication network in Cyprus via the deployment of a multi-node quantum network, exploiting existing commercial underground optical fibre. The network employs bidirectional occupation of fibres and wavelength multiplexing in a ring architecture to achieve, with minimal use of dark fibres, high-rate QKD. Results obtained reveal consistent key generation rates across all nodes, confirming reliable operation in a real-world environment. This deployment highlights the feasibility of leveraging existing telecom infrastructure for quantum-secured communication, marking a significant step toward scalable and cost-effective quantum networks suited for critical applications.

TI Quantum machine learning assisted lung cancer telemedicine
SO AIP ADVANCES
AB The rapidly increasing human population, the high cost of medical equipment, and the spread of multifactor diseases have transformed the entire healthcare industry into an electronic consulting, telediagnosis, delivery, and treatment model to avoid the physical personalization of patients. Despite this, we face many challenges, including low sensitivity of medical instruments, signal losses, and security of medical records. This study aims to develop a lung cancer telemedicine platform that utilizes classical and quantum computing models to classify lung cancer subtypes and stages and develop effective telemedicine techniques. By using optoplasmonic biosensors, the biosignals (that show lung cancer) were extracted and correlated with cloud datasets (containing patient information) to determine the dose of laser interstitial thermal therapy (LITT). Then, applying quantum teleportation, the biosignals and doses of LITT were teleported between two healthcare stations. From the numerical result, we observed the maximum sensitivity (10 421 nm/RIU) of the proposed biosensor, a minimum degree of the loss function and maximum correlation of data from the quantum machine learning model, and high teleportation fidelity (96% transmission fidelity for biosignals and 98% teleportation fidelity for doses LITT). This shows the proposed telemedicine schemes anticipated solutions for the long-distance faithful lung cancer telemedicine. (c) 2023 Author(s).

TI Scalable Optical Quantum State Synthesizer with Dual-Mode Resonator
   Memory
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Optical quantum computing is a promising approach for achieving large-scale quantum computation. While Gaussian operations have been successfully scaled, the inherently weak nonlinearity in optics makes generating highly non-Gaussian states a critical challenge for universality and fault tolerance. Here, we propose and experimentally demonstrate a scalable method to generate optical non-Gaussian states with a resonator-based quantum memory that supports continuous-time storage and retrieval, in contrast to conventional loop-based memories. We introduce a dual-mode operation of the memory, enabling both storage and entangling functionalities within a single device. By employing a time-domain-multiplexed approach, we successfully demonstrate both cat and Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill breeding protocols in a scalable fashion, marking a key step toward quantum error correction. Our experiment also marks the first full demonstration of an optical resonator memory performing writing, storage, and readout operations. We validate the memory by storing squeezed single-photon states with up to 93% total efficiency, and measure an energy relaxation time T1 = 2.3 mu s and dephasing time T phi = 0.96 mu s. These results establish a scalable pathway to generating complex non-Gaussian states required for fault-tolerant optical quantum computing. Beyond computation, our techniques provide new tools for enhancing quantum communication, sensing, and metrology.

TI Quantum Machine Learning Algorithms for Drug Discovery Applications
SO JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL INFORMATION AND MODELING
AB The growing quantity of public and private data sets focused on small molecules screened against biological targets or whole organisms provides a wealth of drug discovery relevant data. This is matched by the availability of machine learning algorithms such as Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Deep Neural Networks (DNN) that are computationally expensive to perform on very large data sets with thousands of molecular descriptors. Quantum computer (QC) algorithms have been proposed to offer an approach to accelerate quantum machine learning over classical computer (CC) algorithms, however with significant limitations. In the case of cheminformatics, which is widely used in drug discovery, one of the challenges to overcome is the need for compression of large numbers of molecular descriptors for use on a QC. Here, we show how to achieve compression with data sets using hundreds of molecules (SARS-CoV-2) to hundreds of thousands of molecules (whole cell screening data sets for plague and M. tuberculosis) with SVM and the data reuploading classifier (a DNN equivalent algorithm) on a QC benchmarked against CC and hybrid approaches. This study illustrates the steps needed in order to be "quantum computer ready" in order to apply quantum computing to drug discovery and to provide the foundation on which to build this field.

TI Optimal strategies for optical quantum memories using long-lived
   noble-gas spins
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Nuclear spins of noble gases exhibit exceptionally long coherence times and can potentially serve as a longlived storage medium for quantum information. We analyze and compare the performance of two mechanisms for mapping the quantum state of light onto the collective spin state of noble gases. The first mechanism utilizes collisional exchange with the electronic spin state of metastable noble-gas atoms, while the second relies on spin-exchange collisions with ground-state alkali-metal atoms. We describe the operation of an optical quantum memory relying on these two mechanisms using a compact model and study strategies that optimize the memory storage efficiency. Through numerical simulations, we identify optimal sequences for storing optical signals with different signal bandwidths and electronic spin relaxation rates. This work highlights the qualitative difference between the two approaches for using noble gases as long-lived quantum memories at noncryogenic conditions and outlines the regimes in which they are expected to be efficient.

AB Rapid developments in quantum communication are paving the way forward for more advanced technologies. Conventional channels like optical fibres have been a great resource in recent decades. However, they suffer largely from exponential transmissivity decays and are not suitable for very long-distance communication. Satellite links along with quantum cryptography can be the foundation of modern quantum communication systems. This work presents an overview of the hybrid quantum repeater with a detailed analysis of different parametric relations in satellite-based communication from experimental data. The link efficiency between the satellite-based scheme and terrestrial scheme is also compared, emphasising the satellite-based scheme's importance for quantum communication. Finally, we present a performance analysis of different quantities and derive relations between them.

TI Variational quantum algorithms for trace distance and fidelity
   estimation
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Estimating the difference between quantum data is crucial in quantum computing. However, as typical characterizations of quantum data similarity, the trace distance and quantum fidelity are believed to be exponentially-hard to evaluate in general. In this work, we introduce hybrid quantum-classical algorithms for these two distance measures on near-term quantum devices where no assumption of input state is required. First, we introduce the variational trace distance estimation (VTDE) algorithm. We in particular provide the technique to extract the desired spectrum information of any Hermitian matrix by local measurement. A novel variational algorithm for trace distance estimation is then derived from this technique, with the assistance of a single ancillary qubit. Notably, VTDE could avoid the barren plateau issue with logarithmic depth circuits due to a local cost function. Second, we introduce the variational fidelity estimation algorithm. We combine Uhlmann's theorem and the freedom in purification to translate the estimation task into an optimization problem over a unitary on an ancillary system with fixed purified inputs. We then provide a purification subroutine to complete the translation. Both algorithms are verified by numerical simulations and experimental implementations, exhibiting high accuracy for randomly generated mixed states.

TI Quantum error correction with gauge symmetries
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Quantum simulations of lattice gauge theories (LGTs) are often formulated on an enlarged Hilbert space containing both physical and unphysical sectors in order to retain a local Hamiltonian. We provide simple fault-tolerant procedures that exploit such redundancy by combining a phase flip error correction code with the Gauss' law constraint to correct one-qubit errors for a Z(2) or truncated U(1) LGT in 1+1 and 2+1 dimensions with a link flux cutoff of 1. Unlike existing work on detecting violations of Gauss' law, our circuits are fault tolerant and the overall error correction scheme outperforms a naive application of the [5,1, 3] code. The constructions outlined can be extended to LGT systems with larger cutoffs and may be of use in understanding how to hybridize error correction and quantum simulation for LGTs in higher space-time dimensions and with different symmetry groups.

TI Genuine Bell locality and its maximal violation in quantum networks
SO PHYSICA SCRIPTA
AB In K-locality networks, local hidden variables emitted from classical sources are distributed among limited observers. We explore genuine Bell locality in classical networks, where, regarding all local hidden variables as classical objects that can be perfectly cloned and spread throughout the networks, any observer can access all local hidden variables plus shared randomness. In the proposed linear and nonlinear Bell-type inequalities, there are more correlators to reveal genuine Bell locality than those in the K-locality inequalities, and their upper bounds can be specified using the probability normalization of the predetermined probability distribution. On the other hand, the no-cloning theorem limits the broadcast of quantum correlations in quantum networks. To explore genuine Bell nonlocality, the stabilizing operators play an important role in designing the segmented Bell operators and assigning the incompatible measurements for the spatially separated observers. We prove the maximal violations of the proposed Bell-type inequalities tailored for the given qubit distributions in quantum networks.

We consider a system consisting of a minimally coupled massive quantum scalar field in a spacetime undergoing homogeneous and isotropic expansion, transitioning from one stationary state to another through a brief inflationary period. We simulate two vibration modes, positive and negative for a given field momentum, by devising a quantum circuit that implements the time evolution. With this circuit, we study the number of particles created after the universe expands at a given rate, both by simulating the circuit and by actual experimental implementation on IBM quantum computers, consisting of hundreds of quantum gates. We find that state-of-the-art error mitigation techniques are useful to improve the estimation of the number of particles and the fidelity of the state.

TI An Efficient Analytical Approach for Error Assessment in Quantum
   Circuits
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB One of the most important challenges in constructing large-scale quantum computers is handling the high error rates in quantum systems. Using error correction codes and frequently applying error correction on qubits is a common approach to compete with this challenge. Quantum error analysis techniques are required to compare the effectiveness of error correction codes and also to efficiently insert the error correction procedures (ECPs) in a quantum circuit. However, most existing assessment approaches are either inaccurate and inefficient or are slow and time-consuming. To address these problems, in this paper, a fast analytical approach is proposed that analyzes errors and smartly inserts ECPs into a quantum circuit and finally estimates the failure probability of the circuit. The approach is also able to estimate the pseudo-threshold of quantum error correction codes. Experimental results show that the proposed method improves the number of ECPs and the latency of the circuit encoded by the Steane's [[7, 1, 3]] code on average by about 52.6% and 29.4% for the one-level one and by about 79.4% and 48.5% for the two-level concatenated code respectively compared with a related method in the literature. Moreover, the proposed method takes only a few seconds to run on even our relatively large benchmark circuits.

We demonstrate the first quantum simulation of an NMR spectrum, computing the zero-field spectrum of the methyl group of acetonitrile using four qubits of a trapped-ion quantum computer. We reduce the sampling cost of the quantum simulation by an order of magnitude using compressed sensing techniques.

TI Hybrid Quantum Noise Model to Compute Gaussian Quantum Channel Capacity
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Quantum information processing leverages the principles of quantum mechanics, utilizing qubits, to improve computational and communicative tasks. In this realm, the quantum channel's capacity is pivotal in determining the efficiency and accuracy of quantum information handling, with its performance being significantly influenced by channel noise. Our study aims to establish a holistic hybrid quantum noise model to determine the quantum channel capacity. In this paper, we formulated a mathematical expression for this capacity and conducted simulations for both Gaussian and non-Gaussian inputs. A hybrid noise model is constructed by convolution of Poisson-distributed quantum noise with classical additive white Gaussian noise. We characterized the quantum-classical noise and the received signal using Gaussian Mixture Models. The maximum amount of quantum information that can be reliably transmitted over a quantum channel (per use of the channel) is determined by its capacity, and entropy and related quantities like mutual information play a role in calculating this capacity. Our formulation of quantum channel capacity is derived from the mutual information shared between the transmitter and receiver, encompassing the entropies of the signals. The quantum channel presents a higher capacity-to-signal-to-noise ratio for Gaussian inputs than non-Gaussian ones.

   algorithms
SO QUANTUM MACHINE INTELLIGENCE
AB Quantum machine learning-and specifically Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQAs)-offers a powerful, flexible paradigm for programming near-term quantum computers, with applications in chemistry, metrology, materials science, data science, and mathematics. Here, one trains an ansatz, in the form of a parameterized quantum circuit, to accomplish a task of interest. However, challenges have recently emerged suggesting that deep ansatzes are difficult to train, due to flat training landscapes caused by randomness or by hardware noise. This motivates our work, where we present a variable structure approach to build ansatzes for VQAs. Our approach, called VAns (Variable Ansatz), applies a set of rules to both grow and (crucially) remove quantum gates in an informed manner during the optimization. Consequently, VAns is ideally suited to mitigate trainability and noise-related issues by keeping the ansatz shallow. We employ VAns in the variational quantum eigensolver for condensed matter and quantum chemistry applications, in the quantum autoencoder for data compression and in unitary compilation problems showing successful results in all cases.

TI Optimality Study of Existing Quantum Computing Layout Synthesis Tools
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON COMPUTERS
AB Layout synthesis, an important step in quantum computing, processes quantum circuits to satisfy device layout constraints. In this paper, we construct QUEKO benchmarks for this problem, which have known optimal depths and gate counts. We use QUEKO to evaluate the optimality of current layout synthesis tools, including Cirq from Google, Qiskit from IBM, tjketi from Cambridge Quantum Computing, and a recent academic work. To our surprise, despite over a decade of research and development by academia and industry on compilation and synthesis for quantum circuits, we are still able to demonstrate large optimality gaps: 1.5-12x on average on a smaller device and 5-45x on average on a larger device. This suggests substantial room for improvement of the efficiency of quantum computer by better layout synthesis tools. Finally, we also prove the NP-completeness of the layout synthesis problem for quantum computing. We have made the QUEKO benchmarks open-source.

TI Variational quantum entanglement classification discrimination
SO PHYSICA A-STATISTICAL MECHANICS AND ITS APPLICATIONS
AB With the rapid development of quantum technology, understanding the properties of entanglement states has become an urgent task. Various classifications of entanglement states have been proposed to cater to distinct quantum applications, highlighting the significance of entanglement classification. This paper presents a variational quantum classifier for entanglement classification discrimination which can effectively reduce the measurement resources, specifically for four-qubit entanglement equivalence classifications under SLOCC (Stochastic Local Operations and Classical Communication). Through training one-to-one and one -to -many models, our proposed method achieves excellent performance in the entanglement classification. We further investigate the impact of parameterized quantum circuit layers and various measurement settings on the classifier's performance. Considering the inherent noise present in near -term quantum computers, we also analyze how noise affects the model's performance. Moreover, we explore the classifier's capabilities in the context of multi-qubit entanglement systems. Numerical simulations demonstrate that high -precision entanglement classification tasks can be accomplished with shallow circuit depths, and the model exhibits resilience to noise. Additionally, the results reveal the versatility and potential application of our proposed model in larger -scale quantum systems by effectively handling entanglement classification tasks involving an increased number of qubits.

TI Molecular topological quantum computer
SO EPJ QUANTUM TECHNOLOGY
AB Biomolecular residue pairs have been utilized in constructing quantum logic gates (QLGs), significantly reducing the hardware size to the subnanoscale level. However, the development of molecular fault-tolerant topological quantum computers (TQCs) presents challenges in error reduction and hardware size minimization. This study presents the manipulation of molecular QLGs (MQLGs) by utilizing protein residue pairs as molecular transistors, enabling the construction of molecular topological QLGs. This innovative approach leverages molecular functionality in quantum computer (QC) designs to build sub-nanometer transistors that significantly reduce size, enhance efficiency, and accelerate computing. The transmission spectra of electron transfer in molecular junction systems were analyzed using the non-equilibrium Green's function method. The molecular field effect led to the observation of four quantum states on a two-dimensional potential energy surface with two degrees of freedom-proton translation and molecular rotation. These states form a quaternary QLG, similar to a 2-qubit controlled-NOT logic gate. By applying the Kitaev honeycomb lattice model, MQLGs were employed to generate nonabelian anyons that adhere to fusion rules, such as Ising and Fibonacci anyons. Furthermore, quantum circuits incorporating nonabelian anyons and their fusion processes were developed for practical applications. These findings underscore the shift away from conventional atom-based silicon technology and highlight the potential for innovative applications of molecular universal QLGs, particularly in the advancement of sub-nanometer molecular fault-tolerance TQCs.

TI Multiplexed telecommunication-band quantum networking with atom arrays
   in optical cavities
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB The realization of a quantum network node of matter-based qubits compatible with telecommunication-band operation and large-scale quantum information processing is an outstanding challenge that has limited the potential of elementary quantum networks. We propose a platform for interfacing quantum processors comprising neutral atom arrays with telecommunication-band photons in a multiplexed network architecture. The use of a large atom array instead of a single atom mitigates the deleterious effects of two-way communication and improves the entanglement rate between two nodes by nearly two orders of magnitude. Furthermore, this system simultaneously provides the ability to perform high-fidelity deterministic gates and readout within each node, opening the door to quantum repeater and purification protocols to enhance the length and fidelity of the network, respectively. Using intermediate nodes as quantum repeaters, we demonstrate the feasibility of entanglement distribution over approximate to 1500 km based on realistic assumptions, providing a blueprint fora transcontinental network. Finally, we demonstrate that our platform can distribute greater than or similar to 25 Bell pairs over metropolitan distances, which could serve as the backbone of a distributed fault-tolerant quantum computer.

TI Multiqubit time-varying quantum channels for NISQ-era superconducting
   quantum processors
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Time-varying quantum channels (TVQCs) have been proposed as a model to include fluctuations of the relaxation (T1) and dephasing times (T2). In previous works, realizations of multiqubit TVQCs have been assumed to be equal for all the qubits of an error correction block, implying that the random variables that describe the fluctuations of T1 and T2 are block-to-block uncorrelated but qubit-wise perfectly correlated for the same block. In this article, we perform a correlation analysis of the fluctuations of the relaxation times of five multiqubit quantum processors. Our results show that it is reasonable to assume that the fluctuations of the relaxation and dephasing times of superconducting qubits are local to each of the qubits of the system. Based on these results, we discuss the multiqubit TVQCs when the fluctuations of the decoherence parameters for an error correction block are qubit-wise uncorrelated (as well as from block-to-block), a scenario we have named the fast time-varying quantum channel (FTVQC). Furthermore, we lower-bound the quantum capacity of general FTVQCs based on a quantity we refer to as the ergodic quantum capacity. Finally, we use numerical simulations to study the performance of quantum error correction codes when they operate over FTVQCs.

TI Realization of Real-Time Fault-Tolerant Quantum Error Correction
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW X
AB Correcting errors in real time is essential for reliable large-scale quantum computations. Realizing this high-level function requires a system capable of several low-level primitives, including single-qubit and two-qubit operations, midcircuit measurements of subsets of qubits, real-time processing of measurement outcomes, and the ability to condition subsequent gate operations on those measurements. In this work, we use a 10-qubit quantum charge-coupled device trapped-ion quantum computer to encode a single logical qubit using the [[7, 1, 3]] color code, first proposed by Steane [Phys. Rev. Lett. 77, 793 (1996)]. The logical qubit is initialized into the eigenstates of three mutually unbiased bases using an encoding circuit, and we measure an average logical state preparation and measurement (SPAM) error of 1.7(2) x 10-3, compared to the average physical SPAM error 2.4(4) x 10-3 of our qubits. We then perform multiple syndrome measurements on the encoded qubit, using a real-time decoder to determine any necessary corrections that are done either as software updates to the Pauli frame or as physically applied gates. Moreover, these procedures are done repeatedly while maintaining coherence, demonstrating a dynamically protected logical qubit memory. Additionally, we demonstrate non-Clifford qubit operations by encoding a T over bar I+)L magic state with an error rate below the threshold required for magic state distillation. Finally, we present system-level simulations that allow us to identify key hardware upgrades that may enable the system to reach the pseudothreshold.

TI MODELING OF ENTANGLED STATES IN QUBIT CLUSTERS
SO PHYSICAL AND CHEMICAL ASPECTS OF THE STUDY OF CLUSTERS NANOSTRUCTURES
   AND NANOMATERIALS
AB The model of universal quantum computation, which uses quantum circuits consisting of one-qubit and two-qubit logic elements, is implemented in several existing quantum-computing devices. In the last decade, the idea of using multiqubit gates has become very relevant, since this, in the future, will reduce the noise level of quantum circuits. The main resource of quantum computing is the entanglement of individual qubits that form a cluster. Despite the actuality of this issue, so far only a few examples of the simplest logic elements with entanglement are considered in theory for a system of three qubits (Toffoli element and double controlled NOT). This work is devoted to mathematical modeling of the entangled states of quantum systems composed of several qubits. A mathematical method is proposed for the exact or approximate construction of Hamiltonians generating the required unitary transformations. It turns out that the approach based on the representation of Hamiltonians and unitary transformations in the Pauli basis is the most suitable in this context for two reasons: firstly, the Pauli basis forms the Lie algebra of the corresponding unitary group; secondly, there are only real coefficients in the decompositions of Hamiltonians and state density operators in this basis. The method is considered in detail on the example of a three-qubit cluster driven by a ternary Hamiltonian to obtain the Greenberger-Horn-Zeilinger entangled state. For this system, the thermal state is also studied and the corresponding density operator is obtained.

TI QuIP: A P4 Quantum Internet Protocol Prototyping Framework
SO IEEE JOURNAL ON SELECTED AREAS IN COMMUNICATIONS
AB Quantum entanglement is so fundamentally different from a network packet that several quantum network stacks have been proposed; one of which has even been experimentally demonstrated. Several simulators have also been developed to make up for limited hardware availability, and which facilitate the design and evaluation of quantum network protocols. However, the lack of shared tooling and community-agreed node architectures has resulted in protocol implementations that are tightly coupled to their simulators. Besides limiting their reusability between different simulators, it also makes building upon prior results and simulations difficult. To address this problem, we have developed QuIP: a P4-based Quantum Internet Protocol prototyping framework for quantum network protocol design. QuIP is a framework for designing and implementing quantum network protocols in a platform-agnostic fashion. It achieves this by providing the means to flexibly, but rigorously, define device architectures against which quantum network protocols can be implemented in the network programming language P4(16) . QuIP also comes with the necessary tooling to enable their execution in existing quantum network simulators. We demonstrate its use by showcasing V1Quantum, a completely new device architecture, implementing a link- and network-layer protocol, and simulating it in the existing simulator NetSquid.

TI Mitigated barren plateaus in the time-nonlocal optimization of analog
   quantum-algorithm protocols
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Quantum machine learning has emerged as a promising utilization of near-term quantum computation devices. However, algorithmic classes such as variational quantum algorithms have been shown to suffer from barren plateaus due to vanishing gradients in their parameters spaces. We present an approach to quantum algorithm optimization that is based on trainable Fourier coefficients of Hamiltonian system parameters. Our ansatz is exclusive to the extension of discrete quantum variational algorithms to analog quantum optimal control schemes and is nonlocal in time. We demonstrate the viability of our ansatz on the objectives of compiling the quantum Fourier transform and preparing ground states of random problem Hamiltonians. In comparison to the temporally local discretization ansatze in quantum optimal control and parametrized circuits, our ansatz exhibits faster and more consistent convergence. We uniformly sample objective gradients across the parameter space and find that in our ansatz the variance decays at a nonexponential rate with the number of qubits, while it decays at an exponential rate in the temporally local benchmark ansatz. This indicates the mitigation of barren plateaus in our ansatz. We propose our ansatz as a viable candidate for near-term quantum machine learning.

TI Splitting and Connecting Singlets in Atomic Quantum Circuits
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW X
AB Gate operations composed in quantum circuits form the basis for digital quantum simulation and quantum processing. While two-qubit gates generally operate on nearest neighbors, many circuits require nonlocal connectivity and necessitate some form of quantum information transport. Yet, connecting distant nodes of a quantum processor still remains challenging, particularly for neutral atoms in optical lattices. Here, we create singlet pairs of two magnetic states of fermionic potassium-40 atoms in an optical lattice and use a bidirectional topological Thouless pump to transport, coherently split, and separate the pairs, as well as to demonstrate interaction between them via tuneable (SWAP)alpha-gate operations. We achieve pumping with a single-shift fidelity of 99.78(3)% over 50 lattice sites and split the pairs within a decoherence-free subspace. Gates are implemented by superexchange interaction, allowing us to produce interwoven atomic singlets. For readout, we apply a magnetic field gradient, resulting in single- and multifrequency singlet-triplet oscillations. Our work shows avenues to create complex patterns of entanglement and new approaches to quantum processing, sensing, and atom interferometry.

Despite its potential, QRNG integration remains largely unexplored in practical applications. This paper investigates the QRNG chip's integration and functionality in the Samsung Quantum Galaxy smartphone through digital forensics and reverse engineering. We identified a lack of effective QRNG utilization in existing applications and addressed this gap by developing a secure instant messaging and VoIP application that combines QRNG with post-quantum cryptography (PQC). Our solution demonstrates that leveraging QRNG-generated randomness alongside PQC significantly improves security against emerging quantum threats, establishing a foundation for enhanced mobile data protection.

SO IEEE COMMUNICATIONS MAGAZINE
AB This article envisions the concept of a "Quantum Internet in the Sky," aiming to establish ubiquitous quantum communication links among distant nodes via free-space optical channels. Our key focus is on deploying quantum communication terminals on non-terrestrial platforms, specifically unmanned aerial vehicles and satellites at various altitudes. By highlighting the unique characteristics of these platforms compared to terrestrial counterparts, we address inherent challenges and discuss potential solutions through meticulous system designs and analyses of typical non-terrestrial quantum communication scenarios. Finally, we illuminate the path forward by proposing essential future directions that underscore the integration of high-dimensional multipartite quantum communications with sensing, computing, and intelligence for multiple users en route to realizing a fully operational quantum Internet.

TI Holographic spacetime, black holes and quantum error correcting codes: a
   review
SO EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL C
AB This article reviews the progress in our understanding of the reconstruction of the bulk spacetime in the holographic correspondence from the dual field theory including an account of how these developments have led to the reproduction of the Page curve of the Hawking radiation from black holes. We review quantum error correction and relevant recovery maps with toy examples based on tensor networks, and discuss how it provides the desired framework for bulk reconstruction in which apparent inconsistencies with properties of the operator algebra in the dual field theory are naturally resolved. The importance of understanding the modular flow in the dual field theory has been emphasized. We discuss how the state-dependence of reconstruction of black hole microstates can be formulated in the framework of quantum error correction with inputs from extremal surfaces along with a quantification of the complexity of encoding of bulk operators. Finally, we motivate and discuss a class of tractable microstate models of black holes which can illuminate how the black hole complementarity principle can emerge operationally without encountering information paradoxes, and provide new insights into generation of desirable features of encoding into the Hawking radiation.

TI Quantum Annealing for Complex Optimization in Satellite Communication
   Systems
SO IEEE INTERNET OF THINGS JOURNAL
AB Satellite communication (SatCom) systems play a vital role in providing global connectivity and enable a wide range of applications, including Internet of Things (IoT) connectivity for remote areas, such as forests and oceans. Two crucial resource allocation challenges in SatCom are beam placement (BP) and frequency assignment (FA) problems, which involve the clique covering (CC) and graph coloring (GC) problems, respectively. Conventional solutions for these problems incur excessive computational cost, which is intractable for classical computers. A promising approach is to formulate these problems using the Ising model, construct their Hamiltonians, and then solve them efficiently by a quantum computer. However, the current quantum computers have very limited hardware and can only handle rather small inputs. To overcome this limitation, we propose a hybrid-quantum-classical-computational pipeline where an efficient hamiltonian reduction method is the key for solving large CC/GC instances. Through experiments on real quantum computers, our reduction method outperforms commercial solutions, allowing quantum annealers to handle significantly larger BP/FA instances while maintaining high probability to achieve feasible solutions and near-optimal performance. Although the inherent hardness of the CC/GC problems cannot be overcome by quantum computing, our research contributes to the early exploration of quantum computing in the context of the complex optimization problems in SatCom systems, particularly in the realm of IoT connectivity for remote areas.

TI Quantum computing in power systems
SO IENERGY
AB Electric power systems provide the backbone of modern industrial societies. Enabling scalable grid analytics is the keystone to successfully operating large transmission and distribution systems. However, today's power systems are suffering from ever-increasing computational burdens in sustaining the expanding communities and deep integration of renewable energy resources, as well as managing huge volumes of data accordingly. These unprecedented challenges call for transformative analytics to support the resilient operations of power systems. Recently, the explosive growth of quantum computing techniques has ignited new hopes of revolutionizing power system computations. Quantum computing harnesses quantum mechanisms to solve traditionally intractable computational problems, which may lead to ultra-scalable and efficient power grid analytics. This paper reviews the newly emerging application of quantum computing techniques in power systems. We present a comprehensive overview of existing quantum-engineered power analytics from different operation perspectives, including static analysis, transient analysis, stochastic analysis, optimization, stability, and control. We thoroughly discuss the related quantum algorithms, their benefits and limitations, hardware implementations, and recommended practices. We also review the quantum networking techniques to ensure secure communication of power systems in the quantum era. Finally, we discuss challenges and future research directions. This paper will hopefully stimulate increasing attention to the development of quantum-engineered smart grids.

TI Feature Selection for Recommender Systems with Quantum Computing
SO ENTROPY
AB The promise of quantum computing to open new unexplored possibilities in several scientific fields has been long discussed, but until recently the lack of a functional quantum computer has confined this discussion mostly to theoretical algorithmic papers. It was only in the last few years that small but functional quantum computers have become available to the broader research community. One paradigm in particular, quantum annealing, can be used to sample optimal solutions for a number of NP-hard optimization problems represented with classical operations research tools, providing an easy access to the potential of this emerging technology. One of the tasks that most naturally fits in this mathematical formulation is feature selection. In this paper, we investigate how to design a hybrid feature selection algorithm for recommender systems that leverages the domain knowledge and behavior hidden in the user interactions data. We represent the feature selection as an optimization problem and solve it on a real quantum computer, provided by D-Wave. The results indicate that the proposed approach is effective in selecting a limited set of important features and that quantum computers are becoming powerful enough to enter the wider realm of applied science.

TI Controlled Double-Direction Cyclic Quantum Communication of Arbitrary
   Two-Particle States
SO ENTROPY
AB With the rapid development of quantum communication technologies, controlled double-direction cyclic (CDDC) quantum communication has become an important research direction. However, how to choose an appropriate quantum state as a channel to achieve double-direction cyclic (DDC) quantum communication for multi-particle entangled states remains an unresolved challenge. This study aims to address this issue by constructing a suitable quantum channel and investigating the DDC quantum communication of two-particle states. Initially, we create a 25-particle entangled state using Hadamard and controlled-NOT (CNOT) gates, and provide its corresponding quantum circuit implementation. Based on this entangled state as a quantum channel, we propose two new four-party CDDC schemes, applied to quantum teleportation (QT) and remote state preparation (RSP), respectively. In both schemes, each communicating party can synchronously transmit two different arbitrary two-particle states to the other parties under supervisory control, achieving controlled quantum cyclic communication in both clockwise and counterclockwise directions. Additionally, the presented two schemes of four-party CDDC quantum communication are extended to situations where n>3 communicating parties. In each proposed scheme, we provide universal analytical formulas for the local operations of the sender, supervisor, and receiver, demonstrating that the success probability of each scheme can reach 100%. These schemes only require specific two-particle projective measurements, single-particle von Neumann measurements, and Pauli gate operations, all of which can be implemented with current technologies. We have also evaluated the inherent efficiency, security, and control capabilities of the proposed schemes. In comparison to earlier methods, the results demonstrate that our schemes perform exceptionally well. This study provides a theoretical foundation for bidirectional controlled quantum communication of multi-particle states, aiming to enhance security and capacity while meeting the diverse needs of future network scenarios.

TI High-fidelity parallel entangling gates on a neutral-atom quantum
   computer
SO NATURE
AB The ability to perform entangling quantum operations with low error rates in a scalable fashion is a central element of useful quantum information processing(1). Neutral-atom arrays have recently emerged as a promising quantum computing platform, featuring coherent control over hundreds of qubits(2,3) and any-to-any gate connectivity in a flexible, dynamically reconfigurable architecture(4). The main outstanding challenge has been to reduce errors in entangling operations mediated through Rydberg interactions(5). Here we report the realization of two-qubit entangling gates with 99.5% fidelity on up to 60 atoms in parallel, surpassing the surface-code threshold for error correction(6,7). Our method uses fast, single-pulse gates based on optimal control(8), atomic dark states to reduce scattering(9) and improvements to Rydberg excitation and atom cooling. We benchmark fidelity using several methods based on repeated gate applications(10,11), characterize the physical error sources and outline future improvements. Finally, we generalize our method to design entangling gates involving a higher number of qubits, which we demonstrate by realizing low-error three-qubit gates(12,13). By enabling high-fidelity operation in a scalable, highly connected system, these advances lay the groundwork for large-scale implementation of quantum algorithms(14), error-corrected circuits(7) and digital simulations(15).

TI Towards European standards for quantum technologies
SO EPJ QUANTUM TECHNOLOGY
AB The Second Quantum Revolution facilitates the engineering of new classes of sensors, communication technologies, and computers with unprecedented capabilities. Supply chains for quantum technologies are emerging, some focused on commercially available components for enabling technologies and/or quantum-technologies research infrastructures, others with already higher technology-readiness levels, near to the market. In 2018, the European Commission has launched its large-scale and long-term Quantum Flagship research initiative to support and foster the creation and development of a competitive European quantum technologies industry, as well as the consolidation and expansion of leadership and excellence in European quantum technology research. One of the measures to achieve an accelerated development and uptake has been identified by the Quantum Flagship in its Strategic Research Agenda: The promotion of coordinated, dedicated standardisation and certification efforts. Standardisation is indeed of paramount importance to facilitate the growth of new technologies, and the development of efficient and effective supply chains. The harmonisation of technologies, methodologies, and interfaces enables interoperable products, innovation, and competition, all leading to structuring and hence growth of markets. As quantum technologies mature, the time has come to start thinking about further standardisation needs. This article presents insights on standardisation for quantum technologies from the perspective of the CEN-CENELEC Focus Group on Quantum Technologies (FGQT), which was established in June 2020 to coordinate and support the development of standards relevant for European industry and research.

TI Single photonic qutrit in a collective Rydberg polariton
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Qutrit with highly efficient algorithms and security is imperative in quantum information processing. Here, we demonstrate for the first time the coherent creation, control, and readout of a single photonic qutrit in a cold Rydberg ensemble. In each measurement, an optical photon is stored as a Rydberg polariton through electromagnetically induced transparency. Employing two microwave fields, the polariton is driven into an arbitrary superposition of three collective states, each encoded in a Rydberg state. The collective state is mapped into a photonic time-bin qutrit with the microwave field and read out sequentially. The complete sequence, including preparation, control, and readout, is less than 1.8 mu s, which mitigates decoherence significantly. We measure the coherence of the qutrit with nondestructive Ramsey interferometry, which is preferable for quantum information processing, and find good quantitative agreement with the theoretical model. The ability to write, process, and read out the single photonic qutrit on microsecond timescales with microwave-coupled Rydberg states demonstrates the coherent connectivity among the high Hilbert space of the qutrit. Our study is an important step in exploring qutrit-based quantum information processes and quantum simulation of topological physics with microwave-coupled Rydberg atom ensembles.

TI Optimal Remote Qubit Teleportation Using Node2vec
SO TEHNICKI VJESNIK-TECHNICAL GAZETTE
AB Much research work is done on implementing quantum teleportation and entanglement swapping for remote entanglement. Due to dynamical topological changes in quantum networks, nodes have to construct the shortest paths every time they want to communicate with a remote neighbour. But due to the entanglement failures remote entanglement establishment is still a challenging task. Also as the nodes know only about their neighbouring nodes computing optimal paths between source and remote nodes is time consuming too. In finding the next best neighbour in the optimal path between a given source and remote nodes so as to decrease the entanglement cost, deep learning techniques can be applied. In this paper we defined throughput of the quantum network as the maximum qubits transmitted with minimum entanglement cost. Much of research work is done to improve the throughput of the quantum network using the deep learning techniques. In this paper we adopted deep learning techniques for implementing remote entanglement between two non-neighbour nodes using remote qubit teleportation and entanglement swapping. The proposed method called Optimal Remote Qubit Teleportation outperforms the throughput obtained by the state of art approach.

TI Automated Synthesis of Fault-Tolerant State Preparation Circuits for
   Quantum Error-Correction Codes
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB A central ingredient in fault-tolerant quantum algorithms is the initialization of a logical state for a given quantum error-correcting code from a set of noisy qubits. A scheme that has demonstrated promising results for small code instances that are realizable on currently available hardware composes a non-faulttolerant state preparation circuit with a verification circuit that checks for spreading errors. Known circuit constructions of this scheme are mostly obtained manually, and no algorithmic techniques for constructing depth- or gate-optimal circuits exist. As a consequence, the current state-of-the-art exploits this scheme only for specific code instances and mostly for the special case of distance d = 3 codes only. In this work, we propose an automated approach for synthesizing fault-tolerant state preparation circuits for arbitrary CSS codes. We utilize methods based on satisfiability solving (SAT) to construct fault-tolerant state preparation circuits consisting of depth- and gate-optimal preparation and verification circuits. We also provide heuristics that can synthesize fault-tolerant state preparation circuits for code instances where no optimal solution can be obtained in an adequate time. Moreover, we give a general construction for nondeterministic state preparation circuits for codes beyond distance 3. Numerical evaluations using d = 3, d = 5, and d = 7 codes confirm that the generated circuits exhibit the desired scaling of the logical error rates. The resulting methods are publicly available as part of the Munich Quantum Toolkit (MQT) at https://github.com/cda-tum/mqt-qecc. Such methods are an important step in providing fault-tolerant circuit constructions that can aid in near-term demonstrations of fault-tolerant quantum computing.

TI Exchange-free computation on an unknown qubit at a distance
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB We present a way of directly manipulating an arbitrary qubit, without the exchange of any particles. This includes as an application the exchange-free preparation of an arbitrary quantum state at Alice by a remote classical Bob. As a result, we are able to propose a protocol that allows one party to directly enact, by means of a suitable program, any computation exchange-free on a remote second party's unknown qubit. Further, we show how to use this for the exchange-free control of a universal two-qubit gate, thus opening the possibility of directly enacting any desired algorithm remotely on a programmable quantum circuit.

TI Measurement-induced quantum phases realized in a trapped-ion quantum
   computer
SO NATURE PHYSICS
AB Many-body open quantum systems balance internal dynamics against decoherence and measurements induced by interactions with an environment(1,2). Quantum circuits composed of random unitary gates with interspersed projective measurements represent a minimal model to study the balance between unitary dynamics and measurement processes(3-5). As the measurement rate is varied, a purification phase transition is predicted to emerge at a critical point akin to a fault-tolerant threshold(6). Here we explore this purification transition with random quantum circuits implemented on a trapped-ion quantum computer. We probe the pure phase, where the system is rapidly projected to a pure state conditioned on the measurement outcomes, and the mixed or coding phase, where the initial state becomes partially encoded into a quantum error correcting codespace that keeps the memory of initial conditions for long times(6,7). We find experimental evidence of the two phases and show numerically that, with modest system scaling, critical properties of the transition emerge.

TI Equivalence checking of quantum circuits via intermediary matrix product
   operator
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB As quantum computing advances, the complexity of quantum circuits is rapidly increasing, driving the need for robust methods to aid in their design. Equivalence checking plays a vital role in identifying errors that may arise during compilation and optimization of these circuits and is a critical step in quantum circuit verification. In this work, we introduce a method based on matrix product operators (MPOs) for determining the equivalence of quantum circuits. Our approach contracts tensorized quantum gates from two circuits into an intermediary MPO, exploiting their reversibility to determine their equivalence or nonequivalence. Our results show that this method offers significant scalability improvements over existing methods, with polynomial scaling in circuit width and depth for the practical use cases we explore. We expect that this work to set a standard for scalable equivalence checking of quantum circuits and will become a crucial tool for the validation of increasingly complex quantum systems.

TI Internet of Things Network Intrusion Detection System Using Quantum and
   Classical Machine Learning
SO IET QUANTUM COMMUNICATION
AB Quantum technology strengthens intrusion detection with unbreakable encryption and highly precise threat sensors, providing unparallelled security against cyber threats. This work proposes the integration of quantum technology into Network Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS), focusing on Machine Learning (ML) algorithms such as Quantum Support Vector Classifier (QSVC) and Quantum Random Forest (QRF) models in comparison with Classical Support Vector Classifier (CSVC) and Classical Random Forest (CRF). The dataset used in all the models is UNSW-NB15. By harnessing vast amounts of UNSW-NB15 data, it is processed in parallel by allowing quantum technology and thereby improving computer power and speed. The results are observed simultaneously by simulating QSVC and QRF in IBM Quantum labs, which shows improved performance of and compared to classical CSVC and CRF methods, resulting in accuracy. Later, the QSVC and QRF are processed with an optimiser to obtain improved accuracy of for QSVC and for QRF. The proposed framework aims to enhance the resistance and efficiency of IDS in defending against evolutionary cyber threats in a precisely interconnected digital ecosystem.

TI Experimental localisation of quantum entanglement through monitored
   classical mediator
SO QUANTUM
AB Quantum entanglement is a form of correlation between quantum particles that cannot be increased via local operations and classical communication. It has therefore been proposed that an increment of quantum entanglement between probes that are interacting solely via a mediator implies non-classicality of the mediator. Indeed, under certain assumptions regarding the initial state, entanglement gain between the probes indicates quantum coherence in the mediator. Going beyond such assumptions, there exist other initial states which lead to entanglement between the probes via only local interactions with a classical mediator. In this process the initial entanglement between any probe and the rest of the system "flows through" the classical mediator and gets localised between the probes. Here we theoretically characterise the maximal entanglement gain via classical mediator and experimentally demonstrate, using liquid-state NMR spectroscopy, the optimal growth of quantum correlations between two nuclear spin qubits interacting through a mediator qubit in a classical state. We additionally monitor, i.e., dephase, the mediator in order to emphasise its classical character. It is important to note here that no new entanglement is being generated, but rather the correlation already present in the system is being redistributed or localised between the two probe qubits. Our results indicate the necessity of verifying features of the initial state if entanglement gain between the probes is used as a figure of merit for witnessing non-classical mediator. Such methods were proposed to have exemplary applications in quantum optomechanics, quantum biology and quantum gravity.

TI Profiling quantum circuits for their efficient execution on single- and
   multi-core architectures
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Application-specific quantum computers offer the most efficient means to tackle problems intractable by classical computers. Realizing these architectures necessitates a deep understanding of quantum circuit properties and their relationship to execution outcomes on quantum devices. Our study aims to perform for the first time a rigorous examination of quantum circuits by introducing graph theory-based metrics extracted from their qubit interaction graph and gate dependency graph (GDG) alongside conventional parameters describing the circuit itself. This methodology facilitates a comprehensive analysis and clustering of quantum circuits. Furthermore, it uncovers a connection between parameters rooted in both qubit interaction and GDGs, and the performance metrics for quantum circuit mapping, across a range of established quantum device and mapping configurations. Among the various device configurations, we particularly emphasize modular (i.e. multi-core) quantum computing architectures due to their high potential as a viable solution for quantum device scalability. This thorough analysis will help us to: i) identify key attributes of quantum circuits that affect the quantum circuit mapping performance metrics; ii) predict the performance on a specific chip for similar circuit structures; iii) determine preferable combinations of mapping techniques and hardware setups for specific circuits; and iv) define representative benchmark sets by clustering similarly structured circuits.

TI Symmetric Channel Verification for Purifying Noisy Quantum Channels
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Symmetry inherent in quantum states has been widely used to reduce the effect of noise in quantum error correction and a quantum error-mitigation technique known as symmetry verification. However, these symmetry-based techniques exploit symmetry in quantum states rather than quantum channels, limiting their application to cases where the entire circuit shares the same symmetry. In this work, we propose symmetric channel verification (SCV), a channel purification protocol that leverages the symmetry inherent in quantum channels. By introducing different phases to each symmetric subspace and employing a quantum phase estimation-like circuit, SCV can detect and correct symmetry-breaking noise in quantum channels. We further propose a hardware-efficient implementation of SCV at the virtual level, which requires only a single-qubit ancilla and is robust against the noise in the ancilla qubit. Our protocol is applied to various Hamiltonian simulation circuits and phase estimation circuits, resulting in a significant reduction of errors. Furthermore, in setups where only Clifford unitaries can be used for noise purification, which is relevant in the early fault-tolerant regime, we show that SCV under Pauli symmetry represents the optimal purification method.

TI Controlling NMR spin systems for quantum computation
SO PROGRESS IN NUCLEAR MAGNETIC RESONANCE SPECTROSCOPY
AB Nuclear magnetic resonance is arguably both the best available quantum technology for implementing simple quantum computing experiments and the worst technology for building large scale quantum computers that has ever been seriously put forward. After a few years of rapid growth, leading to an implementation of Shor's quantum factoring algorithm in a seven-spin system, the field started to reach its natural limits and further progress became challenging. Rather than pursuing more complex algorithms on larger systems, interest has now largely moved into developing techniques for the precise and efficient manipulation of spin states with the aim of developing methods that can be applied in other more scalable technologies and within conventional NMR. However, the user friendliness of NMR implementations means that they remain popular for proof-of-principle demonstrations of simple quantum information protocols.

TI Efficient high-fidelity flying qubit shaping
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Matter qubit to traveling photonic qubit conversion is the cornerstone of numerous quantum technologies such as distributed quantum computing, as well as several quantum internet and networking protocols. We formulate a theory for stimulated Raman emission which is applicable to a wide range of physical systems, including quantum dots, solid-state defects, and trapped ions, as well as various parameter regimes. We find the upper bound for the photonic pulse emission efficiency of arbitrary matter qubit states for imperfect emitters and show a path forward to optimizing the fidelity. Based on these results, we propose a paradigm shift from optimizing the drive to directly optimizing the temporal mode of the flying qubit using a closed -form expression. Protocols for the production of time -bin encoding and spin -photon entanglement are proposed. Furthermore, the mathematical idea to use input-output theory for pulses to absorb the dominant emission process into the coherent dynamics, followed by a non -Hermitian Schrodinger equation approach, has great potential for studying other physical systems.

TI Robustness of optimal quantum annealing protocols
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB Noise in quantum computing devices poses a key challenge in their realization. In this paper, we study the robustness of optimal quantum annealing (QA) protocols against coherent control errors, which are multiplicative Hamiltonian errors causing detrimental effects on current quantum devices. We show that the norm of the Hamiltonian quantifies the robustness against these errors, motivating the introduction of an additional regularization term in the cost function. We analyze the optimality conditions of the resulting robust quantum optimal control problem based on Pontryagin's maximum principle, showing that robust protocols admit larger smooth annealing sections. This suggests that QA admits improved robustness in comparison to bang-bang solutions such as the quantum approximate optimization algorithm. Finally, we perform numerical simulations to verify our analytical results and demonstrate the improved robustness of the proposed approach.

TI Detection of network and genuine network quantum steering
SO RESULTS IN PHYSICS
AB The quantum network correlations play significant roles in long distance quantum communication, quantum cryptography and distributed quantum computing. Generally it is very difficult to characterize the multipartite quantum network correlations such as nonlocality, entanglement and steering. In this paper, we propose the network and the genuine network quantum steering models from the aspect of probabilities in the star network configurations. Linear and nonlinear inequalities are derived to detect the network and genuine network quantum steering when the central party performs one fixed measurement. We show that our criteria can detect more quantum network steering than that from the violation of the ������-locality quantum networks. Moreover, it is shown that biseparable assemblages can demonstrate genuine network steering in the star network configurations.

SO BULLETIN DES SCIENCES MATHEMATIQUES
AB Quantum computing is captured in the formalism of the monoidal subcategory of Vect C generated by C 2 - in particular, quantum circuits are diagrams in Vect C - while topological quantum field theories, in the sense of Atiyah, are diagrams in Vect C indexed by cobordisms. We initiate a program to formalize this connection. In doing so, we equip cobordisms with machinery for producing linear maps by parallel transport along curves under a connection and then assemble these structures into a higher category. Finite-dimensional complex vector spaces and linear maps between them are given a suitable higher categorical structure which we call F Vect C . We realize quantum circuits as images of cobordisms under monoidal functors from these modified cobordisms to F Vect C , which are computed by taking parallel transports of vectors and then combining the results in a pattern encoded in the domain category.

TI Multi-Objective Evolutionary Architecture Search for Parameterized
   Quantum Circuits
SO ENTROPY
AB Recent work on hybrid quantum-classical machine learning systems has demonstrated success in utilizing parameterized quantum circuits (PQCs) to solve the challenging reinforcement learning (RL) tasks, with provable learning advantages over classical systems, e.g., deep neural networks. While existing work demonstrates and exploits the strength of PQC-based models, the design choices of PQC architectures and the interactions between different quantum circuits on learning tasks are generally underexplored. In this work, we introduce a Multi-objective Evolutionary Architecture Search framework for parameterized quantum circuits (MEAS-PQC), which uses a multi-objective genetic algorithm with quantum-specific configurations to perform efficient searching of optimal PQC architectures. Experimental results show that our method can find architectures that have superior learning performance on three benchmark RL tasks, and are also optimized for additional objectives including reductions in quantum noise and model size. Further analysis of patterns and probability distributions of quantum operations helps identify performance-critical design choices of hybrid quantum-classical learning systems.

AB In the last few years, quantum computing has experienced a growth spurt. One exciting avenue of quantum computing is quantum machine learning (QML) which can exploit the high dimensional Hilbert space to learn richer representations from limited data and thus can efficiently solve complex learning tasks. Despite the increased interest in QML, there have not been many studies that discuss the security aspects of QML. In this work, we explored the possible future applications of QML in the hardware security domain. We also expose the security vulnerabilities of QML and emerging attack models, and corresponding countermeasures.

TI Equilibrium and nonequilibrium quantum correlations between two
   detectors in curved spacetime
SO EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL C
AB We investigate the equilibrium and nonequilibrium quantum information correlations encoded in a two-qubit system in curved spacetime near the horizon of a Kerr black hole. We study the impact of mass and the angular momentum and further the local curvature or accelerations on the behaviors of the quantum correlations between the two qubits. We show that the quantum information of the two qubits is encoded in the spacetime structure. Concretely, the quantum correlations in the two-qubit system vary non-monotonically with the mass of the black hole and are amplified by the angular momentum, while the curvature suppresses the quantum correlations in the system. We show that the nonequilibrium can also contribute to the quantum correlations. Remarkably, the nonequilibrium can lead to the increase of quantum correlations in the steady state under the curved spacetime shown in this black hole example.

TI Studying the effect of fluctuating environment on intra-atomic frequency
   comb based quantum memory
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB In this article, we study the effect of various environmental factors on intra-atomic frequency comb (I-AFC) based quantum memory. The effect of the environment is incorporated as random fluctuations and non-uniformity in the parameters such as comb spacing and the optical depth, of the frequency comb. We found that the I-AFC is viable for photon storage even for very large fluctuations in the parameters of the frequency comb, which makes I-AFC a robust platform for photon storage. Furthermore, we show that the non-uniform frequency combs without any fluctuations in the comb parameters can also yield efficient quantum memory. Since the intra-atomic frequency combs found in natural atomic systems are often non-uniform, our results suggest that a large class of these systems can be used for I-AFC based efficient quantum memory.

TI Qubit energy tuner based on single flux quantum circuits
SO FRONTIERS IN PHYSICS
AB A device called the qubit energy tuner (QET), based on single flux quantum (SFQ) circuits, has been proposed for Z control of superconducting qubits. The QET is created by improving flux digital-to-analog converters (flux DACs). It can set the energy levels or frequencies of qubits, particularly flux-tunable transmons, and perform gate operations requiring Z control. The circuit structure of the QET is elucidated, consisting of an inductor loop and flux bias units for coarse or fine-tuning. The key feature of the QET is analyzed to understand how SFQ pulses change the inductor loop current, which provides external flux for qubits. Three simulations were performed to verify QET functionality. The first simulation verified the responses of the inductor loop current to SFQ pulses, showing a relative deviation of approximately 4.259% between the analytical solutions of the inductor loop current and the solutions from the WRSpice time-domain simulation. The second and third simulations, using QuTip, demonstrated how to perform a Z gate and an iSWAP gate using the QET, respectively, with corresponding fidelities of 99.99884% and 99.93906% for only one gate operation to specific initial states. These simulations indicate that the SFQ-based QET could act as an efficient component of SFQ-based quantum-classical interfaces for digital Z control of large-scale superconducting quantum computers.

TI Classically Optimal Variational Quantum Algorithms
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM ENGINEERING
AB Hybrid quantum-classical algorithms, such as variational quantum algorithms (VQAs), are suitable for implementation on noisy intermediate-scale quantum computers. In this article, we expand an implicit step of VQAs: the classical precomputation subroutine, which can nontrivially use classical algorithms to simplify, transform, or specify problem instance-specific variational quantum circuits. In VQA, there is a tradeoff between quality of solution and difficulty of circuit construction and optimization. In one extreme, we find VQA for MAXCUT, which are exact, but circuit design or variational optimization is NP-hard. At the other extreme are low-depth VQA, such as the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA), with tractable circuit construction and optimization but poor approximation ratios. Combining these two, we define the Spanning Tree QAOA to solve MAXCUT, which uses an ansatz whose structure is derived from an approximate classical solution and achieves the same performance guarantee as the classical algorithm and, hence, can outperform QAOA at low depth. In general, we propose integrating these classical precomputation subroutines into VQA to improve heuristic or guaranteed performance.

AB Methods from Quantum Information Theory are used to scrutinize quantum correlations encoded in the two-quark density matrix over light-cone momentum fractions x1 and x2. A nonperturbative three quark model light-cone wavefunction predicts significant nonclassical correlations associated with the "entanglement negativity" measure for asymmetric and small quark momentum fractions. We perform one step of QCD scale evolution of the entire density matrix, not just its diagonal (dPDF), by computing collinearly divergent corrections due to the emission of a gluon. Finally, we present first qualitative numerical results for single-step scale evolution of quantum entanglement correlations in double quark PDFs. At a higher Q2 scale, the nonclassical correlations manifest in the dPDF for nearly symmetric momentum fractions.

TI Random Covariant Quantum Channels
SO ANNALES HENRI POINCARE
AB The group symmetries inherent in quantum channels often make them tractable and applicable to various problems in quantum information theory. In this paper, we introduce natural probability distributions for covariant quantum channels. Specifically, this is achieved through the application of "twirling operations" on random quantum channels derived from the Stinespring representation that uses Haar-distributed random isometries. We explore various types of group symmetries, including unitary and orthogonal covariance, hyperoctahedral covariance, and diagonal orthogonal covariance (DOC), and analyze their properties related to quantum entanglement based on the model parameters. In particular, we discuss the threshold phenomenon for positive partial transpose and entanglement breaking properties, comparing thresholds among different classes of random covariant channels. Finally, we contribute to the PPT2 conjecture by showing that the composition between two random DOC channels is generically entanglement breaking.

TI The effect of quantum memory on quantum speed limit time for
   CP-(in)divisible channels
SO QUANTUM INFORMATION PROCESSING
AB Quantum speed limit time defines the limit on the minimum time required for a quantum system to evolve between two states. Investigation of bounds on speed limit time of quantum system under non-unitary evolution is of fundamental interest, as it reveals interesting connections to quantum (non-)Markovianity. Here, we discuss the characteristics of quantum speed limit time as a function of quantum memory, quantified as the deviation from temporal self-similarity of quantum dynamical maps for CP-divisible as well as indivisible maps, and show that the presence of quantum memory can speed up quantum evolution. This demonstrates the enhancement of the speed of quantum evolution in the presence of quantum memory for a wider class of channels than indicated by the CP-indivisibility criterion.

TI Fault-Tolerant Quantum Computation by Hybrid Qubits with Bosonic Cat
   Code and Single Photons
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Hybridizing different degrees of freedom or physical platforms potentially offers various advantages in building scalable quantum architectures. Here, we introduce a fault-tolerant hybrid quantum computation by building on the advantages of both discrete-variable (DV) and continuous-variable (CV) systems. In particular, we define a CV-DV hybrid qubit with a bosonic cat code and a single photon, which is implementable in current photonic platforms. Due to the cat code encoded in the CV part, the predominant loss errors are readily correctable without multiqubit encoding, while the logical basis is inherently orthogonal due to the DV part. We design fault-tolerant architectures by concatenating hybrid qubits and an outer DV quantum error-correction code such as a topological code, exploring their potential merit in developing scalable quantum computation. We demonstrate by numerical simulations that our scheme is at least an order of magnitude more resource efficient compared to all previous proposals in photonic platforms, allowing us to achieve a record-high loss threshold among existing CV and hybrid approaches. We discuss the realization of our approach not only in all-photonic platforms but also in other hybrid platforms including superconducting and trapped-ion systems, which allows us to find various efficient routes toward fault-tolerant quantum computing.

TI A Quantum Algorithm for System Specifications Verification
SO IEEE INTERNET OF THINGS JOURNAL
AB Verifying system specifications is a crucial requirement in science and technology, as it improves accuracy and efficiency in systems engineering. However, traditional computers are time-consuming and cannot efficiently check the consistency of system specifications for classical and quantum systems due to exponential complexity costs. Currently, there is no quantum approach available for verifying consistency in quantum systems. This article introduces a novel quantum algorithm that utilizes the virtual degree of entanglement to efficiently check the consistency of unknown system specifications represented by m oracles. The proposed algorithm has a time complexity of O(m epsilon(-2)), which is independent of the input size n and depends only on a predetermined error margin epsilon, providing exponential speedup compared to the classical approach with a time complexity of O(m2(n)). Moreover, the proposed algorithm can handle weighted superposition input states, which are impossible for classical computers to handle. Thus, the algorithm has the potential to check the consistency of both quantum and classical system specifications. The proposed algorithm is realized experimentally using IBM's Aer simulator with an input size of n = 12. The experimental results closely aligned with the theoretical predictions, demonstrating the algorithm's efficiency in checking the consistency of system specifications. Specifically, the proposed algorithm achieved a quantum supremacy ratio of 300% to 3100% compared to the classical algorithm, highlighting its significant advantage in terms of time complexity. Additionally, the simulation results confirmed the efficiency of the proposed algorithm in checking the consistency of the quantum system's specifications.

TI Analysis of quantum correlations within the ground state of a
   three-level Lipkin model
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB The performance of beyond mean-field methods in solving the quantum many-body problem for fermions is usually characterized by the correlation energy measured with respect to the underlying mean-field value. In this paper we address the issue of characterizing the amount of correlations associated to different approximations from a quantum information perspective. With this goal in mind, we analyze the traditional Hartree-Fock (HF) method with spontaneous symmetry breaking, the HF with symmetry restoration and the generator coordinate method in an exactly solvable fermion model known as the three-level Lipkin model. To characterize correlations including entanglement and beyond we use the quantum discord between different partition orbitals. We find that for physically motivated partitions, the quantum discord of the exact ground state is reasonably well reproduced by the different approximations. However, other partitions create "fake quantum correlations" in order to capture quantum correlations corresponding to partitions for which the Hartree-Fock solution fails. Those are removed and redistributed through a symmetry restoration process.

TI Blockchain Consensus Mechanism Based on Quantum Teleportation
SO MATHEMATICS
AB The consensus mechanism is the core secret of the blockchain network. However, the consensus mechanism of the classical blockchain is based on the classical cryptosystem, which is based on the problem of computational complexity. With the improvement of computing power, the security of this cryptosystem is being threatened. In addition, the consensus mechanism of classic blockchain also has the following disadvantages: serious waste of computing resources and energy; the inability to withstand a 51% attack; low system throughput and large delay. Based on quantum teleportation technology and the randomness of quantum measurement, a consensus mechanism for a quantum blockchain system is proposed. Based on the physical properties of quantum mechanics, this scheme has the unconditional security of quantum cryptography. This new consensus mechanism does not involve a great deal of computing resources and hence has a lower energy consumption, shorter time delay and higher throughput. Furthermore, the new consensus mechanism could withstand a 51% attack.

TI Complete analysis of a realistic fiber-based quantum repeater scheme
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB We present a quantum repeater protocol for distributing entanglement over long distances, where a dedicated communication stage enables trial rates not limited by the travel time between repeater nodes. To accomplish this, each node contains several qubits that can couple to one single-photon emitter. Photons from the emitters in neighboring nodes generate heralded entanglement between qubits in these nodes. The protocol leaves the emitters disentangled from the rest of the system immediately after emitting the photons, thus allowing them to be reused to entangle other qubits without waiting for the repeater link round-trip time. This time multiplexing increases the protocol trial rate by up to an order of magnitude. The protocol is then combined with conventional deterministic entanglement swapping and heralded entanglement purification to extend the entanglement distance and reduce the entanglement error, respectively. We perform a complete protocol analysis by considering all relevant error sources, such as initialization, two-qubit gate, and qubit measurement errors, as well as the exponential decoherence of the qubits with time. The latter is particularly important since we analyze the protocol performance for a broad range of experimental parameters and obtain secret key rates ranging from 1 to 1000 Hz at a distance of 1000 km. Our results suggest that it is important to reach a qubit memory coherence time of around 1 s, and two-qubit gate and measurement errors on the order of 10-3 to obtain reasonable secret key rates over distances longer than achievable with direct transmission. While this work focuses on optimizing secret key rates, the protocol can also be used for Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen pair generation and is thus also relevant for, e.g., distributed quantum computing.

TI New Permutation-Free Quantum Circuits for Implementing 3- and 4-Qubit
   Unitary Operations
SO INFORMATION
AB The article presents the quantum signal-induced heap transform (QsiHT) method of the QR-decomposition of multi-qubit operations. This transform can be generated by a given signal, by using different paths, or orders, of processing the data. We propose using the concept of the fast path of calculation of the QsiHT and applying such transforms on each stage of the matrix decomposition. This allows us to build quantum circuits for multi-qubit unitary operation without permutations. Unitary operations with real and complex matrices are considered. The cases of 3- and 4-qubit operations are described in detail with quantum circuits. These circuits use a maximum of 28 and 120 Givens rotation gates for 3- and 4-qubit real operations, respectively. All rotations are performing only on adjacent bit planes. For complex unitary operation, each of the Givens gates is used in pairs with two Z-rotation gates. These two types of rotations and the global phase gate are the universal gate set for multi-qubit operations. The presented approach can be used for implementing quantum circuits for n-qubits when n >= 2, with a maximum of (4n/2-2n-1) Givens rotations and no permutations.

TI Autonomous quantum error correction in a four-photon Kerr parametric
   oscillator
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Autonomous quantum error correction has gained considerable attention to avoid complicated measurements and feedback. Despite its simplicity compared with the conventional measurement-based quantum error correction, it is still a far from practical technique because of significant hardware overhead. We propose an autonomous quantum error correction scheme for a rotational symmetric bosonic code in a four-photon Kerr parametric oscillator. Our scheme is the simplest possible error correction scheme that can surpass the break-even point-it requires only a single continuous microwave tone. We also introduce an unconditional reset scheme that requires one more continuous microwave tone in addition to that for the error correction. The key properties underlying this simplicity are protected quasienergy states of a four-photon Kerr parametric oscillator and the degeneracy in its quasienergy level structure. These properties eliminate the need for state-by-state correction in the Fock basis. Our schemes greatly reduce the complexity of autonomous quantum error correction and thus may accelerate the use of the bosonic code for practical quantum computation.

TI Entanglement Routing with Guaranteed Fidelity for Drone-based Quantum
   Networks
SO JOURNAL OF COMMUNICATIONS AND NETWORKS
AB The quantum Internet is profoundly impacting the world and is expected to be operational in the future. With the global wide-area quantum networks begin to take shape, drone-based quantum entanglement networks have attracted widespread attention. Compared to quantum links based on optical fibers or satellites, drone-based quantum entanglement networks can effectively address the need for responsive and on-demand quantum network coverage across diverse locations and operational times. To realize network construction, entanglement routing protocols pose a significant challenge. On the one hand, the fidelity of the entangled system degrades hop-by-hop. On the other hand, the dynamics and limited energy of drone nodes are equally not negligible. However, existing works have not adequately addressed these issues. In this paper, we present a novel fidelity-guaranteed entanglement routing protocol for drone-based quantum networks (FGER D). The FGER D considers the node energy and quantum link vulnerability comprehensively, selects end-to-end fidelity as the routing metric, and employs multiple attempts' entanglement purification scheme to provide fidelity-guaranteed entanglement connections in noisy environments. Numerical simulations demonstrate that compared to existing algorithms, FGER D improves network throughput by approximately 24% under default settings, while also ensuring network fidelity and extending network lifetime. Our work is expected to provide a theoretical basis for the deployment of drone-based entanglement distribution networks.

TI Quantum computing methods for supervised learning
SO QUANTUM MACHINE INTELLIGENCE
AB The last two decades have seen an explosive growth in the theory and practice of both quantum computing and machine learning. Modern machine learning systems process huge volumes of data and demand massive computational power. As silicon semiconductor miniaturization approaches its physics limits, quantum computing is increasingly being considered to cater to these computational needs in the future. Small-scale quantum computers and quantum annealers have been built and are already being sold commercially. Quantum computers can benefit machine learning research and application across all science and engineering domains. However, owing to its roots in quantum mechanics, research in this field has so far been confined within the purview of the physics community, and most work is not easily accessible to researchers from other disciplines. In this paper, we provide a background and summarize key results of quantum computing before exploring its application to supervised machine learning problems. By eschewing results from physics that have little bearing on quantum computation, we hope to make this introduction accessible to data scientists, machine learning practitioners, and researchers from across disciplines.

TI Synthetic aperture radar image segmentation with quantum annealing
SO IET RADAR SONAR AND NAVIGATION
AB In image processing, image segmentation is the process of partitioning a digital image into multiple image segments. Among state-of-the-art methods, Markov random fields can be used to model dependencies between pixels and achieve a segmentation by minimising an associated cost function. Currently, finding the optimal set of segments for a given image modelled as a Markov random fields appears to be NP-hard. The authors aim to take advantage of the exponential scalability of quantum computing to speed up the segmentation of synthetic aperture radar images. For that purpose, the authors propose a hybrid quantum annealing classical optimisation expectation maximisation algorithm to obtain optimal sets of segments. After proposing suitable formulations, the authors discuss the performances and the scalability of authors' approach on the D-Wave quantum computer. The authors also propose a short study of optimal computation parameters to enlighten the limits and potential of the adiabatic quantum computation to solve large instances of combinatorial optimisation problems.

TI Quantum Register Machine: Efficient Implementation of Quantum Recursive
   Programs
SO PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACM ON PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES-PACMPL
AB Quantum recursive programming has been recently introduced for describing sophisticated and complicated quantum algorithms in a compact and elegant way. However, implementation of quantum recursion involves intricate interplay between quantum control flow and recursive procedure calls. In this paper, we aim at resolving this fundamental challenge and develop a series of techniques to efficiently implement quantum recursive programs. Our main contributions include: (1) We propose a notion of quantum register machine, the first quantum architecture (including an instruction set) that provides instruction-level support for quantum control flow and recursive procedure calls at the same time. (2) Based on quantum register machine, we describe the first comprehensive implementation process of quantum recursive programs, including the compilation, the partial evaluation of quantum control flow, and the execution on the quantum register machine. (3) As a bonus, our efficient implementation of quantum recursive programs also offers automatic parallelisation of quantum algorithms. For implementing certain quantum algorithmic subroutine, like the widely used quantum multiplexor, we can even obtain exponential parallel speed-up (over the straightforward implementation) from this automatic parallelisation. This demonstrates that quantum recursive programming can be win-win for both modularity of programs and efficiency of their implementation.

TI 40-user fully connected entanglement-based quantum key distribution
   network without trusted node
SO PHOTONIX
AB Quantum key distribution (QKD) would play an important role in future information technologies due to its theoretically proven security based on the laws of quantum mechanics. How to realize QKDs among multiple users in an effective and simple way is crucial for its real applications in communication networks. In this work, we propose and demonstrate a fully connected QKD network without trusted node for a large number of users. Using flexible wavelength division multiplexing/demultiplexing and space division multiplexing, entanglement resources generated by a broadband energy-time entangled quantum light source are distributed to 40 users. Any two users share a part of entanglement resources, by which QKD is established between them. As a result, it realizes a fully connected network with 40 users and 780 QKD links. The performance of this network architecture is also discussed theoretically, showing its potential on developing quantum communication networks with large user numbers owing to its simplicity, scalability, and high efficiency.

TI Deterministic quantum teleportation of a path-encoded state using
   entangled photons
SO EPJ QUANTUM TECHNOLOGY
AB Quantum teleportation enables a way to transmit an arbitrary qubit state from one location to another. The standard scheme for teleportation in optical setups involves three photons: an entangled photon pair and a photon carrying the quantum state to be teleported. The interaction between photons in such schemes makes quantum teleportation probabilistic. Here, we demonstrate a novel scheme for deterministic quantum teleportation of an arbitrary qubit state using only a polarization-entangled photon pair in a linear optical setup. By introducing the path degree of freedom (DOF) to one of the entangled photons and encoding the arbitrary qubit state into it, we achieve complete Bell state discrimination within our measurement strategy. This enables deterministic teleportation of a qubit state in an optical scheme with high fidelity. We report an average teleportation fidelity of 0.88 +/- 0.04\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$0.88 \pm 0.04$\end{document}. The dependence of fidelity on the visibility of single-photon interference used in our scheme highlights the possibility of further improving the teleportation fidelity.

TI Q-Gen: A Parameterized Quantum Circuit Generator
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM ENGINEERING
AB Unlike most classical algorithms that take an input and give the solution directly as an output, quantum algorithms produce a quantum circuit that works as an indirect solution to computationally hard problems. In the full quantum computing workflow, most data processing remains in the classical domain except for running the quantum circuit in the quantum processor. This leaves massive opportunities for classical automation and optimization toward future utilization of quantum computing. We kick-start the first step in this direction by introducing Q-gen, a high-level parameterized quantum circuit generator incorporating 15 realistic quantum algorithms. Each customized generation function comes with algorithm-specific parameters beyond the number of qubits, providing a large generation volume with high circuit variability. To demonstrate the functionality of Q-gen, we organize the algorithms into five hierarchical systems and generate a quantum circuit dataset accompanied by their measurement histograms and state vectors. This dataset enables researchers to statistically analyze the structure, complexity, and performance of large-scale quantum circuits or quickly train novel machine learning models without worrying about the exponentially growing simulation time. Q-gen is an open-source and multipurpose project that serves as the entrance for users with a classical computer science background to dive into the world of quantum computing.

TI Universal Qudit Gate Synthesis for Transmons
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Gate-based quantum computers typically encode and process information in two-dimensional units called qubits. Using d-dimensional qudits instead may offer intrinsic advantages, including more efficient circuit synthesis, problem-tailored encodings and embedded error correction. In this work, we design a superconducting qudit-based quantum processor wherein the logical space of transmon qubits is extended to higher-excited levels. We propose a universal gate set featuring a two-qudit cross-resonance entangling gate, for which we predict fidelities beyond 99% in the d = 4 case of ququarts with realistic experimental parameters. Furthermore, we present a decomposition routine that compiles general qudit unitaries into these elementary gates, requiring fewer entangling gates than qubit alternatives. As proof-of-concept applications, we numerically demonstrate the synthesis of SU(16) gates for noisy quantum hardware and an embedded error-correction sequence that encodes a qubit memory in a transmon ququart to protect against pure dephasing noise. We conclude that universal qudit control-a valuable extension to the operational toolbox of superconducting quantum information processing-is within reach of current transmon-based architectures and has applications to near-term and long-term hardware.

TI Device-independent quantum key distribution from computational
   assumptions
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB In device-independent quantum key distribution (DIQKD), an adversary prepares a device consisting of two components, distributed to Alice and Bob, who use the device to generate a secure key. The security of existing DIQKD schemes holds under the assumption that the two components of the device cannot communicate with one another during the protocol execution. This is called the no-communication assumption in DIQKD. Here, we show how to replace this assumption, which can be hard to enforce in practice, by a standard computational assumption from post-quantum cryptography: we give a protocol that produces secure keys even when the components of an adversarial device can exchange arbitrary quantum communication, assuming the device is computationally bounded. Importantly, the computational assumption only needs to hold during the protocol execution-the keys generated at the end of the protocol are information-theoretically secure as in standard DIQKD protocols.

TI Suppression of dark-state polariton collapses in a cold-atom quantum
   memory
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We observe dark-state polariton collapses and revivals in a quantum memory based on electromagnetically induced transparency on a cloud of cold cesium atoms in a magnetic field. Using sigma(+)-polarized signal and control beams in the direction of the magnetic field, we suppress the dark-state polariton collapses by polarizing the atoms towards one of the stretched Zeeman states and optimizing the frequency detuning of the control beam. In this way, we demonstrate a quantum memory with only partial dark-state polariton collapses, making the memory usable at any storage time, not only at discretized times of revivals. We obtain a storage time of more than 400 mu s, which is ten times longer than what we can achieve by trying to annul the magnetic field.

TI Construction of quaternary quantum error-correcting codes via

SO FRONTIERS IN PHYSICS
AB This paper presents a method based on orthogonal arrays of constructing pure quaternary quantum error-correcting codes. As an application of the method, some infinite classes of quantum error-correcting codes with distances 2, 3, and 4 can be obtained. Moreover, the infinite class of quantum codes with distance 2 is optimal. The advantage of our method also lies in the fact that the quantum codes we obtain have less items for a basis quantum state than existing ones.

TI Variational Quantum Gibbs State Preparation with a Truncated Taylor
   Series
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB The preparation of a quantum Gibbs state is an essential part of quantum computation and has wideranging applications in various areas, including quantum simulation, quantum optimization, and quantum machine learning. In this paper, we propose variational hybrid quantum-classical algorithms for quantum Gibbs state preparation. We first utilize a truncated Taylor series to evaluate the free energy and choose the truncated free energy as the loss function. Our protocol then trains the parameterized quantum circuits to learn the desired quantum Gibbs state. Notably, this algorithm can be implemented on near-term quantum computers equipped with parameterized quantum circuits. By performing numerical experiments, we show that shallow parameterized circuits with only one additional qubit can be trained to prepare the Ising chain and spin chain Gibbs states with a fidelity higher than 95%. In particular, for the Ising chain model, we find that a simplified circuit ansatz with only one parameter and one additional qubit can be trained to realize a 99% fidelity in Gibbs state preparation at inverse temperatures larger than 2.

TI Cluster States from Gaussian States: Essential Diagnostic Tools for
   Continuous-Variable One-Way Quantum Computing
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Continuous-variable (CV) cluster states are a universal quantum computing platform that has experimentally outscaled qubit platforms by orders of magnitude. Room-temperature implementation of CV cluster states has been achieved with quantum optics by using multimode squeezed Gaussian states. It has also been proven that fault tolerance thresholds for CV quantum computing can be reached at realistic squeezing levels. In this paper, we show that standard approaches to design and characterize CV cluster states can miss entanglement present in the system. Such hidden entanglement may be used to increase the power of a quantum computer but it can also, if undetected, hinder the successful implementation of a quantum algorithm. By a detailed analysis of the structure of Gaussian states, we derive an algorithm that reveals hidden entanglement in an arbitrary Gaussian state and optimizes its use for one-way quantum computing.

TI Connectomes and properties of quantum entanglement
SO JOURNAL OF HIGH ENERGY PHYSICS
AB Topological quantum field theories (TQFT) encode properties of quantum states in the topological features of abstract manifolds. One can use the topological avatars of quantum states to develop intuition about different concepts and phenomena of quantum mechanics. In this paper we focus on the class of simplest topologies provided by a specific TQFT and investigate what the corresponding states teach us about entanglement. These "planar connectome" states are defined by graphs of simplest topology for a given adjacency matrix. In the case of bipartite systems the connectomes classify different types of entanglement matching the classification of stochastic local operations and classical communication (SLOCC). The topological realization makes explicit the nature of entanglement as a resource and makes apparent a number of its properties, including monogamy and characteristic inequalities for the entanglement entropy. It also provides tools and hints to engineer new measures of entanglement and other applications. Here the approach is used to construct purely topological versions of the dense coding and quantum teleportation protocols, giving diagrammatic interpretation of the role of entanglement in quantum computation and communication. Finally, the topological concepts of entanglement and quantum teleportation are employed in a simple model of information retrieval from a causally disconnected region, similar to the interior of an evaporating black hole.

TI Noncooperative Quantum Networks
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Existing protocols for quantum communication networks usually assume an initial allocation of quantum entanglement resources, which are then manipulated through local operations and classical communication to establish high-fidelity entanglement between distant parties. It is generally held that the resulting fidelity would increase monotonically with the entanglement budget. Here, we show that for noncooperative protocols, the resulting fidelity may decrease as more entanglement is added to a network with nonpure states. This effect results from a quantum analog of selfish routing and constitutes a potential obstacle to the optimal use of resources in large quantum networks.

TI Construction and volumetric benchmarking of quantum computing noise
   models
SO PHYSICA SCRIPTA
AB The main challenge of quantum computing on its way to scalability is the erroneous behaviour of current devices. Understanding and predicting their impact on computations is essential to counteract these errors with methods such as quantum error mitigation. Thus, it is necessary to construct and evaluate accurate noise models. However, the evaluation of noise models does not yet follow a systematic approach, making it nearly impossible to estimate the accuracy of a model for a given application. Therefore, we developed and present a systematic approach to benchmarking noise models for quantum computing applications. It compares the results of hardware experiments to predictions of noise models for a representative set of quantum circuits. We also construct a noise model containing five types of quantum noise and optimize its parameters using a series of training circuits. We compare its accuracy to other noise models by volumetric benchmarks involving typical variational quantum circuits. The model can easily be expanded by adding new quantum channels.

TI Atomically-thin single-photon sources for quantum communication
SO NPJ 2D MATERIALS AND APPLICATIONS
AB To date, quantum communication widely relies on attenuated lasers for secret key generation. In future quantum networks, fundamental limitations resulting from their probabilistic photon distribution must be overcome by using deterministic quantum light sources. Confined excitons in monolayers of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) constitute an emerging type of emitter for quantum light generation. These atomically thin solid-state sources show appealing prospects for large-scale and low-cost device integration, meeting the demands of quantum information technologies. Here, we pioneer the practical suitability of TMDC devices in quantum communication. We employ a WSe2 monolayer single-photon source to emulate the BB84 protocol in a quantum key distribution (QKD) setup and achieve click rates of up to 66.95 kHz and antibunching values down to 0.034-a performance competitive with QKD experiments using semiconductor quantum dots or color centers in diamond. Our work opens the route towards wider applications of quantum information technologies using TMDC single-photon sources.

TI Quantum teleportation of a silicon nanophotonic CNOT gate
SO OPTICA QUANTUM
AB Large-scale quantum computers possess the capacity to effectively tackle practical problems that can be insurmountable for classical computers. The main challenge in building these quantum computers is to realize scalable modules for remote qubits and entanglement. By assembling small, specialized parts into a larger architecture, the modular approach mitigates complexity and uncertainty. Such a distributed architecture requires non-local quantum gate operations between remote qubits. An essential method for implementing such operations, known as quantum gate teleportation, requires only local operations, classical communication, and shared entanglement. Till today, the quantum gate teleportation using a photonic chip has remained elusive. Here, we experimentally demonstrate the quantum teleportation of an on-chip controlled-NOT (CNOT) gate, implemented via a silicon polarization directional coupler. Assisted with the scalable silicon chip platform, high-fidelity local quantum logic gates, linear optical components, post-selected entanglement, and coincidence measurements from photonic qubits, we first measure and characterize our teleported chip-scale CNOT gate with an average truth table fidelity of 93.1 +/- 0.3%. Second, for different input polarization states, we obtain an average quantum state fidelity of 87.0 +/- 2.2% with our teleported on-chip CNOT gate. Third, we use our non-local CNOT gate for remote entanglement creation of four Bell states, with an average quantum state fidelity of 86.2 +/- 0.8%. Fourth, we fully characterize our teleported on-chip CNOT gate with a quantum process fidelity of 83.1 +/- 2.0%, and an average non-local CNOT gate fidelity of 86.5 +/- 2.2%. Our teleported photonic on-chip quantum logic gate could be extended both to multiple qubits and chip-scale modules towards fault-tolerant and large-scale distributed quantum computation.

TI Federated Quantum Machine Learning
SO ENTROPY
AB Distributed training across several quantum computers could significantly improve the training time and if we could share the learned model, not the data, it could potentially improve the data privacy as the training would happen where the data is located. One of the potential schemes to achieve this property is the federated learning (FL), which consists of several clients or local nodes learning on their own data and a central node to aggregate the models collected from those local nodes. However, to the best of our knowledge, no work has been done in quantum machine learning (QML) in federation setting yet. In this work, we present the federated training on hybrid quantum-classical machine learning models although our framework could be generalized to pure quantum machine learning model. Specifically, we consider the quantum neural network (QNN) coupled with classical pre-trained convolutional model. Our distributed federated learning scheme demonstrated almost the same level of trained model accuracies and yet significantly faster distributed training. It demonstrates a promising future research direction for scaling and privacy aspects.

TI Bayesian learning of parameterised quantum circuits
SO MACHINE LEARNING-SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Currently available quantum computers suffer from constraints including hardware noise and a limited number of qubits. As such, variational quantum algorithms that utilise a classical optimiser in order to train a parameterised quantum circuit have drawn significant attention for near-term practical applications of quantum technology. In this work, we take a probabilistic point of view and reformulate the classical optimisation as an approximation of a Bayesian posterior. The posterior is induced by combining the cost function to be minimised with a prior distribution over the parameters of the quantum circuit. We describe a dimension reduction strategy based on a maximum a posteriori point estimate with a Laplace prior. Experiments on the Quantinuum H1-2 computer show that the resulting circuits are faster to execute and less noisy than the circuits trained without the dimension reduction strategy. We subsequently describe a posterior sampling strategy based on stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics. Numerical simulations on three different problems show that the strategy is capable of generating samples from the full posterior and avoiding local optima.

TI Semi-supervised time series classification method for quantum computing
SO QUANTUM MACHINE INTELLIGENCE
AB In this paper we develop methods to solve two problems related to time series (TS) analysis using quantum computing: reconstruction and classification. We formulate the task of reconstructing a given TS from a training set of data as an unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) problem, which can be solved by both quantum annealers and gate-model quantum processors. We accomplish this by discretizing the TS and converting the reconstruction to a set cover problem, allowing us to perform a one-versus-all method of reconstruction. Using the solution to the reconstruction problem, we show how to extend this method to perform semi-supervised classification of TS data. We present results indicating our method is competitive with current semi- and unsupervised classification techniques, but using less data than classical techniques.

TI Invariant-based inverse engineering for fast nonadiabatic geometric
   quantum computation
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB In this paper, based on first given Lewis-Riesenfeld invariant depicted by a unit vector in parameter space, we inverse engineering the time-dependent Hamiltonian of a system with su(2) Lie algebraic structure. The introduced method is then applied to investigate nonadiabatic Abelian geometric quantum computation. We demonstrate that, by employing the nonadiabatic Berry phase generated through nonadiabatic periodic evolution, a driven two-level system which undergoes a single cyclic evolution along a loop path in Bloch space can realize a universal set of one-qubit gates. Subsequently, under consideration of the influence of the systematic error and dissipation on nonadiabatic process, the result reveals arbitrary one-qubit gate can be implemented with a high fidelity. Moreover, to complete the universal set, arbitrary controlled-U gate is designed by utilizing a driven system consisted of a pair of coupled spin subsystems.

TI Adjusting phase-covariant qubit channel performance with non-unitality
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS A-MATHEMATICAL AND THEORETICAL
AB We analyze quantum communication properties of phase-covariant channels depending on their degree of non-unitality. In particular, we derive analytical formulas for the minimal and maximal channel fidelity on pure states and maximal output purity. Next, we introduce a measure of non-unitality and show how to manipulate between unital and maximally non-unital maps by considering classical mixtures of quantum channels. Finally, we prove that maximal fidelity and maximal output purity increase with non-unitality and present several examples. Interestingly, non-unitality can also prolong quantum entanglement and lead to its rebirth.

TI Fidelity-dissipation relations in quantum gates
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Accurate quantum computing relies on the precision of quantum gates. However, quantum gates in practice are generally affected by dissipative environments, which can significantly reduce their fidelity. In this paper, we elucidate the fundamental relations between the average fidelity of generic quantum gates and the dissipation that occurs during the computing processes. Considering scenarios in which a quantum gate is subject to Markovian environments, we rigorously derive fidelity-dissipation relations that hold for arbitrary operational times. Intriguingly, when the quantum gate undergoes thermal relaxation, the result can be used as a valuable tool for estimating dissipation through experimentally measurable fidelity, without requiring detailed knowledge of the dissipative structure. For the case of arbitrary environments, we uncover a trade-off relation between the average fidelity and energy dissipation, implying that these quantities cannot be large simultaneously. Our results unveil the computational limitations imposed by thermodynamics, shedding light on the profound connection between thermodynamics and quantum computing.

TI Simulating time evolution with fully optimized single-qubit gates on
   parametrized quantum circuits
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We propose a method to sequentially optimize arbitrary single-qubit gates in parametrized quantum circuits for simulating real- and imaginary-time evolution. The method utilizes full degrees of freedom of single-qubit gates and therefore can potentially obtain better performance. Specifically, it simultaneously optimizes both the axis and the angle of a single-qubit gate, while the known methods either optimize the angle with the axis fixed, or vice versa. It generalizes the known methods and utilizes sinusoidal cost functions parametrized by the axis and angle of rotation. Furthermore, we demonstrate how it can be extended to optimize a set of parametrized two-qubit gates with excitation-conservation constraints, which includes the HOP and the reconfigurable beamsplitter gates. We perform numerical experiments showing the power of the proposed method to find ground states of typical Hamiltonians with quantum imaginary-time evolution using parametrized quantum circuits. In addition, we show the method can be applied to real-time evolution and discuss the tradeoff between its simulation accuracy and hardware efficiency.

TI Characterizing the Inter-Core Qubit Traffic in Large-Scale Quantum
   Modular Architectures
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Modular quantum processor architectures are envisioned as a promising solution for the scalability of quantum computing systems beyond the Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ) era. Based upon interconnecting tens to hundreds of quantum processors (i.e cores) via quantum coherent and classical links, this approach unravels the pressing limitations of densely qubit-packed monolithic processors, mainly by mitigating the requirements of qubit control and enhancing qubit isolation. Therefore, this new architectural design enables executing large-scale algorithms in a distributed manner. In order to assess the performance and optimize such architectures, it is crucial to analyze the quantum state transfers occurring via inter-core communication networks, referred to as inter-core qubit traffic. This would provide insights to improve the software and hardware stack for multi-core quantum computers. To this aim, we present a characterization of the spatio-temporal inter-core qubit traffic for different large-scale quantum algorithms. The programs are compiled on an all-to-all connected multi-core architecture that applies the teleportation protocol for inter-core state transfer and supports up to around 1000 qubits. We characterize the qubit traffic based on multiple performance metrics to assess the computational process and the communication overhead. Based on the showcased results, we conclude on the parallelization and scalability of presented algorithms, qualitatively evaluate the resource requirements as we scale circuit sizes, and lay the foundations of application-oriented benchmarking of large-scale multi-core architectures.

TI Does Hawking effect always degrade fidelity of quantum teleportation in
   Schwarzschild spacetime?
SO JOURNAL OF HIGH ENERGY PHYSICS
AB Previous studies have shown that the Hawking effect always destroys quantum correlations and the fidelity of quantum teleportation in the Schwarzschild black hole. Here, we investigate the fidelity of quantum teleportation of Dirac fields between users in Schwarzschild spacetime. We find that, with the increase of the Hawking temperature, the fidelity of quantum teleportation can monotonically increase, monotonically decrease, or non-monotonically increase, depending on the choice of the initial state, which means that the Hawking effect can create net fidelity of quantum teleportation. This striking result banishes the extended belief that the Hawking effect of the black hole can only destroy the fidelity of quantum teleportation. We also find that quantum steering cannot fully guarantee the fidelity of quantum teleportation in Schwarzschild spacetime. This new unexpected source may provide a new idea for the experimental evidence of the Hawking effect.

Adopting a device-independent approach, we study the change in the bipartite conditional probability distribution, i.e., the behavior of the realized nonlocal box pair when the elements of the entangled qubit pair subjected to independent noisy quantum channels modeled by completely positive maps. As the verification of Bell inequalities is crucial in device-independent quantum cryptography, our considerations are instructive from the perspective of quantum realizations of nonlocal box pairs. We find that the impact of quantum channels cannot be described by an equivalent classical noise channel.

AB Quantum cryptography or, more precisely, quantum key distribution (QKD), is one of the advanced areas in the field of quantum technologies. The confidentiality of keys distributed with the use of QKD protocols is guaranteed by the fundamental laws of quantum mechanics. This paper is devoted to the decoy state method, a countermeasure against vulnerabilities caused by the use of coherent states of light for QKD protocols whose security is proved under the assumption of single-photon states. We give a formal security proof of the decoy state method against all possible attacks. We compare two widely known attacks on multiphoton pulses: photon-number splitting and beam splitting. Finally, we discuss the equivalence of polarization and phase coding.

TI Characterizing and Utilizing the Interplay Between Quantum Technologies
   and Non-Terrestrial Networks
SO IEEE OPEN JOURNAL OF THE COMMUNICATIONS SOCIETY
AB Quantum technologies are increasingly recognized as groundbreaking advancements set to redefine the landscape of computing, communications, and sensing by leveraging quantum phenomena, like entanglement and teleportation. Quantum technologies offer an interesting set of advantages such as unconditional security, large communications capacity, unparalleled computational speed, and ultra-precise sensing capabilities. However, their global deployment faces challenges related to communication ranges and geographical boundaries. Non-terrestrial networks (NTNs) have emerged as a potential remedy for these challenges through providing free-space quantum links to circumvent the exponential losses inherent in fiber optics. Through the utilization of free-space optical (FSO) and Li-Fi links, NTNs provide an effective method for transmitting quantum states over extensive distances. This paper delves into the dynamic interplay between quantum technologies and NTNs to unveil their synergistic potential. We also investigate their integration challenges and the potential solutions to foster a symbiotic convergence of quantum and NTN functionalities while identifying avenues for enhanced interoperability. Specifically, quantum communication over NTNs imposes challenges in communication channel reliability, network flexibility, and scalability. To enhance channel reliability, multicarrier transmission techniques and spatial diversity strategies, including quantum MIMO (q-MIMO) transmission schemes, can be employed. Introducing the software defined networking (SDN) model facilitates flexible network configurations. In NTN-based quantum infrastructure, technologies like trusted relays, measurement device independent (MDI), and quantum repeaters can address scalability concerns efficiently. This paper not only offers useful insights into the mutual advantages but also presents future research directions, aiming to inspire additional studies and advance this interdisciplinary collaboration.

TI Two-orbital quantum discord in fermion systems
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB A simple expression to compute the quantum discord between two orbitals in fermion systems is derived using the parity superselection rule. As the correlation between orbitals depends on the basis chosen, we discuss a special orbital basis, the natural one. We show that quantum correlations between natural orbital pairs disappear when the pairing tensor is zero, i.e., the particle number symmetry is preserved. The Hartree-Fock orbitals within a Slater determinant state, Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov quasiparticle orbitals in a quasiparticle vacuum, or the ground state of a Hamiltonian with particle symmetry and their corresponding natural orbitals are some relevant examples of natural bases and their corresponding states. Since natural orbitals have that special property, we seek the quantum discord in non-natural orbital bases. We analyze our findings in the context of the Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick and Agassi models.

TI Material-Inherent Noise Sources in Quantum Information Architecture
SO MATERIALS
AB NISQ is a representative keyword at present as an acronym for "noisy intermediate-scale quantum", which identifies the current era of quantum information processing (QIP) technologies. QIP science and technologies aim to accomplish unprecedented performance in computation, communications, simulations, and sensing by exploiting the infinite capacity of parallelism, coherence, and entanglement as governing quantum mechanical principles. For the last several decades, quantum computing has reached to the technology readiness level 5, where components are integrated to build mid-sized commercial products. While this is a celebrated and triumphant achievement, we are still a great distance away from quantum-superior, fault-tolerant architecture. To reach this goal, we need to harness technologies that recognize undesirable factors to lower fidelity and induce errors from various sources of noise with controllable correction capabilities. This review surveys noisy processes arising from materials upon which several quantum architectures have been constructed, and it summarizes leading research activities in searching for origins of noise and noise reduction methods to build advanced, large-scale quantum technologies in the near future.

TI Variational quantum-algorithm based self-consistent calculations for the

SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS-CONDENSED MATTER
AB Dynamical ean field theory (DMFT) is one of the powerful computational approaches to study electron correlation effects in solid-state materials and molecules. Its practical applicability is, however, limited by the quantity of numerical resources required for the solution of the underlying auxiliary Anderson impurity model. Here, the one-to-one mapping between electronic orbitals and the state of a qubit register suggests a significant computational advantage for the use of a quantum computer (QC) for solving this task. In this work we present a QC approach to solve a two-site DMFT model based on the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) algorithm. We analyze the propagation of stachastic and device errors through the algorithm and their effects on the calculated self-energy. Therefore, we systematically compare results obtained on simulators with calculations on the IBMQ Ehningen QC hardware. We suggest a means to overcome unphysical features in the self-energy which already result from purely stochastic noise. Based heron, we demonstrate the feasibility to obtain self-consistent results of the two-site DMFT model based on VQE simulations with a finite number of shots.

TI Kerr-Effect-Based High-Dimensional Entanglement Generation for Qudit
   Systems
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB Employing high-dimensional photonic encodings (qudits) instead of the traditional 2D encodings (qubits) can significantly enhance loss tolerance and reduce computational resources in photon-based quantum information technology (QIT). To tap into this potential, effective schemes for the high-dimensional generation of entangled states are essential. In this study, two arbitrary 4D entanglement generation protocols based on cross-Kerr effect are developed, including two-qudit entangled states with two photon pairs and three-qudit entangled states with three photon pairs. These 4D entangled states require neither auxiliary photons (or entangled states) nor complicated quantum circuits. The success probabilities of high-dimensional entangled states are close to 1 and their fidelities are robust against the photon loss with the current technology. The 4D entangled states depend on only simple linear-optics elements, available four-dimensional single-qudit operations, and mature measurement methods, making our proposed protocols feasible and efficient in practical QIT.

TI Quantum register of fermion pairs
SO NATURE
AB Quantum control of motion is central for modern atomic clocks(1) and interferometers(2). It enables protocols to process and distribute quantum information(3,4), and allows the probing of entanglement in correlated states of matter(5). However, the motional coherence of individual particles can be fragile to maintain, as external degrees of freedom couple strongly to the environment. Systems in nature with robust motional coherence instead often involve pairs of particles, from the electrons in helium, to atom pairs(6), molecules(7) and Cooper pairs. Here we demonstrate long-lived motional coherence and entanglement of pairs of fermionic atoms in an optical lattice array. The common and relative motion of each pair realize a robust qubit, protected by exchange symmetry. The energy difference between the two motional states is set by the atomic recoil energy, is dependent on only the mass and the lattice wavelength, and is insensitive to the noise of the confining potential. We observe quantum coherence beyond ten seconds. Modulation of the interactions between the atoms provides universal control of the motional qubit. The methods presented here will enable coherently programmable quantum simulators of many-fermion systems(8), precision metrology based on atom pairs and molecules(9,10) and, by implementing further advances(11-13), digital quantum computation using fermion pairs(14).

TI Decoherence-suppressed nonadiabatic holonomic quantum computation
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Nonadiabatic holonomic quantum computation (NHQC) provides an essential way to construct robust and high-fidelity quantum gates due to its geometric features. However, NHQC is more sensitive to decay and dephasing errors than a conventional dynamical gate since it requires an ancillary intermediate state. Here, we utilize the Hamiltonian reverse engineering technique to study the influence of intermediate-state decoherence on NHQC gate fidelity, and propose schemes to construct an arbitrary single-qubit holonomic gate and nontrivial two-qubit holonomic gate with high fidelity and robustness to the decoherence. Although the proposed method is generic and can be applied to many experimental platforms, such as superconducting qubits, trapped ions, and quantum dots, here we take a nitrogen-vacancy center as an example to show that the gate fidelity can be significantly enhanced from 89% to 99.6% in contrast to recent experimental NHQC schemes [Phys.

All in all, our scheme provides a promising way for fault-tolerant geometric quantum computation.

TI Quantum support vector machines for classification and regression on a
   trapped-ion quantum computer
SO QUANTUM MACHINE INTELLIGENCE
AB Quantum machine learning is a rapidly growing field at the intersection of quantum computing and machine learning. In this work, we examine our quantum machine learning models, which are based on quantum support vector classification (QSVC) and quantum support vector regression (QSVR). We investigate these models using a quantum circuit simulator, both with and without noise, as well as the IonQ Harmony quantum processor. For the QSVC tasks, we use a dataset containing fraudulent credit card transactions and image datasets (the MNIST and the Fashion-MNIST datasets); for the QSVR tasks, we use a financial dataset and a materials dataset. For the classification tasks, the performance of our QSVC models using 4 qubits of the trapped-ion quantum computer was comparable to that obtained from noiseless quantum circuit simulations. The result is consistent with the analysis of our device noise simulations with varying qubit gate error rates. For the regression tasks, applying a low-rank approximation to the noisy quantum kernel, in combination with hyperparameter tuning in epsilon-SVR, improved the performance of the QSVR models on the near-term quantum device. The alignment, as measured by the Frobenius inner product between the noiseless and noisy quantum kernels, can serve as an indicator of the relative prediction performance on noisy quantum devices in comparison with their ideal counterparts. Our results suggest that the quantum kernel, as described by our shallow quantum circuit, can be effectively used for both QSVC and QSVR tasks, indicating its resistance to noise and its adaptability to various datasets.

TI Quantum teleportation of hybrid qubits and single-photon qubits using
   Gaussian resources
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We compare single-photon qubits and hybrid qubits as information carriers through quantum teleportation using a Gaussian continuous-variable channel. A hybrid qubit in our study is in the form of entanglement between a coherent state and a single photon. We find that hybrid qubits outperform photonic qubits when coherent amplitudes of the hybrid qubits are as low as alpha less than or similar to 1, while single-photon qubits yield better results for larger amplitudes. We analyze further the effect of photon losses and observe that the overall character of teleportation for different qubits remains the same although the teleportation fidelities are degraded by photon losses. Our work provides a comparative look at practical quantum information processing with different types of qubits.

TI A quantum router architecture for high-fidelity entanglement flows in
   quantum networks
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB The past decade has seen tremendous progress in experimentally realizing the building blocks of quantum repeaters. Repeater architectures with multiplexed quantum memories have been proposed to increase entanglement distribution rates, but an open challenge is to maintain entanglement fidelity over long-distance links. Here, we address this with a quantum router architecture comprising many quantum memories connected in a photonic switchboard to broker entanglement flows across quantum networks. We compute the rate and fidelity of entanglement distribution under this architecture using an event-based simulator, finding that the router improves the entanglement fidelity as multiplexing depth increases without a significant drop in the entanglement distribution rate. Specifically, the router permits channel-loss-invariant fidelity, i.e. the same fidelity achievable with lossless links. Furthermore, this scheme automatically prioritizes entanglement flows across the full network without requiring global network information. The proposed architecture uses present-day photonic technology, opening a path to near-term deployable multi-node quantum networks.

TI Encoded-Fusion-Based Quantum Computation for High Thresholds with Linear
   Optics
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB We propose a fault-tolerant quantum computation scheme in a measurement-based manner with finite- sized entangled resource states and encoded-fusion scheme with linear optics. The encoded fusion is an entangled measurement devised to enhance the fusion success probability in the presence of losses and errors based on a quantum error-correcting code. We apply an encoded-fusion scheme, which can be performed with linear optics and active feedforwards to implement the generalized Shor code, to construct a fault-tolerant network configuration in a three-dimensional Raussendorf-Harrington-Goyal lattice based on the surface code. Numerical simulations show that our scheme allows us to achieve up to 10 times higher loss thresholds than nonencoded fusion approaches with limited numbers of photons used in fusion. Our scheme paves an efficient route toward fault-tolerant quantum computing with finite-sized entangled resource states and linear optics.

TI Quantum Truncated Differential and Boomerang Attack
SO SYMMETRY-BASEL
AB In order to design quantum-safe block ciphers, it is crucial to investigate the application of quantum algorithms to cryptographic analysis tools. In this study, we use the Bernstein-Vazirani algorithm to enhance truncated differential cryptanalysis and boomerang cryptanalysis. We first propose a quantum algorithm for finding truncated differentials, then rigorously prove that the output truncated differentials must have high differential probability for the vast majority of keys in the key space. Subsequently, based on this algorithm, we design a quantum algorithm for finding boomerang distinguishers. The quantum circuits of the two proposed quantum algorithms contain only polynomial quantum gates and qubits. Compared with classical tools for searching truncated differentials or boomerang distinguishers, the proposed algorithms can maintain the polynomial complexity while fully considering the impact of S-boxes and key scheduling.

AB A cloud quantum computer is a quantum computer that can be accessed in a cloud environment through a network. Today, there are numbers of cloud quantum computing services that can be accessed by users. They are used to solve complex problems that require powerful computing. Different cloud quantum computing services deliver different architecture and performances. In our study, we conducted a research on some services to test and evaluate the performances of different cloud quantum computing services and make a comparison out of it. The test will be conducted using two different methods such as visual programming and qiskit From the result, we can see that the amount of qubit per backend and shots per run pretty much affect the execution time of a cloud quantum computing. This test will give the users some insight and enables them to decide which cloud quantum computing services deliver better performance or faster execution time based on the specification each cloud quantum computer offers.

TI Distributed quantum algorithm for Simon's problem
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Limited by today's physical devices, quantum circuits with a long depth are usually noisy and difficult to realize in practice. The novel computing architecture of distributed quantum computing is expected to reduce the noise and depth of quantum circuits. In this paper, we study Simon's problem in distributed scenarios and design a distributed quantum algorithm to solve the problem. The algorithm proposed by us has the advantage of exponential acceleration compared with classical distributed computing and has the advantage of square acceleration compared with the best distributed quantum algorithm proposed before in query complexity. In particular, the previous distributed quantum algorithm for Simon's problem cannot be extended to the case of more than two computing nodes (i.e., two subproblems), but our distributed quantum algorithm can be extended to the case of multiple computing nodes (i.e., multiple subproblems).

TI Optimal quantum teleportation protocols for fixed average fidelity
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We demonstrate that, among all quantum teleportation protocols giving rise to the same average fidelity, those with aligned Bloch vectors between the input and output states exhibit the minimum average trace distance. This defines optimal protocols. Furthermore, we show that optimal protocols can be interpreted as the perfect quantum teleportation protocol under the action of correlated one-qubit channels. In particular, we focus on the deterministic case for which the final Bloch vector length is equal for all measurement outcomes. Within these protocols, there exists one type that corresponds to the action of uncorrelated channels: these are depolarizing channels. Thus, we established the optimal quantum teleportation protocol under a very common experimental noise.

TI Fully autocompensating high-dimensional quantum cryptography by quantum
   degenerate four-wave mixing
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We present a communication system based on quantum degenerate four-wave mixing for achieving fully autocompensating high-dimensional quantum cryptography. We prove that random phase shifts and couplings (cross-talking) among 2N optical modes (spatial and polarization modes), represented by arbitrary SU(2N) transformations and due to mechanical and thermal perturbations, imperfections, and so on, are autocompensated after a single round trip between Alice and Bob. Bob uses a source of single photons or, alternatively, attenuated coherent states and thus autocompensated 1-qudit states are received by Bob for using them with high-dimensional quantum key distribution (QKD) protocols that provide larger secret key rates for large N. A security study is also presented for this autocompensating quantum cryptography system, where it is found that the secure key rate increases with respect to nonautocompensated links for decoy-state QKD in the case of collective attacks. This plug-and-play system can be used in both optical fiber and free-space communication systems.

TI An improved quantum algorithm of the multislice method

AB The multislice method is an important algorithm for electron diffraction and image simulations in transmission electron microscopy (TEM). We have proposed a quantum algorithm of the multislice method based on quantum circuit model previously. In this work, we have developed an improved quantum algorithm. We reconstruct the phase-shifting quantum circuit without using the multi-controlled quantum gates, thereby significantly improve the computation efficiency. The improved quantum circuit also allows further gate count reduction at the cost of a controllable error. We have simulated the quantum circuit on a classical gorithm. We also provide proper parameter settings through testing, allowing the minimization of the necessary number of quantum gates while limiting the relative error within 1%. This work demonstrates the potential of applying quantum computing to electron diffraction simulations and achieving quantum advantages.

Originally designed to leverage information gathered by a gradient-based optimizer around local minima, we adapt the conventional dynamic tunneling flow to exploit the distance measure of quantum states, resolving issues of extrinsic degeneracy arising from the parametrization of quantum states. Our global optimization algorithm is applied to the variational quantum eigensolver for the transverse-field Ising model to demonstrate the performance of our routine while comparing it with the conventional dynamic tunneling method, which is based on the Euclidean distance measure on the parameter space.

TI A Quantum Algorithm for Pricing Asian Options on Valuation Trees

AB We develop a novel quantum algorithm for approximating the price of a discrete floating-strike Asian option based on an underlying valuation tree. The paths of the tree are encoded in bit-representation into a qubit register, where quantum state preparation is used to load the corresponding distribution onto the states. We implement the expectation value of the option pricing formula as a composition of the price probabilities, the payout and an indicator function, mapping their respective values to amplitudes of additional qubits. Thus, the underlying no longer has to be discretized into the same bit values for different times, resulting in smaller quantum circuits. The algorithm may be used with quantum amplitude estimation, enabling a quadratic speed-up over classical Monte Carlo methods.

TI High-Speed Quantum Key Distribution Using Dead-Time Compensated Detector
   Arrays
SO JOURNAL OF LIGHTWAVE TECHNOLOGY
AB There has been growing research interest in quantum technology in general and in quantum key distribution (QKD) in particular. However, the key generation rate of QKD systems is still limited by the quantum channel losses as well as the practical limitations of the quantum sources and detectors. Here, we focus on one of these limitations, namely, the quantum detector's dead time effect, which happens after each photon detection, limiting the maximum quantum bit transmission rate and consequently the key generation rate of QKD systems. Qubit transmission at the sub-dead-time regime (i.e., faster than the reciprocal of dead time) can introduce different security loopholes. In this paper, we propose the use of a detector array instead of a single detector to measure the quantum state of individual photons in discrete variable QKD systems, showing that it can significantly alleviate the limitations induced by detectors' dead time. A dead-time compensated BB84 scheme is introduced, allowing qubit transmission at the sub-dead-time regime. An $M-$dimensional Markov chain model is used to describe the impact of dead time on the operation of the proposed BB84 system, employing detector arrays of size $M$. Consequently, novel analytical expressions can be derived for the sifted bit rate (SBR) and secrecy key rate (SKR) of the proposed QKD system, showing excellent match with the Monte Carlo simulation results. A remarkable gain is observed for the BB84 system employing detector arrays, showing a potential $M$-fold improvement of SBR at high qubit transmission rates.

TI Quantum computing and tensor networks for laminate design: A novel
   approach to stacking sequence retrieval
SO COMPUTER METHODS IN APPLIED MECHANICS AND ENGINEERING
AB As with many tasks in engineering, structural design frequently involves navigating complex and computationally expensive problems. A prime example is the weight optimization of laminated composite materials, which to this day remains a formidable task, due to an exponentially large configuration space and non-linear constraints. The rapidly developing field of quantum computation may offer novel approaches for addressing these intricate problems. However, before applying any quantum algorithm to a given problem, it must be translated into a form that is compatible with the underlying operations on a quantum computer. Our work specifically targets stacking sequence retrieval with lamination parameters, which is typically the second phase in a common bi-level optimization procedure for minimizing the weight of composite structures. To adapt stacking sequence retrieval for quantum computational methods, we map the possible stacking sequences onto a quantum state space. We further derive a linear operator, the Hamiltonian, within this state space that encapsulates the loss function inherent to the stacking sequence retrieval problem. Additionally, we demonstrate the incorporation of manufacturing constraints on stacking sequences as penalty terms in the Hamiltonian. This quantum representation is suitable for a variety of classical and quantum algorithms for finding the ground state of a quantum Hamiltonian. For a practical demonstration, we performed numerical state-vector simulations of two variational quantum algorithms and additionally chose a classical tensor network algorithm, the DMRG algorithm, to numerically validate our approach. For the DMRG algorithm, we derived a matrix product operator representation of the loss function Hamiltonian and the penalty terms. Although this work primarily concentrates on quantum computation, the application of tensor network algorithms presents a novel quantum-inspired approach for stacking sequence retrieval.

TI Design and validation of a-SiC/SiN hybrid photonic platform for
   integrated quantum photonics
SO MATERIALS FOR QUANTUM TECHNOLOGY
AB Recent efforts in quantum photonics emphasize on-chip generation, manipulation, and detection of single photons for quantum computing and quantum communication. In quantum photonic chips, single photons are often generated using parametric down-conversion and quantum dots. Quantum dots are particularly attractive due to their on-demand generation of high-purity single photons. Different photonic platforms are used to manipulate the states of the photons. Nevertheless, no single platform satisfies all the requirements of quantum photonics, as each platform has its merits and shortcomings. For example, the thin-film silicon nitride (SiN) platform provides ultra-low loss on the order of 0.1 dB m-1, but is incompatible with dense integration , requiring large bending radii. On the other hand, silicon on insulator offers a high refractive index contrast for dense integration but has a high absorption coefficient at the emission wavelengths (800-970 nm) of state-of-the-art QDs. Amorphous silicon carbide (a-SiC) has emerged as an alternative with a high refractive index (higher than SiN), an extended transparency window compared to Silicon, and a thermo-optic coefficient three times higher than that of SiN, which is crucial for tuning photonic devices on a chip. With the vision of realizing a quantum photonic integrated circuit, we explore the hybrid integration of SiN/a-SiC photonic platform with quantum dots and superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors. We validate our hybrid platform using a brief literature study, proof-of-principle experiments, and complementary simulations. As a proof-of-principle, we show a quantum dot embedded in nanowires (for deterministic micro-transfer and better integration) that emits single photons at 885 nm with a purity of 0.011 and a lifetime of 0.98 ns. Furthermore, we design and simulate an adiabatic coupler between two photonic platforms, a-SiC and SiN, by aiming to use the benefits of both platforms, i.e. dense integration and low losses, respectively. Our design couples the light from SiN waveguide to a-SiC waveguide with 96% efficiency at 885 nm wavelength. Our hybrid platform can be used to demonstrate on-chip quantum experiments such as Hong-Ou-Mandel, where we can design a large optical delay line in SiN and an interference circuit in a-SiC.

TI A Triple-Site Gd3 Carborane Metal-Organic Framework toward
   Scalable Quantum Computing
SO ACS APPLIED MATERIALS & INTERFACES
AB Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) incorporating arrays of molecular spin qubits (quMOFs) offer a promising pathway toward scalable quantum computing. In this work, we introduce a novel quMOF, {[(Gd)3(mCB-L)4(NO3)(DMF) x ] n <middle dot>Solv}, constructed with a carborane linker and Gd(III) ions at three distinct coordination sites. We thoroughly characterize its magneto-thermal properties using dc/ac magnetometry, X-ray absorption spectroscopy, X-ray magnetic circular dichroism, and heat capacity measurements. The quantum computing potential is demonstrated through ab initio calculations and pulsed electron paramagnetic resonance on GdY-diluted analogues, revealing T m= 0.7 mu s and Rabi oscillations persisting up to 50 K. Each of the three isolated Gd(i) sites in GdY-MOFs functions as an 8-level qudit, accessible via X-band transitions. Notably, the triple-site Gd3 quMOF provides an unprecedented qudit with d = (2S + 1)3 = 512 states, capable of encoding up to 9 qubits, marking a significant advance in the scalability of molecular-based quantum computing systems.

TI Pulse shape optimization against Doppler shifts and delays in optical
   quantum communication
SO EPJ QUANTUM TECHNOLOGY
AB High relative velocities and large distances in space-based quantum communication with satellites in lower earth orbits can lead to significant Doppler shifts and delays of the signal impairing the achievable performance if uncorrected. We analyze the influence of systematic and stochastic Doppler shift and delay in the specific case of a continuous variable quantum key distribution (CV-QKD) protocol and identify the generalized correlation function, the ambiguity function, as a decisive measure of performance loss. Investigating the generalized correlations as well as private capacity bounds for specific choices of spectral amplitude shape (Gaussian, single- and double-sided Lorentzian), we find that this choice has a significant impact on the robustness of the quantum communication protocol to spectral and temporal synchronization errors. We conclude that optimizing the pulse shape can be a building block in the resilient design of quantum network infrastructure.

TI Efficient storage of multidimensional telecom photons in a solid-state
   quantum memory
SO OPTICA QUANTUM
AB Efficient storage of telecom-band quantum optical information represents a crucial milestone for establishing distributed quantum optical networks. Erbium ions in crystalline hosts provide a promising platform for telecom quantum memories; however, their practical applications have been hindered by demanding operational conditions, such as ultra-high magnetic fields and ultra-low temperatures. In this work, we demonstrate the storage of telecom photonic qubits encoded in polarization, frequency, and time-bin bases. Using the atomic frequency comb protocol in an Er3+-doped crystal, we developed a memory initialization scheme that improves storage efficiency by over an order of magnitude. The observed results were made possible by the deliberate selection of the pumping sequence and the minimization of lattice interactions, to the extent possible without the use of dilution refrigerators or superconducting magnets.

AB Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) has significantly advanced the efficiency of ML-focused software development by automating hyperparameter optimization and pipeline construction, reducing the need for manual intervention. Quantum Machine Learning (QML) offers the potential to surpass classical machine learning (ML) capabilities by utilizing quantum computing. However, the complexity of QML presents substantial entry barriers. We introduce AutoQML, a novel framework that adapts the AutoML approach to QML, providing a modular and unified programming interface to facilitate the development of QML pipelines. AutoQML leverages the QML library sQUlearn to support a variety of QML algorithms. The framework is capable of constructing end-to-end pipelines for supervised learning tasks, ensuring accessibility and efficacy. We evaluate AutoQML across four industrial use cases, demonstrating its ability to generate high-performing QML pipelines that are competitive with both classical ML models and manually crafted quantum solutions.

TI Stochastic emulation of quantum algorithms
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB Quantum algorithms profit from the interference of quantum states in an exponentially large Hilbert space and the fact that unitary transformations on that Hilbert space can be broken down to universal gates that act only on one or two qubits at the same time. The former aspect renders the direct classical simulation of quantum algorithms difficult. Here we introduce higher-order partial derivatives of a probability distribution of particle positions as a new object that shares these basic properties of quantum mechanical states needed for a quantum algorithm. Discretization of the positions allows one to represent the quantum mechanical state of n (bit) qubits by 2(n (bit) + 1) classical stochastic bits. Based on this, we demonstrate many-particle interference and representation of pure entangled quantum states via derivatives of probability distributions and find the universal set of stochastic maps that correspond to the quantum gates in a universal gate set. We prove that the propagation via the stochastic map built from those universal stochastic maps reproduces up to a prefactor exactly the evolution of the quantum mechanical state with the corresponding quantum algorithm, leading to an automated translation of a quantum algorithm to a stochastic classical algorithm. We implement several well-known quantum algorithms, analyse the scaling of the needed number of realizations with the number of qubits, and highlight the role of destructive interference for the cost of the emulation.

TI Quantum gates between mesoscopic spin ensembles
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Quantum algorithmics with single spins poses serious technological challenges such as precision fabrication, rapid decoherence, atomic-scale addressing, and readout. To circumvent atomic-scale challenges, we examine the case of fully polarized mesoscopic spin ensembles (spin-coherent states) whose total angular momenta states map to qudit submanifolds. We show that in the limit where the size of the ensembles is small compared to their separation, it is possible to treat them as qubits with an effective coupling strength that scales with the number of spins. If the spins within each ensemble are decoupled (e.g., via control fields, spinning or diffusional averaging, or materials engineering), one-and two-qubit gate operations can be implemented with high fidelities.

TI Continuous-Variable Error Correction for General Gaussian Noises
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB Quantum error correction is essential for robust quantum-information processing with noisy devices. As bosonic quantum systems play a role in quantum sensing, communication, and computation, it is useful to design error-correction codes suitable for these systems against various different types of noises. While most efforts aim at protecting qubits encoded into the infinite-dimensional Hilbert space of a bosonic mode, Ref. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 125, 080503 (2020)] proposed an error-correction code to maintain the infinite-dimensional-Hilbert-space nature of bosonic systems by encoding a single bosonic mode into multiple bosonic modes. Enabled by Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill states as ancilla, the code overcomes the no-go theorem of Gaussian error correction. In this work, we generalize the error-correction code to the scenario with general correlated and heterogeneous Gaussian noises, including memory effects. We introduce Gaussian preprocessing and postprocessing to convert the general noise model to an independent but heterogeneous collection of additive white Gaussian noise channels and then apply concatenated codes in an optimized manner. To evaluate the performance, we develop a theory framework to enable the efficient calculation of the noise SD after the error correction, despite the non-Gaussian nature of the codes. Our code provides the optimal scaling of the residue-noise SD with the number of modes and can be widely applied to distributed sensor networks, network communication, and composite quantum-memory systems.

TI Quantum Error-Correcting Codes Based on Orthogonal Arrays
SO ENTROPY
AB In this paper, by using the Hamming distance, we establish a relation between quantum error-correcting codes ((N, K, d + 1))s and orthogonal arrays with orthogonal partitions. Therefore, this is a generalization of the relation between quantum error-correcting codes ((N, 1, d + 1))s and irredundant orthogonal arrays. This relation is used for the construction of pure quantum error-correcting codes. As applications of this method, numerous infinite families of optimal quantum codes can be constructed explicitly such as ((3, s, 2))s for all s(i) = 3, ((4, s(2), 2))s for all s(i) = 5, ((5, s, 3))s for all s(i) = 4, ((6, s(2), 3))s for all s(i) = 5, ((7, s(3), 3))s for all s(i) = 7, ((8, s(2), 4))s for all s(i) = 9, ((9, s(3), 4))s for all s(i)= 11, ((9, s, 5))s for all s(i) = 9, ((10, s(2), 5))s for all s(i )= 11, ((11, s, 6))s for all s(i) = 11, and ((12, s(2), 6))s for all s(i) = 13, where s = s(1) . . . s(n) and s(1), ... , s(n) are all prime powers. The advantages of our approach over existing methods lie in the facts that these results are not just existence results, but constructive results, the codes constructed are pure, and each basis state of these codes has far less terms. Moreover, the above method developed can be extended to construction of quantum error-correcting codes over mixed alphabets.

TI High Key Rate Quantum Conference Key Agreement With Unconditional
   Security
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Quantum cryptography is a major ingredient of the future quantum internet that promises various secure communication tasks. Quantum conference key agreement (CKA) is an important cryptographic primitive of quantum cryptography, which provides the conference key among multiple users simultaneously. However, quantum CKA is currently far from practical application due to the low conference key rate. Here, we propose a quantum CKA protocol of three users with information-theoretic security. Our protocol only requires phase-randomized weak coherent sources and threshold single-photon detectors, and is anticipated to be experimentally demonstrated over 600 km under current technology. Our scheme can be widely implemented in the approaching large-scale quantum network.

TI Research status and prospects of quantum secret sharing
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB Quantum secret sharing (QSS), as a quantum extension of classical secret sharing, uses the basic principles of quantum mechanics to share information safely among multiple parties, providing a new paradigm for information security. As a key foundation for secure multiparty quantum communication and distributed quantum computing, QSS has attracted considerable attention since its emergence. Currently, research in this field includes both classical and quantum scenarios, and continuous progress has been made in both theoretical and experimental aspects. This paper first reviews the current development of QSS for classical information. In this regard, significant and parallel progress has been made in both discrete-variable QSS and continuous-variable QSS. The QSS protocols for sharing classical information, from entangled states to single photons and then to coherent light, have been continuously optimized to better utilize available resources and achieve more efficient implementation under current technological conditions. Meanwhile, round-robin, measurement-device-independent, and other protocols have been steadily improving the security of QSS. Next, one will focus on QSS scheme for quantum secrets, which begins with the symmetry of access structures and introduces basic (k, n) threshold protocols, dynamic schemes that support adaptive agent groups, and symmetric quantum information splitting through entanglement. It further introduces hierarchical quantum secret sharing schemes for asymmetric splitting of quantum information. Considering practical laboratory conditions of quantum states as resources, an overall discussion is conducted on quantum secret sharing with graph states. Afterwards, the design of a continuous-variable scheme for quantum secret sharing is outlined, and entanglement state sharing and quantum teleportation between multiple senders and receivers are introduced. Finally, this review discusses and outlines the future development directions of QSS, thereby inspiring readers to further study and explore the relevant subjects.

TI Constrained Nuclear-Electronic Orbital Theory for Quantum Computation
SO JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL THEORY AND COMPUTATION
AB Quantum computing offers promising advantages for computational chemistry, particularly through algorithms that efficiently model correlated methods. In this work, we apply quantum computing techniques to the constrained nuclear-electronic orbital (CNEO) framework, which enables the inclusion of nuclear quantum effects in chemical simulations while preserving a well-defined molecular structure. We present the development and implementation of two correlated wave function methods within this framework: CNEO full configuration interaction (CNEO-FCI) and CNEO unitary coupled-cluster with singles and doubles (CNEO-UCCSD), with the latter solved using the variational quantum eigensolver algorithm. These methods were applied to the hydrogen isotopologues H2, HD, and D2 and used to calculate potential energy surfaces, equilibrium geometries, harmonic vibrational frequencies, and von Neumann entropies. The CNEO-UCCSD results are in excellent agreement with CNEO-FCI, recovering over 99% of the correlation energy and accurately capturing geometries and vibrational frequencies. Additionally, we observe a strong connection between CNEO-FCI and CNEO-UCCSD energy and entropy differences as a function of bond length, highlighting the role of quantum entanglement in molecular dissociation. These results demonstrate the viability of CNEO-based quantum algorithms for capturing nuclear quantum effects and lay the groundwork for future quantum simulations and entropy analysis of multicomponent systems within the CNEO paradigm.

TI Transforming two-dimensional tensor networks into quantum circuits for
   supervised learning
SO MACHINE LEARNING-SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB There have been numerous quantum neural networks reported, but they struggle to match traditional neural networks in accuracy. Given the huge improvement of the neural network models' accuracy by two-dimensional tensor network (TN) states in classical tensor network machine learning (TNML), it is promising to explore whether its application in quantum machine learning can extend the performance boundary of the models. Here, we transform two-dimensional TNs into quantum circuits for supervised learning. Specifically, we encode two-dimensional TNs into quantum circuits through rigorous mathematical proofs for constructing model ansatze, including string-bond states, entangled-plaquette states and isometric TN states. In addition, we propose adaptive data encoding methods and combine with TNs. We construct a tensor-network-inspired quantum circuit (TNQC) supervised learning framework for transferring TNML from classical to quantum, and build several novel two-dimensional TN-inspired quantum classifiers based on this framework. Finally, we propose a parallel quantum machine learning method for multi-class classification to construct 2D TNQC-based multi-class classifiers. Classical simulation results on the MNIST benchmark dataset show that our proposed models achieve the state-of-the-art accuracy performance, significantly outperforming other quantum classifiers on both binary and multi-class classification tasks, and beat simple convolutional classifiers on a fair track with identical inputs. The noise resilience of the models makes them successfully run and work in a real quantum computer.

TI Quantum computing revolution in healthcare: a systematic review of
   applications, issues and future directions
SO ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE REVIEW
AB Conventional treatment methods make even the most basic healthcare issues more complicated, which in turn increases the number of parties involved. Classical computing lacks the speed and accuracy needed for effective stakeholder collaboration in COVID-19 healthcare solutions, such as patients, insurance agents, healthcare practitioners, pharmaceutical suppliers, etc. The research uses organizational information processing theory (OIPT) to examine how quantum computing which is applications of artificial intelligence (AI) could transform the healthcare business, creating a more sustainable and less burdened system. The study of quantum computing (QC) has the potential to bring about "quantum leaps," which might have unforeseen consequences for healthcare. The discovery of new medications, the personalization of medicinal treatments, and the acceleration of DNA sequencing are just a few of the many possible applications of this method. The potential of QC to transform compute-intensive healthcare tasks like drug-discovery, personalized-medicine, DNA-sequencing, medical-imaging, and operational-optimization is the primary focus of this survey paper, which offers the first comprehensive analysis of QCs diverse capabilities in improving healthcare systems. After a thorough literature study, we created taxonomies on the healthcare QC paradigm's history and supporting technologies, applications, needs, architectures, security, outstanding questions, and future research prospects.

TI Research status and prospects of quantum secret sharing
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB Quantum secret sharing (QSS), as a quantum extension of classical secret sharing, uses the basic principles of quantum mechanics to share information safely among multiple parties, providing a new paradigm for information security. As a key foundation for secure multiparty quantum communication and distributed quantum computing, QSS has attracted considerable attention since its emergence. Currently, research in this field includes both classical and quantum scenarios, and continuous progress has been made in both theoretical and experimental aspects. This paper first reviews the current development of QSS for classical information. In this regard, significant and parallel progress has been made in both discrete-variable QSS and continuous-variable QSS. The QSS protocols for sharing classical information, from entangled states to single photons and then to coherent light, have been continuously optimized to better utilize available resources and achieve more efficient implementation under current technological conditions. Meanwhile, round-robin, measurement-device-independent, and other protocols have been steadily improving the security of QSS. Next, one will focus on QSS scheme for quantum secrets, which begins with the symmetry of access structures and introduces basic (k, n) threshold protocols, dynamic schemes that support adaptive agent groups, and symmetric quantum information splitting through entanglement. It further introduces hierarchical quantum secret sharing schemes for asymmetric splitting of quantum information. Considering practical laboratory conditions of quantum states as resources, an overall discussion is conducted on quantum secret sharing with graph states. Afterwards, the design of a continuous-variable scheme for quantum secret sharing is outlined, and entanglement state sharing and quantum teleportation between multiple senders and receivers are introduced. Finally, this review discusses and outlines the future development directions of QSS, thereby inspiring readers to further study and explore the relevant subjects.

TI Quantum computer based feature selection in machine learning
SO IET QUANTUM COMMUNICATION
AB The problem of selecting an appropriate number of features in supervised learning problems is investigated. Starting with common methods in machine learning, the feature selection task is treated as a quadratic unconstrained optimisation problem (QUBO), which can be tackled with classical numerical methods as well as within a quantum computing framework. The different results in small problem instances are compared. According to the results of the authors' study, whether the QUBO method outperforms other feature selection methods depends on the data set. In an extension to a larger data set with 27 features, the authors compare the convergence behaviour of the QUBO methods via quantum computing with classical stochastic optimisation methods. Due to persisting error rates, the classical stochastic optimisation methods are still superior.

TI Accurate optimal quantum error correction thresholds from coherent
   information
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Quantum error correcting (QEC) codes protect quantum information from decoherence as long as error rates fall below critical error thresholds. In general, obtaining thresholds implies simulating the QEC procedure using, in general, suboptimal decoding strategies. In a few cases and for sufficiently simple noise models, optimal decoding of QEC codes can be framed as a phase transition in disordered classical spin models. In both situations, accurate estimation of thresholds demands intensive computational resources. Here we use the coherent information of the mixed state of noisy QEC codes to accurately estimate the associated optimal QEC thresholds already from small-distance codes at moderate computational cost. We show the effectiveness and versatility of our method by applying it first to the topological surface and color code under bit-flip and depolarizing noise. We then extend the coherent information based methodology to phenomenological and quantum circuit level noise settings. For all examples considered, we obtain highly accurate estimates of optimal error thresholds from small, low-distance instances of the codes, in close agreement with threshold values reported in the literature. Our findings establish the coherent information as a reliable competitive practical tool for the calculation of optimal thresholds of state-of-the-art QEC codes under realistic noise models.

TI Qudit-based quantum simulation of fermionic systems
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Model Hamiltonians described by fermionic operators are ubiquitous in physics and chemistry, but the quantum simulation of their properties is challenging on near-term quantum computers. Indeed, for any problem with more than two connected neighbors, standard mappings of fermions on qubits lead to many-body operators whose size increases with the size of the problem, quickly making the simulation unfeasible on noisy devices. Here we consider an alternative mapping based on qudits and the auxiliary fermion method, which leads to a significant reduction in the circuit depth and in the number of computational units to be controlled. These advantages increase for highly connected target Hamiltonians, such as lattices with long-range interactions or the molecular systems investigated in quantum chemistry. We numerically test our approach on qudits encoded in molecular spins, by performing the quantum simulation of a fermionic model on a small cluster.

AB This study introduces a novel framework that brings together two main Quantum Programming methodologies, gate-based Quantum Computing and Quantum Annealing, by applying the Model-Driven Engineering principles. This aims to enhance the adaptability, design and scalability of quantum programs, facilitating their design and operation across diverse computing platforms. A notable achievement of this research is the development of a mapping method for programs between gate-based quantum computers and quantum annealers which can lead to the automatic transformation of these programs. Specifically, this method is applied to the Variational Quantum Eigensolver Algorithm and Quantum Anneling Ising Model, targeting ground state solutions. Finding ground-state solutions is crucial for a wide range of scientific applications, ranging from simulating chemistry lab experiments to medical applications, such as vaccine development. The success of this application demonstrates Model-Driven Engineering for Quantum Programming frameworks's practical viability and sets a clear path for quantum Computing's broader use in solving intricate problems.

TI Quantum information processing with bosonic qubits in circuit QED
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB The unique features of quantum theory offer a powerful new paradigm for information processing. Translating these mathematical abstractions into useful algorithms and applications requires quantum systems with significant complexity and sufficiently low error rates. Such quantum systems must be made from robust hardware that can coherently store, process, and extract the encoded information, as well as possess effective quantum error correction (QEC) protocols to detect and correct errors. Circuit quantum electrodynamics (cQED) provides a promising hardware platform for implementing robust quantum devices. In particular, bosonic encodings in cQED that use multi-photon states of superconducting cavities to encode information have shown success in realizing hardware-efficient QEC. Here, we review recent developments in the theory and implementation of QEC with bosonic codes and report the progress made toward realizing fault-tolerant quantum information processing with cQED devices.

TI QuNetSim: A Software Framework for Quantum Networks
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM ENGINEERING
AB As quantum network technologies develop, the need for teaching and engineering tools such as simulators and emulators rises. QuNetSim addresses this need. QuNetSim is a Python software framework that delivers an easy-to-use interface for simulating quantum networks at the network layer, which can be extended at little effort of the user to implement the corresponding link layer protocols. The goal of QuNetSim is to make it easier to investigate and test quantum networking protocols over various quantum network configurations and parameters. The framework incorporates many known quantum network protocols so that users can quickly build simulations using a quantum-networking toolbox in a few lines of code and so that beginners can easily learn to implement their own quantum networking protocols. Unlike most current tools, QuNetSim simulates with real time and is, therefore, well suited to control laboratory hardware. Here, we present a software design overview of QuNetSim and demonstrate examples of protocols implemented with it. We describe ongoing work, which uses QuNetSim as a library, and describe possible future directions for the development of QuNetSim.

TI Fast evolution of single qubit gate in non-adiabatic geometric quantum
   computing
SO PHYSICS LETTERS A
AB We implemented arbitrarythe arbitrary single qubit gates of geometric quantum computing for a three -level system in a single-shot manner. The evolution time of the gate has been minimized by considering the shortest trajectory of the state on the Bloch sphere. The duration of gates grows from zero with the rotation angle gamma, and the tested T gate time can be reduced to -40% of those in the traditional orange -sliced-shaped path non-adiabatic holonomic quantum computing (NHQC) scheme by the parametrization of Rabi frequency. We also demonstrated that certain pulses are robust against static detuning errors and Rabi errors. The time-dependent detuning and Rabi frequency are found to be proportional to each other by a constant which is determined by the geometric phase. In this way, some previous NHQC schemes can be treated as special cases in our generalized model.(C) 2022 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Finding Solutions of the Navier-Stokes Equations through Quantum
   Computing-Recent Progress, a Generalization, and Next Steps Forward
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB Efficient simulation of a quantum system's dynamics is expected to be an important application area for quantum computers as existing classical computers cannot do this. However, quantum systems are not unique in being hard to simulate. For example, classical nonlinear continuum systems and fields are governed by nonlinear partial differential equations whose solution is also hard for classical computers. Solving such equations is essential for many economically important industries/applications such as the aerospace industry, weather-forecasting, fiber-optics communication, and plasma magneto-hydrodynamics. This raises the question: can a quantum computer speed-up solving these equations? In this Review, a new quantum algorithm is described for solving nonlinear partial differential equations for which the answer is yes. First, a new quantum algorithm is discussed for solving the Navier-Stokes nonlinear partial differential equations which govern the flow of a viscous fluid. Its construction, verification, and computational cost are described, and it is shown that a significant quantum speed-up is possible. Its generalization to a quantum algorithm for solving nonlinear partial differential equations is described. The Review closes with a discussion of next steps forward. These new quantum algorithms open up a large new application area for quantum computing with substantial economic impact, including the trillion-dollar aerospace industry.

TI Quantum networks with coherent routing of information through multiple

SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Large-scale communication networks, such as the Internet, rely on routing packets of data through multiple intermediate nodes to transmit information from a sender to a receiver. In this paper, we develop a model of a quantum communication network that routes information simultaneously along multiple paths passing through intermediate stations. We demonstrate that a quantum routing approach can in principle extend the distance over which information can be transmitted reliably. Surprisingly, the benefit of quantum routing also applies to the transmission of classical information: even if the transmitted data is purely classical, delocalising it on multiple routes can enhance the achievable transmission distance. Our findings highlight the potential of a future quantum internet not only for achieving secure quantum communication and distributed quantum computing but also for extending the range of classical data transmission.

TI Quantum sensing of microscopic viscosity with a molecular qubit
   framework
SO APL MATERIALS
AB Probing dynamics of guest molecules in nanoscale pores of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) is essential for optimizing their applications in adsorption, separation, catalysis, etc. Microscopic viscosity, which encompasses both intrinsic macroscopic viscosity of adsorbates and additional frictions exerted by the framework through host-guest interactions, reflects self-diffusion of guest molecules. In this study, we present relaxometric sensing of microscopic viscosity in a molecular qubit framework (MQF), namely a MOF consisting of radical qubits. Guest molecules improve the spin-lattice relaxation time of this material by enhancing its structural rigidity and tweaking local hydrogen bonds. This not only empowers the MQF as a quantum sensor for microscopic viscosity but also demonstrates guest adsorption as a useful strategy to enhance the qubit performance of MQFs. (c) 2025 Author(s).

TI Quantum computation of stopping power for inertial fusion target design
SO PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF
   AMERICA
AB Stopping power is the rate at which a material absorbs the kinetic energy of a charged particle passing through it-one of many properties needed over a wide range of thermodynamic conditions in modeling inertial fusion implosions. First -principles stopping calculations are classically challenging because they involve the dynamics of large electronic systems far from equilibrium, with accuracies that are particularly difficult to constrain and assess in the warm -dense conditions preceding ignition. Here, we describe a protocol for using a fault -tolerant quantum computer to calculate stopping power from a first -quantized representation of the electrons and projectile. Our approach builds upon the electronic structure block encodings of Su et al. [ PRX Quant. 2, 040332 (2021)], adapting and optimizing those algorithms to estimate observables of interest from the non-Born-Oppenheimer dynamics of multiple particle species at finite temperature. We also work out the constant factors associated with an implementation of a high -order Trotter approach to simulating a grid representation of these systems. Ultimately, we report logical qubit requirements and leadingorder Toffoli costs for computing the stopping power of various projectile/target combinations relevant to interpreting and designing inertial fusion experiments. We estimate that scientifically interesting and classically intractable stopping power calculations can be quantum simulated with roughly the same number of logical qubits and about one hundred times more Toffoli gates than is required for state-of-the-art quantum simulations of industrially relevant molecules such as FeMoco or P450. Significance While nuclear fusion and quantum computing are high -profile research areas, very few concrete intersections have been identified. We draw a connection through a class of quantum dynamics simulations relevant to inertial confinement fusion microphysics modeling that enjoy a computational advantage using a quantum computer. To go beyond arguing a quantum simulation advantage based on asymptotic scaling, we describe the complete quantum algorithm necessary to compute a material's stopping power, quantify the constant factors associated with this computation, and describe resources needed for systems relevant to current inertial confinement fusion experiments. These calculations highlight the prospective applicability of large fault -tolerant quantum computers to a high -value simulation target with classical computing investments in the hundreds of millions of CPU hours annually.

TI Quantum Tree-Based Planning
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Reinforcement Learning is at the core of a recent revolution in Artificial Intelligence. Simultaneously, we are witnessing the emergence of a new field: Quantum Machine Learning. In the context of these two major developments, this work addresses the interplay between Quantum Computing and Reinforcement Learning. Learning by interaction is possible in the quantum setting using the concept of oraculization of environments. The paper extends previous oracular instances to address more general stochastic environments. In this setting, we developed a novel quantum algorithm for near-optimal decision-making based on the Reinforcement Learning paradigm known as Sparse Sampling. The proposed algorithm exhibits a quadratic speedup compared to its classical counterpart. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first quantum planning algorithm exhibiting a time complexity independent of the number of states of the environment, which makes it suitable for large state space environments, where planning is otherwise intractable.

TI Non-Markovian Feedback for Optimized Quantum Error Correction
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Bosonic codes allow the encoding of a logical qubit in a single component device, utilizing the infinitely large Hilbert space of a harmonic oscillator. In particular, the Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill code has recently been demonstrated to be correctable well beyond the break-even point of the best passive encoding in the same system. Current approaches to quantum error correction (QEC) for this system are based on protocols that use feedback, but the response is based only on the latest measurement outcome. In our work, we use the recently proposed feedback-GRAPE (gradient-ascent pulse engineering with feedback) method to train a recurrent neural network that provides a QEC scheme based on memory, responding in a non-Markovian way to the full history of previous measurement outcomes, optimizing all subsequent unitary operations. This approach significantly outperforms current strategies and paves the way for more powerful measurement-based QEC protocols.

TI Shot Optimization in Quantum Machine Learning Architectures to
   Accelerate Training
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Quantum Machine Learning (QML) has recently emerged as a rapidly growing domain as an intersection of Quantum Computing (QC) and Machine Learning (ML) fields. Hybrid quantum-classical models have demonstrated exponential speedups in various machine learning tasks compared to their classical counterparts. On one hand, training of QML models on real hardware remains a challenge due to long wait queue and the access cost. On the other hand, simulation-based training is not scalable to large QML models due to exponentially growing simulation time. Since the measurement operation converts quantum information to classical binary data, the quantum circuit is executed multiple times (called shots) to obtain the basis state probabilities or qubit expectation values. Higher number of shots worsen the training time of QML models on real hardware and the access cost. Higher number of shots also increase the simulation-based training time. In this paper, we propose shot optimization method for QML models at the expense of minimal impact on model performance. We use classification task as a test case for MNIST and FMNIST datasets using a hybrid quantum-classical QML model. First, we sweep the number of shots for short and full versions of the dataset. We observe that training the full version provides 5-6% higher testing accuracy than short version of dataset with up to 10X higher number of shots for training. Therefore, one can reduce the dataset size to accelerate the training time. Next, we propose adaptive shot allocation on short version dataset to optimize the number of shots over training epochs and evaluate the impact on classification accuracy. We use a (a) linear function where the number of shots reduce linearly with epochs, and (b) step function where the number of shots reduce in step with epochs. We note around 0.01 increase in loss and maximum similar to 4% (1%) reduction in testing accuracy for reduction in shots by up to 100X (10X) for linear (step) shot function compared to conventional constant shot function for MNIST dataset, and 0.05 increase in loss and similar to 5-7% (5-7%) reduction in testing accuracy with similar reduction in shots using linear (step) shot function on FMNIST dataset. For comparison, we also use the proposed shot optimization methods to perform ground state energy estimation of different molecules and observe that step function gives the best and most stable ground state energy prediction at 1000X less number of shots.

TI On the Robustness of Quantum Algorithms for Blockchain Consensus
SO SENSORS
AB Blockchain has revolutionized many fields, such as distributed sensor networks, finance, and cryptocurrency. Consensus between distributed network nodes is at the core of such blockchain technologies. The three primary performance measures for any consensus algorithm are scalability, security, and decentralization. This paper evaluates the usefulness and practicality of quantum consensus algorithms for blockchain-enhanced sensor, and computing networks and evaluates them against the aforementioned performance measures. In particular, we investigate their noise robustness against quantum decoherence in quantum processors and over fiber-optic channels. We observe that the quantum noise generally increases the error rate in the list distribution. However, the effect is variable on different quantum consensus schemes. For example, the entanglement-free scheme is more affected than entanglement-based schemes for the local noise cases, while in the case of noisy optical fiber links, the effect is prominent on all quantum consensus schemes. We infer that the current quantum protocols with noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices and noisy quantum communication can only be employed for modular units in intraenterprise-level blockchain, such as Zilliqa, for sensor, and computing networks.

TI On the design and analysis of near-term quantum network protocols using
   Markov decision processes
SO AVS QUANTUM SCIENCE
AB The quantum internet is one of the frontiers of quantum information science. It will revolutionize the way we communicate and do other tasks, and it will allow for tasks that are not possible using the current, classical internet. The backbone of a quantum internet is entanglement distributed globally in order to allow for such novel applications to be performed over long distances. Experimental progress is currently being made to realize quantum networks on a small scale, but much theoretical work is still needed in order to understand how best to distribute entanglement, especially with the limitations of near-term quantum technologies taken into account. This work provides an initial step toward this goal. In this work, we lay out a theory of near-term quantum networks based on Markov decision processes (MDPs), and we show that MDPs provide a precise and systematic mathematical framework to model protocols for near-term quantum networks that is agnostic to the specific implementation platform. We start by simplifying the MDP for elementary links introduced in prior work and by providing new results on policies for elementary links in the steady-state (infinite-time) limit. Then, we show how the elementary link MDP can be used to analyze a complete quantum network protocol. We then provide an extension of the MDP formalism to two elementary links. Here, as new results, we derive linear programing relaxations that allow us to obtain optimal steady-state policies with respect to the expected fidelity and waiting time of the end-to-end link.

TI Minimally universal parity quantum computing
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB In parity quantum computing, multiqubit logical gates are implemented by single-qubit rotations on a suitably encoded state involving auxiliary qubits. Consequently, there is a correspondence between qubit count and the size of the native gate set. One might then wonder, what is the smallest number of auxiliary qubits that still allows for universal parity computing? Here, we demonstrate that the answer is 1 if the number of logical qubits is even, and 2 otherwise. Furthermore, we present a sufficient condition for a given parity gate set to be universal. This leads to a variety of different universal parity gate sets corresponding to different numbers of auxiliary qubits and more generally contributes to the understanding of which entangling gates are required to augment the set of single-qubit unitaries to perform universal quantum computing. As a consequence, we obtain (i) minimal implementations of the parity framework on, e.g., a triangular lattice, (ii) hardware-specific implementations of the parity flow framework on, e.g., a heavy-hex lattice, and (iii) novel universal resources for measurement-based quantum computation.

TI Superconducting Quantum Simulation for Many-Body Physics beyond

SO ENTROPY
AB Quantum computing is an exciting field that uses quantum principles, such as quantum superposition and entanglement, to tackle complex computational problems. Superconducting quantum circuits, based on Josephson junctions, is one of the most promising physical realizations to achieve the long-term goal of building fault-tolerant quantum computers. The past decade has witnessed the rapid development of this field, where many intermediate-scale multi-qubit experiments emerged to simulate nonequilibrium quantum many-body dynamics that are challenging for classical computers. Here, we review the basic concepts of superconducting quantum simulation and their recent experimental progress in exploring exotic nonequilibrium quantum phenomena emerging in strongly interacting many-body systems, e.g., many-body localization, quantum many-body scars, and discrete time crystals. We further discuss the prospects of quantum simulation experiments to truly solve open problems in nonequilibrium many-body systems.

TI Quantum Communication Complexity of Linear Regression
SO ACM TRANSACTIONS ON COMPUTATION THEORY
AB Quantum computers may achieve speedups over their classical counterparts for solving linear algebra problems. However, in some cases-such as for low-rankmatrices-dequantized algorithms demonstrate that there cannot be an exponential quantum speedup. In this work, we show that quantum computers have provable polynomial and exponential speedups in terms of communication complexity for some fundamental linear algebra problems if there is no restriction on the rank. We mainly focus on solving linear regression and Hamiltonian simulation. In the quantum case, the task is to prepare the quantum state of the result. To allow for a fair comparison, in the classical case, the task is to sample from the result. We investigate these two problems in two-party and multiparty models, propose near-optimal quantum protocols, and prove quantum/classical lower bounds. In this process, we propose an efficient quantum protocol for quantum singular value transformation, which is a powerful technique for designing quantum algorithms. We feel this will be helpful in developing efficient quantum protocols for many other problems.

TI Device-independent verification of controlled non-local CNOT quantum

SO SCIENTIA SINICA-PHYSICA MECHANICA & ASTRONOMICA
AB Controlled non-local quantum gate operations reveal the cooperative and supervisory relationships of the controller and the non-local gate operators in a quantum networks, which is an essential feature for building multi-party quantum computing networks, and their security relies on quantum entanglement resources. To understand the behavior of vendors who substitute quantum entanglement resources with classical-quantum hybrid resources, this paper proposes a device-independent verification scheme for controlled non-local CNOT quantum gates. Moreover, it formulates a Svetlichny-type inequality to conduct an effective verification of the utilization of entanglement resources in nonlocal gate operations, particularly in instances where the Svetlichny inequality is not applicable. Our scheme offers a theoretical foundation for constructing secure distributed quantum computing networks in the future.

SO QUANTUM INFORMATION PROCESSING
AB A two-qubit Heisenberg XYZ model with Dzyaloshinsky-Moriya (DM) and Kaplan-Shekhtman-Entin-Wohlman-Aharony (KSEA) interactions is considered at thermal equilibrium. Analytical formulas are derived for the local quantum uncertainty (LQU) and local quantum Fisher information (LQFI). Using the available expressions for the entropic quantum discord, we perform a comparative study of these measures of nonclassical correlation. Our analysis showed the following: all three measures of quantum correlation have similar qualitative and even quantitative behavior on temperature for different values of system parameters, there are regions in the parameter space correspondent to a local increase of correlations with increasing temperature, and sudden changes in the behavior of quantum correlations occur at certain values of the interaction parameters.

TI Error-protected qubits in a silicon photonic chip
SO NATURE PHYSICS
AB Entangled photon states can be used to make quantum information more robust. A photonic experimental implementation with eight qubits shows that error-protection schemes can increase the success rate of running a quantum algorithm.
   General-purpose quantum computers can, in principle, entangle a number of noisy physical qubits to realize composite qubits protected against errors. Architectures for measurement-based quantum computing intrinsically support error-protected qubits and are the most viable approach for constructing an all-photonic quantum computer. Here we propose and demonstrate an integrated silicon photonic scheme that both entangles multiple photons, and encodes multiple physical qubits on individual photons, to produce error-protected qubits. We realize reconfigurable graph states to compare several schemes with and without error-correction encodings and implement a range of quantum information processing tasks. We observe a success rate increase from 62.5% to 95.8% when running a phase-estimation algorithm without and with error protection, respectively. Finally, we realize hypergraph states, which are a generalized class of resource states that offer protection against correlated errors. Our results show how quantum error-correction encodings can be implemented with resource-efficient photonic architectures to improve the performance of quantum algorithms.

TI Optimized reversible quantum circuits for F28 multiplication
SO QUANTUM INFORMATION PROCESSING
AB Quantum computers represent a serious threat to the safety of modern encryption standards. Within symmetric cryptography, Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) is believed to be quantum resistant if the key sizes are large enough. Arithmetic operations in AES are performed over the binary field F2m generated by an irreducible pentanomial of degree m=8 using polynomial basis (PB) representation. Multiplication over F2m is the most complex and important arithmetic operation, so efficient implementations are highly desired. A number of quantum circuits realizing F2m multiplication have been proposed, where the number of qubits, the number of quantum gates and the depth of the circuit are mainly considered as optimization objectives. In this work, optimized reversible quantum circuits for F28 multiplication using PB generated by two irreducible pentanomials are presented. The proposed reversible multipliers require the minimum number of qubits and CNOT gates, and the minimum depth among similar F28 multipliers found in the literature.

TI Moving quantum states without SWAP via intermediate higher-dimensional
   qudits
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Quantum algorithms can be realized in the form of a quantum circuit. To map a quantum circuit for a specific quantum algorithm to quantum hardware, qubit mapping is an imperative technique based on the qubit topology. Due to the neighborhood constraint of qubit topology, the implementation of the quantum algorithm rightly, is essential for moving information around in a quantum computer. Swapping of qubits using a SWAP gate moves the quantum state between two qubits and solves the neighborhood constraint of qubit topology. Although, one needs to decompose the SWAP gate into three controlled-NOT gates to implement the SWAP gate efficiently, but unwillingly quantum cost with respect to the gate count and depth increases. In this paper, a formalism of moving quantum states without using SWAP operation is introduced. Moving quantum states through qubits have been attained with the adoption of temporary intermediate qudit states. This introduction of intermediate qudit states has exhibited a three times reduction in quantum cost with respect to the gate count and approximately two times reduction with respect to circuit depth compared to the state-of-the-art approach of the SWAP gate insertion. We also exhibit that the adoption of the intermediate qudit makes the approach sublimer than the existing works by obtaining a better fidelity. Furthermore, the proposed approach is generalized to any finite-dimensional quantum system.

TI Demonstration of 75 km-fiber quantum clock synchronization in quantum
   entanglement distribution network
SO EPJ QUANTUM TECHNOLOGY
AB The quantum entanglement distribution network, serviced as the communication infrastructure which distributes quantum information among remote users, enables many applications beyond the reach of classical networks. Recently, the applications such as quantum key distribution and quantum secure direct communication, have been successfully demonstrated in the quantum entanglement distribution network. In this article, we propose a multi-user round-trip quantum clock synchronization (QCS) scheme in the quantum network, which can be implemented with one single entangled photon source located at the server. The server distributes the entangled photons to remote multiple users with the wavelength division multiplexing strategy, and each user feeds partial received photons back to the server. The clock difference between the server and each user is calculated from the one-way and round-trip propagation times, which are determined according to the time correlation of entangled photons. Afterwards, the demonstration has been conducted between the server and a user over a 75-km-long fiber link, where the measured clock difference uncertainty is 4.45 ps, and the time deviation is 426 fs with an average time of 4000 s. Furthermore, the proposed QCS scheme is linearly scalable to many users, with respect to user hardware and number of deployed fibers.

The system consists of a superconducting grain in a regime of the Cooper pair box (the charge qubit) that performs mechanical vibrations between two bulk superconductors. Operation of the device is based on the AC Josephson effect, i.e., the phase difference between superconducting electrodes is controlled by a DC bias voltage following the operational switch on/off protocol. We compare an analytical idealised solution with numerical simulation using experimentally feasible parameters, different decoherence processes, as well as imperfections of experimental procedures such as time-control of the bias voltage, to get insight into how they influence the time-evolution of the realistic system, deteriorate the quantum coherence, and affect the formation of the cat-states.

TI Robust Qubit Mapping Algorithm via Double-Source Optimal Routing on
   Large Quantum Circuits
SO ACM TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM COMPUTING
AB Qubit mapping is a critical aspect of implementing quantum circuits on real hardware devices. Currently, the existing algorithms for qubit mapping encounter difficulties when dealing with larger circuit sizes involving hundreds of qubits. In this article, we introduce an innovative qubit mapping algorithm, Duostra, tailored to address the challenge of implementing large-scale quantum circuits on real hardware devices with limited connectivity. Duostra operates by efficiently determining optimal paths for double-qubit gates and inserting SWAP gates accordingly to implement the double-qubit operations on real devices. Together with two heuristic scheduling algorithms, Limitedly Exhaustive Search and Shortest-Path Estimation, it yields results of good quality within a reasonable runtime, thereby striving toward achieving quantum advantage. Experimental results showcase our algorithm's superiority, especially for large circuits beyond the NISQ era. For example, on large circuits with more than 50 qubits, we can reduce the mapping cost on an average 21.75% over the virtual best results among QMAP, t vertical bar ket >, Qiskit, and SABRE. Besides, for mid-size circuits such as the SABRE-large benchmark, we improve the mapping costs by 4.5%, 5.2%, 16.3%, 20.7%, and 25.7%, when compared to QMAP, TOQM, t vertical bar ket >, Qiskit, and SABRE, respectively.

AB Optical photons play unique role in transmitting information over long distances. Photonic links by the optical fiber networks compose the backbone of today's global internet. Such fiber optics can also provide the most cost-effective quantum channels to distribute quantum information across distant stationary nodes in future large-scale quantum networks. This prospect motivates the recent emerging efforts in developing microwave-optical quantum transduction technology to interconnect microwave quantum processors. Various frequency conversion approaches are investigated to efficiently bridge the enormous electromagnetic frequency gap while preserving quantum coherence. Nonetheless, high-fidelity entanglement generation between remote quantum processing units has remained out of reach to date. Here, we summarize the state-of-the-art progresses in quantum transducer engineering and provide the perspectives on the key challenges and opportunities toward optically heralded quantum entanglement distributions.

AB To witness quantum advantages in practical settings, substantial efforts are required not only at the hardware level but also on theoretical research to reduce the computational cost of a given protocol. Quantum computation has the potential to significantly enhance existing classical machine learning methods, and several quantum algorithms for binary classification based on the kernel method have been proposed. These algorithms rely on estimating an expectation value, which in turn requires an expensive quantum data encoding procedure to be repeated many times. In this work, we calculate explicitly the number of repetition necessary for acquiring a fixed success probability and show that the Hadamard-test and the swap-test circuits achieve the optimal variance in terms of the quantum circuit parameters. The variance, and hence the number of repetition, can be further reduced only via optimization over data-related parameters. We also show that the kernel-based binary classification can be performed with a single-qubit measurement regardless of the number and the dimension of the data. Finally, we show that for a number of relevant noise models the classification can be performed reliably without quantum error correction. Our findings are useful for designing quantum classification experiments under limited resources, which is the common challenge in the noisy intermediate-scale quantum era.

AB The emergence of quantum computers represents a crucial leap forward in practical computability, when compared to classical architectures. Harnessing that power effectively is an exercise of increasing importance. Despite research in this field expanding rapidly, little headway has been made towards new quantum algorithms. The complexity of quantum systems makes them conceptually inaccessible to non-experts; therefore, programs are hard to design, hindering advancement. This paper presents a method for genetically encoding and designing arbitrary circuits in Qiskit, a software library developed by IBM for simulating quantum logic gates. The effectiveness of the system is verified by evolving solutions to the Toffoli gate and Quantum Fourier Transform problems.

TI Detection of mode-intrinsic quantum entanglement
SO OPTICA QUANTUM
AB Quantum correlations are at the core of quantum information processing and are necessary to achieve a quantum computational advantage. In the context of continuous-variable quantum systems, another necessary resource for quantum advantages is non-Gaussianity. In this work, we propose a witness based on previously known relations between metrological power and quantum correlations, to detect a strong form of entanglement that only non-Gaussian states possess and that cannot be undone by passive optical operations, i.e., entanglement in all mode bases. The strength of our witness is two-fold: it only requires measurements in one basis to check entanglement in any arbitrary mode basis; it can be made applicable experimentally using homodyne measurements and without requiring a full tomography of the state.

TI Encoding patterns for quantum algorithms
SO IET QUANTUM COMMUNICATION
AB As quantum computers are based on the laws of quantum mechanics, they are capable of solving certain problems faster than their classical counterparts. However, quantum algorithms with a theoretical speed-up often assume that data can be loaded efficiently. In general, the runtime complexity of the loading routine depends on (i) the data encoding that defines how the data is represented by the state of the quantum computer and (ii) the data itself. In some cases, loading the data requires at least exponential time that destroys a potential speed-up. And especially for the first generation of devices that are currently available, the resources (qubits and operations) needed to encode the data are limited. In this work, we, therefore, present six patterns that describe how data is handled by quantum computers.

TI Simulating noisy quantum circuits with matrix product density operators
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Simulating quantum circuits with classical computers requires resources growing exponentially in terms of system size. Real quantum computer with noise, however, may be simulated polynomially with various methods considering different noise models. In this work, we simulate random quantum circuits in one dimension with matrix product density operators (MPDOs), for different noise models such as dephasing, depolarizing, and amplitude damping. We show that the method based on matrix product states (MPSs) fails to approximate the noisy output quantum states for any of the noise models considered, while the MPDO method approximates them well. Compared with the method of matrix product operators (MPOs), the MPDO method reflects a clear physical picture of noise (with inner indices taking care of the noise simulation) and quantum entanglement (with bond indices taking care of two-qubit gate simulation). Consequently, in case of weak system noise, the resource cost of the MPDO will be significantly less than that of the MPO due to a relatively small inner dimension needed for the simulation. In case of strong system noise, a relatively small bond dimension may be sufficient to simulate the noisy circuits, indicating a regime that the noise is large enough for an "easy" classical simulation, which is further supported by a comparison with the experimental results on an IBM cloud device. Moreover, we propose a more effective tensor updates scheme with optimal truncations for both the inner and the bond dimensions, performed after each layer of the circuit, which enjoys a canonical form of the MPDO for improving simulation accuracy. With truncated inner dimension to a maximum value. and bond dimension to a maximum value., the cost of our simulation scales as similar to ND kappa(3)chi(3), for an N-qubit circuit with depth D.

TI Heralded Entanglement of On-Demand Spin-Wave Solid-State Quantum
   Memories for Multiplexed Quantum Network Links
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW X
AB The ability to distribute heralded entanglement between distant matter nodes is a primitive for the implementation of large-scale quantum networks. Some of the most crucial requirements for future applications include high heralding rates at telecom wavelengths, multiplexed operation, and on-demand retrieval of stored excitations for synchronization of separate quantum links. Despite tremendous progress in various physical systems, the demonstration of telecom-heralded entanglement between quantum nodes featuring both multiplexed operation and on-demand retrieval remains elusive. In this work, we combine narrow band parametric photon-pair sources and solid-state quantum memories based on rare-earth doped crystals to demonstrate telecom-heralded entanglement between spatially separated spin-wave quantum memories with fully adjustable recall time and temporal multiplexing of 15 modes. In a first experiment, the storage in the spin state is conditioned on the entanglement heralding. We take advantage of the control over readout pulse phase to achieve feedforward conditional phase shifts on the stored photons depending on which heralding detector clicked. We exploit this effect to double the entanglement heralding rate for a given quantum state up to 510 counts/s, with an associated detection rate of 0.32 counts/s and measured positive concurrence by up to 6 standard deviations. In a second experiment, we simulate the communication time of a long-distance link by implementing an unconditional storage scheme with a dead time of 100 mu s. We take advantage of temporal multiplexing to increase the entanglement rates by a factor of 15 with respect to single mode storage, reaching a value of 22 counts/s per heralding detector. These results establish our architecture as a prime candidate for the implementation of scalable high-rate quantum network links.

TI Correlation energy and quantum correlations in a solvable model
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Typically in many-body systems the correlation energy, which is defined as the difference between the exact ground-state energy and the mean-field solution, has been a measure of the system's total correlations. However, under the quantum information context, it is possible to define some quantities in terms of the system's constituents that measure the classical and quantum correlations, such as the entanglement entropy, mutual information, quantum discord, one-body entropy, etc. In this work we apply concepts of quantum information in fermionic systems in order to study traditional correlation measures (the relative correlation energy). Concretely, we analyze the two- and three-level Lipkin models, which are exactly solvable (but nontrivial) models commonly used in the context of the many-body problem. We conclude that the correlation energy is not a good estimator of the total correlation of the system, and information theoretic measures should be considered.

TI Backtesting Quantum Computing Algorithms for Portfolio Optimization
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM ENGINEERING
AB In portfolio theory, the investment portfolio optimization problem is one of those problems whose complexity grows exponentially with the number of assets. By backtesting classical and quantum computing algorithms, we can get a sense of how these algorithms might perform in the real world. This work establishes a methodology for backtesting classical and quantum algorithms in equivalent conditions, and uses it to explore four quantum and three classical computing algorithms for portfolio optimization and compares the results. Running 10 000 experiments on equivalent conditions we find that quantum can match or slightly outperform classical results, showing a better escalability trend. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that performs a systematic backtesting comparison of classical and quantum portfolio optimization algorithms. In this work, we also analyze in more detail the variational quantum eigensolver algorithm, applied to solve the portfolio optimization problem, running on simulators and real quantum computers from IBM. The benefits and drawbacks of backtesting are discussed, as well as some of the challenges involved in using real quantum computers of more than 100 qubits. Results show quantum algorithms can be competitive with classical ones, with the advantage of being able to handle a large number of assets in a reasonable time on a future larger quantum computer.

This paper proposes a blockchain-based healthcare system leveraging post-quantum cryptography (PQC) to secure sensitive patient data, stored on a permissioned blockchain. Discrete event simulation (DES) is used in the simulation to represent and assess three critical processes: blockchain transactions, patient data requests, and data encryption. We examine the dynamics of blockchain transaction processing, encryption effectiveness, and data access inside the suggested architecture through simulation. The results highlight how post-quantum encryption and blockchain technology can strengthen healthcare data management by resolving important concerns about patient data sharing's integrity and confidentiality.

Every simulation starts with a codification, and here we succently review a newly developed compact encoding based on the identification between registers and particles; the quantum memory is divided into registers, and to each we associate a Hilbert space of dimension the number of degrees of freedom of the codified particles. In this way we gain an exponential compression over direct encodings for a low number of particles with many degrees of freedom. As an example we apply this encoding on a two-register memory and implement antisymmetrization and exponentiation algorithms.

TI Optimization of quantum-repeater networks using stochastic automatic
   differentiation
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Quantum repeaters are envisioned to enable long-distance entanglement distribution. Analysis of quantumrepeater networks could hasten their realization by informing design decisions and research priorities. Determining derivatives of network properties is crucial toward that end, facilitating optimizations and revealing parameter sensitivity. Doing so, however, is difficult because the networks are discretely random. Here we use a recently developed technique, stochastic automatic differentiation, to automatically extract derivatives from discrete Monte Carlo simulations of repeater networks. With these derivatives, we optimize rate-fidelity tradeoffs in a repeater chain, determine the chain's sensitivity with respect to the coherence times of different nodes, and finally choose the locations of quantum repeaters in a two-dimensional plane to optimize the guaranteed quality of service between four end nodes. In particular, the technique enabled us to discover how the best achievable quality of service, the minimal number of repeaters required to improve a network, and the number of repeaters required to saturate the network scale with the physical size of the network.

AB Modeling electronic systems is an important application for quantum computers. In the context of materials science, an important open problem is the computational description of chemical reactions on surfaces. In this work, we outline a workflow to model the adsorption and reaction of molecules on surfaces using quantum computing algorithms. We develop and compare two local embedding methods for the systematic determination of active spaces. These methods are automated and based on the physics of molecule-surface interactions and yield systematically improvable active spaces. Furthermore, to reduce the quantum resources required for the simulation of the selected active spaces using quantum algorithms, we introduce a technique for exact and automated circuit simplification. This technique is applicable to a broad class of quantum circuits and critical to enable demonstration on near-term quantum devices. We apply the proposed combination of active-space selection and circuit simplification to the dissociation of water on a magnesium surface using classical simulators and quantum hardware. Our study identifies reactions of molecules on surfaces, in conjunction with the proposed algorithmic workflow, as a promising research direction in the field of quantum computing applied to materials science.

TI Efficient Experimental Verification of Quantum Gates with Local
   Operations
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Verifying the correct functioning of quantum gates is a crucial step toward reliable quantum information processing, but it becomes an overwhelming challenge as the system size grows due to the dimensionality curse. Recent theoretical breakthroughs show that it is possible to verify various important quantum gates with the optimal sample complexity of O(1/epsilon) using local operations only, where e is the estimation precision. In this Letter, we propose a variant of quantum gate verification (QGV) that is robust to practical gate imperfections and experimentally realize efficient QGV on a 2-qubit controlled-not gate and a 3-qubit Toffoli gate using only local state preparations and measurements. The experimental results show that, by using only 1600 and 2600 measurements on average, we can verify with 95% confidence level that the implemented controlled-not gate and Toffoli gate have fidelities of at least 99% and 97%, respectively. Demonstrating the superior low sample complexity and experimental feasibility of QGV, our work promises a solution to the dimensionality curse in verifying large quantum devices in the quantum era.

SO QUANTUM INFORMATION PROCESSING
AB As part of a protocol, we braid in a certain way six anyons of topological charges 222211 in the Kauffman-Jones version of SU(2) Chern-Simons theory at level 4. The gate we obtain is a braid for the usual qutrit 2222 but with respect to a different basis than the usual basis. With respect to that basis, the Freedman group of J. Phys. A: Math. Theor. 47, 285203 (2014) is identical to the D-group D(18, 1, 1; 2, 1, 1) from the Blichfeldt classification. We provide a physical realization of each Blichfeldt generator of the SU(3) finite subgroup D(18, 1, 1; 2, 1, 1). The link of this group to elementary particle physics was already well-known by the physicists. This paper uncovers its realization in quantum physics. Inspired by these new techniques for the qutrit, we are able to make new ancillas, namely 1/root 2(|1>+|3>) and 1/root 2(|1>-|3>), for the qubit 1221.

TI Simulating 2D Effects in Lattice Gauge Theories on a Quantum Computer
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Quantum computing is in its greatest upswing, with so-called noisy-intermediate-scale-quantum devices heralding the computational power to be expected in the near future. While the field is progressing toward quantum advantage, quantum computers already have the potential to tackle classically intractable problems. Here, we consider gauge theories describing fundamental-particle interactions. On the way to their full-fledged quantum simulations, the challenge of limited resources on near-term quantum devices has to be overcome. We propose an experimental quantum simulation scheme to study ground-state properties in two-dimensional quantum electrodynamics (2D QED) using existing quantum technology. Our protocols can be adapted to larger lattices and offer the perspective to connect the lattice simulation to low-energy observable quantities, e.g., the hadron spectrum, in the continuum theory. By including both dynamical matter and a nonminimal gauge-field truncation, we provide the novel opportunity to observe 2D effects on present-day quantum hardware. More specifically, we present two variational-quantumeigensolver- (VQE) based protocols for the study of magnetic field effects and for taking an important first step toward computing the running coupling of QED. For both instances, we include variational quantum circuits for qubit-based hardware. We simulate the proposed VQE experiments classically to calculate the required measurement budget under realistic conditions. While this feasibility analysis is done for trapped ions, our approach can be directly adapted to other platforms. The techniques presented here, combined with advancements in quantum hardware, pave the way for reaching beyond the capabilities of classical simulations.

TI Hacking Cryptographic Protocols with Advanced Variational Quantum
   Attacks
SO ACM TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM COMPUTING
AB Here we introduce an improved approach to Variational Quantum Attack Algorithms (VQAA) on crytographic protocols. Our methods provide robust quantum attacks to well-known cryptographic algorithms, more efficiently and with remarkably fewer qubits than previous approaches. We implement simulations of our attacks for symmetric-key protocols such as S-DES, S-AES, and Blowfish. For instance, we show how our attack allows a classical simulation of a small 8-qubit quantum computer to find the secret key of one 32-bit Blowfish instance with 24 times fewer number of iterations than a brute-force attack. Our work also shows improvements in attack success rates for lightweight ciphers such as S-DES and S-AES. Further applications beyond symmetric-key cryptography are also discussed, including asymmetric-key protocols and hash functions. In addition, we also comment on potential future improvements of our methods. Our results bring one step closer assessing the vulnerability of large-size classical cryptographic protocols with Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices, and set the stage for future research in quantum cybersecurity.

SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Quantum key distribution (QKD) is a revolutionary cryptography response to the rapidly growing cyberattacks threat posed by quantum computing. Yet, the roadblock limiting the vast expanse of secure quantum communication is the exponential decay of the transmitted quantum signal with the distance. Today's quantum cryptography is trying to solve this problem by focusing on quantum repeaters. However, efficient and secure quantum repetition at sufficient distances is still far beyond modern technology. Here, we shift the paradigm and build the long-distance security of the QKD upon the quantum foundations of the Second Law of Thermodynamics and end-to-end physical oversight over the transmitted optical quantum states. Our approach enables us to realize quantum states' repetition by optical amplifiers keeping states' wave properties and phase coherence. The unprecedented secure distance range attainable through our approach opens the door for the development of scalable quantum-resistant communication networks of the future.

AB Current efforts to build quantum computers focus mainly on the two-state qubit, which often involves suppressing readily-available higher states. In this work, we break this abstraction and synthesize short-duration control pulses for gates on generalized d-state qudits. We present Incremental Pulse Reseeding, a practical scheme to guide optimal control software to the lowest-duration pulse by iteratively seeding the optimizer with previous results. We find a near-linear relationship between Hilbert space dimension and gate duration through explicit pulse optimization for one- and two-qudit gates on transmons. Our results suggest that qudit operations are much more efficient than previously expected in the practical regime of interest and have the potential to significantly increase the computational power of current hardware.

AB Quantum computing is an emerging field of high interest. Many companies have started to work on developing more powerful and stable quantum computers. However, developers still struggle to master the art of programming with a quantum computer. One of the major challenges faced is the integration of quantum parts of a system with the classical one. This paper proposes a novel development model called Quantum-Algorithms-as-a-Service (QAaaS). This new model aims to allow developers to abstract the quantum components away from the design of the software they are building. The model leverages Software-as-a-Service and Function-as-a-Service to support multiple quantum cloud providers and run their algorithms regardless of the underlying hardware.

Yet although significant progress has been realized in proof-of-principle tabletop demonstrations, ranging from arbitrary single-qubit gates to controllable multiphoton interference, challenges in scaling frequency-bin processors to larger systems remain. In this Perspective, we highlight recent advances at the intersection of frequency-bin encoding and integrated photonics that are fundamentally transforming the outlook for scalable frequency-based quantum information. Focusing specifically on results on sources, state manipulation, and hyperentanglement, we envision a possible future in which on-chip frequency-bin circuits fulfill critical roles in quantum information processing, particularly in communications and networking.

AB Efficient computation of molecular energies is an exciting application of quantum computing for quantum chemistry, but current noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices can only execute shallow circuits, limiting existing variational quantum algorithms, which require deep entangling quantum circuit ansatzes to capture correlations, to small molecules. Here we demonstrate a variational NISQ-friendly algorithm that generates a set of Hartree-Fock ansatzes using multiple shallow circuits with depth linear in the number of qubits to estimate electronic correlation energies via perturbation theory up to the second order. We tested the algorithm on several small molecules, both with classical simulations including noise models and on cloud quantum processors, showing that it not only reproduces the equilibrium molecular energies but it also captures the perturbative electronic correlation effects at longer bond distances. The number of shallow circuits required for our algorithms scales O(N5) , with N being the system size, thus enabling the study of larger molecules compared to other approaches, where circuit depth or number of qubits required become prohibitive for NISQ devices.

TI A Preprocessing Perspective for Quantum Machine Learning Classification
   Advantage in Finance Using NISQ Algorithms
SO ENTROPY
AB Quantum Machine Learning (QML) has not yet demonstrated extensively and clearly its advantages compared to the classical machine learning approach. So far, there are only specific cases where some quantum-inspired techniques have achieved small incremental advantages, and a few experimental cases in hybrid quantum computing are promising, considering a mid-term future (not taking into account the achievements purely associated with optimization using quantum-classical algorithms). The current quantum computers are noisy and have few qubits to test, making it difficult to demonstrate the current and potential quantum advantage of QML methods. This study shows that we can achieve better classical encoding and performance of quantum classifiers by using Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) during the data preprocessing step. As a result, the Variational Quantum Algorithm (VQA) shows a gain of performance in balanced accuracy with the LDA technique and outperforms baseline classical classifiers.

TI Upper Bounds on Device-Independent Quantum Key Distribution Rates and a
   Revised Peres Conjecture
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION THEORY
AB Device-independent quantum key distribution (DIQKD) is one of the most challenging tasks in quantum cryptography. The protocols and their security are based on the existence of Bell inequalities and the ability to violate them by measuring entangled states. We study the entanglement needed for DIQKD protocols in two different ways. Our first contribution is the derivation of upper bounds on the key rates of CHSH-based DIQKD protocols in terms of the violation of the inequality; this sets an upper limit on the possible DI key extraction rate from states with a given violation. Our upper bound improves on the previously known bound of Kaur et al. Our second contribution is the initiation of the study of the role of bound entangled states in DIQKD. We present a revised Peres conjecture stating that such states cannot be used as a resource for DIQKD. We give a first piece of evidence for the conjecture by showing that the bound entangled state found by Vertesi and Brunner, even though it can certify DI randomness, cannot be used to produce a key using protocols analogous to the well-studied CHSH-based DIQKD protocol.

TI Constructing a virtual two-qubit gate by sampling single-qubit
   operations
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB We show a certain kind of non-local operations can be simulated by sampling a set of local operations with a quasi-probability distribution when the task of a quantum circuit is to evaluate an expectation value of observables. Utilizing the result, we describe a strategy to decompose a two-qubit gate to a sequence of single-qubit operations. Required operations are projective measurement of a qubit in Pauli basis, and pi/2 rotation around x, y, and z axes. The required number of sampling to get an expectation value of a target observable within an error of epsilon is roughly O(9(k)/epsilon(2)), where k is the number of 'cuts' performed. The proposed technique enables to perform 'virtual' gates between a distant pair of qubits, where there is no direct interaction and thus a number of swap gates are inevitable otherwise. It can also be utilized to improve the simulation of a large quantum computer with a small-sized quantum device, which is an idea put forward by Peng et al (2019 arXiv:). This work can enhance the connectivity of qubits on near-term, noisy quantum computers.

TI Quantum computer-enabled receivers for optical communication
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Optical communication is the standard for high-bandwidth information transfer in today's digital age. The increasing demand for bandwidth has led to the maturation of coherent transceivers that use phase- and amplitude-modulated optical signals to encode more bits of information per transmitted pulse. Such encoding schemes achieve higher information density, but also require more complicated receivers to discriminate the signaling states. In fact, achieving the ultimate limit of optical communication capacity, especially in the low light regime, requires coherent joint detection of multiple pulses. Despite their superiority, such joint detection receivers are not in widespread use because of the difficulty of constructing them in the optical domain. In this work we describe how optomechanical transduction of phase information from coherent optical pulses to superconducting qubit states followed by the execution of trained short-depth variational quantum circuits can perform joint detection of communication codewords with error probabilities that surpass all classical, individual pulse detection receivers. Importantly, we utilize a model of optomechanical transduction that captures non-idealities such as thermal noise and loss in order to understand the transduction performance necessary to achieve a quantum advantage with such a scheme. We also execute the trained variational circuits on an IBM-Q device with the modeled transduced states as input to demonstrate that a quantum advantage is possible even with current levels of quantum computing hardware noise.

TI Project and Implementation of a Quantum Logic Gate Emulator on FPGA
   Using a Model-Based Design Approach
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Quantum computing emulators are widely used for testing quantum algorithms ideally before executing them on real quantum processors. Therefore, researchers are very active in developing emulators primarily on FPGAs. This project is complex and requires a long time and a specific expertise if carried out following the low-level design approach using a Hardware Description Language (HDL). This paper describes, step by step, the process of quick designing a quantum gate emulator using a much simpler high-level design approach. It begins with the development of a quantum gate simulator in the MATLAB (R) environment, and subsequently translates it into an HDL design for FPGA implementation by using the MATLAB's HDL Coder toolbox. However, while code translation may seem straightforward using MATLAB toolboxes, it becomes a non-trivial task when transitioning from a quantum computing simulator to an HDL-based quantum computing emulator. Thus, it was necessary to conduct an in-depth study to implement a quantum computing simulator in MATLAB, enabling an error-free translation of HDL code. The developed method enables the designer to leverage the highly useful and straightforward model-based design approach offered by MATLAB, rather than directly the more complex HDL approach, returning a highly optimized HDL code for configuring the FPGA as a quantum computing emulator. This topic makes the design of quantum emulators on FPGA quick, reliable, optimized and without the need for specialized hardware design skills. Additionally, two implementation examples have been described using Altera/Intel FPGA on development boards DE1_SoC and DE5a-NET DDR4 provided by Terasic Inc.

TI Calibrating quantum gates up to 52 qubits in a superconducting processor
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Benchmarking large-scale quantum gates, typically involving multiple native two-qubit and single-qubit gates, is crucial in quantum computing. Global fidelity, encompassing information about inter-gate correlations, offers a comprehensive metric for evaluating and optimizing gate performance, unlike the fidelities of individual local native gates. In this work, utilizing the character-average benchmarking protocol implementable in a shallow circuit, we successfully benchmark gate fidelities up to 52 qubits. Notably, we achieved a fidelity of 63.09% +/- 0.23% for a 44-qubit parallel CZ gate. Utilizing the global fidelity of the parallel CZ gate, we explore the correlations among local CZ gates by introducing an inter-gate correlation metric, enabling one to simultaneously quantify crosstalk error when benchmarking gate fidelity. Finally, we apply our methods in gate optimization. By leveraging global fidelity for optimization, we enhance the fidelity of a 6-qubit parallel CZ gate from 87.65% to 92.04% and decrease the gate correlation from 3.53% to 3.22%, compared to local gate fidelity-based optimization. The experimental results align well with our established composite noise model, incorporating depolarizing and ZZ-coupling noises, and provide valuable insight into further study and mitigation of correlated noise.

AB Quantum machine learning (QML) algorithms have obtained great relevance in the machine learning (ML) field due to the promise of quantum speedups when performing basic linear algebra subroutines (BLAS), a fundamental element in most ML algorithms. By making use of BLAS operations, we propose, implement and analyze a quantum k-means (qk-means) algorithm with a low time complexity of O(NKlog(D)I/C) to apply it to the fundamental problem of discriminating quantum states at readout. Discriminating quantum states allows the identification of quantum states vertical bar 0 > and vertical bar 1 > from low-level in-phase and quadrature signal (IQ) data, and can be done using custom ML models. In order to reduce dependency on a classical computer, we use the qk-means to perform state discrimination on the IBMQ Bogota device and managed to find assignment fidelities of up to 98.7% that were only marginally lower than that of the k-means algorithm. We also performed a cross-talk benchmark on the quantum device by applying both algorithms to perform state discrimination on a combination of quantum states and using Pearson Correlation coefficients and assignment fidelities of discrimination results to conclude on the presence of cross-talk on qubits. Evidence shows cross-talk in the (1, 2) and (2, 3) neighboring qubit couples for the analyzed device.

TI NetQIR: An extension of QIR for distributed quantum computing
SO FUTURE GENERATION COMPUTER SYSTEMS-THE INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ESCIENCE
AB The rapid advancement of quantum computing has highlighted the need for scalable and efficient software infrastructures to fully exploit its potential. Current quantum processors face significant scalability constraints due to the limited number of qubits per chip. In response, distributed quantum computing (DQC) - achieved by networking multiple quantum processor units (QPUs)- is emerging as a promising solution. To support this paradigm, robust intermediate representations (IRs) are needed to translate high-level quantum algorithms into executable instructions suitable for distributed systems. This paper presents NetQIR, an extension of Microsoft's Quantum Intermediate Representation (QIR), specifically designed to facilitate DQC by incorporating new instruction specifications. NetQIR was developed in response to the lack of abstraction at the network and hardware layers identified in the existing literature as a significant obstacle to effectively implementing distributed quantum algorithms. Based on this analysis, NetQIR introduces new essential abstraction features to support compilers in DQC contexts. It defines network communication instructions independent of specific hardware, abstracting the complexities of inter-QPU communication. Although the proposed work allows abstraction of the underlying network, it is important to note that it is intended for the development of high-performance code on future modular quantum architectures. Leveraging the QIR framework, NetQIR aims to bridge the gap between high-level quantum algorithm design and low-level hardware execution, thus promoting modular and scalable approaches to quantum software infrastructures for distributed applications. Furthermore, its design may serve as a foundational component for future implementations of distributed quantum standards such as the Quantum Message Passing Interface (QMPI).

TI Hyperentangled Time-Bin and Polarization Quantum Key Distribution
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB Fiber-based quantum communication networks are currently limited without quantum repeaters. Satellite-based quantum links have been proposed to extend the network domain. We develop a quantum communication system, suitable for realistic satellite-to-ground communication. With this system, we execute an entanglement-based quantum key distribution (QKD) protocol developed by Bennett, Brassard, and Mermin (BBM92), achieving quantum bit-error rates (QBERs) below 2% in all bases. More importantly, we demonstrate low-QBER execution of a higher-dimensional hyperentanglement-based QKD protocol, using photons simultaneously entangled in polarization and time bin, leading to significantly higher secure key rates, at the cost of increased technical complexity and system size. We show that our protocol is suitable for a space-to-ground link, after incorporating Doppler-shift compensation, and verify its security using a rigorous finite-key analysis. Additionally, we discuss system-engineering considerations relevant to those and other quantum communication protocols and their dependence on what photonic degrees of freedom are utilized.

TI Efficient pumping of atomic frequency combs in a Tm3+:YAG crystal for
   broadband quantum optical storage
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB Quantum memory devices with high storage efficiency and bandwidth are essential elements for future quantum networks. Here, we report a storage efficiency greater than 28% in a Tm3+:YAG crystal (where YAG is yttrium aluminum garnet) at elevated temperatures, achieving this milestone without relying on optical cavities and without compromising memory bandwidth. We introduce different pumping techniques for Tm-based memories that enable multifrequency-window storage and high memory bandwidth reaching 630 MHz, significantly surpassing previous Tm-based memory demonstrations, considering the operating temperature of 3.5 K. Furthermore, we propose a general method for large-bandwidth atomic frequency memory using non-Kramers rare-earth ions (REIs) in solids, paving the way for storage efficiencies and bandwidths approaching fundamental limits. The compatibility of Tm memories with neutral-atom quantum processors and their seamless integration with scalable photonic platforms, such as lithium niobate on insulator, underscore their potential for distributed quantum computing, hybrid quantum networks, and space-based quantum communication. Our study represents a significant advancement toward practical high-performance quantum memories based on REI-doped crystals, where we predict that gigahertz bandwidth and storage efficiencies exceeding 30% are achievable at lower temperatures.

TI Deterministic Generation of Frequency-Bin-Encoded Microwave Photons
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB A distributed quantum computing network requires a quantum communication channel between spatially separated processing units. In superconducting circuits, such a channel can be implemented based on propagating microwave photons to encode and transfer quantum information between an emitter and a receiver. However, traveling microwave photons can be lost during the transmission, leading to the failure of information transfer. Heralding protocols can be used to detect such photon losses. In this Letter, we propose such a protocol and experimentally demonstrate a frequency-bin encoding method of microwave photonic modes using superconducting circuits. We deterministically encode the quantum information from a superconducting qubit by simultaneously emitting its information into two photonic modes at different frequencies, with a process fidelity of 94.9%. The frequency-bin-encoded photonic modes can be used, at the receiver processor, to detect the occurrence of photon loss. Our Letter thus provides a reliable method to implement high-fidelity quantum state transfer in a distributed quantum computing network, incorporating error detection to enhance performance and accuracy.

TI One-way deficit and Holevo quantity of generalized n-qubit Werner
   state
SO QUANTUM INFORMATION PROCESSING
AB Originated from the work extraction in quantum systems coupled to a heat bath, quantum deficit is a kind of significant quantum correlations like quantum entanglement. It links quantum thermodynamics with quantum information. We analytically calculate the one-way deficit of the generalized n-qubit Werner state. We find that the one-way deficit increases as the mixing probability p increases for any n. For fixed p, we observe that the one-way deficit increases as n increases. For any n, the maximum of one-way deficit is attained at p = 1. Furthermore, for large n (2(n) -> infinity), we prove that the curve of one-way deficit versus p approaches to a straight line with slope 1. We also calculate the Holevo quantity for the generalized n-qubit Werner state and show that it is zero.

TI Counting Cosmic Cycles: Past Big Crunches, Future Recurrence Limits, and
   the Age of the Quantum Memory Matrix Universe
SO ENTROPY
AB We present a quantitative theory of contraction and expansion cycles within the Quantum Memory Matrix (QMM) cosmology. In this framework, spacetime consists of finite-capacity Hilbert cells that store quantum information. Each non-singular bounce adds a fixed increment of imprint entropy, defined as the cumulative quantum information written irreversibly into the matrix and distinct from coarse-grained thermodynamic entropy, thereby providing an intrinsic, monotonic cycle counter. By calibrating the geometry-information duality, inferring today's cumulative imprint from CMB, BAO, chronometer, and large-scale-structure constraints, and integrating the modified Friedmann equations with imprint back-reaction, we find that the Universe has already completed Npast=3.6 +/- 0.4 cycles. The finite Hilbert capacity enforces an absolute ceiling: propagating the holographic write rate and accounting for instability channels implies only Nfuture=7.8 +/- 1.6 additional cycles before saturation halts further bounces. Integrating Kodama-vector proper time across all completed cycles yields a total cumulative age tQMM=62.0 +/- 2.5Gyr, compared to the 13.8 +/- 0.2Gyr of the current expansion usually described by Lambda CDM. The framework makes concrete, testable predictions: an enhanced faint-end UV luminosity function at z greater than or similar to 12 observable with JWST, a stochastic gravitational-wave background with f2/3 scaling in the LISA band from primordial black-hole mergers, and a nanohertz background with slope alpha similar or equal to 2/3 accessible to pulsar-timing arrays. These signatures provide near-term opportunities to confirm, refine, or falsify the cyclical QMM chronology.

TI Fusion for high-dimensional linear-optical quantum computing with
   improved success probability
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB Type-II fusion is a probabilistic entangling measurement that is essential to measurement-based linear-optical quantum computing and can be used for quantum teleportation more broadly. However, it remains under-explored for high-dimensional qudits. Our main result gives a Type-II fusion protocol with proven success probability approximately 2/d2 for qudits of arbitrary dimension d. This generalizes a previous method that only applied to even-dimensional qudits. We believe this protocol to be the most efficient known protocol for Type-II fusion, with the d = 5 case beating the previous record by a factor of approximately 723. We discuss the construction of the required (d-2)-qudit ancillary state using a silicon spin-qudit ancilla coupled to a microwave cavity through time-bin multiplexing. We then introduce a general framework of extra-dimensional corrections, a natural technique in linear optics that can be used to nondeterministically correct nonmaximally entangled projections into Bell measurements. We use this method to analyze and improve several different circuits for high-dimensional Type-II fusion and compare their benefits and drawbacks.

TI Local Quantum Uncertainty and Entanglement in the Hyperfine Structure of
   the Hydrogen Atom: A Lindblad Approach
SO MATHEMATICS
AB In this work, we investigate quantum correlations, including entanglement and quantum discord, within the hyperfine structure of the hydrogen atom using the Lindblad master equation to model its dynamics as an open quantum system interacting with an environment. By incorporating realistic environmental influences, we examine the time evolution of two key measures of quantum correlations: concurrence, which quantifies entanglement, and local quantum uncertainty (LQU), a broader indicator of quantumness. Our analysis spans various initial states, including coherent superpositions of hyperfine states, to capture a wide range of possible configurations and demonstrate how these measures capture distinct aspects of quantum behavior. The results reveal the robustness of LQU in regimes where entanglement may vanish. This resilience of LQU underscores its utility as a robust measure of quantum correlations beyond entanglement alone in the hydrogen atom. By elucidating the dynamics of quantum correlations in the hydrogen atom under realistic conditions, this work not only deepens our fundamental understanding of atomic systems but also highlights their potential relevance to quantum information science and the development of quantum technologies.

TI Quantum Graphs as Quantum Relations
SO JOURNAL OF GEOMETRIC ANALYSIS
AB The "noncommutative graphs" which arise in quantum error correction are a special case of the quantum relations introduced in Weaver (Quantum relations. Mem Am Math Soc 215(v-vi):81-140, 2012). We use this perspective to interpret the Knill-Laflamme error-correction conditions (Knill and Laflamme in Theory of quantum error-correcting codes. Phys Rev A 55:900-911, 1997) in terms of graph-theoretic independence, to give intrinsic characterizations of Stahlke's noncommutative graph homomorphisms (Stahlke in Quantum zero-error source-channel coding and non-commutative graph theory. IEEE Trans Inf Theory 62:554-577, 2016) and Duan, Severini, and Winter's noncommutative bipartite graphs (Duan et al., op. cit. in Zero-error communication via quantum channels, noncommutative graphs, and a quantum Lovasz number. IEEE Trans Inf Theory 59:1164-1174, 2013), and to realize the noncommutative confusability graph associated to a quantum channel (Duan et al., op. cit. in Zero-error communication via quantum channels, noncommutative graphs, and a quantum Lovasz number. IEEE Trans Inf Theory 59:1164-1174, 2013) as the pullback of a diagonal relation. Our framework includes as special cases not only purely classical and purely quantum information theory, but also the "mixed" setting which arises in quantum systems obeying superselection rules. Thus we are able to define noncommutative confusability graphs, give error correction conditions, and so on, for such systems. This could have practical value, as superselection constraints on information encoding can be physically realistic.

TI Fast, noise-free atomic optical memory with 35-percent end-to-end
   efficiency
SO COMMUNICATIONS PHYSICS
AB Coherent optical memories will likely play an important role in future quantum communication networks. Among the different platforms, memories based on ladder-type orbital transitions in atomic gasses offer high bandwidth (>100 MHz), continuous (on-demand) readout, and low-noise operation. Here we report on an upgraded setup of our previously-reported fast ladder memory, with improved efficiency and lifetime, and reduced noise. The upgrade employs a stronger control field, wider signal beam, reduced atomic density, higher optical depth, annular optical-pumping beam, and weak dressing of an auxiliary orbital to counteract residual Doppler-broadening. For a 2 ns-long pulse, we demonstrate 53% internal efficiency, 35% end-to-end efficiency, 3 x 10(-5) noise photons per pulse, and a 1/e lifetime of 108 ns. This combination of performances is a record for continuous-readout memories.

SO SCIENCE ADVANCES
AB Reliable execution of large-scale quantum algorithms requires robust underlying operations, which is addressed by quantum error correction (QEC). Most modern QEC protocols rely on measurements and feed-forward operations, which are experimentally demanding and often prone to high error rates. Additionally, no single-error-correcting code intrinsically supports the full set of logical operations required for universal quantum computing. In this work, we present a complete toolbox for fault-tolerant universal quantum computing without measurements during algorithm execution by combining the strategies of code switching and concatenation. We develop fault-tolerant, measurement-free protocols to transfer encoded information between 2D and 3D color codes that offer complementary and, in combination, universal sets of robust logical gates. Moreover, we extend the scheme to higher-distance codes by concatenating the 2D color code and integrating code switching for operations lacking a natively fault-tolerant implementation. Our measurement-free approach thereby provides a practical and scalable pathway for universal quantum computing on state-of-the-art quantum processors.

TI Quantum computation capability verification protocol for noisy
   intermediate-scale quantum devices with the dihedral coset problem
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB In this article, we propose an interactive protocol for one party (the verifier) holding a quantum computer to verify the quantum computation power of another party???s (the prover) device via a one-way quantum channel. This protocol is referred to as the dihedral coset problem (DCP) challenge. The verifier needs to prepare quantum states encoding secrets (DCP samples) and send them to the prover. The prover is then tasked with recovering those secrets with a certain accuracy. Numerical simulation demonstrates that this accuracy is sensitive to errors in quantum hardware. Additionally, the DCP challenge serves as a benchmarking protocol for locally fully connected quantum architecture and aims to be performed on current and near-future quantum resources. We conduct a 4-qubit experiment on one of the IBM Q devices.

TI Multiuser quantum key distribution using quotient graph states derived
   from continuous-variable dual-rail cluster states
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB Multipartite entangled states are essential for multiuser quantum cryptography. While large-scale continuous-variable (CV) cluster states, particularly the dual-rail cluster state, have been well studied in measurement-based quantum computation, their cryptographic potential remains underexplored. Here, we propose a three-user conference key protocol using a CV dual-rail cluster state. By applying a node-coloring scheme to the infinite dual-rail graph, we create a six-mode pure graph state ideal for cryptographic tasks. Our results demonstrate near-GHZ (Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger) performance for quantum conference key agreement (QCKA). Crucially, our protocol uniquely enables bipartite keys post-QCKA, which GHZ states cannot provide. It also surpasses two-mode squeezed vacuum states in generating bipartite keys within downstream-access networks. Considering finite-size effects and impure squeezed states, our scheme remains robust despite experimental imperfections. We also introduce an enhanced method to more accurately estimate bipartite key generation capacity in quantum networks, paving the way for practical multiuser quantum cryptography.

TI Algebraic representation of Three Qubit Quantum Circuit Problems
SO MALAYSIAN JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL SCIENCES
AB The evolution of quantum states serves as good fundamental studies in understanding the quantum information systems which finally lead to the research on quantum computation. To carry out such a study, mathematical tools such as the Lie group and their associated Lie algebra is of great importance. In this study, the Lie algebra of su(8) is represented in a tensor product operation between three Pauli matrices. This can be realized by constructing the generalized Gell-Mann matrices and comparing them to the Pauli bases. It is shown that there is a one-to-one correlation of the Gell-Mann matrices with the Pauli basis which resembled the change of coordinates. Together with the commutator relations and the frequency analysis of the structure constant via the algebra, the Lie bracket operation will be highlighted providing insight into relating quantum circuit model with Lie Algebra. These are particularly useful when dealing with three-qubit quantum circuit problems which involve quantum gates that is derived from the SU(8) Lie group.

TI Quantum Computing to Study Cloud Turbulence Properties
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB The analysis and investigation of the data obtained from Direct Numerical (DNS) simulation of droplet dynamics in cloud turbulence is a complex and time-consuming task when performaed on traditional computers. The DNS data generally have, a high spatial resolution $\approx 1mm$ and require considerable space to store. It is tedious to find specific features of this data, such as locating high and low vortex areas in cloud turbulence using machine learning algorithms. In this research, we employ quantum computing to examine and analyze cloud droplet dynamics data and present a quantum supervised machine learning algorithm, namely, a support vector machine (SVM) to segregate low and high vortex regions and investigate the droplet characteristics in those regions. The result show that use of quantum computers can accelerate the entire process, and quantum mechanics tools, such as quantum kernels and quantum circuits can better manage the complex nature of data than traditional methods.

TI Maximizing quantum-computing expressive power through randomized
   circuits
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB In the noisy intermediate -scale quantum era, variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) have emerged as a promising avenue to obtain quantum advantage. However, the success of VQAs depends on the expressive power of parametrized quantum circuits, which is constrained by the limited gate number and the presence of barren plateaus. In this paper, we propose and numerically demonstrate an approach for VQAs, utilizing randomized quantum circuits to generate the variational wave function. We parametrize the distribution function of these random circuits using artificial neural networks and optimize it to find the solution. This random -circuit approach presents a trade-off between maximizing the expressive power of the variational wave function and minimizing the associated time cost, specifically the sampling cost of quantum circuits. Given a fixed gate number, we can systematically increase the expressive power by extending the quantum -computing time. With a sufficiently large permissible time cost, the variational wave function can approximate any quantum state with arbitrary accuracy. Furthermore, we establish explicit relationships between expressive power, time cost, and gate number for variational quantum eigensolvers. These results highlight the promising potential of the random -circuit approach in achieving a high expressive power in quantum computing.

TI Power of data in quantum machine learning
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB The use of quantum computing for machine learning is among the most exciting prospective applications of quantum technologies. However, machine learning tasks where data is provided can be considerably different than commonly studied computational tasks. In this work, we show that some problems that are classically hard to compute can be easily predicted by classical machines learning from data. Using rigorous prediction error bounds as a foundation, we develop a methodology for assessing potential quantum advantage in learning tasks. The bounds are tight asymptotically and empirically predictive for a wide range of learning models. These constructions explain numerical results showing that with the help of data, classical machine learning models can be competitive with quantum models even if they are tailored to quantum problems. We then propose a projected quantum model that provides a simple and rigorous quantum speed-up for a learning problem in the fault-tolerant regime. For near-term implementations, we demonstrate a significant prediction advantage over some classical models on engineered data sets designed to demonstrate a maximal quantum advantage in one of the largest numerical tests for gate-based quantum machine learning to date, up to 30 qubits. Expectations for quantum machine learning are high, but there is currently a lack of rigorous results on which scenarios would actually exhibit a quantum advantage. Here, the authors show how to tell, for a given dataset, whether a quantum model would give any prediction advantage over a classical one.

TI MarQSim: Reconciling Determinism and Randomness in Compiler Optimization
   for Quantum Simulation
SO PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACM ON PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES-PACMPL
AB Quantum Hamiltonian simulation, fundamental in quantum algorithm design, extends far beyond its foundational roots, powering diverse quantum computing applications. However, optimizing the compilation of quantum Hamiltonian simulation poses significant challenges. Existing approaches fall short in reconciling deterministic and randomized compilation, lack appropriate intermediate representations, and struggle to guarantee correctness. Addressing these challenges, we present MarQSim, a novel compilation framework. MarQSim leverages a Markov chain-based approach, encapsulated in the Hamiltonian Term Transition Graph, adeptly reconciling deterministic and randomized compilation benefits. Furthermore, we formulate a Minimum-Cost Flow model that can tune transition matrices to enforce correctness while accommodating various optimization objectives. Experimental results demonstrate MarQSim's superiority in generating more efficient quantum circuits for simulating various quantum Hamiltonians while maintaining precision.

AB With the rapid advancement of ICT and IoT technologies, the integration of Edge and Fog Computing has become essential to meet the increasing demands for real-time data processing and network efficiency. However, these technologies face critical security challenges, exacerbated by the emergence of quantum computing, which threatens traditional encryption methods. The rise in cyber-attacks targeting IoT and Edge/Fog networks underscores the need for robust, quantum-resistant security solutions. To address these challenges, researchers are focusing on Quantum Key Distribution and Post-Quantum Cryptography, which utilize quantum-resistant algorithms and the principles of quantum mechanics to ensure data confidentiality and integrity. This paper reviews the current security practices in IoT and Edge/Fog environments, explores the latest advancements in QKD and PQC technologies, and discusses their integration into distributed computing systems. Additionally, this paper proposes an enhanced QKD protocol combining the Cascade protocol and Kyber algorithm to address existing limitations. Finally, we highlight future research directions aimed at improving the scalability, efficiency, and practicality of QKD and PQC for securing IoT and Edge/Fog networks against evolving quantum threats.

TI Superposition of two-mode squeezed states for quantum information
   processing and quantum sensing
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We investigate superpositions of two-mode squeezed states (TMSSs), which have potential applications in quantum information processing and quantum sensing. We study some properties of these nonclassical states such as the statistics of each mode and the degree of entanglement between the two modes, which can be higher than that of a TMSS with the same degree of squeezing. The states we consider can be prepared by inducing two-mode Jaynes-Cummings and anti-Jaynes-Cummings interactions in a system of two modes and a spin-1/2 particle, for instance, in the trapped ion domain, as described here. We show that when two harmonic oscillators are prepared in a superposition of two TMSSs, each reduced single-mode state can be advantageously employed to sense arbitrary displacements of the mode in phase space. The Wigner function of this reduced state exhibits a symmetrical peak centered at the phase-space origin, which has the convenient peculiarity of getting narrower in both quadratures simultaneously as the average photon number increases. This narrow peak can be used as the pointer of our quantum sensor, with its position in phase space indicating the displacement undergone by the oscillator.

TI Effect of noisy environment on secure quantum teleportation of unimodal
   Gaussian states
SO QUANTUM INFORMATION PROCESSING
AB Quantum networks rely on quantum teleportation, a process where an unknown quantum state is transmitted between sender and receiver via entangled states and classical communication. In our study, we utilize a continuous variable two-mode squeezed vacuum state as the primary resource for quantum teleportation, shared by Alice and Bob, while exposed to a squeezed thermal environment. Secure quantum teleportation necessitates a teleportation fidelity exceeding 2/3 and the establishment of two-way steering of the resource state. We investigate the temporal evolution of steering and teleportation fidelity to determine critical parameter values for secure quantum teleportation of a coherent Gaussian state. Our findings reveal constraints imposed by temperature, dissipation rate, and squeezing parameters of the squeezed thermal reservoir on the duration of secure quantum teleportation. Intriguingly, we demonstrate that increasing the squeezing parameter of the initial state effectively extends the temporal window for a successful secure quantum teleportation.

TI Topological graph states and quantum error-correction codes
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Deciding if a given family of quantum states is topologically ordered is an important but nontrivial problem in condensed matter physics and quantum information theory. We derive necessary and sufficient conditions for a family of graph states to be in TQO-1, which is a class of quantum error-correction code states whose code distance scales macroscopically with the number of physical qubits. Using these criteria, we consider a number of specific graph families, including the star and complete graphs, and the line graphs of complete and completely bipartite graphs, and discuss which are topologically ordered and how to construct the codewords. The formalism is then employed to construct several codes with macroscopic distance, including a three-dimensional topological code generated by local stabilizers that also has a macroscopic number of encoded logical qubits. The results indicate that graph states provide a fruitful approach to the construction and characterization of topological stabilizer quantum error-correction codes.

SO IET QUANTUM COMMUNICATION
AB With the race to build large-scale quantum computers and efforts to exploit quantum algorithms for efficient problem solving in science and engineering disciplines, the requirement to have efficient and scalable verification methods are of vital importance. A novel formal verification method that is targeted at Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT) circuits is proposed. Quantum Fourier Transform is a fundamental quantum algorithm that forms the basis of many quantum computing applications. The verification method employs abstractions of quantum gates used in QFT that leads to a reduction of the verification problem from Hilbert space to the quantifier free logic of bit-vectors. Very efficient decision procedures are available to reason about bit-vectors. Therefore, this method is able to scale up to the verification of QFT circuits with 10,000 qubits and 50 million quantum gates, providing a meteoric advance in the size of QFT circuits thus far verified using formal verification methods.

AB Variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) can potentially solve practical problems using contemporary Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ) computers. VQAs find near-optimal solutions in the presence of qubit errors by classically optimizing a loss function computed by parameterized quantum circuits. However, developing and testing VQAs is challenging due to the limited availability of quantum hardware, their high error rates, and the significant overhead of classical simulations. Furthermore, VQA researchers must pick the right initialization for circuit parameters, utilize suitable classical optimizer configurations, and deploy appropriate error mitigation methods. Unfortunately, these tasks are done in an adhoc manner today, as there are no software tools to configure and tune the VQA hyperparameters.
   In this paper, we present OSCAR (cOmpressed Sensing based Cost lAndscape Reconstruction) to help configure: 1) correct initialization, 2) noise mitigation techniques, and 3) classical optimizers to maximize the quality of the solution on NISQ hardware. OSCAR enables efficient debugging and performance tuning by providing users with the loss function landscape without running thousands of quantum circuits as required by the grid search. Using OSCAR, we can accurately reconstruct the complete cost landscape with up to 100X speedup. Furthermore, OSCAR can compute an optimizer function query in an instant by interpolating a computed landscape, thus enabling the trial run of a VQA configuration with considerably reduced overhead.

TI An RNN-policy gradient approach for quantum architecture search
SO QUANTUM INFORMATION PROCESSING
AB Variational quantum circuits are one of the promising ways to exploit the advantages of quantum computing in the noisy intermediate-scale quantum technology era. The design of the quantum circuit architecture might greatly affect the performance capability of the quantum algorithms. The quantum architecture search is the process of automatically designing quantum circuit architecture, aiming at finding the optimal quantum circuit composition architecture by the algorithm for a given task, so that the algorithm can learn to design the circuit architecture. Compared to manual design, quantum architecture search algorithms are more effective in finding quantum circuits with better performance capabilities. In this paper, based on the deep reinforcement learning, we propose an approach for quantum circuit architecture search. The sampling of the circuit architecture is learnt through reinforcement learning-based controller. Layer-based search is also used to accelerate the computational efficiency of the search algorithm. Applying to data classification tasks, we show that the method can search for quantum circuit architectures with better accuracies. Moreover, the circuit has a smaller number of quantum gates and parameters.

Although RSA is not a viable option for ensuring post-quantum security, its performance was used as a control to show the performance difference on constrained networks of a widely-used traditional cryptographic algorithm versus the measured performance of the post-quantum algorithms tested. Data was collected at determined network constraint settings, and this collected data is presented as a basis for further research into the post-quantum performance of IKEv2 on constrained networks.

TI Quantum Algorithms for Solving Ordinary Differential Equations via
   Classical Integration Methods
SO QUANTUM
AB Identifying computational tasks suitable for (future) quantum computers is an active field of research. Here we explore utilizing quantum computers for the purpose of solving differential equations. We consider two approaches: (i) basis encoding and fixed-point arithmetic on a digital quantum computer, and (ii) representing and solving high-order Runge-Kutta methods as optimization problems on quantum annealers. As realizations applied to two-dimensional linear ordinary differential equations, we devise and simulate corresponding digital quantum circuits. We also implement and run a 6th order Gauss-Legendre collocation method on a D-Wave 2000Q system, showing good agreement with the reference solution. We find that the quantum annealing approach exhibits the largest potential for high-order implicit integration methods. As promising future scenario, the digital arithmetic method could be employed as an "oracle" within quantum search algorithms for inverse problems.

TI Spin-Photon Entanglement of a Single Er3+Ion in the Telecom Band
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW X
AB Entanglement between photons and a quantum memory is a key component of quantum repeaters, which allow long-distance quantum entanglement distribution in the presence of fiber losses. Spin-photon entanglement has been implemented with a number of different atomic and solid-state qubits with long spin coherence times, but none directly emit photons into the 1.5-mu m telecom band where losses in optical fibers are minimized. Here, we demonstrate spin-photon entanglement using a single rare earth ion in the solidstate Er3coupled to a silicon nanophotonic cavity, which directly emits photons at 1532.6 nm. We infer an entanglement fidelity of 73(3)% after propagating through 15.6 km of optical fiber. This work opens the door to large-scale quantum networks based Er3ions, leveraging scalable silicon device fabrication and spectral multiplexing.

TI Robust Millisecond Coherence Times of Erbium Electron Spins
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB Erbium-doped solids are prime candidates for quantum memories in optical quantum networks given their telecom-compatible photon emission. An electron spin of erbium with millisecond coherence time is desirable for generating remote entanglement between adjacent quantum network nodes. Here we report GHz-range electron-spin transitions of 167Er3+ in a yttrium oxide (Y2O3) matrix with coherence times that are consistently longer than a millisecond. By polarizing paramagnetic impurity spins we achieve a spin T2 up to 1.46 ms, and up to 7.1 ms after dynamical decoupling. These coherence lifetimes are among the longest found for erbium in crystalline matrices despite the presence of host nuclear spins. We further enhance the coherence time beyond conventional dynamical decoupling, using customized sequences to simultaneously mitigate spectral diffusion and dipolar interactions. Our study not only establishes 167Er3+: Y2O3 as a significant quantum memory platform but also provides a guideline for engineering long-lived erbium spins in a variety of host materials for quantum technologies.

TI Improvement in quantum communication using quantum switch
SO PHYSICA SCRIPTA
AB Applications of the quantum switch on quantum channels have recently become a topic of intense discussion. In the present work, we show that some useless (for communication) channels may provide useful communication under the action of quantum switch for several information-theoretic tasks: quantum random access codes, quantum steering, etc. We demonstrate that the quantum switch can also be useful in preventing the loss of coherence in a system when only coherence-breaking channels are the available channels for communication. We also show that if a useless quantum channel does not provide useful communication even after using a quantum switch, concatenating the channel with another suitable quantum channel, and subsequently using the switch, one may achieve useful communication. Finally, we discuss how the introduction of noise in the quantum switch can reduce the advantage that the switch provides.

TI Improved Big Data Security Using Quantum Chaotic Map of Key Sequence
SO COMPUTERS
AB In the era of ubiquitous big data, ensuring secure storage, transmission, and processing has become a paramount concern. Classical cryptographic methods face increasing vulnerabilities in the face of quantum computing advancements. This research proposes an enhanced big data security framework integrating a quantum chaotic map of key sequence (QCMKS), which synergizes the principles of quantum mechanics and chaos theory to generate highly unpredictable and non-repetitive key sequences. The system incorporates quantum random number generation (QRNG) for true entropy sources, quantum key distribution (QKD) for secure key exchange immune to eavesdropping, and quantum error correction (QEC) to maintain integrity against quantum noise. Additionally, quantum optical elements transformation (QOET) is employed to implement state transformations on photonic qubits, ensuring robustness during transmission across quantum networks. The integration of QCMKS with QRNG, QKD, QEC, and QOET significantly enhances the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of big data systems, laying the groundwork for a quantum-resilient data security paradigm. While the proposed framework demonstrates strong theoretical potential for improving big data security, its practical robustness and performance are subject to current quantum hardware limitations, noise sensitivity, and integration complexities.

TI Efficient Quantum Circuits for Non-Unitary and Unitary Diagonal
   Operators with Space-Time-Accuracy Trade-Offs
SO ACM TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM COMPUTING
AB Unitary and non-unitary diagonal operators are fundamental building blocks in quantum algorithms with applications in the resolution of partial differential equations, Hamiltonian simulations, the loading of classical data on quantum computers (quantum state preparation), and many others. In this paper, we introduce a general approach to implement unitary and non-unitary diagonal operators with efficient-adjustable-depth quantum circuits. The depth, i.e., the number of layers of quantum gates of the quantum circuit, is reducible with respect either to the width, i.e., the number of ancilla qubits, or to the accuracy between the implemented operator and the target one. While exact methods have an optimal exponential scaling either in terms of size, i.e., the total number of primitive quantum gates, or width, approximate methods prove to be efficient for the class of diagonal operators depending on smooth, at least differentiable, functions. Our approach is general enough to allow any method for diagonal operators to become adjustable-depth or approximate, decreasing the depth of the circuit by increasing its width or its approximation level. This feature offers flexibility and can match with the hardware limitations in coherence time or cumulative gate error. We illustrate these methods by performing quantum state preparation and non-unitary-real-space simulation of the diffusion equation. This simulation paves the way to efficient implementations of stochastic models useful in physics, chemistry, biology, image processing, and finance.

TI Quantum teleportation of cat states with binary-outcome measurements
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB We propose a teleportation protocol involving beam splitting operations and binary-outcome measurements, such as parity measurements. These operations have a straightforward implementation using the dispersive regime of the Jaynes-Cummings Hamiltonian, making our protocol suitable for a broad class of platforms, including trapped ions, circuit quantum electrodynamics and acoustodynamics systems. In these platforms homodyne measurements of the bosonic modes are less natural than dispersive measurements, making standard continuous variable teleportation unsuitable. In our protocol, Alice is in possession of two bosonic modes and Bob a single mode. An entangled mode pair between Alice and Bob is created by performing a beam splitter operation on a cat state. An unknown qubit state encoded by cat states is then teleported from Alice to Bob after a beamsplitting operation, measurement sequence, and a conditional correction. In the case of multiple measurements, near-perfect fidelity can be obtained. We discuss the optimal parameters in order to maximize the fidelity under a variety of scenarios.

TI High-rate quantum LDPC codes for long-range-connected neutral atom
   registers
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB High-rate quantum error correcting (QEC) codes with moderate overheads in qubit number and control complexity are highly desirable for achieving fault-tolerant quantum computing. Recently, quantum error correction has experienced significant progress both in code development and experimental realizations, with neutral atom qubit architecture rapidly establishing itself as a leading platform in the field. Scalable quantum computing will require processing with QEC codes that have low qubit overhead and large error suppression, and while such codes do exist, they involve a degree of non-locality that has yet to be integrated into experimental platforms. In this work, we analyze a family of high-rate Low-Density Parity-Check (LDPC) codes with limited long-range interactions and outline a near-term implementation in neutral atom registers. By means of circuit-level simulations, we find that these codes outperform surface codes in all respects when the two-qubit nearest neighbour gate error probability is below similar to 0.1%. By using multiple laser colors, we show how these codes can be natively integrated in two-dimensional static neutral atom qubit architectures with open boundaries, where the desired long-range connectivity can be targeted via the Rydberg blockade interaction.

TI Asymmetric Quantum Multicast Network Coding: Asymmetric Optimal Cloning
   over Quantum Networks
SO APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
AB Multicasting of quantum states is an essential feature of quantum internet. Since the noncloning theorem prohibits perfect cloning of an unknown quantum state, an appropriate protocol may depend on the purpose of the multicast. In this paper, we treat the multicasting of a single copy of an unknown state over a quantum network with free classical communication. We especially focus on protocols exactly multicasting an asymmetric optimal universal clone. Hence, these protocols are optimal and universal in terms of mean fidelity between input and output states, but the fidelities can depend on target nodes. Among these protocols, a protocol spending smaller communication resources is preferable. Here, we construct such a protocol attaining the min-cut of the network described as follows. Two (three) asymmetric optimal clones of an input state are created at a source node. Then, the state is divided into classical information and a compressed quantum state. The state is sent to two (three) target nodes using the quantum network coding. Finally, the asymmetric clones are reconstructed using LOCC with a small amount of entanglement shared among the target nodes and the classical information sent from the source node.

AB Quantum computing represents a groundbreaking approach to high-performance computing. In recent years, quantum computers have progressed from single-qubit processors to systems boasting over 400 qubits. The presence of such a large number of qubits offers significant advantages, including enhanced computational speed-a capability beyond classical computing methods. However, the current stage of quantum computing is referred to as the noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) era. The existence of noise in this era presents challenges in testing quantum computing applications, leading to considerable variance in application results. Furthermore, the diverse noise characteristics observed across different machines exacerbate this issue, complicating the selection of the appropriate machine for application execution. In response to these challenges, we introduce our Predictive Quantum Machine Learning (PQML) tool. This tool is designed to predict outcomes when executing identical quantum machine learning applications-specifically, a critical suite of variational quantum algorithms-across various quantum computers during the NISQ era. This effort relies on data collected over a 12-month period. To the best of our knowledge, this study represents the first attempt to ensure reproducibility across quantum computers for complex circuits. Additionally, we have developed a model capable of forecasting the accuracy of quantum computers for variational quantum algorithms, with a particular emphasis on quantum machine learning as a case study.

Quantum annealers provide a physical computing platform which utilises quantum phase transitions to solve specific classes of combinatorial problems. These devices have seen rapid increases in scale and performance, and are now approaching the point where they could be valuable for industrial applications. This paper shows how an optimal power flow problem incorporating linear multiphase network modelling, discrete sources of energy flexibility, renewable generation placement/sizing and network upgrade decisions can be formulated as a quadratic unconstrained binary optimisation problem, which can be solved by quantum annealing. Case studies with these components integrated with the IEEE European Low Voltage Test Feeder are implemented using D-Wave Systems' 5,760 qubit Advantage quantum processing unit and hybrid quantum-classical solver.

TI Monogamy of quantum discord
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB The original quantum discord (QD) is shown to be not monogamous except for the three-qubit states. Recently, a complete monogamy relation for multiparty quantum system was established for entanglement in (Guo and Zhang 2020 Phys. Rev. A 101 032301), and in addition, a new multipartite generalization of QD was proposed in (Radhakrishnan et al 2020 Phys. Rev. Lett. 124 110401). In this work, we firstly define the complete monogamy for this multipartite quantum discord (MQD) and the global quantum discord (GQD). MQD, with the same spirit as the complete monogamy of entanglement, is said to be completely monogamous (i) if it does not increase under coarsening of subsystems and (ii) if some given combination of subsystems reach the total amount of the correlation, then all other combination of subsystems that do not include all the given subsystems do not contain such a correlation any more. Here, coarsening of subsystems means discarding or combining some subsystems up to the given partition. Simultaneously, the complete monogamy of GQD is also defined with slight modification on the coarsening relation. Consequently, we explore all the coarsening relations of MQD and show that it is completely monogamous with a modicum assumption. In addition, with the same spirit, we investigate all the coarsening relations for GQD and show that GQD is not completely monogamous. That is, in the sense of the complete monogamy relation, MQD as a generalization of the original QD captures the nature of such a quantum correlation, and thus it is nicer than GQD as a generalization.

TI Scandium-based point defect in AlN for quantum information processing
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB Point defects in wide-band-gap semiconductors have emerged as leading qubit candidates for realizing quantum information processing. Due to the strong spatial localization of the wave functions, these defects can be described as artificial atoms or molecules in a solid-state matrix. Here we propose the positively charged scandium-nitrogen-vacancy defect (ScAlVN)+ in AlN as a potential quantum memory, similar to the ST1 center in diamond, based on hybrid density functional theory calculations. ScAlVN is stable in the positive charge state over a wide range of Fermi-level positions, where it possesses a singlet ground state and triplet shelving state. By comparing with VN+, we elucidate the role of Sc in redshifting the emission energy and enhancing the intersystem crossing via increased spin-orbit coupling. Nuclear spins in the vicinity of (ScAlVN)+ may be used as a resource to store the quantum information. We outline an optical spin manipulation protocol for (ScAlVN)+ and discuss its utility as a solid-state qubit.

TI Fault-Tolerant Continuous-Variable Measurement-based Quantum Computation
   Architecture
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Continuous-variable measurement-based quantum computation on cluster states has in recent years shown great potential for scalable, universal, and fault-tolerant quantum computation when combined with the Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) code and quantum error correction. However, no complete fault-tolerant architecture exists that includes everything from cluster-state generation with finite squeezing to gate implementations with realistic noise and error correction. In this work, we propose a simple architecture for the preparation of a cluster state in three dimensions in which gates can be efficiently implemented by gate teleportation. To accommodate scalability, we propose architectures that allow both spatial and temporal multiplexing, with the temporally encoded version requiring as little as two squeezed light sources. Because of its three-dimensional structure, the architecture supports topological qubit error correction, while GKP error correction is efficiently realized within the architecture by teleportation. To validate fault tolerance, the architecture is simulated using surface-GKP codes, including noise from GKP states as well as gate noise caused by finite squeezing in the cluster state. We find a fault-tolerant squeezing threshold of 12.7 dB, with room for further improvement.

TI Design of quasi-phase-matching nonlinear crystals based on quantum

SO FRONTIERS IN PHYSICS
AB Quasi-phase-matching (QPM) makes it possible to design domain engineered nonlinear crystals for highly efficient and multitasking nonlinear frequency conversion. However, finding the optimal crystal domain arrangement in a meaningful time is very challenging sometimes impossible by classical computing. In this paper, we proposed a quantum annealing computing method and used D-Wave superconducting quantum computer to design aperiodically poled lithium niobate (APPLN) for coupled third harmonic generation (CTHG). We converted the optical transformation efficiency function to an Ising model which can be solved by D-Wave quantum computer. The crystal design results were simulated by using nonlinear envelope equation (NEE), which showed very similar conversion efficiencies to the crystals designed by using simulated annealing (SA) method, demonstrating that quantum annealing computing is a powerful method for QPM crystal design.

TI Simulating the dynamics of braiding of Majorana zero modes using an IBM
   quantum computer
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB We preform dynamic state evolution on an IBM quantum computer using a simulation of braiding Majorana zero modes as a benchmark for success. We find the native quantum gates introduce too much noise to observe braiding. Instead, we use Qiskit Pulse to develop scaled 2-qubit quantum gates that better match the unitary time evolution operator and enable us to observe braiding. This paper demonstrates that quantum computers can be used for simulation, and highlights the use of pulse-level control for programming quantum computers and constitutes the first experimental evidence of braiding via dynamical Hamiltonian evolution.

TI Quantum Zeno Dynamics of two interacting particles
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB According to quantum Zeno dynamics (QZD), the evolution of a quantum system can be restricted to a subspace of its Hilbert space by frequent measurements. A crucial question in QZD of a particle's position is: how short the time interval between successive measurements should be, in order to confine the particle in its initial spatial region? To address this question, we consider a toy model with two ions initially known to be, for simplicity, in a one-dimensional spatial region. By simulating the evolution of this two-body quantum system, we estimate the measurement frequency needed to keep the ions within their initial confined region at a desired confidence level. Two key parameters we employ in our calculations are the Zeno time and the leakage probability of the quantum system. The measurement frequencies are calculated and compared when ions are located initially at different spatial regions. For our simulation, we introduce the Python code 2IonQZD.

TI Using Variational Quantum Algorithm to Solve the LWE Problem
SO ENTROPY
AB The variational quantum algorithm (VQA) is a hybrid classical-quantum algorithm. It can actually run in an intermediate-scale quantum device where the number of available qubits is too limited to perform quantum error correction, so it is one of the most promising quantum algorithms in the noisy intermediate-scale quantum era. In this paper, two ideas for solving the learning with errors problem (LWE) using VQA are proposed. First, after reducing the LWE problem into the bounded distance decoding problem, the quantum approximation optimization algorithm (QAOA) is introduced to improve classical methods. Second, after the LWE problem is reduced into the unique shortest vector problem, the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) is used to solve it, and the number of qubits required is calculated in detail. Small-scale experiments are carried out for the two LWE variational quantum algorithms, and the experiments show that VQA improves the quality of the classical solutions.

TI Quantum color image watermarking scheme based on quantum error
   correction coding
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB Quantum image processing, which merges classical image processing techniques with quantum computing, provides exceptional storage capacity and unparalleled parallel computing power. In this study, we present a quantum color image watermarking scheme that employs quantum error correction codes to address issues such as pixel loss and image distortion during watermark embedding and extraction. By utilizing the least significant bit method to embed the color values of the watermark image into those of the carrier image, we improve the scheme's robustness. We also address the error correction capabilities of channel coding for phase-flip errors and follow the majority principle, resulting in more accurate extraction of the watermark image's color and enhancing the watermarking scheme's reliability and integrity. Our experimental simulations demonstrate that the proposed watermarking scheme boasts high security, strong robustness, and excellent concealment.

TI Experimental Implementation of Universal Holonomic Quantum Computation
   on Solid-State Spins with Optimal Control
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB Experimental realization of a universal set of quantum logic gates with high fidelity is critical to quantum-information processing, which is always challenging due to the inevitable interaction between the quantum system and environment. Geometric quantum computation is noise immune, and thus, offers a robust way to enhance control fidelity. Here, we experimentally implement the recently proposed extensible nonadiabatic holonomic quantum computation with solid spins in diamond at room temperature, which maintains both flexibility and resilience against decoherence and system-control errors. Compared with the previous geometric method, the fidelities of a universal set of holonomic single-qubit and two-qubit quantum logic gates are improved in experiments. Therefore, this work makes a step towards high-fidelity quantum-information processing based on extensible nonadiabatic holonomic quantum computation in realistic systems.

TI Atmospheric Neutron-Induced Fault Generation and Propagation in Quantum
   Bits and Quantum Circuits
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NUCLEAR SCIENCE
AB Quantum computing (QC), by exploiting the quantum properties of quantum bits (qubits), significantly improves the performance and efficiency of computation. Unfortunately, quantum devices are very susceptible to external perturbation, including natural radiation. In this article, we measure, through GEANT4 simulations, the charge deposited by impinging neutrons in superconducting quantum devices. As we show, most atmospheric neutrons deposit sufficient energy to break the Cooper pairs and, thus, can potentially modify the qubit state. Then, with a dedicated circuit-level fault injector, we track the transient fault propagation in real quantum circuits and measure its impact on the output probabilities distribution. We discuss the fault model for qubits and show how to measure faults' impact on the circuit output.

TI Topological quantum computation on supersymmetric spin chains
SO JOURNAL OF HIGH ENERGY PHYSICS
AB Quantum gates built out of braid group elements form the building blocks of topological quantum computation. They have been extensively studied in SU(2)(k) quantum group theories, a rich source of examples of non-Abelian anyons such as the Ising (k = 2), Fibonacci (k = 3) and Jones-Kauffman (k = 4) anyons. We show that the fusion spaces of these anyonic systems can be precisely mapped to the product state zero modes of certain Nicolai-like supersymmetric spin chains. As a result, we can realize the braid group in terms of the product state zero modes of these supersymmetric systems. These operators kill all the other states in the Hilbert space, thus preventing the occurrence of errors while processing information, making them suitable for quantum computing.

AB Finding the ground state of the Ising model is an important problem in condensed matter physics. Its applications spread far beyond physic due to its deep relation to various combinatorial optimization problems, such as travelling salesman or protein folding. Sophisticated new methods for solving Ising instances rely on quantum annealing, which is a paradigm of quantum computation. However, commercially available quantum annealers are still prone to errors, and their ability to find low energetic states is limited. This naturally calls for a post-processing procedure to correct errors. As a proof-of-concept, this work combines the recent ideas revolving around the DIRAC architecture with the Chimera topology and applies them in a real-world setting as an error-correcting scheme for D-Wave quantum annealers. Our preliminary results show how to correct states output by quantum annealers using reinforcement learning. Our approach exhibits excellent scalability, as it can be trained on small instances. However, its performance on the Chimera graphs is still inferior to Monte Carlo methods.

TI Analytical Methods for High-Rate Global Quantum Networks
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB The development of a future global quantum communication network (or quantum Internet) will enable high-rate private communication and entanglement distribution over very long distances. However, the large-scale performance of ground-based quantum networks (which employ photons as information carriers through optical fibers) is fundamentally limited by fiber quality and link length, with the latter being a primary design factor for practical network architectures. While these fundamental limits are well established for arbitrary network topologies, the question of how to best design global architectures remains open. In this work, we introduce a large-scale quantum network model called weakly regular architectures. Such networks are capable of idealizing network connectivity, provide freedom to capture a broad class of spatial topologies, and remain analytically treatable. This allows us to investigate the effectiveness of large-scale networks with consistent connective properties and unveil critical conditions under which end-to-end rates remain optimal. Furthermore, through a strict performance comparison of ideal ground-based quantum networks with that of realistic satellite quantum communication protocols, we establish conditions for which satellites can be used to outperform fiber-based quantum infrastructure, rigorously proving the efficacy of satellite-based technologies for global quantum communications.

TI Exploiting the Extended Neighborhood of Hexagonal Qubit Architecture for
   Mapping Quantum Circuits
SO ACM JOURNAL ON EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES IN COMPUTING SYSTEMS
AB In this work mapping of quantum circuits to regular hexagonal grid with coupling degree of six has been investigated. Architectures involving superconducting qubits impose restrictions on 2-qubit gate operations to be carried out only between physically coupled qubits, also referred to as nearest-neighbor (NN) constraint. The noise introduced by the 2-qubit gates and the execution time greatly affect the computational reliability. Existing mapping techniques suffer either from the adopted approach to reduce gate overhead or from their inability to take advantage of such architectural regularity. We outlined three different qubit mapping approaches using Remote-CNOT templates, Swap gates and combination of both. We show the benefits of assigning the Cartesian coordinate system in hexagonal grid for runtime elevation and devised approaches for reduction in gate overheads. While the template-based approach gives a strict upper bound of additional gate overheads for a particular qubit mapping, the combined approach provides better result employing a larger lookahead window. Experiments on benchmark quantum circuits confirm that the proposed Swap-based method provides an average 25% improvement in gate overheads over a recent work and the combined approach contributes further 15% average improvement on the result at the expense of a little higher runtime.

TI Quantum Zeno repeaters
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Quantum repeaters pave the way for long-distance quantum communications and quantum Internet, and the idea of quantum repeaters is based on entanglement swapping which requires the implementation of controlled quantum gates. Frequently measuring a quantum system affects its dynamics which is known as the quantum Zeno effect (QZE). Beyond slowing down its evolution, QZE can be used to control the dynamics of a quantum system by introducing a carefully designed set of operations between measurements. Here, we propose an entanglement swapping protocol based on QZE, which achieves almost unit fidelity. Implementation of our protocol requires only simple frequent threshold measurements and single particle rotations. We extend the proposed entanglement swapping protocol to a series of repeater stations for constructing quantum Zeno repeaters which also achieve almost unit fidelity regardless of the number of repeaters. Requiring no controlled gates, our proposal reduces the quantum circuit complexity of quantum repeaters. Our work has potential to contribute to long distance quantum communications and quantum computing via quantum Zeno effect.

TI Quantum machine learning with Adaptive Boson Sampling via post-selection
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB The implementation of large-scale universal quantum computation represents a challenging and ambitious task on the road to quantum processing of information. In recent years, an intermediate approach has been pursued to demonstrate quantum computational advantage via non-universal computational models. A relevant example for photonic platforms has been provided by the Boson Sampling paradigm and its variants, which are known to be computationally hard while requiring at the same time only the manipulation of the generated photonic resources via linear optics and detection. Beside quantum computational advantage demonstrations, a promising direction towards possibly useful applications can be found in the field of quantum machine learning, considering the currently almost unexplored intermediate scenario between non-adaptive linear optics and universal photonic quantum computation. Here, we report the experimental implementation of quantum machine learning protocols by adding adaptivity via post-selection to a Boson Sampling platform based on universal programmable photonic circuits fabricated via femtosecond laser writing. Our experimental results demonstrate that Adaptive Boson Sampling is a viable route towards dimension-enhanced quantum machine learning with linear optical devices.

TI Edge modes, extended TQFT, and measurement based quantum computation
SO JOURNAL OF HIGH ENERGY PHYSICS
AB Quantum teleportation can be used to define a notion of parallel transport which characterizes the entanglement structure of a quantum state [1]. This suggests one can formulate a gauge theory of entanglement. In [2], it was explained that measurement based quantum computation in one dimension can be understood in term of such a gauge theory (MBQC). In this work, we give an alternative formulation of this "entanglement gauge theory" as an extended topological field theory. This formulation gives a alternative perspective on the relation between the circuit model and MBQC. In addition, it provides an interpretation of MBQC in terms of the extended Hilbert space construction in gauge theories, in which the entanglement edge modes play the role of the logical qubit.

TI A Molecular Approach to Quantum Sensing
SO ACS CENTRAL SCIENCE
AB The second quantum revolution hinges on the creation of materials that unite atomic structural precision with electronic and structural tunability. A molecular approach to quantum information science (QIS) promises to enable the bottom-up creation of quantum systems. Within the broad reach of QIS, which spans fields ranging from quantum computation to quantum communication, we will focus on quantum sensing. Quantum sensing harnesses quantum control to interrogate the world around us. A broadly applicable class of quantum sensors would feature adaptable environmental compatibility, control over distance from the target analyte, and a tunable energy range of interaction. Molecules enable customizable "designer" quantum sensors with tunable functionality and compatibility across a range of environments. These capabilities offer the potential to bring unmatched sensitivity and spatial resolution to address a wide range of sensing tasks from the characterization of dynamic biological processes to the detection of emergent phenomena in condensed matter. In this Outlook, we outline the concepts and design criteria central to quantum sensors and look toward the next generation of designer quantum sensors based on new classes of molecular sensors.

TI Optomechanical Microwave-to-Optical Photon Transducer Chips: Empowering
   the Quantum Internet Revolution
SO MICROMACHINES
AB The first quantum revolution has brought us the classical Internet and information technology. Today, as technology advances rapidly, the second quantum revolution quietly arrives, with a crucial moment for quantum technology to establish large-scale quantum networks. However, solid-state quantum bits (such as superconducting and semiconductor qubits) typically operate in the microwave frequency range, making it challenging to transmit signals over long distances. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop quantum transducer chips capable of converting microwaves into optical photons in the communication band, since the thermal noise of optical photons at room temperature is negligible, rendering them an ideal information carrier for large-scale spatial communication. Such devices are important for connecting different physical platforms and efficiently transmitting quantum information. This paper focuses on the fast-developing field of optomechanical quantum transducers, which has flourished over the past decade, yielding numerous advanced achievements. We categorize transducers based on various mechanical resonators and discuss their principles of operation and their achievements. Based on existing research on optomechanical transducers, we compare the parameters of several mechanical resonators and analyze their advantages and limitations, as well as provide prospects for the future development of quantum transducers.

TI From Entanglement to Universality: A Multiparticle Spacetime Algebra
   Approach to Quantum Computational Gates Revisited
SO SYMMETRY-BASEL
AB Alternative mathematical explorations in quantum computing can be of great scientific interest, especially if they come with penetrating physical insights. In this paper, we present a critical revisitation of our application of geometric (Clifford) algebras (GAs) in quantum computing as originally presented in [C. Cafaro and S. Mancini, Adv. Appl. Clifford Algebras 21, 493 (2011)]. Our focus is on testing the usefulness of geometric algebras (GAs) techniques in two quantum computing applications. First, making use of the geometric algebra of a relativistic configuration space (namely multiparticle spacetime algebra or MSTA), we offer an explicit algebraic characterization of one- and two-qubit quantum states together with a MSTA description of one- and two-qubit quantum computational gates. In this first application, we devote special attention to the concept of entanglement, focusing on entangled quantum states and two-qubit entangling quantum gates. Second, exploiting the previously mentioned MSTA characterization together with the GA depiction of the Lie algebras SO3;R and SU2;C depending on the rotor group Spin+3,0 formalism, we focus our attention to the concept of universality in quantum computing by reevaluating Boykin's proof on the identification of a suitable set of universal quantum gates. At the end of our mathematical exploration, we arrive at two main conclusions. Firstly, the MSTA perspective leads to a powerful conceptual unification between quantum states and quantum operators. More specifically, the complex qubit space and the complex space of unitary operators acting on them merge in a single multivectorial real space. Secondly, the GA viewpoint on rotations based on the rotor group Spin+3,0 carries both conceptual and computational advantages compared to conventional vectorial and matricial methods.

TI Comparing planar quantum computing platforms at the quantum speed limit
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB An important aspect that strongly impacts the experimental feasibility of quantum circuits is the ratio of gate times and typical error time scales. Algorithms with circuit depths that significantly exceed the error time scales will result in faulty quantum states and error correction is inevitable. We present a comparison of the theoretical minimal gate time, i.e., the quantum speed limit (QSL), for realistic two- and multi-qubit gate implementations in neutral atoms and superconducting qubits. Subsequent to finding the QSLs for individual gates by means of optimal control theory we use them to quantify the circuit QSL of the quantum Fourier transform and the quantum approximate optimization algorithm. In particular, we analyze these quantum algorithms in terms of circuit run times and gate counts both in the standard gate model and the parity mapping. We find that neutral atom and superconducting qubit platforms show comparable weighted circuit QSLs with respect to the system size.

TI Topological order from measurements and feed-forward on a trapped ion
   quantum computer
SO COMMUNICATIONS PHYSICS
AB Quantum systems evolve in time in one of two ways: through the Schr & ouml;dinger equation or wavefunction collapse. So far, deterministic control of quantum many-body systems in the lab has focused on the former, due to the probabilistic nature of measurements. This imposes serious limitations: preparing long-range entangled states, for example, requires extensive circuit depth if restricted to unitary dynamics. In this work, we use mid-circuit measurement and feed-forward to implement deterministic non-unitary dynamics on Quantinuum's H1 programmable ion-trap quantum computer. Enabled by these capabilities, we demonstrate a constant-depth procedure for creating a toric code ground state in real-time. In addition to reaching high stabilizer fidelities, we create a non-Abelian defect whose presence is confirmed by transmuting anyons via braiding. This work clears the way towards creating complex topological orders in the lab and exploring deterministic non-unitary dynamics via measurement and feed-forward.
   Topological quantum states are essential resources in quantum error correction and quantum simulation but unitary quantum circuits for their preparation require extensive circuit depth. The authors demonstrate a constant-depth protocol to prepare topologically ordered states on a trapped-ion quantum computer using non-unitary operations.

TI Solving the resource constrained project scheduling problem with quantum
   annealing
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Quantum annealing emerges as a promising approach for tackling complex scheduling problems such as the resource-constrained project scheduling problem (RCPSP). This study represents the first application of quantum annealing to solve the RCPSP, analyzing 12 well-known mixed integer linear programming (MILP) formulations and converting the most qubit-efficient one into a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) model. We then solve this model using the D-wave advantage 6.3 quantum annealer, comparing its performance against classical computer solvers. Our results indicate significant potential, particularly for small to medium-sized instances. Further, we introduce time-to-target and Atos Q-score metrics to evaluate the effectiveness of quantum annealing and reverse quantum annealing. The paper also explores advanced quantum optimization techniques, such as customized anneal schedules, enhancing our understanding and application of quantum computing in operations research.

TI The Quantum Path Kernel: A Generalized Neural Tangent Kernel for Deep
   Quantum Machine Learning
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM ENGINEERING
AB Building a quantum analog of classical deep neural networks represents a fundamental challenge in quantum computing. A key issue is how to address the inherent nonlinearity of classical deep learning, a problem in the quantum domain due to the fact that the composition of an arbitrary number of quantum gates, consisting of a series of sequential unitary transformations, is intrinsically linear. This problem has been variously approached in literature, principally via the introduction of measurements between layers of unitary transformations. In this article, we introduce the quantum path kernel (QPK), a formulation of quantum machine learning capable of replicating those aspects of deep machine learning typically associated with superior generalization performance in the classical domain, specifically, hierarchical feature learning. Our approach generalizes the notion of quantum neural tangent kernel, which has been used to study the dynamics of classical and quantum machine learning models. The QPK exploits the parameter trajectory, i.e., the curve delineated by model parameters as they evolve during training, enabling the representation of differential layerwise convergence behaviors, or the formation of hierarchical parametric dependencies, in terms of their manifestation in the gradient space of the predictor function. We evaluate our approach with respect to variants of the classification of Gaussian xor mixtures: an artificial but emblematic problem that intrinsically requires multilevel learning in order to achieve optimal class separation.

TI Verification of Distributed Quantum Programs
SO ACM TRANSACTIONS ON COMPUTATIONAL LOGIC
AB Distributed quantum systems and especially the Quantum Internet have the ever-increasing potential to fully demonstrate the power of quantum computation. This is particularly true given that developing a general-purpose quantum computer is much more difficult than connecting many small quantum devices. One major challenge of implementing distributed quantum systems is programming them and verifying their correctness. In this paper, we propose a CSP-like distributed programming language to facilitate the specification and verification of such systems. After presenting its operational and denotational semantics, we develop a Hoare-style logic for distributed quantum programs and establish its soundness and (relative) completeness with respect to both partial and total correctness. The effectiveness of the logic is demonstrated by its applications in the verification of quantum teleportation and local implementation of non-local CNOT gates, two important algorithms widely used in distributed quantum systems.

Applied to present-day experimental parameters for superconducting circuit qubits and diamond silicon-vacancy centers in an optimized phononic cavity, we estimate quantum state transduction with fidelity exceeding 99% at a MHz-scale bandwidth. By combining the complementary strengths of superconducting circuit quantum computing and artificial atoms, the hybrid architecture provides high-fidelity qubit gates with long-lived quantum memory, high-fidelity measurement, large qubit number, reconfigurable qubit connectivity, and high-fidelity state and gate teleportation through optical quantum networks.

TI VaR Estimation with Quantum Computing Noise Correction Using Neural
   Networks
SO MATHEMATICS
AB In this paper, we present the development of a quantum computing method for calculating the value at risk (VaR) for a portfolio of assets managed by a finance institution. We extend the conventional Monte Carlo algorithm to calculate the VaR of an arbitrary number of assets by employing random variable algebra and Taylor series approximation. The resulting algorithm is suitable to be executed in real quantum computers. However, the noise affecting current quantum computers renders them almost useless for the task. We present a methodology to mitigate the noise impact by using neural networks to compensate for the noise effects. The system combines the output from a real quantum computer with the neural network processing. The feedback is used to fine tune the quantum circuits. The results show that this approach is useful for estimating the VaR in finance institutions, particularly when dealing with a large number of assets. We demonstrate the validity of the proposed method with up to 139 assets. The accuracy of the method is also proven. We achieved an error of less than 1% in the empirical measurements with respect to the parametric model.

TI Exploring Quantum Machine Learning for Enhanced Skin Lesion
   Classification: A Comparative Study of Implementation Methods
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Skin diseases affect millions of people worldwide, leading to significant healthcare burdens and challenges in diagnosis and treatment. In the past few years, machine learning techniques have demonstrated potential in assisting dermatologists with diagnosing various skin conditions. As in, conventional machine learning algorithms might encounter challenges in handling the complexity and distinction of skin disease classification tasks, primarily because of the intricate nature of medical image data with its high dimensional properties. In this work, the main analysis is done based on exploring quantum machine learning models for skin disease classification. This approach blends with the aspects of quantum computing with the conventional machine learning techniques to push the boundaries of skin disease classification. This work harnesses the HAM10000 dataset, an extensive compilation of categorized images portraying common skin lesions, to train and assess the efficacy of the proposed methodologies. Quantum computing libraries such as PennyLane and Qiskit is used in this study. Using different combination of qubit rotation encoding and decoding using three types of Pauli gates such as Pauli X, Y and Z gates are implemented and compared using proposed Quanvolutional neural network. Features extracted using MobileNet pre-trained network is used to build Quantum support vector classifier. These quantum machine learning models are compared with some well-known pre-trained models such as Resnet50, Inception-Resnet, Densenet121, DenseNet201 and MobileNet. The combination of RY qubit rotation and PauliZ gate in quantum convolution layer in Quanvolutional neural network produced the optimal classification accuracy of 82.86% more than any other models included in this study. In contrast, Quantum Support Vector Classifier produced similar classification accuracy of 72.5% with respect to pre-trained models.

TI Scalable interconnection using a superconducting flux qubit
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Superconducting quantum computers are rapidly reaching scales where bottlenecks to scaling arise from the practical aspects of the fabrication process. To improve quantum computer performance, implementation technology that guarantees the scalability of the number of qubits is essential. Increasing the degrees of freedom in routing by 2.5-dimensional implementation is important for realizing circuit scalability. We report an implementation technology to overcome the scaling bottlenecks using a reliable connection qubit with a demonstration of quantum annealing. The method comprises interconnection based on quantum annealing using a superconducting flux qubit, precise coupling status control, and flip-chip bonding. We perform experiments and simulations with a proof-of-concept demonstration of qubit coupling via interconnection using a flux qubit. The coupling status is strictly controllable by quantum annealing. A low-temperature flip-chip bonding technology is introduced for the 2.5-dimensional interconnection. The superconducting flux qubit, formed across two different chips via bumps, is demonstrated for the first time to show a state transition like that in a conventional qubit. The quantum annealing flux qubit and flip-chip bonding enable new interconnections between qubits. A perspective on the possibility of applying this technology to the connection between gate-type qubits is described.

TI On the Applicability of Quantum Machine Learning
SO ENTROPY
AB In this article, we investigate the applicability of quantum machine learning for classification tasks using two quantum classifiers from the Qiskit Python environment: the variational quantum circuit and the quantum kernel estimator (QKE). We provide a first evaluation on the performance of these classifiers when using a hyperparameter search on six widely known and publicly available benchmark datasets and analyze how their performance varies with the number of samples on two artificially generated test classification datasets. As quantum machine learning is based on unitary transformations, this paper explores data structures and application fields that could be particularly suitable for quantum advantages. Hereby, this paper introduces a novel dataset based on concepts from quantum mechanics using the exponential map of a Lie algebra. This dataset will be made publicly available and contributes a novel contribution to the empirical evaluation of quantum supremacy. We further compared the performance of VQC and QKE on six widely applicable datasets to contextualize our results. Our results demonstrate that the VQC and QKE perform better than basic machine learning algorithms, such as advanced linear regression models (Ridge and Lasso). They do not match the accuracy and runtime performance of sophisticated modern boosting classifiers such as XGBoost, LightGBM, or CatBoost. Therefore, we conclude that while quantum machine learning algorithms have the potential to surpass classical machine learning methods in the future, especially when physical quantum infrastructure becomes widely available, they currently lag behind classical approaches. Our investigations also show that classical machine learning approaches have superior performance classifying datasets based on group structures, compared to quantum approaches that particularly use unitary processes. Furthermore, our findings highlight the significant impact of different quantum simulators, feature maps, and quantum circuits on the performance of the employed quantum estimators. This observation emphasizes the need for researchers to provide detailed explanations of their hyperparameter choices for quantum machine learning algorithms, as this aspect is currently overlooked in many studies within the field. To facilitate further research in this area and ensure the transparency of our study, we have made the complete code available in a linked GitHub repository.

TI Scalable error mitigation for noisy quantum circuits produces
   competitive expectation values
SO NATURE PHYSICS
AB Noise in existing quantum processors only enables an approximation to ideal quantum computation. However, for the computation of expectation values, these approximations can be improved by error mitigation. This has been experimentally demonstrated in small systems but the scaling of these methods to larger circuit volumes remains unknown. Here we demonstrate the utility of zero-noise extrapolation for practically relevant quantum circuits using up to 26 qubits, circuit depths of 120 and 1,080 CNOT gates. We study the scaling of the method for canonical examples of product states and entangling Clifford circuits of increasing size, and extend it to simulating the quench dynamics of two-dimensional Ising spin lattices with varying couplings. These experiments reveal that the accuracy of physically relevant observables after error mitigation substantially exceeds previously expected values. Furthermore, we show that the efficacy of error mitigation is greatly enhanced by additional error suppression techniques and native gate decomposition that reduce the circuit time. By combining these methods, the accuracy of our quantum simulation surpasses the classical approximations obtained from an established tensor network method. These results establish the potential of a useful quantum advantage using noisy, digital quantum processors.
   A technique called error mitigation can significantly improve the performance of large-scale quantum computations on near-term devices without the significant resource overheard of fault-tolerant quantum error correction.

TI Generalization in Quantum Machine Learning: A Quantum Information
   Standpoint
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Quantum classification and hypothesis testing (state and channel discrimination) are two tightly related subjects, the main difference being that the former is data driven: how to assign to quantum states rho(x) the corresponding class c (or hypothesis) is learnt from examples during training, where x can be either tunable experimental parameters or classical data "embedded" into quantum states. Does the model generalize? This is the main question in any data-driven strategy, namely the ability to predict the correct class even of previously unseen states. Here we establish a link between quantum classification and quantum information theory, by showing that the accuracy and generalization capability of quantum classifiers depend on the (Renyi) mutual information I (C:Q) and I-2(X:Q) between the quantum state space Q and the classical parameter space X or class space C. Based on the above characterization, we then show how different properties of Q affect classification accuracy and generalization, such as the dimension of the Hilbert space, the amount of noise, and the amount of neglected information from X via, e.g., pooling layers. Moreover, we introduce a quantum version of the information bottleneck principle that allows us to explore the various trade-offs between accuracy and generalization. Finally, in order to check our theoretical predictions, we study the classification of the quantum phases of an Ising spin chain, and we propose the variational quantum information bottleneck method to optimize quantum embeddings of classical data to favor generalization.

TI Energy and power scaling in quantum computers based on rotated surface
   codes with silicon flip-flop qubits
SO EPJ QUANTUM TECHNOLOGY
AB Scalable solutions are essential to achieving the long-term goal of building a fault-tolerant quantum computer and energy-power consumption are fundamental limiting factors for this target. Among the available types of silicon qubits, this work focuses on Flip-Flop (FF) qubits. Energy consumption and power requirements are estimated for a square array of qubits that hosts the logical qubit. The logical qubit is implemented using the rotated Surface Code (SC) for Quantum Error Correction (QEC). By using a universal set of quantum gates, the energy usage, time and power requirements for a SC cycle are estimated based on noise level, code distance and control levels. These estimates are used to provide insights into the main scaling-up challenges for quantum computer development. This is achieved by extending a thermal model that includes energy contributions from both the cryogenic components (such as the qubit array, the cryogenic control electronics, and the cryostat) and the room temperature (RT) section (RT electronics and heat dissipation systems). The maximum numbers of physical and logical qubits are provided, as well as power consumption across the different temperature sections.

TI Heralded optical entanglement distribution via lossy quantum channels: a
   comparative study
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Quantum entanglement serves as a foundational resource for various quantum technologies. In optical systems, entanglement distribution relies on the indistinguishability and spatial overlap of photons. Heralded schemes play a crucial role in ensuring the reliability of entanglement generation by detecting ancillary photons to signal the creation of desired entangled states. However, photon losses in quantum channels remain a significant challenge, limiting the distance and capacity of entanglement distributions. This study suggests three heralded schemes for distributing multipartite Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) states via lossy quantum channels. These schemes differ both qualitatively in their network architecture (centralized or decentralized) and photon source requirements (Bell states or single-photons), and quantitatively in their success probabilities and heralding efficiency. Through comprehensive analysis incorporating both practical implementation considerations and theoretical performance metrics, we find that each scheme offers distinct advantages depending on the number of parties, channel distance, and security requirements. The decentralized scheme proves particularly advantageous for networks requiring balanced information distribution, while centralized schemes may offer better performance for smaller networks. This analysis provides insights into designing resilient heralded circuits for quantum information processing over lossy channels, considering both architectural constraints and performance requirements.

TI Er:LiNbO3 Quantum Memory Platform Optimized with Dynamic
   Defect Annealing
SO ADVANCED OPTICAL MATERIALS
AB Lithium niobate (LiNbO3) exhibits poor radiation resistance when conventionally implanted with Er at room temperature. To repair the structural disorder, high-temperature post-implantation anneals are typically required; however, such treatments can cause sample cracking and dopant redistribution, which are incompatible with device applications. The optimized approach is proposed by performing implants at elevated but acceptably low temperatures to in situ minimize the structural defects generated in the collision cascades, via so-called "dynamic defect annealing". Thus, a gradual increase in Er optical activity is shown as a function of irradiation temperature in the range of 25-450 degrees C, in striking correlation with a decreasing trend for the residual disorder. The impact of moderate post-implantation anneals is also investigated by comparing the results of anneals of samples implanted at 25 degrees C and 450 degrees C. This comparison further confirms the higher optical activation of Er and lower residual structural disorder when the material is initially implanted at elevated temperatures. Based on these data, it is concluded that the use of dynamic defect annealing during the Er implantation of LiNbO3 is a promising strategy for optimizing it as a quantum memory platform, resolving otherwise inevitable trade-offs.

TI Efficient quantum broadcast for an arbitrary number of receivers in
   noisy channels
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS A-MATHEMATICAL AND THEORETICAL
AB Quantum broadcast is a method for distributing known quantum information to multiple recipients at once. Although the no-cloning theorem prohibits copying unknown quantum states, it is still possible to transmit the same known state to different destinations. This research introduces two new approaches. The first approach allows a sender to broadcast a single qubit to n receivers using a specialized entangled state known as a 2n-qubit cluster state. The paper illustrates this method with a detailed example for four receivers ( n=4) and demonstrates its validity through implementation on the Qiskit platform. The second protocol, builds upon the first protocol and allows for broadcasting a particular class of n-qubit state to n receivers. The effects of different quantum noise types on the protocol are investigated, with the fidelity metric used to quantify the quality of broadcasted states over a noisy quantum channel. These new protocols offer more efficient ways to share quantum information, potentially paving the way for improved quantum communication networks and internet.

TI Benchmarking Variants of the Adam Optimizer for Quantum Machine Learning
   Applications
SO IEEE OPEN JOURNAL OF THE COMPUTER SOCIETY
AB Quantum Machine Learning is gaining traction by leveraging quantum advantage to outperform classical Machine Learning. Many classical and quantum optimizers have been proposed to train Parameterized Quantum Circuits in the simulation environment, achieving high accuracy and fast convergence speed. However, to the best of our knowledge, currently there is no related work investigating these optimizers on multiple algorithms, which may lead to the selection of suboptimal optimizers. In this article, we first benchmark the most popular classical and quantum optimizers, such as Gradient Descent (GD), Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam), and Quantum Natural Gradient Descent (QNG), through the Quantum Compilation algorithm. Evaluated metrics include the lowest cost value and the wall time. The results indicate that Adam outperforms other optimizers in terms of convergence speed, cost value, and stability. Furthermore, we conduct additional experiments on multiple algorithms with Adam variants, demonstrating that the choice of hyperparameters significantly impacts the optimizer's performance.

TI Reducing hardware requirements for entanglement distribution via joint
   hardware-protocol optimization
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB We conduct a numerical investigation of fiber-based entanglement distribution over distances of up to 1600 km using a chain of processing-node quantum repeaters. We determine minimal hardware requirements while simultaneously optimizing over protocols for entanglement generation and entanglement purification, as well as over strategies for entanglement swapping. Notably, we discover that through an adequate choice of protocols the hardware improvement cost scales linearly with the distance covered. Our results highlight the crucial role of good protocol choices in significantly reducing hardware requirements, such as employing purification to meet high-fidelity targets and adopting a swap as soon as possible policy for faster rates. To carry out this analysis, we employ an extensive simulation framework implemented with NetSquid, a discrete-event-based quantum-network simulator, and a genetic-algorithm-based optimization methodology to determine minimal hardware requirements.

TI Remote Entanglement of Superconducting Qubits via Solid-State Spin
   Quantum
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB Quantum communication between remote superconducting systems is being studied intensively to increase the number of integrated superconducting qubits and to realize a distributed quantum computer. Since optical photons must be used for communication outside a dilution refrigerator, the direct conversion of microwave photons to optical photons has been widely investigated. However, the direct conversion approach suffers from added photon noise, heating due to a strong optical pump, and the requirement for large cooperativity. Instead, for quantum communication between superconducting qubits, we propose an entanglement distribution scheme using a solid-state spin quantum memory that works as an interface for both microwave and optical photons. The quantum memory enables quantum communication without significant heating inside the refrigerator, in contrast to schemes using high-power optical pumps. Moreover, introducing the quantum memory naturally makes it possible to herald entanglement and parallelization using multiple memories.

CY JUL 15-19, 2024
CL Buenos Aires, ARGENTINA
AB Quantum computing and AI have found a fruitful intersection in the field of natural language processing. We focus on the recently proposed DisCoCirc framework for natural language, and propose a quantum adaptation, QDisCoCirc. This is motivated by a compositional approach to rendering AI interpretable: the behavior of the whole can be understood in terms of the behavior of parts, and the way they are put together. For the model-native primitive operation of text similarity, we derive quantum algorithms for fault-tolerant quantum computers to solve the task of question-answering within QDisCoCirc, and show that this is BQP-hard; note that we do not consider the complexity of question-answering in other natural language processing models. Assuming widely-held conjectures, implementing the proposed model classically would require super-polynomial resources. Therefore, it could provide a meaningful demonstration of the power of practical quantum processors. The model construction builds on previous work in compositional quantum natural language processing. Word embeddings are encoded as parameterized quantum circuits, and compositionality here means that the quantum circuits compose according to the linguistic structure of the text. We outline a method for evaluating the model on near-term quantum processors, and elsewhere we report on a recent implementation of this on quantum hardware. In addition, we adapt a quantum algorithm for the closest vector problem to obtain a Groverlike speedup in the fault-tolerant regime for our model. This provides an unconditional quadratic speedup over any classical algorithm in certain circumstances, which we will verify empirically in future work.

AB The increasing capabilities of quantum computing hardware and the challenge of realizing deep quantum circuits require fully automated and efficient tools for compiling quantum circuits. To express arbitrary circuits in a sequence of native gates specific to the quantum computer architecture, it is necessary to make algorithms portable across the landscape of quantum hardware providers. In this work, we present a compiler capable of transforming and optimizing a quantum circuit targeting a shuttling-based trapped-ion quantum processor. It consists of custom algorithms set on top of the quantum circuit framework Pytket. The performance was evaluated for a wide range of quantum circuits and the results show that the gate counts can be reduced by factors up to 5.1 compared to standard Pytket and up to 2.2 compared to standard Qiskit compilation.

TI Quantum annealing with twisted fields
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB Quantum annealing (QA) is a promising method for solving combinational optimization problems and performing quantum chemical calculations. The main sources of errors in QA are the effects of decoherence and non-adiabatic transition. We propose a method for suppressing both these effects using inhomogeneous twist operators corresponding to the twist angles of transverse fields applied to qubits. Furthermore, we adopt variational methods to determine the optimal inhomogeneous twist operator for minimizing the energy of the state after QA. Our approach is useful for increasing the energy gap and/or making the quantum states robust against decoherence during QA. In summary, our results can pave the way to a new approach for realizing practical QA.

AB Verifying equivalence between two quantum circuits is a hard problem, that is nonetheless crucial in compiling and optimizing quantum algorithms for real-world devices. This paper gives a Turing reduction of the (universal) quantum circuits equivalence problem to weighted model counting (WMC). Our starting point is a folklore theorem showing that equivalence checking of quantum circuits can be done in the so-called Pauli-basis. We combine this insight with a WMC encoding of quantum circuit simulation, which we extend with support for the Toffoli gate. Finally, we prove that the weights computed by the model counter indeed realize the reduction. With an open-source implementation, we demonstrate that this novel approach can outperform a state-of-the-art equivalence-checking tool based on ZX calculus and decision diagrams.

TI ZX graphical calculus for continuous-variable quantum processes
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Continuous-variable (CV) quantum information processing is a promising candidate for large-scale faulttolerant quantum computation. However, analysis of CV quantum process relies mostly on direct computation of the evolution of operators in the Heisenberg picture, and the features of CV space has yet to be thoroughly investigated in an intuitive manner. One key ingredient for further exploration of CV quantum computing is the construction of a computational model that brings visual intuition and new tools for the analysis of quantum protocols, especially non-Gaussian processes. In this paper, we delve into a graphical computational model, inspired by a similar model for qubit-based systems called the ZX calculus, which enables the representation of arbitrary CV quantum process as a simple directed graph. We demonstrate the utility of our model as a graphical tool to comprehend CV processes intuitively by showing how equivalences between two distinct quantum processes can be proven as a sequence of diagrammatic transformations for various quantum protocols. We also examine possible applications of our model, such as measurement-based quantum computing, characterization of Gaussian and non-Gaussian processes, and circuit optimization.

TI Reducing the Depth of Linear Reversible Quantum Circuits
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM ENGINEERING
AB In quantum computing the decoherence time of the qubits determines the computation time available, and this time is very limitedwhen using current hardware. In this article, weminimize the execution time (the depth) for a class of circuits referred to as linear reversible circuits, which has many applications in quantum computing (e.g., stabilizer circuits, "CNOT+T" circuits, etc.). We propose a practical formulation of a divide-and-conquer algorithm that produces quantum circuits that are twice as shallow as those produced by existing algorithms. We improve the theoretical upper bound of the depth in the worst case for some range of qubits. We also propose greedy algorithms based on cost minimization to find more optimal circuits for small or simple operators. Overall, we manage to consistently reduce the total depth of a class of reversible functions, with up to 92% savings in an ancilla-free case and up to 99% when ancillary qubits are available.

TI Quantum Error Correction Via Noise Guessing Decoding
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Quantum error correction codes (QECCs) play a central role in both quantum communications and quantum computation. Practical quantum error correction codes, such as stabilizer codes, are generally structured to suit a specific use, and present rigid code lengths and code rates. This paper shows that it is possible to both construct and decode QECCs that can attain the maximum performance of the finite blocklength regime, for any chosen code length when the code rate is sufficiently high. A recently proposed strategy for decoding classical codes called GRAND (guessing random additive noise decoding) opened doors to efficiently decode classical random linear codes (RLCs) performing near the maximum rate of the finite blocklength regime. By using noise statistics, GRAND is a noise-centric efficient universal decoder for classical codes, provided that a simple code membership test exists. These conditions are particularly suitable for quantum systems, and therefore the paper extends these concepts to quantum random linear codes (QRLCs), which were known to be possible to construct but whose decoding was not yet feasible. By combining QRLCs and a newly proposed quantum-GRAND, this work shows that it is possible to decode QECCs that are easy to adapt to changing conditions. The paper starts by assessing the minimum number of gates in the coding circuit needed to reach the QRLCs' asymptotic performance, and subsequently proposes a quantum-GRAND algorithm that makes use of quantum noise statistics, not only to build an adaptive code membership test, but also to efficiently implement syndrome decoding

TI Realization of a crosstalk-avoided quantum network node using dual-type
   qubits of the same ion species
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Generating ion-photon entanglement is a crucial step for scalable trapped-ion quantum networks. To avoid the crosstalk on memory qubits carrying quantum information, it is common to use a different ion species for ion-photon entanglement generation such that the scattered photons are far off-resonant for the memory qubits. However, such a dual-species scheme can be subject to inefficient sympathetic cooling due to the mass mismatch of the ions. Here we demonstrate a trapped-ion quantum network node in the dual-type qubit scheme where two types of qubits are encoded in the S and F hyperfine structure levels of 171Yb+ ions. We generate ion photon entanglement for the S-qubit in a typical timescale of hundreds of milliseconds, and verify its small crosstalk on a nearby F-qubit with coherence time above seconds. Our work demonstrates an enabling function of the dual-type qubit scheme for scalable quantum networks.
   In ion-photon quantum network platforms, usually memory qubits and communication qubits are encoded in ions of different species. Here, instead, the authors show how to realise ion-photon entanglement within the same-species-dual-encoding scheme.

TI Data-driven decoding of quantum error correcting codes using graph
   neural networks
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB To leverage the full potential of quantum error-correcting stabilizer codes it is crucial to have an efficient and accurate decoder. Accurate, maximum likelihood, decoders are computationally very expensive whereas decoders based on more efficient algorithms give sub-optimal performance. In addition, the accuracy will depend on the quality of models and estimates of error rates for idling qubits, gates, measurements, and resets, and will typically assume symmetric error channels. In this work, we explore a model-free, data-driven, approach to decoding, using a graph neural network (GNN). The decoding problem is formulated as a graph classification task in which a set of stabilizer measurements is mapped to an annotated detector graph for which the neural network predicts the most likely logical error class. We show that the GNN-based decoder can outperform a matching decoder for circuit level noise on the surface code given only the simulated data, while the matching decoder is given full information of the underlying error model. Although training is computationally demanding, inference is fast and scales approximately linearly with the space-time volume of the code. We also find that we can use large, but more limited, datasets of real experimental data for the repetition code, giving decoding accuracies that are on par with minimum weight perfect matching. The results show that a purely data-driven approach to decoding may be a viable future option for practical quantum error correction, which is competitive in terms of speed, accuracy, and versatility.

TI How to enhance quantum generative adversarial learning of noisy
   information
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB Quantum machine learning is where nowadays machine learning (ML) meets quantum information science. In order to implement this new paradigm for novel quantum technologies, we still need a much deeper understanding of its underlying mechanisms, before proposing new algorithms to feasibly address real problems. In this context, quantum generative adversarial learning is a promising strategy to use quantum devices for quantum estimation or generative ML tasks. However, the convergence behaviours of its training process, which is crucial for its practical implementation on quantum processors, have not been investigated in detail yet. Indeed here we show how different training problems may occur during the optimization process, such as the emergence of limit cycles. The latter may remarkably extend the convergence time in the scenario of mixed quantum states playing a crucial role in the already available noisy intermediate scale quantum devices. Then, we propose new strategies to achieve a faster convergence in any operating regime. Our results pave the way for new experimental demonstrations of such hybrid classical-quantum protocols allowing to evaluate the potential advantages over their classical counterparts.

TI Graph test of controllability in qubit arrays: a systematic way to
   determine the minimum number of external controls
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB The ability to implement any desired quantum logic gate on a quantum processing unit is equivalent to evolution-operator controllability of the qubits. Conversely, controllability analysis can be used to minimize the resources, i.e. the number of external controls and qubit-qubit couplings, required for universal quantum computing. Standard controllability analysis, consisting in the construction of the dynamical Lie algebra, is, however, impractical already for a comparatively small number of qubits. Here, we show how to leverage an alternative approach, based on a graph representation of the Hamiltonian, to determine controllability of arrays of coupled qubits. We provide a complete computational framework and exemplify it for arrays of five qubits, inspired by the ibmq_quito architecture. We find that the number of controls can be reduced from five to one for complex qubit-qubit couplings and to two for standard qubit-qubit couplings.

AB The development of Shor's algorithm makes it possible to solve some of the problems that are currently NP-intermediate, e.g. the prime factorization problem and discrete logarithm problem, in polynomial time. Hence, the homomorphic encryption algorithms that are designed based on prime factorization may be vulnerable to quantum computing attacks. Considering the post-quantum cryptography, this study proposes a homomorphic encryption method which is devised based on non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) owing to the NP-hardness of the NMF problem and constructs the homomorphic encryption function through the code-based cryptography method for withstanding the quantum computing attacks. The feasibility of the proposed method is demonstrated by the derived mathematical models coupled with some calculation examples illustrating the detailed method steps. Our conducted experiments show that the proposed method has a shorter encryption/decryption time than the mainstream cryptographic algorithms based on the RSA or elliptic-curve cryptography.

TI Quantum sensing of antiferromagnetic magnon two-mode squeezed vacuum
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB N & eacute;el ordered antiferromagnets exhibit two-mode squeezing such that their ground state is a nonclassical superposition of magnon Fock states. Here we theoretically demonstrate that antiferromagnets can couple to spin qubits via direct dispersive interaction stemming from, e.g., interfacial exchange. We demonstrate that this kind of coupling induces a magnon number-dependent level splitting of the excited state resulting in multiple system excitation energies. This series of level splittings manifests itself as nontrivial excitation peaks in qubit spectroscopy thereby revealing the underlying nonclassical magnon composition of the antiferromagnetic quantum state. By appropriately choosing the drive or excitation energy, the magnonic state can be controlled via the qubit, suggesting that Fock states of magnon pairs can be generated deterministically. This enables achieving states useful for quantum computing and quantum information science protocols.

TI Neutral atom quantum computing hardware: performance and end-user
   perspective
SO EPJ QUANTUM TECHNOLOGY
AB We present an industrial end-user perspective on the current state of quantum computing hardware for one specific technological approach, the neutral atom platform. Our aim is to assist developers in understanding the impact of the specific properties of these devices on the effectiveness of algorithm execution. Based on discussions with different vendors and recent literature, we discuss the performance data of the neutral atom platform. Specifically, we focus on the physical qubit architecture, which affects state preparation, qubit-to- qubit connectivity, gate fidelities, native gate instruction set, and individual qubit stability. These factors determine both the quantum-part execution time and the end-to- end wall clock time relevant for end-users, but also the ability to perform fault-tolerant quantum computation in the future. We end with an overview of which applications have been shown to be well suited for the peculiar properties of neutral atom-based quantum computers.

TI A quantum approximate optimization method for finding Hadamard matrices
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Finding a Hadamard matrix of a specific order using a quantum computer can lead to a demonstration of practical quantum advantage. Earlier efforts using a quantum annealer were impeded by the limitations of the present quantum resource and its capability to implement high order interaction terms, which for an M-order matrix will grow by \documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$O(M<^>2)$$\end{document}. In this paper, we propose a novel qubit-efficient method by implementing the Hadamard matrix searching algorithm on a gate-based quantum computer. We achieve this by employing the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA). Since high order interaction terms that are implemented on a gate-based quantum computer do not need ancillary qubits, the proposed method reduces the required number of qubits into O(M). We present the formulation of the method, construction of corresponding quantum circuits, and experiment results in both a quantum simulator and a real gate-based quantum computer.

TI Quantum machine learning for multiclass classification beyond kernel
   methods
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Quantum machine learning is considered one of the current research fields with great potential. In recent years, Havl & iacute;cek et al. [Nature (London) 567, 209 (2019)] have proposed a quantum machine learning algorithm with quantum-enhanced feature spaces, which effectively addressed a binary classification problem and offered a potential pathway to achieving quantum advantage. However, a straightforward binary classification algorithm falls short in solving multiclass classification problems. In this paper, we propose a quantum algorithm that rigorously demonstrates that quantum kernel methods enhance the efficiency of multiclass classification in real-world applications, providing quantum-enhanced performance. To demonstrate this, we design six distinct quantum kernels within the quantum algorithm to map input data into quantum state spaces and estimate the corresponding quantum kernel matrices. The results from quantum simulations reveal that the quantum algorithm outperforms its classical counterpart in handling six real-world multiclass classification problems. Furthermore, we leverage a variety of performance metrics to comprehensively evaluate the classification and generalization performance of the quantum algorithm. The results demonstrate that the quantum algorithm achieves superior classification and better generalization performance relative to classical counterparts.

TI Variational quantum algorithm based on Lagrange polynomial encoding to
   solve differential equations
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Differential equations (DEs) serve as the cornerstone for a wide range of scientific endeavors, their solutions weaving through the core of diverse fields such as structural engineering, fluid dynamics, and financial modeling. DEs are notoriously hard to solve, due to their intricate nature, and finding solutions to DEs often exceeds the capabilities of traditional computational approaches. Recent advances in quantum computing have triggered a growing interest from researchers for the design of quantum algorithms for solving DEs. In this work, we introduce two different architectures of a novel variational quantum algorithm (VQA) with Lagrange polynomial encoding in combination with derivative quantum circuits using the Hadamard test differentiation to approximate the solution of DEs. To demonstrate the potential of our new VQA, two well-known ordinary differential equations are used: the damped mass-spring system from a given initial condition and the Poisson equation for periodic, Dirichlet, and Neumann boundary conditions. It is shown that the proposed new VQA has a reduced gate complexity compared to previous variational quantum algorithms, for a similar or better quality of the solution.

The lower bound depends on the observables' complementarity and the complementarity of uncertainty whilst the upper bound includes the complementarity of the observables, quantum discord, and quantum condition entropy. In quantum measurement processing, there exists a relationship between the complementarity of uncertainty and the complementarity of information. In addition, based on the information exclusion principle the complementarity of uncertainty and the shareability of quantum discord can exist as an essential factor to enhance the bounds of each other in the presence of quantum memory.

TI Controlling nonlocality of bipartite qubit states via quantum channels
SO PHYSICS LETTERS A
AB In this paper, we analyze quantum channels derived from a class of two-qubit states known as the X states. In particular, we consider X states that break the Bell's CHSH condition and then characterize the associated inverse Choi-Jamio & lstrok;kowski maps, which we call nonlocality generating. Interestingly, the region corresponding to nonlocality generating channels shrinks as their stationary state departs from the maximally mixed state. Finally, we demonstrate special cases, where nonlocality can be fully characterized via as little as a single parameter. This approach significantly simplifies the analysis of nonlocality for the X states.

AB The current phase of quantum computing is in the Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) era. On NISQ devices, two-qubit gates such as CNOTs are much noisier than single-qubit gates, so it is essential to minimize their count. Quantum circuit synthesis is a process of decomposing an arbitrary unitary into a sequence of quantum gates, and can be used as an optimization tool to produce shorter circuits to improve overall circuit fidelity. However, the time-to-solution of synthesis grows exponentially with the number of qubits. As a result, synthesis is intractable for circuits on a large qubit scale.
   In this paper, we propose a hierarchical, block-by-block optimization framework, QGo, for quantum circuit optimization. Our approach allows an exponential cost optimization to scale to large circuits. QGo uses a combination of partitioning and synthesis: 1) partition the circuit into a sequence of independent circuit blocks; 2) re-generate and optimize each block using quantum synthesis; and 3) re-compose the final circuit by stitching all the blocks together. We perform our analysis and show the fidelity improvements in three different regimes: small-size circuits on real devices, medium-size circuits on noisy simulations, and large-size circuits on analytical models. Our technique can be applied after existing optimizations to achieve higher circuit fidelity. Using a set of NISQ benchmarks, we show that QGo can reduce the number of CNOT gates by 29.9% on average and up to 50% when compared with industrial compiler optimizations such as t vertical bar ket >. When executed on the IBM Athens system, shorter depth leads to higher circuit fidelity. We also demonstrate the scalability of our QGo technique to optimize circuits of 60+ qubits. Our technique is the first demonstration of successfully employing and scaling synthesis in the compilation toolchain for large circuits. Overall, our approach is robust for direct incorporation in production compiler toolchains to further improve the circuit fidelity.

TI Nonlinear feedforward enabling quantum computation
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Measurement-based quantum computation with optical time-domain multiplexing is a promising method to realize a quantum computer from the viewpoint of scalability. Fault tolerance and universality are also realizable by preparing appropriate resource quantum states and electro-optical feedforward that is altered based on measurement results. While linear feedforward has been realized and become a common experimental technique, nonlinear feedforward was unrealized until now. In this paper, we demonstrate that a fast and flexible nonlinear feedforward realizes the essential measurement required for fault-tolerant and universal quantum computation. Using non-Gaussian ancillary states, we observed 10% reduction of the measurement excess noise relative to classical vacuum ancilla.
   The ability to perform nonlinear feedforward operations - that is, conditional operations controlled by nonlinear function of the measurement outcomes - is still a missing ingredient for measurement-based quantum computation. Here, the authors fill this gap using nonlinear electro-optical feedforward and non-Gaussian ancillary states.

TI Shadows of quantum machine learning
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Quantum machine learning is often highlighted as one of the most promising practical applications for which quantum computers could provide a computational advantage. However, a major obstacle to the widespread use of quantum machine learning models in practice is that these models, even once trained, still require access to a quantum computer in order to be evaluated on new data. To solve this issue, we introduce a class of quantum models where quantum resources are only required during training, while the deployment of the trained model is classical. Specifically, the training phase of our models ends with the generation of a 'shadow model' from which the classical deployment becomes possible. We prove that: (i) this class of models is universal for classically-deployed quantum machine learning; (ii) it does have restricted learning capacities compared to 'fully quantum' models, but nonetheless (iii) it achieves a provable learning advantage over fully classical learners, contingent on widely believed assumptions in complexity theory. These results provide compelling evidence that quantum machine learning can confer learning advantages across a substantially broader range of scenarios, where quantum computers are exclusively employed during the training phase. By enabling classical deployment, our approach facilitates the implementation of quantum machine learning models in various practical contexts.
   Quantum machine learning faces applicability challenges as quantum computers are needed for both training and evaluation of trained models. This study explores models that can be quantumly trained but classically evaluated, highlighting their limits compared to fully quantum models and their advantages over classical ones.

TI A Hybrid Quantum-Classical Generative Adversarial Network for Near-Term
   Quantum Processors
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB In this article, we present a hybrid quantum-classical generative adversarial network (GAN) for near-term quantum processors. The hybrid GAN comprises a variational generator and a discriminator quantum neural network, which are trained using a classic computer. The generator network is realized using angle-encoding and variational quantum circuits. The discriminator network is realized using multi-stage trainable encoding quantum circuits. A modular design approach is proposed for quantum neural networks which allows control on their depth to compromise accuracy and circuit complexity. Moreover, this modular approach makes the quantum neural networks amenable to scaling up the dimension of dataset and the number of qubits. Gradients of the loss functions are derived using the same quantum circuits used for the implementation of quantum neural networks to prevent the need for extra quantum circuits or auxiliary qubits. The quantum simulations are performed using the IBM Qiskit open-source software development kit (SDK), while the training of the hybrid quantum-classical GAN is conducted using the mini-batch stochastic gradient descent (SGD) optimization on a classic computer. The hybrid quantum-classical GAN is realized using a two-qubit system with different discriminator network structures. The best performance is achieved using a five-stage discriminator network comprising 63 quantum gates and 31 trainable parameters, with the Kullback-Leibler (KL) and Jensen-Shannon (JS) divergence scores of 0.39 and 0.52, respectively, for the similarity between the real and generated data distributions.

TI A framework for processing large-scale health data in medical
   higher-order correlation mining by quantum computing in smart healthcare
SO FRONTIERS IN DIGITAL HEALTH
AB This study aims to leverage the advanced capabilities of quantum computing to construct an efficient framework for processing large-scale health data, uncover potential higher-order correlations in medicine, and enhance the accuracy of smart healthcare diagnosis and treatment. A data processing framework is developed using quantum annealing algorithms and quantum circuits. We call it the quantum medical data simulation computational model (Q-MDSC). A unique encoding method based on quantum bits is employed for health data features, such as encoding symptom information from electronic health records into different quantum bits and representing different alleles of genetic data through superposition states of quantum bits. The properties of quantum entanglement are utilized to relate different data types, and quantum parallelism is harnessed to process multiple data combinations simultaneously. Additionally, this quantum computing framework is compared with traditional data mining methods using the same datasets, which include the Cochrane Systematic Review Database (https://www.cochranelibrary.com), the BioASQ Dataset (https://participants-area.bioasq.org), the PubMed Central Dataset (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc), and the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) (https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov). The datasets are divided into training and testing sets in a 7:3 ratio during the experiments. Tests are conducted on association mining tasks of varying data scales and complexities, ranging from simple symptom-disease associations to complex gene-symptom-disease higher-order associations. The results indicate that, when processing large-scale data, the quantum computing framework improves overall computational speed by approximately 45% compared to traditional algorithms. Regarding uncovering higher-order correlations, the quantum computing framework enhances accuracy by about 30% relative to traditional algorithms. For early disease prediction, the accuracy achieved with the new framework is approximately 25% higher than that of conventional methods. Furthermore, for personalized treatment plan matching, the matching accuracy of the quantum computing framework surpasses traditional approaches by about 35%. These findings demonstrate the significant potential of the quantum computing-based smart healthcare framework for processing large-scale health data in the context of higher-order correlation mining, paving new pathways for the development of smart healthcare. This study utilizes multiple public datasets to achieve breakthroughs in computational speed, higher-order correlation mining, early disease prediction, and personalized treatment plan matching, thus opening new avenues for advancing smart healthcare.

TI Monitoring the Energy of a Cavity by Observing the Emission of a
   Repeatedly Excited Qubit
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB The number of excitations in a large quantum system (harmonic oscillator or qudit) can be measured in a quantum nondemolition manner using a dispersively coupled qubit. It typically requires a series of qubit pulses that encode various binary questions about the photon number. Recently, a method based on the fluorescence measurement of a qubit driven by a train of identical pulses was introduced to track the photon number in a cavity, hence simplifying its monitoring and raising interesting questions about the measurement backaction of this scheme. A first realization with superconducting circuits demonstrated how the average number of photons could be measured in this way. Here we present an experiment that reaches single-shot photocounting and number tracking owing to a cavity decay rate 4 orders of magnitude smaller than both the dispersive coupling rate and the qubit emission rate. An innovative notch filter and pogo-pin-based galvanic contact makes possible these seemingly incompatible features. The qubit dynamics under the pulse train is characterized. We observe quantum jumps by monitoring the photon number via the qubit fluorescence as photons leave the cavity one at a time. Additionally, we extract the measurement rate and induced dephasing rate and compare them to theoretical models. Our method could be applied to quantum error correction protocols on bosonic codes or qudits.

TI Benchmarking digital-analog quantum computation for the inhomogeneous
   two-body Ising model
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Digital-analog quantum computation (DAQC) has recently been proposed as an alternative to the standard paradigm of digital quantum computation (DQC). DAQC generates entanglement through a continuous or analog evolution of the whole device, rather than by applying two-qubit gates. This manuscript describes an in-depth analysis of errors in DAQC implementing Ising Hamiltonians used for arbitrary computations, which was missing from the previous literature, revealing that, overall, DAQC errors scale less favorably compared to those in DQC. As demonstrated, for an all-to-all connectivity, the leading error source for DAQC scales like Theta(N4), while for the digital case, it scales like O(N2) for implementing an arbitrary Hamiltonian evolution. We further illustrate this result with our own simulations of the Quantum Fourier Transform, which in the previous literature were based on unrealistic parameter choices, biasing the result in favor of DAQC, and were limited to system sizes of up to only seven qubits. On the other hand, we develop a specific DAQC protocol for a star connectivity, which shows an advantage for the particular case of a GHZ state generation protocol.

TI Gravity Data Inversion by Adiabatic Quantum Computing
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB A quantum-enhanced implementation of the binary inversion method for gravity data acquisition is discussed. The subsurface structure of a single density anomaly with an assigned density contrast is calculated by using a D-Wave adiabatic quantum computer. In particular, an iterative heuristic based on quantum annealing that recovers a sharp shape of the subsurface anomaly is developed. Such a task is accomplished by collecting partial images obtained by quantum annealing processes for optimal Lagrange penalty coefficients. The results are compared with those obtained according to the same cost function minimized via genetic algorithms by conventional hardware on a realistic 2D dataset. The outcomes of this work are promising as the reconstructed model is obtained in tenths of iterations instead of the hundreds required in conventional methods. Moreover, for the part of the computation that resides in the quantum processing unit, the computational cost of the single quantum annealing descent is constant with respect to the number of degrees of freedom of the subsurface grid. The implemented method is likely to reveal its full potential on forthcoming quantum annealing devices, outperforming existing techniques.
   The gravity inversion method is used to map the subsurface density distributions starting from surface measurements. The article investigates a quantum-enhanced binary inversion formulation, addressing a novel application of quantum annealing to geophysics. The algorithm is tested in two different realistic use cases. When non-convexity of the associated optimization problem prevails, a hybrid classical-quantum approach provides an improved subsurface reconstruction.image

TI Quantum Control Machine The Limits of Control Flow in Quantum
   Programming
SO PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACM ON PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES-PACMPL
AB Quantum algorithms for tasks such as factorization, search, and simulation rely on control flow such as branching and iteration that depends on the value of data in superposition. High-level programming abstractions for control flow, such as switches, loops, higher-order functions, and continuations, are ubiquitous in classical languages. By contrast, many quantum languages do not provide high-level abstractions for control flow in superposition, and instead require the use of hardware-level logic gates to implement such control flow.
   The reason for this gap is that whereas a classical computer supports control flow abstractions using a program counter that can depend on data, the typical architecture of a quantum computer does not analogously provide a program counter that can depend on data in superposition. As a result, the complete set of control flow abstractions that can be correctly realized on a quantum computer has not yet been established.
   In this work, we provide a complete characterization of the properties of control flow abstractions that are correctly realizable on a quantum computer. First, we prove that even on a quantum computer whose program counter exists in superposition, one cannot correctly realize control flow in quantum algorithms by lifting the classical conditional jump instruction to work in superposition. This theorem denies the ability to directly lift general abstractions for control flow such as the lambda-calculus from classical to quantum programming.
   In response, we present the necessary and sufficient conditions for control flow to be correctly realizable on a quantum computer. We introduce the quantum control machine, an instruction set architecture featuring a conditional jump that is restricted to satisfy these conditions. We show how this design enables a developer to correctly express control flow in quantum algorithms using a program counter in place of logic gates.

TI Compact Ion-Trap Quantum Computing Demonstrator
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Quantum information processing is steadily progressing from a purely academic discipline towards applications throughout science and industry. Transitioning from lab-based, proof-of-concept experiments to robust, integrated realizations of quantum information processing hardware is an important step in this process. However, the nature of traditional laboratory setups does not offer itself readily to scaling up system sizes or allow for applications outside of laboratory-grade environments. This transition requires overcoming challenges in engineering and integration without sacrificing the state-of-the-art performance of laboratory implementations. Here, we present a 19-inch rack quantum computing demonstrator based on Ca-40(+) optical qubits in a linear Paul trap to address many of these challenges. We outline the mechanical, optical, and electrical subsystems. Furthermore, we describe the automation and remote access components of the quantum computing stack. We conclude by describing characterization measurements relevant to quantum computing including site-resolved single-qubit interactions, and entangling operations mediated by the Molmer-Sorensen interaction delivered via two distinct addressing approaches. Using this setup, we produce maximally entangled Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger states with up to 24 ions without the use of postselection or error mitigation techniques; on par with well-established conventional laboratory setups.

TI Adaptive non-Gaussian quantum state engineering
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Non-Gaussian quantum states of bosons are a key resource in quantum information science with applications ranging from quantum metrology to fault-tolerant quantum computation. Generation of photonic non-Gaussian resource states, such as Schr & ouml;dinger's cat and Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill states, is challenging. In this work, we go beyond existing passive architectures and explore a broad set of adaptive schemes. Our numerical results demonstrate a consistent improvement in the probability of success and fidelity of generating these non-Gaussian quantum states with equivalent resources. We also explore the effect of loss as the primary limiting factor and observe that adaptive schemes lead to more desirable outcomes in terms of overall probability of success and loss tolerance. Our work offers a versatile framework for non-Gaussian resource state generation with the potential to guide future experimental implementations.

TI Flying-Qubit Control: Basics, Progress, and Outlook
SO ADVANCED DEVICES & INSTRUMENTATION
AB Flying qubit is one type of the basic elements for transmitting quantum information in quantum networks. It can serve as a communication link between quantum computer nodes and represents a vital part of secure data transmission. For high-fidelity information transmission, precise control of flying qubit is highly demanded. Here, based on quantized photons or phonons as the carriers of the flying qubit, we review the basics and the progress of the flying-qubit control in both theoretical and experimental aspects. The flying-qubit control system can be regarded as an open quantum system with N energy levels coupled with multiple quantum channels. Its input includes classical components, such as coherent or incoherent control functions, as well as quantum components, but its output only includes quantum components, and the system is affected by environmental noise. According to the characteristics of quantum input and quantum output fields, the flying-qubit control problems can be divided into 3 categories: generation, reception, and conversion. From a theoretical perspective, the different modeling approaches of the flying-qubit control are discussed and compared, including the master equation, the quantum trajectory, the scattering matrix, the quantum stochastic differential equation, and the quantum Langevin equation. Considering both control design schemes and experimental perspectives, various control strategies and experimental progress have been thoroughly discussed and analyzed. The applications and future directions of flying-qubit control are discussed. The realization of flying qubits plays a vital role in application scenarios such as quantum coherent interconnection, the construction of large-scale quantum chips with a large number of bits, and the link between computers and communication networks.

We give the formulas for the entanglement swapping of Bell states and GHZ states in any number of qubit systems. We further consider entanglement swapping between any number of Bell states and between any number of the introduced GHZ states, and propose a series of entanglement swapping schemes in a detailed way.

TI Universal Limitations on Quantum Key Distribution over a Network
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW X
AB We consider the distribution of secret keys, both in a bipartite and a multipartite (conference) setting, via a quantum network and establish a framework to obtain bounds on the achievable rates. We show that any multipartite private state-the output of a protocol distilling secret key among the trusted parties-has to be genuinely multipartite entangled. In order to describe general network settings, we introduce a multiplex quantum channel, which links an arbitrary number of parties where each party can take the role of sender only, receiver only, or both sender and receiver. We define asymptotic and nonasymptotic local quantum operations and classical communication-assisted secret-key-agreement (SKA) capacities for multiplex quantum channels and provide strong and weak converse bounds. The structure of the protocols we consider, manifested by an adaptive strategy of secret-key and entanglement [Greenberger-Horne- Zeilinger (GHZ) state] distillation over an arbitrary multiplex quantum channel, is generic. As a result, our approach also allows us to study the performance of quantum key repeaters and measurement-device independent quantum key distribution (MDI-QKD) setups. For teleportation-covariant multiplex quantum channels, we get upper bounds on the SKA capacities in terms of the entanglement measures of their Choi states. We also obtain bounds on the rates at which secret key and GHZ states can be distilled from a finite number of copies of an arbitrary multipartite quantum state. We are able to determine the capacities for MDI-QKD setups and rates of GHZ-state distillation for some cases of interest.

TI Zero uncertainty states in the presence of quantum memory
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB The uncertainty principle imposes a fundamental limit on predicting the measurement outcomes of incompatible observables even if complete classical information of the system state is known. The situation is different if one can build a quantum memory entangled with the system. Zero uncertainty states (in contrast with minimum uncertainty states) are peculiar quantum states that can eliminate uncertainties of incompatible von Neumann observables once assisted by suitable measurements on the memory. Here we determine all zero uncertainty states of any given set of nondegenerate observables and determine the minimum entanglement required. It turns out all zero uncertainty states are maximally entangled in a generic case, and vice versa, even if these observables are only weakly incompatible. Our work establishes a simple and precise connection between zero uncertainty and maximum entanglement, which is of interest to foundational studies and practical applications, including quantum certification and verification.

TI Diagnostics of Mixed-State Topological Order and Breakdown of Quantum
   Memory
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Topological quantum memory can protect information against local errors up to finite error thresholds. Such thresholds are usually determined based on the success of decoding algorithms rather than the intrinsic properties of the mixed states describing corrupted memories. Here we provide an intrinsic characterization of the breakdown of topological quantum memory, which both gives a bound on the performance of decoding algorithms and provides examples of topologically distinct mixed states. We employ three information-theoretical quantities that can be regarded as generalizations of the diagnostics of ground-state topological order, and serve as a definition for topological order in error-corrupted mixed states. We consider the topological contribution to entanglement negativity and two other metrics based on quantum relative entropy and coherent information. In the concrete example of the two-dimensional (2D) Toric code with local bit-flip and phase errors, we map three quantities to observables in 2D classical spin models and analytically show they all undergo a transition at the same error threshold. This threshold is an upper bound on that achieved in any decoding algorithm and is indeed saturated by that in the optimal decoding algorithm for the Toric code.

We identify a special class of subspaces, for which a sequence of rotations results in a non-abelian holonomy of a topological nature, so that it is invariant under any SO(3)-perturbation. Making use of a Majorana-like stellar representation for subspaces, we give explicit examples of topological-holonomic (or toponomic) NOT and CNOT gates.

TI Dynamical phase error in interacting topological quantum memories
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB A local Hamiltonian with topological quantum order (TQO) has a robust ground-state degeneracy that makes it an excellent quantum memory candidate. This memory can be corrupted however if part of the state leaves the protected ground-state manifold and returns later with a dynamically accrued phase error. Here we analyze how TQO suppresses this process and use this to quantify the degree to which spectral densities in different topological sectors are correlated. We provide numerical verification of our results by modeling an interacting p-wave superconducting wire.

TI Influence of deformed cavity field and atomic dipole interaction on the
   quantum correlations of two-qubit system
SO OPTICAL AND QUANTUM ELECTRONICS
AB The possibility of generating of some quantum correlations of the entangled or separable initial two-qubit system interacting with a deformed cavity mode in the presence of dipole dipole interaction is discussed. These quantum correlations are the coherence, non -separability and steering degrees which are quantifiers by using l(1 )norm of coherence, Entanglement of Formation and Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen-steering. It is shown that maximizing or minimizing the quantum correlations depends on the initial setting states of the two-qubit system. To maximize the quantum correlations on the presence of deformation, one has to prepare the initial two-qubit system in an entangled state, setting large values of the coupling dipole and decreasing the effect of the deformation parameter.

TI Error-Detectable Bosonic Entangling Gates with a Noisy Ancilla
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Bosonic quantum error correction has proven to be a successful approach for extending the coherence of quantum memories, but to execute deep quantum circuits, high-fidelity gates between encoded qubits are needed. To that end, we present a family of error-detectable two-qubit gates for a variety of bosonic encodings. From a new geometric framework based on a "Bloch sphere" of bosonic operators, we con-struct ZZL(& theta;) and exponential-SWAP(& theta;) gates for the binomial, four-legged cat, dual-rail, and several other bosonic codes. The gate Hamiltonian is simple to engineer, requiring only a programmable beam splitter between two bosonic qubits and an ancilla dispersively coupled to one qubit. This Hamiltonian can be realized in circuit QED hardware with ancilla transmons and microwave cavities. The proposed theoret-ical framework was developed for circuit QED but is generalizable to any platform that can effectively generate this Hamiltonian. Crucially, one can also detect first-order errors in the ancilla and the bosonic qubits during the gates. We show that this allows one to reach error-detected gate fidelities at the 0.01% level with today's hardware, limited only by second-order hardware errors.

TI Quantum Algorithm for Higher-Order Unconstrained Binary Optimization and
   MIMO Maximum Likelihood Detection
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON COMMUNICATIONS
AB In this paper, we propose a quantum algorithm that supports a real-valued higher-order unconstrained binary optimization (HUBO) problem. This algorithm is based on the Grover adaptive search that originally supported HUBO with integer coefficients. Next, as an application example, we formulate multiple-input multiple-output maximum likelihood detection as a HUBO problem with real-valued coefficients, where we use the Gray-coded bit-to-symbol mapping specified in the 5G standard. The proposed approach allows us to construct an efficient quantum circuit for the detection problem and to analyze specific numbers of required qubits and quantum gates, whereas other conventional studies have assumed that such a circuit is feasible as a quantum oracle. To further accelerate the quantum algorithm, we also derive a probability distribution of the objective function value and determine a unique threshold to sample better states. Assuming a future fault-tolerant quantum computing, our proposed algorithm has the potential for significantly reducing query complexity in the classical domain and providing a quadratic speedup in the quantum domain.

TI Distributed Quantum Error Correction for Chip-Level Catastrophic Errors
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Quantum error correction holds the key to scaling up quantum computers. Cosmic ray events severely impact the operation of a quantum computer by causing chip-level catastrophic errors, essentially erasing the information encoded in a chip. Here, we present a distributed error correction scheme to combat the devastating effect of such events by introducing an additional layer of quantum erasure error correcting code across separate chips. We show that our scheme is fault tolerant against chip-level catastrophic errors and discuss its experimental implementation using superconducting qubits with microwave links. Our analysis shows that in state-of-the-art experiments, it is possible to suppress the rate of these errors from 1 per 10 s to less than 1 per month.

TI Proposal for practical multidimensional quantum networks
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB A quantum internet, i.e., a global interconnection of quantum devices, is the long-term goal of quantum communications and has so far been based on two-dimensional systems (qubits). Recent years have seen a significant development of high-dimensional quantum systems (qudits). While qudits present higher photon information efficiency and robustness to noise, their use in quantum networks presents experimental challenges due to the impractical resources required in high-dimensional quantum repeaters. Here, we show that such challenges can be met via the use of standard quantum optical resources, such as weak coherent states or weak squeezed states, and linear optics. We report a concrete design and simulations of an entanglement swapping scheme for three-and four-dimensional systems, showing how the network parameters can be tuned to optimize secret key rates and analyzing the enhanced noise robustness at different dimensions. Our work significantly simplifies the implementation of high-dimensional quantum networks, fostering their development with current technology.

TI Optimizing quantum convolutional neural network architectures for
   arbitrary data dimension
SO FRONTIERS IN PHYSICS
AB Quantum convolutional neural networks (QCNNs) represent a promising approach in quantum machine learning, paving new directions for both quantum and classical data analysis. This approach is particularly attractive due to the absence of the barren plateau problem, a fundamental challenge in training quantum neural networks (QNNs), and its feasibility. However, a limitation arises when applying QCNNs to classical data. The network architecture is most natural when the number of input qubits is a power of two, as this number is reduced by a factor of two in each pooling layer. The number of input qubits determines the dimensions (i.e., the number of features) of the input data that can be processed, restricting the applicability of QCNN algorithms to real-world data. To address this issue, we propose a QCNN architecture capable of handling arbitrary input data dimensions while optimizing the allocation of quantum resources such as ancillary qubits and quantum gates. This optimization is not only important for minimizing computational resources, but also essential in noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) computing, as the size of the quantum circuits that can be executed reliably is limited. Through numerical simulations, we benchmarked the classification performance of various QCNN architectures across multiple datasets with arbitrary input data dimensions, including MNIST, Landsat satellite, Fashion-MNIST, and Ionosphere. The results validate that the proposed QCNN architecture achieves excellent classification performance while utilizing a minimal resource overhead, providing an optimal solution when reliable quantum computation is constrained by noise and imperfections.

TI Quantum Correlation Enhanced Optical Imaging
SO QUANTUM BEAM SCIENCE
AB Quantum correlations, especially time correlations, are crucial in ghost imaging for significantly reducing the background noise on the one hand while increasing the imaging resolution. Moreover, the time correlations serve as a critical reference, distinguishing between signal and noise, which in turn enable clear visualization of biological samples. Quantum imaging also addresses the challenge involved in imaging delicate biological structures with minimal photon exposure and sample damage. Here, we explore the recent progress in quantum correlation-based imaging, notably its impact on secure imaging and remote sensing protocols as well as on biological imaging. We also exploit the quantum characteristics of heralded single-photon sources (HSPS) combined with decoy state methods for secure imaging. This method uses Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) principles to reduce measurement uncertainties and protect data integrity. It is highly effective in low-photon number regimes for producing high-quality, noise-reduced images. The versatility of decoy state methods with WCSs (WCS) is also discussed, highlighting their suitability for scenarios requiring higher photon numbers. We emphasize the dual advantages of these techniques: improving image quality through noise reduction and enhancing data security with quantum encryption, suggesting significant potential for quantum imaging in various applications, from delicate biological imaging to secure quantum imaging and communication.

TI Free-space optical multiplexing scheme based on acousto-optic deflector
   (AOD) with orbital angular momentum
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Free-space optical multiplexing is essential for multimode quantum repeater, which plays a central role in quantum information processing and communication. Regarding spatial degrees of freedom, orbital angular momentum (OAM) modes have garnered significant interest due to their capacity for encoding with infinite inherent dimensions. OAM qubits and optical paths multiplexing have been separately implemented in previous work, the achieved number of multiplexed modes implemented is on the order of hundreds. We propose to directly enhance free-space optical propagation mode by combining optical paths multiplexing based on acoustic-optic deflectors (AODs) with OAM modes. The experiment verified that OAM still maintains high efficiency and considerable 0.5 dB bandwidth after AODs modulation. This scheme at least offers one order of magnitude more mode numbers than previous works and is expected to achieve higher mode numbers in quantum memory using more practical methods.

TI Topologically Protected Valley-Dependent Quantum Photonic Circuits
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Topological photonics has been introduced as a powerful platform for integrated optics, since it can deal with robust light transport, and be further extended to the quantum world. Strikingly, valley-contrasting physics in topological photonic structures contributes to valley-related edge states, their unidirectional coupling, and even valley-dependent wave division in topological junctions. Here, we design and fabricate nanophotonic topological harpoon-shaped beam splitters (HSBSs) based on 120-deg-bending interfaces and demonstrate the first on-chip valley-dependent quantum information process. Two-photon quantum interference, namely, Hong-Ou-Mandel interference with a high visibility of 0.956 +/- 0.006, is realized with our 50/50 HSBS, which is constructed by two topologically distinct domain walls. Cascading this kind of HSBS together, we also demonstrate a simple quantum photonic circuit and generation of a path-entangled state. Our work shows that the photonic valley state can be used in quantum information processing, and it is possible to realize more complex quantum circuits with valley-dependent photonic topological insulators, which provides a novel method for on-chip quantum information processing.

TI Estimation of correlations and nonseparability in quantum channels via
   unitarity benchmarking
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB The ability to transfer quantum information between systems is a fundamental component of quantum technologies and leads to correlations within the global quantum process. However, correlation structures in quantum channels are less studied than those in quantum states. Motivated by recent techniques in randomized benchmarking, we develop a range of results for efficient estimation of correlations within a bipartite quantum channel. We introduce subunitarity measures that are invariant under local changes of basis, generalize the unitarity of a channel, and allow for the analysis of quantum information exchange within channels. Using these, we show that unitarity is monogamous, and we provide an information-disturbance relation. We then define a notion of correlated unitarity that quantifies the correlations within a given channel. Crucially, we show that this measure is strictly bounded on the set of separable channels and therefore provides a witness of nonseparability. Finally, we describe how such measures for effective noise channels can be efficiently estimated within different randomized benchmarking protocols. We find that the correlated unitarity can be estimated in a SPAM-robust manner for any separable quantum channel, and we show that a benchmarking/tomography protocol with mid-circuit resets can reliably witness nonseparability for sufficiently small reset errors. The tools we develop provide information beyond that obtained via simultaneous randomized benchmarking and so could find application in the analysis of cross-talk errors in quantum devices.

TI Silicon spin qubits from laboratory to industry
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS D-APPLIED PHYSICS
AB Quantum computation (QC) is one of the most challenging quantum technologies that promise to revolutionize data computation in the long-term by outperforming the classical supercomputers in specific applications. Errors will hamper this quantum revolution if not sufficiently limited and corrected by quantum error correction codes thus avoiding quantum algorithm failures. In particular millions of highly-coherent qubits arranged in a two-dimensional array are required to implement the surface code, one of the most promising codes for quantum error correction. One of the most attractive technologies to fabricate such large number of almost identical high-quality devices is the well known metal-oxide-semiconductor technology. Silicon quantum processor manufacturing can leverage the technological developments achieved in the last 50 years in the semiconductor industry. Here, we review modeling, fabrication aspects and experimental figures of merit of qubits defined in the spin degree of freedom of charge carriers confined in quantum dots and donors in silicon devices along with classical electronics innovations for qubit control and readout. Furthermore, we discuss potential applications of the technology and finally we review the role of start-ups and companies in the silicon-based QC era.

TI On Circuit-Based Hybrid Quantum Neural Networks for Remote Sensing
   Imagery Classification
SO IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE
   SENSING
AB This article aims to investigate how circuit-based hybrid quantum convolutional neural networks (QCNNs) can be successfully employed as image classifiers in the context of remote sensing. The hybrid QCNNs enrich the classical architecture of convolutional neural networks by introducing a quantum layer within a standard neural network. The novel QCNN proposed in this work is applied to the land-use and land-cover classification, chosen as an Earth observation (EO) use case, and tested on the EuroSAT dataset used as the reference benchmark. The results of the multiclass classification prove the effectiveness of the presented approach by demonstrating that the QCNN performances are higher than the classical counterparts. Moreover, investigation of various quantum circuits shows that the ones exploiting quantum entanglement achieve the best classification scores. This study underlines the potentialities of applying quantum computing to an EO case study and provides the theoretical and experimental background for future investigations.

TI Machine Learning Assisted Prediction for Free-Space Continuous Variable
   Quantum Teleportation
SO IEEE PHOTONICS JOURNAL
AB Satellite-based quantum communication is critical in establishing a global quantum network for its ability to achieve thousand-kilometer-level tasks without the requirement of quantum relay. The free-space channel, however, is affected by diffraction, regular refraction, and atmospheric turbulence, which induce random wandering and broadening of the transmitted beam, resulting in the transmittance of fluctuation. In such a scenario, the ability to predict the unknown situation has become a problem worth considering. In this paper, we suggest a machine learning (ML) assisted prediction of continuous-variable quantum teleportation (CVQT) over satellite-ground channel. We apply the prediction algorithm, which involves k-nearest neighbor (KNN) algorithm and decision tree (DT) algorithm, to the squeezing parameter and the satellite altitude. Numerical analysis shows that the predicted parameter can reflect the actual derivation and calculation under certain circumstances within the allowable range of error. Moreover, we apply the prediction algorithm to the case affected by the fluctuating parameter transmittance. The results show that the ML-assisted prediction results are consistent with the actual data when zenith angles, turbulence strengths, and wavelengths are taken into account. It demonstrates the high identifying accuracy without increasing the complexity of the system.

TI Near-Landauer-Bound Quantum Computing Engineering Using Single Spins
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM ENGINEERING
AB Quantum computing engineering integrates quantum electronic engineering and computer science required to develop quantum computer hardware and software. In this study, we used four experiments (a single spin experiment, a giant spin experiment, a nanomagnet experiment, and the Stern-Gerlach experiment) to demonstrate that a single spin was much more energy efficient due to its small size and weak coupling with the surroundings. We conclude that quantum spintronics, with a single spin as a qubit, is a near-Landauer-bound computing engineering. This means that it is approaching the theoretical limit on the minimum amount of energy required to perform a computation, as defined by Landauer's principle. Our study is also the first experimental verification of Landauer's bound on a single spin, which is the smallest information carrier in size.

TI Entanglement Purification for Logic-Qubit of Photon System Based on
   Parity Check Measurement Gate
SO ENTROPY
AB It has been found that logic-qubit entanglement has great potential for applications in quantum communication and quantum networks in recent years. However, along with the effects of noise and decoherence, the fidelity of the communication transmission can be greatly reduced. In this paper, we investigate the entanglement purification of logic bit-flip error and phase-flip error in polarization logic-qubit entanglement based on the parity-check measurement (PCM) gate, which is constructed by the cross-Kerr nonlinearity and used to distinguish the parity information of two-photon polarization states. The probability of entanglement purification is higher than the scheme using the linear optical method. Moreover, the quality of logic-qubit entangled states can be improved by a cyclic purification process. This entanglement purification protocol will be useful in the future when faced with long-distance communication with logic-qubit entanglement states.

TI Quantum Teleportation and Dense Coding in Multiple Bosonic Reservoirs
SO ENTROPY
AB The effect of a reservoir on quantum communication depends on its spectral density. The efficiency of quantum teleportation and dense coding is explored when each one of the channel qubits is coupled simultaneously to multiple bosonic reservoirs. It is shown that the non-Markovianity triggered by increasing the reservoir number can induce revivals of quantum advantages of the two protocols after their disappearance. However, the backflow of information to the system that signifies non-Markovianity does not always induce immediate revivals of the quantum advantages. There may be a delayed effect for some initial states, and only as the backflow of information accumulates to a certain extent can the revivals of quantum advantages be triggered.

TI A Novel Approach to State-to-State Transformation in Quantum Computing
SO INFORMATION
AB This article presents a new approach to the problem of transforming one quantum state into another. It is shown that an r-qubit superposition |x > can be obtained from another r-qubit superposition |y >, by using only (2r-1) rotations, each presented by one controlled rotation gate. The quantum superpositions with real amplitudes are considered. The traditional two-stage approach Uy-1Ux:|x >->|0 >circle plus r ->|y > requires twice as many rotations. Here, both transformations to the conventual basis state, Ux: |x >-> |0 >circle plus r and Uy: |y >-> |0 >circle plus r, use (2r-1) rotations each on two binary planes, and many of these rotations require additional sets of CNOTs to be represented as 1- or 2-qubit-controlled gates. The proposed method is based on the concept of the discrete signal-induced heap transform (DsiHT) which is unitary and generated by a vector and a set of angular equations with given parameters. The quantum analog of this transform is described. The main characteristic of the DsiHT is the path of processing the data. It is shown that there exist such fast paths that allow for effective computing of the DsiHT, which leads to the simple quantum circuits for state preparation and transformation. Examples of such paths are given and quantum circuits for preparation and transformation of 2-, 3-, and 4-qubits are described in detail. CNOT gates are not used, but only controlled gates of elementary rotations around the y-axis. It is shown that the transformation and, in particular, only rotation gates with control qubits are required for initialization of 2-, 3-, and 4-qubits. The quantum circuits are simple and have a recursive form, which makes them easy to implement for arbitrary r-qubit superposition, with r >= 2. This approach significantly reduces the complexity of quantum state transformations, paving the way for more efficient quantum algorithms and practical implementations on near-term quantum devices.

Furthermore, our method presents a remarkable quantum advantage over classical schemes, the latter of which can only transmit a maximum of 3 bits in the environment without any noise.

TI QUICK3 - Design of a Satellite-Based Quantum Light Source for
   Quantum Communication and Extended Physical Theory Tests in Space
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB Modern quantum technologies have matured such that they can now be used in space applications, e.g., long-distance quantum communication. Here, the design of a compact true single photon source is presented that can enhance the secure data rates in satellite-based quantum key distribution scenarios compared to conventional laser-based light sources. The quantum light source is a fluorescent color center in hexagonal boron nitride. The emitter is off-resonantly excited by a diode laser and directly coupled to an integrated photonic processor that routes the photons to different experiments performed directly on-chip: i) the characterization of the single photon source and ii) testing a fundamental postulate of quantum mechanics, namely the relation of the probability density and the wave function (known as Born's rule). The described payload is currently being integrated into a 3U CubeSat and scheduled to launch in 2024 into low Earth orbit. Therefore the feasibility of true single photon sources and reconfigurable photonic circuits in space can be evaluated. This provides a promising route toward a high-speed quantum network.

TI Error suppression in adiabatic quantum computing with qubit ensembles
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Incorporating protection against quantum errors into adiabatic quantum computing (AQC) is an important task due to the inevitable presence of decoherence. Here, we investigate an error-protected encoding of the AQC Hamiltonian, where qubit ensembles are used in place of qubits. Our Hamiltonian only involves total spin operators of the ensembles, offering a simpler route towards error-corrected quantum computing. Our scheme is particularly suited to neutral atomic gases where it is possible to realize large ensemble sizes and produce ensemble-ensemble entanglement. We identify a critical ensemble size N-c where the nature of the first excited state becomes a single particle perturbation of the ground state, and the gap energy is predictable by mean-field theory. For ensemble sizes larger than N-c, the ground state becomes protected due to the presence of logically equivalent states and the AQC performance improves with N, as long as the decoherence rate is sufficiently low.

SO JOURNAL OF MAGNETIC RESONANCE OPEN
AB The quantum no-disturbance principle imposes a fundamental monogamy relation on quantum contextuality and quantum nonlocality. We experimentally demonstrated the simulation of this monogamy relation on a ququartqubit system using three NMR qubits. We constructed experimental tests of the violation of the Klyachko-CanBinicioglu-Shumovski (KCBS) inequality and the Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (CHSH) inequality. We measured the average CHSH and KCBS values at the single point where the quantum boundary meets the nodisturbance boundary, at which point the tradeoff inequality becomes an equality. The tradeoff relation is always satisfied, implying that the violation of either the KCBS or the CHSH inequality automatically forbids the violation of the other.

TI Boltzmann distributions on a quantum computer via active cooling
SO NUCLEAR PHYSICS A
AB Quantum computing raises the possibility of solving a variety of problems in physics that are presently intractable. A number of such problems involves the physics of systems in or near thermal equilibrium. There are two main ways to compute thermal expectation values on a quantum computer: construct a thermal state that reproduces thermal expectation values, or sample various energy eigenstates from a Boltzmann distribution of a given temperature. In this paper we address the second approach and propose an algorithm that uses active cooling to produce the distribution. While this algorithm is quite general and applicable to a wide variety of systems, it was developed with the specific intention of simulating thermal configurations of non-Abelian gauge theories such as QCD, which would allow the study of quark-gluon plasma created in heavy-ion collisions.

TI Bottom-up fabrication of scalable room-temperature diamond quantum
   computing and sensing technologies
SO MATERIALS FOR QUANTUM TECHNOLOGY
AB The nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centre in diamond is a premier solid-state defect for quantum information processing and metrology. An integrated diamond quantum device harnesses the collective properties of multiple NV centres, enabling room-temperature quantum computing and sensing. While large-scale devices are poised to fill an important gap in the burgeoning quantum technology landscape, their practical realisation has not been achieved using current top-down fabrication techniques such as ion implantation. Consequently, this necessitates the development of a bottom-up fabrication technique, which is scalable, deterministic, and possesses atomic-scale precision. Informed by existing methods for fabricating phosphorous defect qubits in silicon, we envision a hydrogen depassivation lithography technique for atomically-precise manufacturing of nitrogen-vacancy centres in diamond. This perspective article outlines a viable multi-step procedure for realising scalable fabrication of diamond quantum devices and identifies the key challenges in its development.

TI Qubit-Reuse Compilation with Mid-Circuit Measurement and Reset
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW X
AB A number of commercially available quantum computers, such as those based on trapped-ion or superconducting qubits, can now perform mid-circuit measurements and resets. In addition to being crucial for quantum error correction, this capability can help reduce the number of qubits needed to execute many types of quantum algorithms by measuring qubits as early as possible, resetting them, and reusing them elsewhere in the circuit. In this work, we introduce the idea of qubit-reuse compilation, which takes as input a quantum circuit and produces as output a compiled circuit that requires fewer qubits to execute due to qubit reuse. We present two algorithms for performing qubit-reuse compilation: an exact constraint programming optimization model and a greedy heuristic. We introduce the concept of dual circuits, obtained by exchanging state preparations with measurements and vice versa and reversing time, and show that optimal qubit-reuse compilation requires the same number of qubits to execute a circuit as its dual. We illustrate the performance of these algorithms on a variety of relevant near-term quantum circuits, such as one-dimensional and two-dimensional time-evolution circuits, and numerically benchmark their performance on the quantum adiabatic optimization algorithm (QAOA) applied to the MaxCut problem on random three-regular graphs. To demonstrate the practical benefit of these techniques, we experimentally realize an 80-qubit QAOA MaxCut circuit on the 20-qubit Quantinuum H1-1 trapped-ion quantum processor using qubit-reuse compilation algorithms.

TI Non-Markovian Dynamics of Geometric Quantum Discord in a Double Quantum
   Dot System
SO JOURNAL OF LOW TEMPERATURE PHYSICS
AB In this paper, we study the geometric quantum discord dynamics of the double quantum dot charge qubit in the non-Markovian environment. We apply the non-perturbative non-Markovian quantum state diffusion method to obtain the exact master equation of the double quantum dot system coupled to two independent non-zero temperature electronic baths. Then, we use this master equation to investigate the effects of non-Markovianity, inter-dot coupling strength and bath temperature on the dynamics of geometric quantum discord. Our studies show that the geometric quantum discord of a double quantum dot system can be modified and enhanced in some cases via these factors.

TI Efficiency optimization in quantum computing: balancing thermodynamics
   and computational performance
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB We investigate the computational efficiency and thermodynamic cost of the D-Wave quantum annealer under reverse-annealing with and without pausing. Our demonstration on the D-Wave 2000Q annealer shows that the combination of reverse-annealing and pausing leads to improved computational efficiency while minimizing the thermodynamic cost compared to reverse-annealing alone. Moreover, we find that the magnetic field has a positive impact on the performance of the quantum annealer during reverse-annealing but becomes detrimental when pausing is involved. Our results, which are reproducible, provide strategies for optimizing the performance and energy consumption of quantum annealing systems employing reverse-annealing protocols.
