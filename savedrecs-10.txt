TI Quantum finite difference solvers for physics simulation
SO IET QUANTUM COMMUNICATION
AB Physics systems are becoming increasingly complex and require more and more computing time. Quantum computing, which has shown its efficiency on some problems, such as the factorisation of a number with Shor's algorithm, may be the solution to reduce these computation times. Here, the authors propose two quantum numerical schemes for the simulation of physics phenomena, based on the finite difference method. The aim is to see if quantum versions of standard numerical schemes offer an advantage over their classical counterparts, either in accuracy, stability or computation time. First, the authors will present the different phenomena studied as well as the classical solution methods chosen. The authors will then describe the implementation of the quantum numerical schemes and present some results obtained on the different physics phenomena beforehand and then compare both approaches, classical and quantum.

TI Security of quantum key distribution with imperfect phase randomisation
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB The performance of quantum key distribution (QKD) is severely limited by multiphoton emissions, due to the photon-number-splitting attack. The most efficient solution, the decoy-state method, requires that the phases of all transmitted pulses are independent and uniformly random. In practice, however, these phases are often correlated, especially in high-speed systems, which opens a security loophole. Here, we address this pressing problem by providing a security proof for decoy-state QKD with correlated phases that offers key rates close to the ideal scenario. Our work paves the way towards high-performance secure QKD with practical laser sources, and may have applications beyond QKD.

TI Security of the traditional quantum key distribution protocols with
   finite-key lengths
SO CHINESE PHYSICS B
AB Quantum key distribution (QKD) in principle can provide unconditional secure communication between distant parts. However, when finite-key length is taken into account, the security can only be ensured within certain security level. In this paper, we adopt the Chernoff bound analysis method to deal with finite-key-size effects, carrying out corresponding investigations on the relationship between the key generation rate and security parameters for different protocols, including BB84, measurement-device-independent and twin-field QKD protocols. Simulation results show that there exists a fundamental limit between the key rate and the security parameters. Therefore, this study can provide valuable references for practical application of QKD, getting a nice balance between the key generation rate and the security level.

TI Long-distance transmission of arbitrary quantum states between spatially
   separated microwave cavities
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Long-distance transmission between spatially separated microwave cavities is a crucial area of quantum information science and technology. In this work, we present a method for achieving long-distance transmission of arbitrary quantum states between two microwave cavities, by using a hybrid system that comprises two microwave cavities, two nitrogen-vacancy center ensembles (NV ensembles), two optical cavities, and an optical fiber. Each NV ensemble serves as a quantum transducer, dispersively coupling with a microwave cavity and an optical cavity, which enables the conversion of quantum states between a microwave cavity and an optical cavity. The optical fiber acts as a connector between the two optical cavities. Numerical simulations demonstrate that our method allows for the transfer of an arbitrary photonic qubit state between two spatially separated microwave cavities with high fidelity. Furthermore, the method exhibits robustness against environmental decay, parameter fluctuations, and additive white Gaussian noise. Our approach offers a promising way for achieving long-distance transmission of quantum states between two spatially separated microwave cavities, which may have practical applications in networked large-scale quantum information processing and quantum communication.

TI Tunable photon-mediated interactions between spin-1 systems
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB The exchange of off-resonant photons between quantum optical emitters in cavity QED or quantum nanophotonic setups induces interactions between them which can be harnessed for quantum information and simulation purposes. So far, these interactions have been mostly characterized for two-level emitters, which restrict their application to engineering quantum gates among qubits or simulating spin-1/2 quantum many-body models. Here, we show how to harness multilevel emitters with several optical transitions to engineer a wide class of photon-mediated interactions between effective spin-1 systems. We characterize their performance through analytical and numerical techniques and provide specific implementations based on the atomic level structure of Alkali atoms. Our results expand the quantum simulation toolbox available in such cavity QED and quantum nanophotonic setups and open up different ways of engineering entangling gates among qutrits.

TI Algorithms for Quantum Computation: The Derivatives of Discontinuous
   Functions
SO MATHEMATICS
AB We hope this work allows one to calculate large prime numbers directly, not by trial-and-error, but following a physical law. We report-contrary to conventional assumptions-that differentiation of discontinuous functions (DDF) exists in the set Q, which becomes central to algorithms for quantum computation. DDF have been thought to exist not in the classical sense, but using distributions. However, DDF using distributions still is defined in terms of mathematical real-numbers (MRN), and do not address the Problem of Closure, here investigated. These facts lead to contradictions using MRN, solved by this work, providing a new unbounded class of physical solutions using physical numbers in quantum mechanics (QM), that were always there (just hidden), allowing DDF without distributions, or MRN. It is worthwhile to see this only in mathematics, to avoid the prejudices found in physics, as this reforms both general relativity and QM. This confirms the opinions of Nicolas Gisin that MRN are non-computable with probability 1, and Niels Bohr that physics is not reality, it is a fitting story about reality. Mathematics can get closer to reality, surprisingly. We just have to base mathematics on nature, not on how it defines nature.

TI Using quantum annealing to design lattice proteins
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Quantum annealing has shown promise for finding solutions to difficult optimization problems, including protein folding. Recently, we used the D-Wave Advantage quantum annealer to explore the folding problem in a coarse-grained lattice model, the HP model, in which amino acids are classified into two broad groups: hydrophobic (H) and polar (P). Using a set of 22 HP sequences with up to 64 amino acids, we demonstrated the fast and consistent identification of the correct HP model ground states using the D-Wave hybrid quantumclassical solver. An equally relevant biophysical challenge, called the protein design problem, is the inverse of the above, where the task is to predict protein sequences that fold to a given structure. Here, we approach the design problem by a two-step procedure implemented and executed on a D-Wave machine. In the first step, we perform a pure sequence-space search by varying the type of amino acid at each sequence position, and seek sequences which minimize the HP-model energy of the target structure. After mapping this task onto an Ising spin-glass representation, we employ a hybrid quantum-classical solver to deliver energy-optimal sequences for structures with 30-64 amino acids, with a 100% success rate. In the second step, we filter the optimized sequences from the first step according to their ability to fold to the intended structure. In addition, we try solving the sequence optimization problem using only the quantum processing unit (QPU), which confines us to sizes .20, due to exponentially decreasing success rates. To shed light on the pure QPU results, we investigate the effects of control errors caused by an imperfect implementation of the intended Hamiltonian on the QPU, by numerically analyzing the Schrodinger equation. We find that the simulated success rates in the presence of control noise semiquantitatively reproduce the modest pure QPU results for larger chains.

SO CURRENT OPINION IN STRUCTURAL BIOLOGY
AB Biomolecular simulation can act as both a digital microscope and a crystal ball; offering the potential for a deeper understanding of experimental observations whilst also presenting a forward-looking avenue for the in silico design and evaluation of hitherto unsynthesized compounds. Indeed, as the intricacy of our scientific inquiries has grown, so too has the computational prowess we seek to deploy in our pursuit of answers. As we enter the Exascale era, this mini-review surveys the computational landscape from both the point of view of the development of new and ever more powerful systems, and the simulations that are run on them. Moreover, as we stand on the cusp of a transformative phase in computational biology, this article offers a contemplative glance into the future, speculating on the profound implications of artificial intelligence and quantum computing for large-scale biomolecular simulations.

TI Entanglement - nonstabilizerness separation in hybrid quantum circuits
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Nonstabilizerness describes the distance of a quantum state to its closest stabilizer state. It is-like entanglement-a necessary resource for a quantum advantage over classical computing. We study nonstabilizerness, quantified by stabilizer entropy, in a hybrid quantum circuit with projective measurements and a controlled injection of non-Clifford resources. We discover a phase transition between a power law and constant scaling of nonstabilizerness with system size controlled by the rate of measurements. The same circuit also exhibits a phase transition in entanglement that appears, however, at a different critical measurement rate. This mechanism shows how, from the viewpoint of a quantum advantage, hybrid circuits can host multiple distinct transitions where not only entanglement, but also other nonlinear properties of the density matrix come into play.

TI Physics-informed tracking of qubit fluctuations
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB Environmental fluctuations degrade the performance of solid-state qubits but can in principle be mitigated by real-time Hamiltonian estimation down to timescales set by the estimation efficiency. We implement a physics-informed and an adaptive Bayesian estimation strategy and apply them in real time to a semiconductor spin qubit. The physics-informed strategy propagates a probability distribution inside the quantum controller according to the Fokker-Planck equation, appropriate for describing the effects of nuclear spin diffusion in gallium arsenide. Evaluating and narrowing the anticipated distribution by a predetermined qubit probe sequence enables improved dynamical tracking of the uncontrolled magnetic field gradient within the singlet-triplet qubit. The adaptive strategy replaces the probe sequence by a small number of qubit probe cycles, with each probe time conditioned on the previous measurement outcomes, thereby further increasing the estimation efficiency. The combined real-time estimation strategy efficiently tracks low-frequency nuclear spin fluctuations in solid-state qubits, and can be applied to other qubit platforms by tailoring the appropriate update equation to capture their distinct noise sources.

   sensing applications
SO REVIEW OF SCIENTIFIC INSTRUMENTS
AB Radio frequency (RF) signals are frequently used in emerging quantum applications due to their spin state manipulation capability. Efficient coupling of RF signals into a particular quantum system requires the utilization of carefully designed and fabricated antennas. Nitrogen vacancy (NV) defects in diamond are commonly utilized platforms in quantum sensing experiments with the optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) method, where an RF antenna is an essential element. We report on the design and fabrication of high efficiency coplanar RF antennas for quantum sensing applications. Single and double ring coplanar RF antennas were designed with -37 dB experimental return loss at 2.87 GHz, the zero-field splitting frequency of the negatively charged NV defect in diamond. The efficiency of both antennas was demonstrated in magnetic field sensing experiments with NV color centers in diamond. An RF amplifier was not needed, and the 0 dB output of a standard RF signal generator was adequate to run the ODMR experiments due to the high efficiency of the RF antennas.

TI The tensor as an informational resource
SO PNAS NEXUS
AB A tensor is a multidimensional array of numbers that can be used to store data, encode a computational relation, and represent quantum entanglement. In this sense, a tensor can be viewed as valuable resource whose transformation can lead to an understanding of structure in data, computational complexity, and quantum information. In order to facilitate the understanding of this resource, we propose a family of information-theoretically constructed preorders on tensors, which can be used to compare tensors with each other and to assess the existence of transformations between them. The construction places copies of a given tensor at the edges of a hypergraph and allows transformations at the vertices. A preorder is then induced by the transformations possible in a given growing sequence of hypergraphs. The new family of preorders generalizes the asymptotic restriction preorder which Strassen defined in order to study the computational complexity of matrix multiplication. We derive general properties of the preorders and their associated asymptotic notions of tensor rank and view recent results on tensor rank nonadditivity, tensor networks, and algebraic complexity in this unifying frame. We hope that this work will provide a useful vantage point for exploring tensors in applied mathematics, physics, and computer science but also from a purely mathematical point of view.

TI Exploring the scaling limitations of the variational quantum eigensolver
   with the bond dissociation of hydride diatomic molecules
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF QUANTUM CHEMISTRY
AB Materials simulations involving strongly correlated electrons pose fundamental challenges to state-of-the-art electronic structure methods but are hypothesized to be the ideal use case for quantum computing algorithms. To date, no quantum computer has simulated a molecule of a size and complexity relevant to real-world applications, despite the fact that the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) algorithm can predict chemically accurate total energies. Nevertheless, because of the many applications of moderately sized, strongly correlated systems, such as molecular catalysts, the successful use of the VQE stands as an important waypoint in the advancement toward useful chemical modeling on near-term quantum processors. In this paper, we take a significant step in this direction. We lay out the steps, write, and run parallel code for an (emulated) quantum computer to compute the bond dissociation curves of the TiH, LiH, NaH, and KH diatomic hydride molecules using the VQE. TiH was chosen as a relatively simple chemical system that incorporates d orbitals and strong electron correlation. Because current VQE implementations on existing quantum hardware are limited by qubit error rates, the number of qubits available, and the allowable gate depth, recent studies using it have focused on chemical systems involving s and p block elements. Through VQE + UCCSD calculations of TiH, we evaluate the near-term feasibility of modeling a molecule with d-orbitals on real quantum hardware. We demonstrate that the inclusion of d-orbitals and the use of the UCCSD ansatz, which are both necessary to capture the correct TiH physics, dramatically increase the cost of this problem. We estimate the approximate error rates necessary to model TiH on current quantum computing hardware using VQE + UCCSD and show them to likely be prohibitive until significant improvements in hardware and error correction algorithms are available.

AB Particle identification is one of most fundamental tools in various particle physics experiments. For the BESIII experiment on the BEPCII, the realization of numerous physical goals heavily relies on advanced particle identification algorithms. In recent years, the emerging of quantum machine learning could potentially arm particle physics experiments with a powerful new toolbox. In this work, targeting at the muon/pion discrimination problem at BESIII, we have developed a quantum SVM classifier for the Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) device. By studying and optimizing various encoding circuits, the quantum SVM trained with the BESIII MC data shows comparable discrimination power than other traditional machine learning models. This has demonstrated the potential of using quantum machine learning techniques to form a new approach for particle identification in particle physics experiments. In this talk, we present the application of the quantum SVM for particle identification at BESIII, and demonstrate how to construct and optimize the quantum kernel. Furthermore, we present results obtained from the noisy simulator as well as the small-scale hardware to show the potential advantage of the quantum SVM algorithm.

TI Coherence fraction in Grover's search algorithm
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB The question of which resources drive the advantages in quantum algorithms has long been a fundamental challenge. While entanglement and coherence are critical to many quantum algorithms, our results indicate that they do not fully explain the quantum advantage achieved by the Grover search algorithm. By introducing a generalized Grover search algorithm, we demonstrate that the success probability depends not only on the querying number of oracles but also on the coherence fraction, which quantifies the fidelity between an arbitrary initial quantum state and the equal superposition state. Additionally, we explore the role of the coherence fraction in the quantum minimization algorithm, which offers a framework for solving complex problems in quantum machine learning. These findings offer insights into the origins of quantum advantage and open pathways for the development of new quantum algorithms.

SO MACHINE LEARNING-SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Machine learning is among the most widely anticipated use cases for near-term quantum computers, however there remain significant theoretical and implementation challenges impeding its scale up. In particular, there is an emerging body of work which suggests that generic, data agnostic quantum machine learning (QML) architectures may suffer from severe trainability issues, with the gradient of typical variational parameters vanishing exponentially in the number of qubits. Additionally, the high expressibility of QML models can lead to overfitting on training data and poor generalisation performance. A promising strategy to combat both of these difficulties is to construct models which explicitly respect the symmetries inherent in their data, so-called geometric quantum machine learning (GQML). In this work, we utilise the techniques of GQML for the task of image classification, building new QML models which are equivariant with respect to reflections of the images. We find that these networks are capable of consistently and significantly outperforming generic ansatze on complicated real-world image datasets, bringing high-resolution image classification via quantum computers closer to reality. Our work highlights a potential pathway for the future development and implementation of powerful QML models which directly exploit the symmetries of data.

TI Benchmarking variational quantum eigensolvers for the
   square-octagon-lattice Kitaev model
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Quantum spin systems may offer the first opportunities for beyond-classical quantum computations of scientific interest. While general quantum simulation algorithms likely require error-corrected qubits, there may be applications of scientific interest prior to the practical implementation of quantum error correction. The variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) is a promising approach to finding energy eigenvalues on noisy quantum computers. Lattice models are of broad interest for use on near-term quantum hardware due to the sparsity of the number of Hamiltonian terms and the possibility of matching the lattice geometry to the hardware geometry. Here, we consider the Kitaev spin model on a hardware-native square-octagon qubit connectivity map, and examine the possibility of efficiently probing its rich phase diagram with VQE approaches. By benchmarking different choices of variational Ansatz states and classical optimizers, we illustrate the advantage of a mixed optimization approach using the Hamiltonian variational Ansatz (HVA) and the potential of probing the system's phase diagram using VQE. We further demonstrate the implementation of HVA circuits on Rigetti's Aspen-9 chip with error mitigation.

TI Circuit complexity of quantum access models for encoding classical data
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB How to efficiently encode classical data is a fundamental task in quantum computing. While many existing works treat classical data encoding as a black box in oracle-based quantum algorithms, their explicit constructions are crucial for the efficiency of practical algorithm implementations. Here, we unveil the mystery of the classical data encoding black box and study the Clifford + T complexity in constructing several typical quantum access models. For general matrices (even including sparse ones), we prove that sparse-access input models and block-encoding both require nearly linear circuit complexities relative to the matrix dimension. We also give construction protocols achieving near-optimal gate complexities. On the other hand, the construction becomes efficient with respect to the data qubit when the matrix is a linear combination of polynomial terms of efficiently implementable unitaries. As a typical example, we propose improved block-encoding when these unitaries are Pauli strings. Our protocols are built upon improved quantum state preparation and a select oracle for Pauli strings, which hold independent values. Our access model constructions provide considerable flexibility, allowing for tunable ancillary qubit numbers and offering corresponding space-time trade-offs.

TI Quantum Low-Density Parity-Check Codes
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Quantum error correction is an indispensable ingredient for scalable quantum computing. In this Perspective we discuss a particular class of quantum codes called "quantum low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes." The codes we discuss are alternatives to the surface code, which is currently the leading candidate to implement quantum fault tolerance. We introduce the zoo of quantum LDPC codes and discuss their potential for making quantum computers robust with regard to noise. In particular, we explain recent advances in the theory of quantum LDPC codes related to certain product constructions and discuss open problems in the field.

TI Synthesizing Quantum-Circuit Optimizers
SO PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACM ON PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES-PACMPL
AB Near-term quantum computers are expected to work in an environment where each operation is noisy, with no error correction. Therefore, quantum-circuit optimizers are applied to minimize the number of noisy operations. Today, physicists are constantly experimenting with novel devices and architectures. For every new physical substrate and for every modification of a quantum computer, we need to modify or rewrite major pieces of the optimizer to run successful experiments. In this paper, we present qeso, an efficient approach for automatically synthesizing a quantum-circuit optimizer for a given quantum device. For instance, in 1.2 minutes, qeso can synthesize an optimizer with high-probability correctness guarantees for ibm computers that significantly outperforms leading compilers, such as ibm's Qiskit and tket, on the majority (85%) of the circuits in a diverse benchmark suite.
   A number of theoretical and algorithmic insights underlie qeso: (1) An algebraic approach for representing rewrite rules and their semantics. This facilitates reasoning about complex symbolic rewrite rules that are beyond the scope of existing techniques. (2) A fast approach for probabilistically verifying equivalence of quantum circuits by reducing the problem to a special form of polynomial identity testing. (3) A novel probabilistic data structure, called a polynomial identity filter (pif), for efficiently synthesizing rewrite rules. (4) A beam-search-based algorithm that efficiently applies the synthesized symbolic rewrite rules to optimize quantum circuits.

TI Quantum Computing for Dealing with Inaccurate Knowledge Related to the
   Certainty Factors Model
SO MATHEMATICS
AB In this paper, we illustrate that inaccurate knowledge can be efficiently implemented in a quantum environment. For this purpose, we analyse the correlation between certainty factors and quantum probability. We first explore the certainty factors approach for inexact reasoning from a classical point of view. Next, we introduce some basic aspects of quantum computing, and we pay special attention to quantum rule-based systems. In this context, a specific use case was built: an inferential network for testing the behaviour of the certainty factors approach in a quantum environment. After the design and execution of the experiments, the corresponding analysis of the obtained results was performed in three different scenarios: (1) inaccuracy in declarative knowledge, or imprecision, (2) inaccuracy in procedural knowledge, or uncertainty, and (3) inaccuracy in both declarative and procedural knowledge. This paper, as stated in the conclusions, is intended to pave the way for future quantum implementations of well-established methods for handling inaccurate knowledge.

TI Analytic Filter-Function Derivatives for Quantum Optimal Control
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB Autocorrelated noise appears in many solid-state qubit systems and hence needs to be taken into account when developing gate operations for quantum information processing. However, explicitly simulating this kind of noise is often less efficient than approximate methods. Here, we focus on the filter function formalism, which allows the computation of gate fidelities in the presence of autocorrelated classical noise. Hence, this formalism can be combined with optimal control algorithms to design control pulses, which optimally implement quantum gates. To enable the use of gradient-based algorithms with fast convergence, we present analytically derived filter function gradients with respect to control pulse amplitudes, and analyze the computational complexity of our results. When comparing pulse optimization using our derivatives to a gradient-free approach, we find that the gradient-based method is roughly 2 orders of magnitude faster for our test cases. We also provide a modular computational implementation compatible with quantum optimal control packages.

TI A review of the study of diamond NV color centers: fabrication,
   application and challenge
SO FUNCTIONAL DIAMOND
AB Nitrogen-vacancy (NV) color centers in diamond have emerged as a focal point in quantum technology research due to their exceptional optical and electronic spin properties. This discovery not only expands our understanding of the material properties of diamond but also paves the way for practical applications in quantum technology. As a solid-state spin quantum system characterized by long electron spin coherence times and stable performance, NV color centers offer distinct advantages in quantum information processing. Recent advancements have enabled the fabrication of high-quality NV color centers with controllable concentration and spatial positioning through techniques such as in situ doping, ion implantation, and hybrid approaches. These technological breakthroughs have significantly enhanced the efficiency of NV center fabrication, thereby establishing a robust foundation for their widespread application in quantum sensing and quantum information technologies. This review provides a comprehensive introduction to the structure and fundamental properties of NV color centers in diamond, an in-depth analysis of recent progress in their fabrication techniques, and a critical discussion of their current applications in quantum science and technology. Additionally, the challenges, open questions, and future research directions in NV color center studies are addressed.

TI A multi-mode free-space delay interferometer with no refractive
   compensation elements for phase-encoded QKD protocols
SO LASER PHYSICS LETTERS
AB We demonstrate a compensation-free approach to the realization of multi-mode delay interferometers, mainly for use in phase-encoded quantum key distribution (QKD). High interference visibility of spatially multi-mode beams in unbalanced Michelson or Mach-Zehnder interferometers with a relatively wide range of delays is achieved by the appropriate choice of the transverse size of the beam. We provide a simple theoretical model that gives a direct connection between the visibility of interference, the delay and the beam parameters. The performed experimental study confirms our theoretical findings and demonstrates measured visibility of up to 0.95 for a delay of 2 ns. Our approach's simplicity and robust performance make it a practical choice for the implementation of QKD systems, where a quantum signal is received over a multi-mode fiber. The important application of such a configuration is an intermodal QKD system, where the free-space atmospheric communication channel is coupled into a span of the multi-mode fiber, delivering the spatially distorted beam to the remote receiver with minimal coupling loss.

TI A Topical Review of Quantum and Classical Machine Learning Approaches to
   Disaster Escape Routing Problems
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB The pathfinding problem in a graph has been solved using several classical algorithms, notably Dijkstra's and A* algorithms. However, most classical algorithms are most effective on static graphs. They either cannot be adapted to dynamic graphs or become computationally expensive. The challenge of processing dynamic graphs, which demands significant computational resources, can be addressed using Classical and Quantum Machine Learning methods. For this review, we consider a dynamically changing graph representing a disaster-stricken city. Our problem, termed the Disaster Escape Routing problem, aims to find the optimal path within this dynamic graph. We review and analyze an existing hybrid quantum-classical machine learning model alongside classical machine learning models specifically for this problem. We also explore Variational Quantum Circuits and Encoding Methods. Our study suggests that hybrid quantum-classical machine learning, Graph Neural Networks, and Temporal Graph Networks offer high performance in terms of path prediction and accuracy in finding the optimal path. This review also identifies Kolmogorov Arnold Networks as a promising approach to solving escape routing problems. Additionally, an integrated approach combining strengths of all the models has been hypothesized to enhance emergency escape route planning.

TI Redundantly Amplified Information Suppresses Quantum Correlations in
   Many-Body Systems
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB We establish bounds on quantum correlations in many-body systems. They reveal what sort of information about a quantum system can be simultaneously recorded in different parts of its environment. Specifically, independent agents who monitor environment fragments can eavesdrop only on amplified and redundantly disseminated???hence, effectively classical???information about the decoherence-resistant pointer observable. We also show that the emergence of classical objectivity is signaled by a distinctive scaling of the conditional mutual information, bypassing hard numerical optimizations. Our results validate the core idea of quantum Darwinism: objective classical reality does not need to be postulated and is not accidental, but rather a compelling emergent feature of quantum theory that otherwise???in the absence of decoherence and amplification???leads to ???quantum weirdness.??? In particular, a lack of consensus between agents that access environment fragments is bounded by the information deficit, a measure of the incompleteness of the information about the system.

AB The remarkable sensitivity of non-Hermitian systems has been extensively studied and stimulated ideas about developing new types of sensors. In this paper, we examine a chain of parametrically driven coupled resonators governed by the squeezed Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model. We emphasize the qualitative difference in sensor performance between configurations depending on bulk topology and boundary modes, specifically for detecting both on-site and non-Hermitian skin effect perturbations. Our analysis goes beyond the scenario of infinitesimal perturbations, extending to arbitrary perturbation strengths beyond the linear response regime. We stress the importance of optimizing the system's parameters to achieve quantum enhancement while avoiding fine-tuned regimes that could limit the practical applicability of this system for real-world quantum sensing.

TI Scalable hyperfine qubit state detection via electron shelving in the
   2D5/2 and
   2F7/2 manifolds in
   171Yb+
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Qubits encoded in hyperfine states of trapped ions are ideal for quantum computation given their long lifetimes and low sensitivity to magnetic fields, yet they suffer from off-resonant scattering during detection, often limiting their measurement fidelity. In Yb-171(+) this is exacerbated by a low fluorescence yield, which leads to a need for complex and expensive hardware, a problematic bottleneck especially when scaling up the number of qubits. We demonstrate a detection routine based on electron shelving to address this issue in Yb-171(+) and achieve a 5.6x reduction in single-ion detection error on an avalanche photodiode to 1.8(2) x 10(-3) in a 100 mu s detection period and a 4.3x error reduction on an electron multiplying CCD camera with 7.7(2) x 10(-3) error in 400 mu s. We further improve the characterization of a repump transition at 760 nm to enable a more rapid reset of the auxiliary F-2(7/2) states populated after shelving. Finally, we examine the detection fidelity limit using the long-lived F-2(7/2) state, achieving further 300x and 12x reductions in error to 6(7) x 10(-6) and 6.3(3) x 10(-4) in 1 ms on the respective detectors. While shelving-rate limited in our setup, we suggest various techniques to realize this detection method at speeds compatible with quantum information processing, providing a pathway to ultrahigh-fidelity detection in Yb-171(+).

TI Qubit Assignment Using Time Reversal
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB As quantum computers with large numbers of qubits become increasingly available, experiments exe-cuted on a given device may not utilize all available qubits. In this case, the outcome of executing a quantum program will depend on the ability to efficiently select a subset of high-performing physical qubits. For any given quantum program and device there are many ways to assign physical qubits for execution of the program, and assignments will differ in performance due to the variability in quality across qubits and entangling operations on a single device. Evaluating the performance of each assign-ment using fidelity estimation introduces significant experimental overhead and will be infeasible for many applications, while relying on standard device benchmarks provides incomplete information about the performance of any specific program. Furthermore, the number of possible assignments grows com-binatorially in the number of qubits on the device and in the program, motivating the use of heuristic optimization techniques. We demonstrate a practical solution to the problem of qubit assignment by using simulated annealing with a cost function based on the Loschmidt echo, a diagnostic that measures the reversibility of a quantum process. We provide theoretical justification for this choice of cost function by demonstrating that the optimal qubit assignment coincides with the optimal qubit assignment based on state fidelity in the weak error limit, and we provide experimental justification using diagnostics performed on Google's superconducting qubit devices. We then establish the performance of simulated annealing for qubit assignment using classical simulations of noisy devices as well as optimization experiments per-formed on a quantum processor. Our results demonstrate that the use of Loschmidt echoes and simulated annealing provides a scalable and flexible approach to optimizing qubit assignment on near-term hardware.

We study primordial gravitational waves (PGWs) during inflation in the presence of magnetic fields sustained by a gauge kinetic coupling.

They become entangled with each other through graviton to photon conversion and vice versa. We derive the reduced density matrix for the gravitons and calculate their entanglement entropy. It turns out that the state of the gravitons is not a squeezed state but a mixed state. Although witnessing such an entanglement is not feasible at present, it would be an important experimental challenge.

TI Security enhancement of amplitude-shift keying-type asymmetric quantum
   communication systems
SO QUANTUM INFORMATION PROCESSING
AB Recently, we proposed an amplitude-shift keying asymmetric quantum communication system and evaluated its reliability when using the quasi-Bell state and two-mode squeezed vacuum state (TSVS) as an entangled light source. In this paper, we evaluate the security of the system and find that either security or reliability can be enhanced depending on the entangled light sources. We also consider an approach to enhance the security of the system as well as its reliability by increasing the number of signal modes. Interestingly, we find that the quasi-Bell state always performs better than the TSVS under certain conditions.

TI A Characterization of Quantum Generative Models
SO ACM TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM COMPUTING
AB Quantum generative modeling is a growing area of interest for industry-relevant applications. This work systematically compares a broad range of techniques to guide quantum computing practitioners when deciding which models and methods to use in their applications. We compare fundamentally different architectural ansatzes of parametric quantum circuits: (1) A continuous architecture, which produces continuous valued data samples, and (2) a discrete architecture, which samples on a discrete grid. We also compare the performance of different data transformations: the min-max and the probability integral transforms. We use two popular training methods: (1) quantum circuit Born machines (QCBM), and (2) quantum generative adversarial networks (QGAN). We study their performance and tradeoffs as the number of model parameters increases, with a baseline comparison of similarly trained classical neural networks. The study is performed on six low-dimensional synthetic and two real financial data sets. Our two key findings are that: (1) For all data sets, our quantum models require similar or fewer parameters than their classical counterparts. In the extreme case, the quantum models require two orders of magnitude less parameters. (2) We empirically find that a variant of the discrete architecture, which learns the copula of the probability distribution, outperforms all other methods.

TI Variational quantum algorithm for enhanced continuous variable optical
   phase sensing
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) are hybrid quantum-classical approaches used for tackling a wide range of problems on noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices. Testing these algorithms on relevant hardware is crucial to investigate the effect of noise and imperfections and to assess their practical value. Here, we implement a variational algorithm designed for optimized parameter estimation on a continuous variable platform based on squeezed light, a key component for high-precision optical phase estimation. We investigate the ability of the algorithm to identify the optimal metrology process, including the optimization of the probe state and measurement strategy for small-angle optical phase sensing. Two different optimization strategies are employed, the first being a gradient descent optimizer using Gaussian parameter shift rules to estimate the gradient of the cost function directly from the measurements. The second strategy involves a gradient-free Bayesian optimizer, fine-tuning the system using the same cost function and trained on the data acquired through the gradient-dependent algorithm. We find that both algorithms can steer the experiment towards the optimal metrology process. However, they find minima not predicted by our theoretical model, demonstrating the strength of variational algorithms in modelling complex noise environments, a non-trivial task.

TI Sequential device-independent certification of indefinite causal order
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Indefinite causal order has found numerous applications in quantum computation, quantum communication, and quantum metrology. Before its usage, the quality of the indefinite causal order needs to be first certified, and the certification should ideally be device independent (DI) to avoid the impact of device imperfections. In this work, we initiate the study of the sequential DI certification of an indefinite causal order. This can be useful in experimental platforms where the generation of an indefinite causal order is difficult. We show that an arbitrary number of sequential DI certifications of an indefinite causal order can be achieved with a quantum switch and also analyze practical requirements for experimental implementations of the certifications. Our work opens the possibility of reusing the resource of an indefinite causal order multiple times in device-independent quantum information processing.

TI Characterization of Traveling-Wave Josephson Parametric Amplifiers at
   T=0.3 K
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON APPLIED SUPERCONDUCTIVITY
AB The growing interest in quantum technologies, from fundamental physics experiments to quantum computing, demands for extremely performing electronics only adding the minimum amount of noise admitted by quantum mechanics to the input signal (i.e., quantum-limited electronics). Superconducting microwave amplifiers, due to their dissipationless nature, exhibit outstanding performances in terms of noise (quantum limited), and gain. However, bandwidth and saturation power still show space for substantial improvement. Within the DARTWARS(1) collaboration, we are developing state-of-the-art microwave superconducting amplifiers based on Josephson junction arrays and on distributed kinetic inductance transmission lines. Here we report the realization of a setup for the characterization of the performances of Josephson traveling-wave parametric amplifiers at a temperature of 300 mK. Although in the final experimental setup, these amplifiers will operate at a base temperature of about 20 mK, their characterization at 300 mK allows to evidence the main aspects of their performances, but the ultimate noise level. This represents a quick and relatively inexpensive way to test these superconductive devices that can be of help to improve their design and fabrication.

TI Breakdown of the Weak-Coupling Limit in Quantum Annealing
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB Reverse annealing is a variant of quantum annealing, in which the system is prepared in a classical state, reverse annealed to an inversion point, and then forward annealed. We report on reverse annealing experiments using the D-Wave 2000Q device, with a focus on the p = 2 p-spin problem, which undergoes a second-order quantum phase transition with a gap that closes polynomially in the number of spins. We concentrate on the total and partial success probabilities, with the latter being the probabilities of finding each of two degenerate ground states of all spins up or all spins down, and the former being their sum. The empirical partial success probabilities exhibit a strong asymmetry between the two degenerate ground states, depending on the initial state of the reverse anneal. To explain these results, we perform open-system simulations using master equations in the limits of weak and strong coupling to the bath. The former, known as the adiabatic master equation, with decoherence in the instantaneous energy eigenbasis, predicts perfect symmetry between the two degenerate ground states, thus failing to agree with the experiment. In contrast, the latter, known as the polaron transformed Redfield equation, is in close agreement with experiment. Thus, our results present a challenge to the sufficiency of the weak system-bath coupling limit in describing the dynamics of current experimental quantum annealers, at least for reverse annealing on timescales of a microsecond or longer.

TI Noisy quantum metrology with the assistance of indefinite causal order
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB A generic qubit unitary operator affected by depolarizing noise is duplicated and inserted in a quantum switch process, realizing a superposition of causal orders. The characterization of the resulting switched quantum channel is worked out for its action on the joint state of the probe-control qubit pair. The switched channel is then specifically investigated for the important metrological task of phase estimation on the noisy unitary operator, with the performance assessed by the Fisher information, classical or quantum. A comparison is made with conventional techniques of estimation where the noisy unitary is directly probed in a one-stage or two-stage cascade with definite order or several uses of them with two or more qubits. In the switched channel with indefinite order, specific properties are reported, meaningful for estimation and not present with conventional techniques. It is shown that the control qubit, although it never directly interacts with the unitary, can nevertheless be measured alone for effective estimation, while discarding the probe qubit that interacts with the unitary. Also, measurement of the control qubit maintains the possibility of efficient estimation in difficult conditions where conventional estimation becomes less efficient, as for instance with ill-configured input probes, or in blind situations when the axis of the unitary is unknown. Effective estimation by measuring the control qubit remains possible even when the input probe tends to align with the axis of the unitary, or with a fully depolarized input probe, while in these conditions conventional estimation becomes inoperative. Measurement of the probe qubit of the switched channel is also analyzed and shown to add useful capabilities for phase estimation. The results contribute to the ongoing identification and analysis of the properties and capabilities of switched quantum channels with indefinite order for information processing and uncover new possibilities for quantum estimation and qubit metrology.

AB Stationary quantum information sources emit sequences of correlated qudits-that is, structured quantum stochastic processes. If an observer performs identical measurements on a qudit sequence, the outcomes are a realization of a classical stochastic process. We introduce quantum-information-theoretic properties for separable qudit sequences that serve as bounds on the classical information properties of subsequent measured processes. For sources driven by hidden Markov dynamics, we describe how an observer can temporarily or permanently synchronize to the source's internal state using specific positive operator-valued measures or adaptive measurement protocols. We introduce a method for approximating an information source with an independent and identically distributed, Markov, or larger memory model through tomographic reconstruction. We identify broad classes of separable processes based on their quantum information properties and the complexity of measurements required to synchronize to and accurately reconstruct them.

TI Modeling and analysis of quantum communication channel in airborne
   platforms with boundary layer effects
SO OPEN PHYSICS
AB The establishment of secure global communication links is fundamentally dependent on the support of airborne platforms. However, the transmission of quantum signals from these platforms faces significant challenges related to boundary layer (BL) effects. This article presents an improved channel loss calculation model that effectively incorporates these BL effects in airborne environment. The model takes into account detailed variations in beam width, scintillation index, and transmission efficiency within the airborne environment. The results indicate that BL effects have an impact on the beam width and scintillation index, highlighting the need to maximize the receiver aperture within payload capacity constraints. In addition, the analysis shows that the supersonic BL results in greater losses and higher error rates compared to the transonic BL. Furthermore, atmospheric turbulence is identified as the primary factor that reduces transmission efficiency when transmitting over long distances in the airborne environment.

TI Tracking spin qubit frequency variations over 912 days
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Solid-state qubits are sensitive to their microscopic environment, causing the qubit properties to fluctuate on a wide range of timescales. The sub-Hz end of the spectrum is usually dealt with by repeated background calibrations, which bring considerable overhead. It is thus important to characterize and understand the low-frequency variations of the relevant qubit characteristics. In this study, we investigate the stability of spin qubit frequencies in the Si/SiGe quantum dot platform. We find that the calibrated qubit frequencies of a six-qubit device vary by up to +/- 100 MHz while performing a variety of experiments over a span of 912 days. These variations are sensitive to the precise voltage settings of the gate electrodes, however when these are kept constant to within 15 mu V, the qubit frequencies vary by less than +/- 7 MHz over periods up to 36 days. During overnight scans, the qubit frequencies of ten qubits across two different devices show a standard deviation below 200 kHz within a 1-hour time window. The qubit frequency noise spectral density shows roughly a 1/f trend above 10-4 Hz and, strikingly, a steeper trend at even lower frequencies.

TI Robust entangling gate for capacitively coupled few-electron
   singlet-triplet qubits
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB The search for a sweet spot, the locus in qubit parameters where quantum control is first-order insensitive to noises, is key to achieve high-fidelity quantum gates. Efforts to search for such a sweet spot in conventional double-quantum-dot singlet-triplet qubits where each dot hosts one electron ( "two-electron singlet-triplet qubit "), especially for two-qubit operations, have been unsuccessful. Here we consider singlet-triplet qubits allowing each dot to host more than one electron, with a total of four electrons in the double quantum dots ( "four-electron singlet-triplet qubit "). We theoretically demonstrate, using configuration interaction calculations, that sweet spots appear in this coupled qubit system. We further demonstrate that, under realistic charge noise and hyperfine noise, a two-qubit operation at the proposed sweet spot could offer gate fidelities (-99%) that are higher than the conventional two-electron singlet-triplet qubit system (-90%). Our results should facilitate realization of high-fidelity two-qubit gates in singlet-triplet qubit systems.

TI DECOHERENCE IN A PT-SYMMETRIC QUBIT
SO UKRAINIAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB We investigate the decoherence in a PT-symmetric qubit coupled with a bosonic bath. Using canonical transformations, we map the non-Hermitian Hamiltonian representing the PT-symmetric qubit to a spin boson model. Identifying the parameter alpha that demarcates the hermiticity and non-hermiticity in the model, we show that the qubit does not decohere at the transition from the real eigen spectrum to a complex eigen spectrum. Using a general class of spectral densities, the strong suppression of the decoherence is observed due to both vacuum and thermal fluctuations of the bath, and the initial correlations hold, as we approach the transition point.

TI Practical Quantum Advantage on Partially Fault-Tolerant Quantum Computer
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW X
AB Achieving quantum speedups in practical tasks remains challenging for current noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices. These devices always encounter significant obstacles such as inevitable physical errors and the limited scalability of current near-term algorithms. Meanwhile, assuming a typical architecture for fault-tolerant quantum computing (FTQC), realistic applications inevitably require a vast number of qubits, typically exceeding 10(6), which seems far beyond near-term realization. In this work, to bridge the gap between the NISQ and FTQC eras, we propose an alternative approach to achieve practical quantum advantages on early-FTQC devices. Our framework is based on partially fault-tolerant logical operations to minimize spatial overhead and avoids the costly distillation techniques typically required for executing non-Clifford gates. To this end, we develop a space-time efficient state preparation protocol to generate an ancillary non-Clifford state consumed for implementing an analog rotation gate with an arbitrary small angle theta and a remarkably low worst-case error rate below O(|theta|P-ph), where P-ph is the physical error rate. Furthermore, we propose several error suppression schemes tailored to our preparation protocol, which are essential to minimize the overhead for mitigating errors. Based on this framework, we present several promising applications that leverage the potential of our framework, including the Trotter simulation and quantum phase estimation (QPE). Notably, we demonstrate that our framework allows us to perform the QPE for an (8 x 8)-site Hubbard model with fewer than 6.8 x 10(4) qubits and an execution time of 10.6 days (or 14 min with full parallelization) under P-ph = 10(-4), which is significantly faster than recent classical estimation with tensor network techniques (density matrix renormalization group and projected entangled pair states).

TI Correlated dynamics of three-body Rydberg superatoms
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB Owing to the long lifetime of Rydberg atom, easy to operate and easy to control the interaction between Rydberg atoms, Rydberg atom has attracted considerable attention in quantum information and quantum optics fields. Specially, the anti-blockade effect, as a physical resource, can be used to implement various tasks in quantum information processing. Based on the rigid dipole blockade, an ensemble of two-level Rydberg atoms trapped in three magneto-optical traps can be regarded as a superatom. Based on the superatom model, the in-phase and anti-phase dynamics of the three-body Rydberg superatoms are studied by adjusting the numbers of atoms, and the W state and two kinds of maximal entangled states are generated simultaneously. Our work has great potential applications in coherent manipulation and quantum information processing.The numerical simulations are performed based on the superatom model and thereby the formidable obstacle that the Hilbert space dimension grows exponentially with the particle number increasing can be completely removed. As a result, the quantum control and quantum entanglement can be achieved from the single-quanta level to the mesoscopic level.

TI Continuous Quantum Gate Sets and Pulse-Class Meta-Optimization
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Reduction of the circuit depth of quantum circuits is a crucial bottleneck to enabling quantum tech-nology. This depth is inversely proportional to the number of available quantum gates that have been synthesized. Moreover, quantum gate-synthesis and control problems exhibit a vast range of external parameter dependencies, both physical and application specific. In this paper, we address the possibil-ity of learning families of optimal-control pulses that depend adaptively on various parameters, in order to obtain a global optimal mapping from the space of potential parameter values to the control space and hence to produce continuous classes of gates. Our proposed method is tested on different experimen-tally relevant quantum gates and proves capable of producing high-fidelity pulses even in the presence of multiple variables or uncertain parameters with wide ranges.

TI Quantum algorithm for the Vlasov simulation of the large-scale structure
   formation with massive neutrinos
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Investigating the cosmological implication of the fact that neutrino has finite mass is of importance for fundamental physics. In particular, massive neutrino affects the formation of the large-scale structure (LSS) of the universe, and, conversely, observations of the LSS can give constraints on the neutrino mass. Numerical simulations of the LSS formation including massive neutrino along with conventional cold dark matter is thus an important task. For this, calculating the neutrino distribution in the phase space by solving the Vlasov equation is a suitable approach, but it requires solving the PDE in the ( 6 + 1)-dimensional space and is thus computationally demanding: Configuring n(gr) grid points in each coordinate and n(t) time grid points leads to O(n(gr)(6)r) memory space and O(n(t)n(gr)(6)) queries to the coefficients in the discretized PDE. We propose a quantum algorithm for this task. Linearizing the Vlasov equation by neglecting the relatively weak self-gravity of the neutrino, we perform the Hamiltonian simulation to produce quantum states that encode the phase-space distribution of neutrino. We also propose a way to extract the power spectrum of the neutrino density perturbations as classical data from the quantum state by quantum amplitude estimation with accuracy is an element of and query complexity of order (N) over tilde O[(n(gr) + n(t))/ is an element of]. Our method also reduces the space complexity to O[polylog(n(gr)/ is an element of)] in terms of the qubit number, while using quantum random access memories with O(n(gr)(3)) entries. As far as we know, this is the first quantum algorithm for the LSS simulation that outputs the quantity of practical interest with guaranteed accuracy.

TI Quantum support vector data description for anomaly detection
SO MACHINE LEARNING-SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Anomaly detection is a critical problem in data analysis and pattern recognition, finding applications in various domains. We introduce quantum support vector data description (QSVDD), an unsupervised learning algorithm designed for anomaly detection. QSVDD utilizes a shallow-depth quantum circuit to learn a minimum-volume hypersphere that tightly encloses normal data, tailored for the constraints of noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) computing. Simulation results on the MNIST and Fashion MNIST image datasets, as well as credit card fraud detection, demonstrate that QSVDD outperforms both quantum autoencoder and deep learning-based approaches under similar training conditions. Notably, QSVDD requires an extremely small number of model parameters, which increases logarithmically with the number of input qubits. This enables efficient learning with a simple training landscape, presenting a compact quantum machine learning model with strong performance for anomaly detection.

TI Few-photon all-optical phase rotation in a quantum-well micropillar
   cavity
SO NATURE PHOTONICS
AB Photonic platforms are an excellent setting for quantum technologies as weak photon-environment coupling ensures long coherence times. The second key ingredient for quantum photonics is interactions between photons, which can be provided by optical nonlinearities in the form of cross-phase modulation. This approach underpins many proposed applications in quantum optics(1-7) and information processing(8), but achieving its potential requires strong single-photon-level nonlinear phase shifts as well as scalable nonlinear elements. In this work we show that the required nonlinearity can be provided by exciton-polaritons in micropillars with embedded quantum wells. These combine the strong interactions of excitons(9,10) with the scalability of micrometre-sized emitters(11). We observe cross-phase modulation of up to 3 +/- 1 mrad per polariton using laser beams attenuated to below the average intensity of a single photon. With our work serving as a stepping stone, we lay down a route for quantum information processing in polaritonic lattices.

Numerous countries and research institutes have invested enormous resources to execute correlation studies on QKD networks. Thus, in this study, we surveyed existing QKD network studies and practical field experiments to summarize the research results (e.g., type and architecture of QKD networks, key generating rate, maximum communication distance, and routing protocol). Furthermore, we highlight the three challenges and future research issues in the security of QKD networks and then provide some feasible resolution strategies for these challenges.

TI Quantum neural networks under depolarization noise: exploring white-box
   attacks and defenses
SO QUANTUM MACHINE INTELLIGENCE
AB Leveraging the unique properties of quantum mechanics, quantum machine learning (QML) promises computational breakthroughs and enriched perspectives where traditional systems reach their boundaries. However, similarly to classical machine learning, QML is not immune to adversarial attacks. Quantum adversarial machine learning has become instrumental in highlighting the weak points of QML models when faced with adversarial crafted feature vectors. Diving deep into this domain, our exploration shines a light on the interplay between depolarization noise and adversarial robustness. While previous results enhanced robustness from adversarial threats through depolarization noise, our findings paint a different picture. Interestingly, adding depolarization noise discontinued the effect of providing further robustness for a multi-class classification scenario. Consolidating our findings, we conducted experiments with a multi-class classifier adversarially trained on gate-based quantum simulators, further elucidating this unexpected behavior.

This method works with an averaging readout scheme and does not require a single-shot readout setup. We validate this protocol by performing thermometry in the range of 50-200 mK, corresponding to a range of residual populations 1%-20% for the first excited state and 0.02%-3% for the second excited state.

TI Fluorescent Nanodiamonds Based Theranostic Platform for pH-Sensitive
   Drug Delivery and Quantum Sensing
SO ADVANCED FUNCTIONAL MATERIALS
AB Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women worldwide. Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) is particularly problematic due to the poor prognosis and limited treatment options. Here, nanodiamond particles are synthesized for delivering the cancer drug Diazoxide (DZX) to TNBC cells. The multifunctional nanodiamond (ND) platform integrates pH-sensitive drug release and advanced quantum sensing capabilities, enabling precise drug delivery and monitoring of intracellular redox dynamics. Due to the nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in the diamond particles, they can be imaged. Further, quantum sensing is demonstrated specifically at the location where the drug is released. After 24 h of treatment at 10 mu g mL-1 diamond-DZX complex (equivalent to 2.75 mu M DZX), diamond relaxometry reveals a decreased radical load in the endo/lysosomal regions, while MitoSOX fluorescence indicates elevated mitochondrial ROS (O2 -) levels, suggesting the activation of intracellular redox homeostasis. By combining controlled drug delivery with advanced quantum sensing, this work provides novel insights into DZX's mechanism of action, particularly its role in modulating mitochondrial ROS and cellular redox balance. This multifunctional nanoplatform demonstrates significant potential for advancing targeted cancer therapy and redox biology research.

First, our algorithm has complexity independent of the number of terms L in the Hamiltonian. Second, unlike previous L-independent approaches, such as those based on qDRIFT, all algorithmic errors in our method can be suppressed by collecting more data samples, without increasing the circuit depth.

Given a set of fixed reducing pure states, we study the linear combinations of them, such that they all have the same marginal states with the given ones. We define the so-called Hadamard set of quantum states whose Gram-Schmidt matrix can be diagonalized by Hadamard unitary matrices. We show that any Hadamard set can be deterministically masked by a unitary operation. We analyze the states which can be masked together with the given Hadamard set using the result about the linear combinations of fixed reducing states.

TI Beating one bit of communication with quantum correlations in smaller
   dimensions
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB As a consequence of Bell's theorem, the statistics of measurements on some entangled states cannot be simulated with local hidden variables alone. The amount of communication that must be supplied is an intuitive quantifier of nonclassicality. While it is obvious that this amount can be very large in general, it has been surprisingly difficult to find simple examples of quantum correlations, whose simulation requires more than one bit of communication. In this paper, we report the simplest example to date, which lives in the (5,2,5,5) Bell scenario [the previously known smallest case living in the (7,3,16,16) scenario]. The proof is built on the observation that finding the largest 1-bit score is equivalent to finding the bipartition of the inputs, in which the sum of the local scores of the two subgames is maximal.

AB The influence of magnon bands on entanglement in the antiferromagnetic XXZ model on a triangular lattice, which models the bilayer structure consisting of an antiferromagnetic insulator and normal metal, is investigated. This effect was studied in ferromagnetic as well as antiferromagnetic triangular lattices. Quantum entanglement measures given by the entanglement negativity have been studied, where a magnon current is induced in the antiferromagnet due to interfacial exchange coupling between localized spins in the antiferromagnet and itinerant electrons in a normal metal. Moreover, quantum correlations in other frustrated models, namely the metal-insulation antiferromagnetic bilayer model and the Heisenberg model with biquadratic and bicubic interactions, are analyzed.

TI Functional calculus of quantum channels for the holomorphic discrete
   series of SU(1,1)
SO JOURNAL OF FUNCTIONAL ANALYSIS
AB The tensor product of two holomorphic discrete series representations of SU(1, 1) can be decomposed as a direct multiplicity-free sum of infinitely many holomorphic discrete series representations. I shall introduce equivariant quantum channels for each component of the direct sum by mapping the tensor product of an operator and the identity onto the projection onto one of the irreducible components, generalizing the construction of pure equivariant quantum channels for compact groups. Then I calculate the functional calculus of this operator for polynomials and prove a limit formula for the trace of the functional calculus for any differentiable function. The methods I used are the theory of reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces and a Plancherel theorem for the disk D = SU(1, 1)/U(1), together with exact constants for the eigenvalues of the Berezin transform. I prove that the limit of the trace of the functional calculus can be expressed using generalized Husimi functions or using Berezin transforms. (c) 2025 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Inc.

TI Many-Body Thermal States on a Quantum Computer: A Variational Approach
SO CROSSROAD OF MAXWELL DEMON
SE Advances in Atom and Single Molecule Machines
AB Many-body quantum states at thermal equilibrium are ubiquitous in nature. Investigating their dynamical properties is a formidable task due to the complexity of the Hilbert space they live in. Quantum computers may have the potential to effectively simulate quantum systems, provided that the many-body state under scrutiny can be faithfully prepared via an efficient algorithm. With this aim, we present a hybrid quantum-classical variational quantum algorithm for the preparation of the Gibbs state of the quantum XY model. Our algorithm is based on the Grover and Rudolph parametrized quantum circuit for the preparation of the Boltzmann weights of the Gibbs state, and on a parity-preserving ansatz for the allocation of the eigenenergy basis to their respective Boltzmann weight. We explicitly show, with a paradigmatic few-body case instance, how the symmetries of a many-body system can be exploited to significantly reduce the exponentially increasing number of variational parameters needed in the Grover and Rudolph algorithm. Finally, we show that the density matrix, of the Gibbs state of the XY model, obtained by statevector simulations for different parameters, exhibits a fidelity close to unity with the exact Gibbs state; this highlights the potential use of our protocol on current quantum computers.

TI Detecting the purely imaginary Fisher zeros of an Ising spin system on a
   quantum computer
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB We propose a protocol for studying the purely imaginary Fisher zeros of the Ising model on a quantum computer. Our protocol is based on the direct relation between the partition function for purely imaginary temperature and the evolution operator of the Ising model. In this case, the inverse temperature is equal to the time of evolution. This protocol allows one to measure the zeros only those localized on the imaginary axes. We test this protocol on the ibm-lagos quantum computer in the cases of a 3-spin chain and a triangle cluster in a purely imaginary magnetic field, as well as a 7-spin cluster in which the interaction between spins reproduces the architecture of the quantum computer.

TI Quantum Sensing with Extreme Light
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB Optical nonlinear conversion processes are ubiquitously applied to scientific as well as industrial tasks. In particular, nonlinear processes are employed to generate radiation in many frequency ranges. In plenty of these nonlinear processes, the generation of paired photons occurs - the so-called signal and idler photons. Although this type of generation has undergone a tremendous development over the last decades, either the generated signal or the idler radiation has been used experimentally. In contrast, novel quantum-based measurement principles enable the usage of both partners of the generated photon pairs based on their correlation. These measurement approaches have an enormous potential for future applications, as they allow to transfer information from one spectral range to another. In particular, spectral ranges where photon generation and detection is particularly challenging can benefit from this principle. Above all, these include the extreme frequency ranges, such as on the low-frequency side the mid to far infrared or even the terahertz spectral range, but also on the high-frequency side the ultraviolet or X-ray spectral range. In this review article, theoretical and experimental developments based on correlated biphotons are described specifically for the extreme spectral regions.

TI Resource theory of quantum uncomplexity
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Quantum complexity is emerging as a key property of many-body systems, including black holes, topological materials, and early quantum computers. A state's complexity quantifies the number of computational gates required to prepare the state from a simple tensor product. The greater a state's distance from maximal complexity, or "uncomplexity," the more useful the state is as input to a quantum computation. Separately, resource theories-simple models for agents subject to constraints-are burgeoning in quantum information theory. We unite the two domains, confirming Brown and Susskind's conjecture that a resource theory of uncomplexity can be defined. The allowed operations, fuzzy operations, are slightly random implementations of two-qubit gates chosen by an agent. We formalize two operational tasks, uncomplexity extraction and expenditure. Their optimal efficiencies depend on an entropy that we engineer to reflect complexity. We also present two monotones, uncomplexity measures that decline monotonically under fuzzy operations, in certain regimes. This work unleashes on many-body complexity the resource-theory toolkit from quantum information theory.

TI Simple and maximally robust processes with no classical common-cause or
   direct-cause explanation
SO QUANTUM
AB Guided by the intuition of coherent superposition of causal relations, recent works presented quantum processes without classical common-cause and directcause explanation, that is, processes which cannot be written as probabilistic mixtures of quantum common-cause and quantum direct-cause relations (CCDC). In this work, we analyze the minimum requirements for a quantum process to fail to admit a CCDC explanation and present "simple" processes, which we prove to be the most robust ones against general noise. These simple processes can be realized by preparing a maximally entangled state and applying the identity quantum channel, thus not requiring an explicit coherent mixture of common-cause and direct-cause, exploiting the possibility of a process to have both relations simultaneously. We then prove that, although all bipartite direct-cause processes are bipartite separable operators, there exist bipartite separable processes which are not direct-cause. This shows that the problem of deciding whether a process is direct-cause is not equivalent to entanglement certification and points out the limitations of entanglement methods to detect non-classical CCDC processes. We also present a semi-definite programming hierarchy that can detect and quantify the non-classical CCDC robustnesses of every non-classical CCDC process. Among other results, our numerical methods allow us to show that the simple processes presented here are likely to be also the maximally robust against white noise. Finally, we explore the equivalence between bipartite direct-cause processes and bipartite processes without quantum memory, to present a separable process which cannot be realized as a process without quantum memory.

AB We analyze the coexistence of continuous variable quantum key distribution (CV-QKD) and 8x200Gb/s 16-QAM classical channels, evaluating parameters such as quantum channel spectral position, classical channel power, guard-band, and the number of exchanged quantum symbols. Additionally, we assess the performance of classical signals in terms of bit error rate (BER) to jointly analyze the impact of coexistence on both classical and quantum channels. These parameters can be exposed to a Software Defined Network (SDN) controller to dynamically optimize the performance of the CV-QKD system. Our results demonstrate that CV-QKD achieves successful key generation with a 100 GHz guard-band with classical channels at -10 dBm and 200 GHz at 0 dBm. The channel position within the spectrum has minimal impact, and lower key rates for short distances do not necessitate asymptotic convergence in quantum symbols. [-20, -10] dBm per channel with 100 GHz guard-band provides error-free classical signals and positive key generation.

TI Dynamics of the Interaction Between Two Coherent States in a Cavity with
   Finite Temperature Decay
SO DYNAMICS
AB In this study, we present an exact solution to the Lindblad master equation describing the interaction of two quantized electromagnetic fields in a decaying cavity coupled to a thermal reservoir at a finite temperature. The solution is obtained using the superoperator technique, leveraging commutation relations to factorize the exponential of the Lindblad superoperators into a product of exponentials. To demonstrate the applicability of this approach, we analyze the dynamics of the system both analytically and numerically for two initial conditions: nonentangled and entangled coherent states, exploring their temporal evolution. Additionally, we employ entropy and quantum discord analysis to characterize quantum correlations and analyze the behavior of entanglement (or lack thereof) during the evolution. This comprehensive analysis provides valuable insights into the behavior of open quantum systems and their interaction with the environment.

TI Emergent symmetry in a two-Higgs-doublet model from quantum information
   and nonstabilizerness
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
AB Studies of scattering processes in scalar models with two Higgs doublets have recently hinted at a connection between the absence of flavor-space entanglement in Phi+Phi 0 scattering and an emergent SO(8) symmetry in the scalar potential. We extend the analysis to all scattering channels with two particles in the external states by treating the process as a four-qubit system in the weak isospin and flavor subspaces of the two-particle state. We work with a generic quantum-information-theoretic principle encoded by the commutativity of the initial-state density matrix with the transition matrix (at leading order in perturbation theory). This yields a special case of the entanglement minimization conditions previously derived in the literature, and we interpret the principle in terms of the conservation of nonstabilizerness (or "magic"). Working at leading order in the quartic couplings, we find a consistent set of conditions that implies an SO(8) symmetry on the quartic part of the potential for scattering an arbitrary initial state but a smaller SU(2)R symmetry when the initial state is chosen to have definite isospin. This follows by accounting for Bose symmetry in the initial state, which introduces entanglement between the isospin and flavor subspaces.

TI Technological diversity of quantum computing providers: a comparative
   study and a proposal for API Gateway integration
SO SOFTWARE QUALITY JOURNAL
AB After decades of advances, mainly theoretical, in recent years quantum computing has begun to show its first practical applications. This new and revolutionary technology aims to enhance essential areas such as cybersecurity, financial services, or medicine. The growth of this technology has encouraged different research centers and big companies such as IBM, Amazon, and Google to dedicate considerable efforts to developing new technologies that bring quantum computing to the market. However, these technologies are not yet mature and create a significant vendor lock-in problem. Therefore, new tools are needed that facilitate access to this technology and that allow developers to increase the abstraction level at which they work. Given that the integration of quantum software should not be very different from that of classical services, we can take advantage of the knowledge acquired and use current techniques of service-oriented computing. In this work, we have carried out a technical comparison between different quantum computing service providers using a case study, by performing empirical tests based on the Travelling Salesman Problem. This study highlights the differences between the main providers. To address these differences and reduce the vendor lock-in effect, we propose an extension of the Quantum API Gateway to support the different providers and the casuistry that each one presents. This would allow programmers to deploy quantum code without vendor-specific knowledge of the major providers, which would facilitate access and simplify the development of quantum applications.

TI Testing Platform-Independent Quantum Error Mitigation on Noisy Quantum
   Computers
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM ENGINEERING
AB We apply quantum error mitigation (QEM) techniques to a variety of benchmark problems and quantum computers to evaluate the performance of QEM in practice. To do so, we define an empirically motivated, resource-normalized metric of the improvement of error mitigation, which we call the improvement factor, and calculate this metric for each experiment we perform. The experiments we perform consist of zero-noise extrapolation and probabilistic error cancellation applied to two benchmark problems run on IBM, IonQ, and Rigetti quantum computers, as well as noisy quantum computer simulators. Our results show that error mitigation is, on average, more beneficial than no error mitigation-even when normalized by the additional resources used-but also emphasize that the performance of QEM depends on the underlying computer.

TI Classical Simulability of Quantum Circuits with Shallow Magic Depth
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Quantum magic is a necessary resource for quantum computers to be not efficiently simulable by classical computers. Previous results have linked the amount of quantum magic, characterized by the number of T gates or the stabilizer rank, to classical simulability. However, the effect of the distribution of quantum magic on the hardness of simulating a quantum circuit remains open. In this work, we investigate the classical simulability of quantum circuits with alternating Clifford and T layers across three tasks: amplitude estimation, sampling, and evaluating Pauli observables. In the case in which all T gates are distributed in a single layer, performing amplitude estimation and sampling to multiplicative error are already classically intractable under reasonable assumptions, but Pauli observables are easy to evaluate. Surprisingly, with the addition of just one T-gate layer or merely replacing all T gates with T1/2, the Pauli evaluation task reveals a sharp complexity transition from being in P to being GapP-complete. Nevertheless, when the precision requirement is relaxed to 1/poly(n) additive error, we are able to give a polynomial-time classical algorithm to compute amplitudes, Pauli observables, and sampling from log(n)-sized marginal distributions for any magic-depth-1 circuit that is decomposable into a product of diagonal gates. This rules out certain forms of quantum advantage in these circuits. Our research provides new techniques to simulate highly magical circuits while shedding light on their complexity and their significant dependence on the magic depth.

TI Mechanism of defect formation in the quantum annealing of the random
   transverse-field Ising chain
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB Based on the strong-disorder renormalization group method, a microscopic mechanism of defect formation in the quantum annealing of the random transverse-field Ising chain is proposed, which represents the annealing process as a gradual aggregation of strongly coupled spin clusters. The ferromagnetic ground state of clusters is either preserved or gets excited in pairwise fusions of clusters, depending on the effective annealing rate of the fusion, the latter events being responsible for the appearance of defects in the final state. A consequence of the theory is that, although the Griffiths-McCoy phases surrounding the critical point are gapless, they are still effectively gapped from the point of view of quantum annealing. Thereby, we provide an explanation of the finiteness of the gap outside the critical point, which was implicit in an early approach to the problem by Kibble-Zurek scaling [Dziarmaga, Phys. Rev. B 74, 064416 (2006)]. Furthermore, by identifying the accessible excitations, we refine the functional form of the vanishing of the gap at the critical point. The defect density in the final state is found to decrease with the annealing time tau, as n(tau)similar to ln-2(tau ln2 tau) for large tau. In addition to this, our approach gives access also to the density of defects at intermediate times of the annealing process.

TI Shaping quantum photonic states using free electrons
SO SCIENCE ADVANCES
AB It is a long-standing goal to create light with unique quantum properties such as squeezing and entanglement. We propose the generation of quantum light using free-electron interactions, going beyond their already ubiquitous use in generating classical light. This concept is motivated by developments in electron microscopy, which recently demonstrated quantum free-electron interactions with light in photonic cavities. Such electron microscopes provide platforms for shaping quantum states of light through a judicious choice of the input light and electron states. Specifically, we show how electron energy combs implement photon displacement operations, creating displaced-Fock and displaced-squeezed states. We develop the theory for consecutive electron-cavity interactions with a common cavity and show how to generate any target Fock state. Looking forward, exploiting the degrees of freedom of electrons, light, and their interaction may achieve complete control over the quantum state of the generated light, leading to novel light statistics and correlations.

TI Toward simulating superstring/M-theory on a quantum computer
SO JOURNAL OF HIGH ENERGY PHYSICS
AB We present a novel framework for simulating matrix models on a quantum computer. Supersymmetric matrix models have natural applications to superstring/M-theory and gravitational physics, in an appropriate limit of parameters. Furthermore, for certain states in the Berenstein-Maldacena-Nastase (BMN) matrix model, several supersymmetric quantum field theories dual to superstring/M-theory can be realized on a quantum device. Our prescription consists of four steps: regularization of the Hilbert space, adiabatic state preparation, simulation of real-time dynamics, and measurements. Regularization is performed for the BMN matrix model with the introduction of energy cut-off via the truncation in the Fock space. We use the Wan-Kim algorithm for fast digital adiabatic state preparation to prepare the low-energy eigenstates of this model as well as thermofield double state. Then, we provide an explicit construction for simulating real-time dynamics utilizing techniques of block-encoding, qubitization, and quantum signal processing. Lastly, we present a set of measurements and experiments that can be carried out on a quantum computer to further our understanding of superstring/M-theory beyond analytic results.

TI On the Logical Error Rate of Sparse Quantum Codes
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM ENGINEERING
AB The quantum paradigm presents a phenomenon known as degeneracy that can potentially improve the performance of quantum error correcting codes. However, the effects of this mechanism are sometimes ignored when evaluating the performance of sparse quantum codes and the logical error rate is not always correctly reported. In this article, we discuss previously existing methods to compute the logical error rate and we present an efficient coset-based method inspired by classical coding strategies to estimate degenerate errors and distinguish them from logical errors. Additionally, we show that the proposed method presents a computational advantage for the family of Calderbank-Shor-Steane codes. We use this method to prove that degenerate errors are frequent in a specific family of sparse quantum codes, which stresses the importance of accurately reporting their performance. Our results also reveal that the modified decoding strategies proposed in the literature are an important tool to improve the performance of sparse quantum codes.

TI Coherent Light Shift on Alkaline-Earth Rydberg Atoms from Isolated Core
   Excitation without Autoionization
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB New experimental quantum simulation platforms have recently been implemented with divalent atoms trapped in optical tweezer arrays, with promising performance. The second valence electron also brings about new prospects through the so-called isolated core excitation (ICE). However, autoionization presents a strong limitation to this use. In this study, we propose and demonstrate a new approach to applying a sizable light shift to a Rydberg state with close-to-resonant ICE while avoiding autoionization. In particular, we investigate the ICE of ytterbium atoms in S-1(0) Rydberg states. Spectroscopic studies of the induced autoionization and the light shift imparted to the Rydberg states are well accounted for with multichannel quantum defect theory. Such control over the inner electron without disturbing the Rydberg electron brings about a new tool for the targeted coherent manipulation of Rydberg states in quantum simulation or quantum computing experiments performed with alkaline-earth atoms.

TI Real-time polarization compensation method in quantum communication
   based on channel Muller parameters detection
SO COMMUNICATIONS ENGINEERING
AB Polarization drift in fiber and free-space optical links is a major factor in the dynamic increase of bit error rate in polarization-coded quantum key distribution (QKD) systems. A dynamic polarization compensation method applicable to both links is a challenge. Here we propose a universally applicable real-time polarization compensation method, that the Muller parameters of the optical links are first detected using a polarization detector, and then the optimal parameters of the controller are obtained by gradient descent algorithm. Simulation results indicate advantages over current methods, with fewer waveplates, faster speed, and wider applicability for various optical links. In equivalent experiments of both satellite and fiber optical links, the average polarization extinction ratio of 27.9 dB and 32.2 dB are respectively achieved. The successful implementation of our method will contribute to the real-time polarization design of fiber and free-space QKD systems, while also contributing to the design of laser-based polarization systems.

TI Nonreciprocity and Quantum Correlations of Light Transport in Hot Atoms
   via Reservoir Engineering
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB The breaking of reciprocity is a topic of great interest in fundamental physics and optical information processing applications. We demonstrate nonreciprocal light transport in a quantum system of hot atoms by engineering the dissipative atomic reservoir. Our scheme is based on the phase-sensitive light transport in a multichannel photon-atom interaction configuration, where the phase of collective atomic excitations is tunable through external driving fields. Remarkably, we observe interchannel quantum correlations that originate from interactions with the judiciously engineered reservoir. The nonreciprocal transport in a quantum optical atomic system constitutes a new paradigm for atom-based nonreciprocal optics and offers opportunities for quantum simulations with coupled optical channels.

TI Nb/a-Si/Nb-Junction Josephson Arbitrary Waveform Synthesizers for
   Quantum Information
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON APPLIED SUPERCONDUCTIVITY
AB We demonstrate Josephson arbitrary waveform synthesizers (JAWS) with increased operating temperature range for temperatures below 4 K. These JAWS synthesizers were fabricated with externally-shunted Nb/alpha-Si/Nb junctions whose critical current exhibits improved temperature stability compared to the self-shunted Nb/Nb0.15Si0.85/Nb junctions typically used. Vertical stud resistors made of 230 nm of PdAu were developed to provide the milliohm shunt resistance required for junction overdamping while maintaining a small footprint suitable for high-density series arrays embedded in a coplanar waveguide. We evaluated the performance of these resistors from 3.8 K down to 20 mK. We designed, fabricated and tested a JAWS circuit with 4650 externally shunted Nb/alpha-Si/Nb JJs with a critical current density (J(c)) of 0.12 mA/mu m(2) and critical current (I-c) of 3 mA. This circuit was designed to be mounted to the 3 K stage of a dilution refrigerator and used to control and calibrate a qubit mounted at the 10 mK stage. To increase the circuit density of the JAWS circuits we made arrays of two-junction vertical stacks. Current-voltage (I-V) curves of this JAWS circuit with stacked junctions under microwave excitation show Shapiro steps with quantum-locking ranges similar to those of JAWS circuits used for qubit control.

TI Fault-tolerant double-circular connectivity pattern for quantum
   stabilizer codes
SO EPJ QUANTUM TECHNOLOGY
AB Recently, the circular connectivity pattern has been presented for a class of stabilizer quantum error correction codes. The circular connectivity pattern for such a class of stabilizer codes can be implemented in a resource-efficient manner using a single ancilla and native two-qubit Controlled-Not-Swap gates (CNS) gates, which may be interesting for demonstrating error-correction codes with superconducting quantum processors. However, one concern is that this scheme is not fault-tolerant. And it might not apply to the Calderbank-Shor-Steane (CSS) codes. In this paper, we present a fault-tolerant version of the circular connectivity pattern, named the double-circular connectivity pattern. This pattern is an implementation for syndrome-measurement circuits with a flagged error correction scheme for stabilizer codes. We illustrate that this pattern is available for Steane code (a CSS code), Laflamme's five-qubit code, and Shor's nine-qubit code. For Laflamme's five-qubit code and Shor's nine-qubit code, the pattern has the property that it uses only native two-qubit CNS gates, which are more efficient in the superconducting quantum platform.

TI Deterministic remote entanglement using a chiral quantum interconnect
SO NATURE PHYSICS
AB Quantum interconnects facilitate entanglement distribution between non-local computational nodes in a quantum network. For superconducting processors, microwave photons are a natural means to mediate this distribution. However, many existing architectures limit node connectivity and directionality. In this work, we construct a chiral quantum interconnect between two nominally identical modules in separate microwave packages. Our approach uses quantum interference to emit and absorb microwave photons on demand and in a chosen direction between these modules. We optimize our protocol using model-free reinforcement learning to maximize the absorption efficiency. By halting the emission process halfway through its duration, we generate remote entanglement between modules in the form of a four-qubit W state with approximately 62% fidelity in each direction, limited mainly by propagation loss. This quantum network architecture enables all-to-all connectivity between non-local processors for modular and extensible quantum simulation and computation.

TI Two-photon interference: the Hong-Ou-Mandel effect
SO REPORTS ON PROGRESS IN PHYSICS
AB Nearly 30 years ago, two-photon interference was observed, marking the beginning of a new quantum era. Indeed, two-photon interference has no classical analogue, giving it a distinct advantage for a range of applications. The peculiarities of quantum physics may now be used to our advantage to outperform classical computations, securely communicate information, simulate highly complex physical systems and increase the sensitivity of precise measurements. This separation from classical to quantum physics has motivated physicists to study two-particle interference for both fermionic and bosonic quantum objects. So far, two-particle interference has been observed with massive particles, among others, such as electrons and atoms, in addition to plasmons, demonstrating the extent of this effect to larger and more complex quantum systems. A wide array of novel applications to this quantum effect is to be expected in the future. This review will thus cover the progress and applications of two-photon (two-particle) interference over the last three decades.

TI Binarization of grayscale quantum image denoted with novel enhanced
   quantum representations
SO RESULTS IN PHYSICS
AB This paper proposes a new algorithm for binarizing the grayscale quantum images represented by novel enhanced quantum image representation(NEQR) through pixel qubit flipping. The algorithm consists of two steps: the first step performs the qubit state checking, and the second completes pixel qubit flipping based on the results in previous step. The key data analysis shows that our algorithm has the following advantages, which include: (1) Contrasting with the probable algorithm, the result of this paper is deterministic( without error). (2) Comparing with the latest result, our paper has some superior characters: fewer quantum gates, fewer auxiliary qubits and less quantum delay.

TI Platform tailored codesign of gate-based quantum simulation
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB The utility of near-term quantum computers and simulators is likely to rely upon software-hardware codesign, with error-aware algorithms and protocols optimized for the platforms they are run on. Here, we show how knowledge of noise in a system can be exploited to improve the design of gate-based quantum simulation algorithms. We demonstrate this codesign in the context of a trapped ion quantum simulation of the dynamics of a Heisenberg spin model. Specifically, we derive a theoretical noise model describing unitary gate errors due to heating of the ions' collective motion, finding that the temporal correlations in the noise induce an optimal gate depth. We then illustrate how tailored feedforward control, best applied at this optimum, can be used to partially mitigate unitary gate errors and improve the simulation outcome. Our results provide a practical guide to the codesign of gate-based quantum simulation algorithms.

TI Variational quantum classifiers through the lens of the Hessian
SO PLOS ONE
AB In quantum computing, the variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) are well suited for finding optimal combinations of things in specific applications ranging from chemistry all the way to finance. The training of VQAs with gradient descent optimization algorithm has shown a good convergence. At an early stage, the simulation of variational quantum circuits on noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices suffers from noisy outputs. Just like classical deep learning, it also suffers from vanishing gradient problems. It is a realistic goal to study the topology of loss landscape, to visualize the curvature information and trainability of these circuits in the existence of vanishing gradients. In this paper, we calculate the Hessian and visualize the loss landscape of variational quantum classifiers at different points in parameter space. The curvature information of variational quantum classifiers (VQC) is interpreted and the loss function's convergence is shown. It helps us better understand the behavior of variational quantum circuits to tackle optimization problems efficiently. We investigated the variational quantum classifiers via Hessian on quantum computers, starting with a simple 4-bit parity problem to gain insight into the practical behavior of Hessian, then thoroughly analyzed the behavior of Hessian's eigenvalues on training the variational quantum classifier for the Diabetes dataset. Finally, we show how the adaptive Hessian learning rate can influence the convergence while training the variational circuits.

TI Reverse Reconciliation for Optimal Error Correction in Quantum Key
   Distribution
SO SYMMETRY-BASEL
AB In this work, we introduce a new method for the establishment of a symmetric secret key through the reconciliation process in QKD systems that, we claim, is immune to the error rate of the quantum channel and, therefore, has an efficiency of 100% since it does not present losses during the distillation of secret keys. Furthermore, the secret rate is scaled to the square of the number of pulses on the destination side. The method only requires a single data exchange from Bob over the classic channel. We affirmed that our results constitute a milestone in the field of QKD and error correction methods at a crucial moment in the development of classical and quantum cryptanalytic algorithms. We believe that the properties of our method can be evaluated directly since it does not require the use of complex formal-theoretical techniques. For this purpose, we provide a detailed description of the reconciliation algorithm. The strength of the method against PNS and IR attacks is discussed. Furthermore, we define a method to analyze the security of the reconciliation approach based on frames that are binary arrays of 2x2. As a result, we came to the conclusion that the conjugate approach can no longer be considered secure, while we came up with a way to increase the secret gain of the method with measured bits.

TI A mid-circuit erasure check on a dual-rail cavity qubit using the
   joint-photon number-splitting regime of circuit QED
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Quantum control of a linear oscillator using a static dispersive coupling to a nonlinear ancilla underpins a wide variety of experiments in circuit QED. Extending this control to more than one oscillator while minimizing the required connectivity to the ancilla would enable hardware-efficient multi-mode entanglement and measurements. We show that the spectrum of an ancilla statically coupled to a single mode can be made to depend on the joint photon number in two modes by applying a strong parametric beamsplitter coupling between them. This 'joint-photon number-splitting' regime extends single-oscillator techniques to two-oscillator control, which we use to realize a hardware-efficient erasure check for a dual-rail qubit encoded in two superconducting cavities. This scheme leverages the high-fidelity beamsplitter coupling already required for single- and two-qubit gates while permitting minimal crosstalk between circuit elements. Furthermore, the flexibility to choose the pulse shape allows us to limit the susceptibility to different error channels. We use this scheme to detect leakage errors with a missed erasure fraction of (9.0 +/- 0.5) x 10-4 while incurring an erasure rate of 2.92 +/- 0.01% and a Pauli error rate of 0.31 +/- 0.01%, both of which are dominated by cavity errors.

TI Quantum correlations in a mixed spin-(1/2,1) Heisenberg dimer
SO JOURNAL OF MAGNETISM AND MAGNETIC MATERIALS
AB In this article, we consider the heterodinuclear complex [Ni(dpt)(H2O)Cu(pba)] center dot 2H(2)O [pba =1,3-propylenebis (oxamato) and dpt = bis-(3-aminopropyl)amine] realized through the theoretical model of mixed spin-(1/2,1) coupled via Heisenberg interaction. We study the behaviors of thermal quantum correlations of the above material via Measurement-Induced Nonlocality (MIN) based on Hilbert-Schmidt norm and fidelity. We observe that the quantum correlation measures increase with the magnetic field in an unconventional way. The role of system parameters is also brought out at thermal equilibrium. The highlight of the results is that we are able to show the existence of room temperature quantum correlation using fidelity based MIN whereas the entanglement ceases to exist at 141 K.

TI 16 x 8 quantum dot array operation at cryogenic temperatures
SO JAPANESE JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS
AB We developed a 16 x 8 quantum dot array and CMOS circuit hybrid chip (Q-CMOS). By optimizing the transistor design of Q-CMOS formed by fully depleted (FD)-SOI, it is possible to selectively control each of 16 x 8 quantum dots, and obtained characteristics of quantum dot variation for the first time. Due to the mesoscopic effect, the variation in the characteristics of the quantum dots is larger than the threshold voltage variation of the transistors. Thus, we have obtained an important finding that it is necessary to suppress the variability in order to realize a large-scale quantum computer. We have also confirmed that the characteristics of the quantum dots change depending on the applied gate voltages.

AB This paper presents a 12-bit cryogenic successive-approximation (SAR) ADC designed in 22nm FD SOI technology for quantum computing. An auto-zeroing technique and dual comparators in alternate working mode are implemented to eliminate signal-dependent comparator offset under cryogenic conditions. In addition, full forward body biasing (FBB) with flipped well scheme is employed to compensates for increased threshold voltage Vth induced by ultra-low temperature. Compared to the previous works, this is the first reported high-resolution SAR ADC which deals with cryogenic environment in advanced technology node. Post-layout simulation results show the ADC achieves a FoM(w) of 26 fJ/step, 71.68 dB SNDR and 83.76 dB SFDR at the Nyquist input frequency of 4.96MHz.

TI Simultaneous Basis and Information Reconciliation in Quantum Key
   Distribution
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB We consider in this paper the practical implementation of a siftingless quantum key distribution protocol. The protocol is considered siftingless since it combines sifting and error correction in a single step for basis and information reconciliation, respectively. The protocol can be efficiently implemented even assuming the existence of errors in the communication. In this case, the correlations between the legitimate parties can be modeled by a binary symmetric channel with erasures. Specific codes for this channel are included and simulated for intermediate block lengths. Simulation results show that a key reconciliation step carrying simultaneously both basis and information reconciliation can be efficiently implemented.

TI Extending the European Competence Framework for Quantum Technologies:
   new proficiency triangle and qualification profiles
SO EPJ QUANTUM TECHNOLOGY
AB With the increasing industrial relevance of quantum technologies (QTs), a new quantum workforce with special qualification will be needed. Building this workforce requires educational efforts, ranging from short term training to degree programs. In order to plan, map and compare such efforts, personal qualifications or job requirements, standardization is necessary. The European Competence Framework for Quantum Technologies (CFQT) provides a common language for QT education. The 2024 update to version 2.5 extends it by the new proficiency triangle and qualification profiles: The proficiency triangle proposes six proficiency levels for three proficiency areas, specifying knowledge and skills for each level. Nine qualification profiles show prototypical qualifications or job roles relevant to the quantum industry, with the required proficiency, examples, and suggestions. This is an important step towards the standardization of QT education. The CFQT update is based on the results of an analysis of 34 interviews on industry needs. The initial findings from the interviews were complemented by iterative refinement and expert consultation.

TI Entanglement and quantum correlation measures for quantum multipartite
   mixed states
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Entanglement, and quantum correlation, are precious resources for quantum technologies implementation based on quantum information science, such as quantum communication, quantum computing, and quantum interferometry. Nevertheless, to our best knowledge, a directly or numerically computable measure for the entanglement of multipartite mixed states is still lacking. In this work, (i) we derive a measure of the degree of quantum correlation for mixed multipartite states. The latter possesses a closed-form expression valid in the general case unlike, to our best knowledge, all other known measures of quantum correlation. (ii) We further propose an entanglement measure, derived from this quantum correlation measure using a novel regularization procedure for the density matrix. Therefore, a comparison of the proposed measures, of quantum correlation and entanglement, allows one to distinguish between quantum correlation detached from entanglement and the one induced by entanglement and, hence, to identify separable but non-classical states. We have tested our quantum correlation and entanglement measures, on states well-known in literature: a general Bell diagonal state and the Werner states, which are easily tractable with our regularization procedure, and we have verified the accordance between our measures and the expected results for these states. Finally, we validate the two measures in two cases of multipartite states. The first is a generalization to three qubits of the Werner state, the second is a one-parameter three qubits mixed state interpolating between a bi-separable state and a genuine multipartite state, passing through a fully separable state.

TI A Quantum Annealing Bat Algorithm for Node Localization in Wireless
   Sensor Networks
SO SENSORS
AB Node localization in two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) space for wireless sensor networks (WSNs) remains a hot research topic. To improve the localization accuracy and applicability, we first propose a quantum annealing bat algorithm (QABA) for node localization in WSNs. QABA incorporates quantum evolution and annealing strategy into the framework of the bat algorithm to improve local and global search capabilities, achieve search balance with the aid of tournament and natural selection, and finally converge to the best optimized value. Additionally, we use trilateral localization and geometric feature principles to design 2D (QABA-2D) and 3D (QABA-3D) node localization algorithms optimized with QABA, respectively. Simulation results show that, compared with other heuristic algorithms, the convergence speed and solution accuracy of QABA are greatly improved, with the highest average error of QABA-2D reduced by 90.35% and the lowest by 17.22%, and the highest average error of QABA-3D reduced by 75.26% and the lowest by 7.79%.

TI Local Invariance of Divergence-Based Quantum Information Measures
SO ENTROPY
AB Quantum information quantities, such as mutual information and entropies, are essential for characterizing quantum systems and protocols in quantum information science. In this contribution, we identify types of information measures based on generalized divergences and prove their invariance under local isometric or unitary transformations. Leveraging the reversal channel for local isometries together with the data-processing inequality, we establish invariance for information quantities used in both asymptotic and one-shot regimes without relying on the specific functional form of the underlying divergence. These invariances can be applied to improve the computation of such information quantities or optimize protocols and their output states, whose performance is determined by some invariant measure. Our results improve the capability to characterize and compute many operationally relevant information measures with application across the field of quantum information processing.

SO QUANTUM INFORMATION & COMPUTATION
AB We investigate the Lambda-polytopes, a convex-linear structure recently defined and applied to the classical simulation of quantum computation with magic states by sampling. There is one such polytope, Lambda(n) for every number n of qubits. We establish two properties of the family {Lambda(n), n is an element of N}, namely (i) Any extremal point (vertex) A(alpha) is an element of Lambda(m) can be used to construct vertices in Lambda(n), for all n > m. (ii) For vertices obtained through this mapping, the classical simulation of quantum computation with magic states can be efficiently reduced to the classical simulation based on the preimage A(alpha). In addition, we describe a new class of vertices in Lambda(2) which is outside the known classification. While the hardness of classical simulation remains an open problem for most extremal points of Lambda(n), the above results extend efficient classical simulation of quantum computations beyond the presently known range.

   Purcell enhanced generation of indistinguishable single photons and
   quantum information processing
SO OPTICS COMMUNICATIONS
AB Integrated photonic circuits are an integral part of all-optical and on-chip quantum information processing and quantum computer. Deterministically integrated single-photon sources in nanoplasmonic circuits lead to densely packed scalable quantum logic circuits operating beyond the diffraction limit. Here, we report the coupling efficiency of single-photon sources to the plasmonic waveguide, characteristic transmission spectrum, propagation length, decay length, and plasmonic Purcell factor. We simulated the transmission spectrum to find the appropriate wavelength for various width of the dielectric in the metal-dielectric-metal waveguide. We find the maximum propagation length of 3.98 mu m for Al2O3 dielectric-width equal to 140 nm and coupling efficiency to be greater than 82%. The plasmonic Purcell factor was found to be inversely proportional to dielectric-width (w), reaching as high as 31974 for w equal to 1 nm. We also calculated quantum properties of the photons like indistinguishability and found that it can be enhanced by plasmonic-nanocavity if single-photon sources are deterministically coupled. We further, propose a scalable metal-dielectric-metal waveguide based quantum logic circuits using the plasmonic circuit and Mach-Zehnder interferometer.

TI Quantum amplitude-amplification operators
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB In this work, we show the characterization of quantum iterations that would generally construct quantum amplitude-amplification algorithms with a quadratic speedup, namely, quantum amplitude-amplification operators (QAAOs). Exact quantum search algorithms that find a target with certainty and with a quadratic speedup can be composed of sequential applications of QAAOs: existing quantum amplitude-amplification algorithms thus turn out to be sequences of QAAOs. We show that an optimal and exact quantum amplitude-amplification algorithm corresponds to the Grover algorithm together with a single iteration of QAAO. We then realize three-qubit QAAOs with current quantum technologies via cloud-based quantum computing services, IBMQ and IonQ. Finally, our results show that the fixed-point quantum search algorithms known so far are not a sequence of QAAOs; for example, the amplitude of a target state may decrease during quantum iterations.

TI Near-optimal quantum circuit construction via Cartan decomposition
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We show the applicability of the Cartan decomposition of Lie algebras to quantum circuits. This approach can be used to synthesize circuits that can efficiently implement any desired unitary operation. Our method finds explicit quantum circuit representations of the algebraic generators of the relevant Lie algebras allowing the direct implementation of a Cartan decomposition on a quantum computer. The construction is recursive and allows us to expand any circuit down to generators and rotation matrices on individual qubits, where through our recursive algorithm we find that the generators themselves can be expressed with controlled-NOT (CNOT) and SWAP gates explicitly. Our approach is independent of the standard CNOT implementation and can be easily adapted to other cross-qubit circuit elements. In addition to its versatility, we also achieve near-optimal counts when working with CNOT gates, achieving an asymptotic CNOT cost of 21164n for n qubits.

TI Nanoscale Trapping of Interlayer Excitons in a 2D Semiconductor
   Heterostructure
SO NANO LETTERS
AB For quantum technologies based on single excitons and spins, the deterministic placement and control of a single exciton is a longstanding goal. MoSe2-WSe2 heterostructures host spatially indirect interlayer excitons (IXs) that exhibit highly tunable energies and unique spin-valley physics, making them promising candidates for quantum information processing. Previous IX trapping approaches involving moire ' superlattices and nanopillars do not meet the quantum technology requirements of deterministic placement and energy tunability. Here, we use a nanopatterned graphene gate to create a sharply varying electric field in close proximity to a MoSe2-WSe2 heterostructure. The dipole interaction between the IX and the electric field creates an similar to 20 nm trap. The trapped IXs show the predicted electric-field-dependent energy, saturation at low excitation power, and increased lifetime, all signatures of strong spatial confinement. The demonstrated architecture is a crucial step toward the deterministic trapping of single IXs, which has broad applications to scalable quantum technologies.

TI Recent Advances in Nonclassical Effects in Hybrid Cavity Magnonic
   Systems (Invited)
SO ACTA OPTICA SINICA
AB Significance Hybrid quantum systems, which integrate multiple physical degrees of freedom and enhance nonlinear interactions, have emerged as a promising frontier in quantum science and technology. Among various platforms, cavity magnonic systems-where magnons (collective spin excitations in ferromagnets such as yttrium iron garnet, YIG) couple coherently with microwave photons, optical photons, mechanical phonons, and superconducting qubits-offer unique advantages due to their high spin density, low damping rate, and tunability via external magnetic fields. This versatility enables the construction of highly integrated quantum architectures for information processing, communication, and sensing. The fundamental mechanisms enabling hybridization in cavity magnonic systems include magnetic dipole coupling between magnons and microwave photons, magneto-optical effects linking magnons to optical photons, magnetostrictive interactions with mechanical vibrations, and electric dipole interactions with superconducting qubits. Key experimental achievements include the demonstration of strong magnon-photon coupling in three-dimensional copper microwave cavities, coherent bidirectional conversion between microwave and optical photons mediated by magnons, and magnetostrictive magnon-phonon coupling. These advances establish cavity magnonic systems as versatile platforms for exploring novel quantum phenomena and realizing coherent quantum control at the mesoscale. A central quantum resource in these systems is the generation of nonclassical states, such as single-quantum sources (single photons, magnons, and phonons) and entangled states. Quantum blockade effects-photon blockade and magnon blockade-serve as fundamental mechanisms for preparing single-quantum sources, which are essential for secure quantum communication, scalable quantum computation, and precision metrology. Conventional blockade relies on anharmonic energy levels induced by strong nonlinearities, while unconventional blockade exploits quantum interference among multiple excitation pathways, enabling blockade even under weak nonlinearity or weak coupling. Extending these concepts to cavity magnonic systems is challenging due to typically weak magnon-photon couplings and losses, especially in the optical domain. Recent theoretical and experimental progress has shown that Kerr nonlinearities, parametric amplification, and hybrid dissipative-coherent couplings offer new pathways to overcome these limitations. In particular, Kerr nonlinearity in cavity magnonic systems allows high-purity single-photon and single-magnon generation under weak coupling by extending the parameter range for conventional photon and magnon blockade. Parametric amplification introduces additional excitation pathways, enhancing quantum interference and improving blockade effects. Furthermore, in open cavity magnonic systems, the interplay between coherent and dissipative couplings enables robust steady-state entanglement and unidirectional quantum steering, which exhibit resilience against environmental noise and thermal fluctuations. Hybrid quantum systems, through the integration of multiple physical degrees of freedom and enhanced nonlinear responses, show great potential in quantum information processing and quantum control. Recent studies based on cavity optomagnonic, electromagnonic, and optomechanical platforms have advanced both theoretical understanding and experimental realization of nonclassical effects.
   This review systematically addresses key aspects of nonclassical state manipulation in cavity-based hybrid quantum systems, from quantum blockade to entanglement and steering mechanisms. For quantum blockade, various schemes based on Kerr nonlinearity and parametric amplification-induced interference are discussed in detail, enabling high-purity single-quantum sources even under weak coupling and nonlinearity. For entanglement and steering, recent progress in generating steady-state entanglement and directional steering via non-Hermitian mechanisms-using coexisting coherent and dissipative couplings-is reviewed, emphasizing robustness against thermal noise and dissipation. This review not only summarizes representative results from the authors' research in recent years but also aligns with international advances in quantum control and device implementation. It aims to provide theoretical insight and inspiration for further studies on nonclassical effects in hybrid quantum systems and to promote the coordinated development of multiphysics-integrated quantum platforms. Progress Significant experimental and theoretical advances have been achieved in this field. Early key experiments include the work by Tabuchi et al. (2014), who demonstrated strong coupling between the Kittel-mode magnon in a YIG sphere and microwave photons in a 3D copper cavity at cryogenic temperatures, showing clear mode splitting proportional to the square root of the total spin number (Fig. 1). Subsequent studies by Hisatomi et al. and Osada et al. realized bidirectional coherent conversion between microwave and optical photons mediated by magnons via the Faraday effect and Brillouin scattering, respectively (Fig. 2). Tang et al. experimentally verified magnon-phonon coupling through magnetostrictive interactions in YIG spheres (Fig. 3). Tabuchi's group also constructed hybrid systems integrating magnons and superconducting transmon qubits in microwave cavities, demonstrating coherent magnon-qubit interactions mediated by virtual photons (Fig. 4). The photon blockade effect, essential for single-photon sources, was first observed in atomic-cavity systems by Birnbaum et al. (2005) and later extended to other platforms. Conventional photon blockade requires anharmonic energy levels and strong nonlinearity, which are challenging to achieve in many systems. Unconventional blockade mechanisms utilize quantum interference but often struggle to fully suppress multi-quantum excitations. In cavity-magnon systems, recent theoretical proposals have explored conventional and magnon blockade using Kerr and cross-Kerr nonlinearities to realize high-purity, high-brightness single-quantum sources (Figs. 6, 9, and 13). These studies employ master equation approaches and second-order correlation functions to demonstrate blockade in both strong and weak coupling regimes. Moreover, the interplay between coherent and dissipative couplings has been shown to generate directional quantum correlations such as one-way quantum steering, which is robust against dissipation and environmental noise (Fig. 15). This opens new possibilities for device-independent quantum key distribution and asymmetric quantum information processing. Conclusions and Prospects Hybrid cavity magnonic systems provide a rich platform for exploring and harnessing nonclassical quantum phenomena involving magnons, photons, phonons, and qubits. Their multi-mode coupling enables flexible quantum control strategies beyond the limitations of single-mode systems.
   Advances in magnon blockade and quantum steering pave the way toward scalable, high-purity single-magnon sources and directional quantum devices. Future research may focus on integrating topological effects, exploring non-Hermitian dynamics, and developing robust quantum networks using magnonic interfaces. Rapid progress in experimental techniques and theoretical models indicates that practical magnon-based quantum technologies-with potential impacts on quantum communication, sensing, and computation-are on the horizon.

TI Quantum adiabatic theorem for unbounded Hamiltonians with a cutoff and
   its application to superconducting circuits
SO PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY A-MATHEMATICAL PHYSICAL
   AND ENGINEERING SCIENCES
AB We present a new quantum adiabatic theorem that allows one to rigorously bound the adiabatic timescale for a variety of systems, including those described by originally unbounded Hamiltonians that are made finite-dimensional by a cutoff. Our bound is geared towards the qubit approximation of superconducting circuits and presents a sufficient condition for remaining within the 2n-dimensional qubit subspace of a circuit model of n qubits. The novelty of this adiabatic theorem is that, unlike previous rigorous results, it does not contain 2n as a factor in the adiabatic timescale, and it allows one to obtain an expression for the adiabatic timescale independent of the cutoff of the infinite-dimensional Hilbert space of the circuit Hamiltonian. As an application, we present an explicit dependence of this timescale on circuit parameters for a superconducting flux qubit and demonstrate that leakage out of the qubit subspace is inevitable as the tunnelling barrier is raised towards the end of a quantum anneal. We also discuss a method of obtaining a 2nx2n effective Hamiltonian that best approximates the true dynamics induced by slowly changing circuit control parameters.This article is part of the theme issue 'Quantum annealing and computation: challenges and perspectives'.

TI Research and application of Big data encryption technology based on
   quantum lightweight image encryption
SO RESULTS IN PHYSICS
AB Given the limitations of current classic image encryption algorithms and the unconditional security characteristics of quantum key distribution protocols, the author proposes an image encryption method based on quantum key distribution and pixel scrambling. The author first analyzed the security issues of quantum image encryption algorithms based on image scrambling methods, namely that image scrambling methods have periodicity, which can ensure that the image can be restored after scrambling. If an image cannot be guaranteed to return to its original state after performing scrambling operations, legitimate users cannot obtain the secret information in the original image, and image scrambling loses its original meaning; However, the periodicity of image scrambling methods not only ensures that legitimate users can decrypt images, but also provides convenience for attackers to steal original image information. Secondly, it is pointed out that when evaluating and analyzing quantum image encryption algorithms, the evaluation indicators should include two parts: One is performance analysis, which is the analysis of the network complexity of quantum circuits. In quantum computing, the network complexity of quantum circuits is usually represented by the number of quantum basic logic gates. The second is security analysis, which mainly includes key analysis (including key space size and key sensitivity analysis), statistical analysis (including pixel correlation, histogram analysis, information fusion, and scatter plot distribution density analysis). Finally, experimental simulations have shown that the NPCR values of the plaintext and ciphertext images of the three images tend to 100%. The encrypted image histogram is evenly distributed, with very weak pixel correlation and high pixel change rate and information entropy.

TI Consensus-Based Distributed Quantum Decomposition Algorithm for
   Security-Constrained Unit Commitment Considering Optimal Transmission
   Switching
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB To enhance controllability, flexibility, and economic performance, this approach develops a dynamic model for the joint optimization of unit commitment (UC) and optimal transmission switching (OTS), considering grid topology changes. This mixed-integer nonlinear problem sees computational complexity rise sharply with system size. A consensus-based distributed quantum decomposition algorithm (QDA) is proposed, splitting the problem into locally relaxed sub-problems (SPs) and consensus-constrained master problems (MPs). Multi-stage strategy is employed to iteratively refine solutions by incorporating cutting planes. For MPs, quadratic unconstrained binary optimization Hamiltonians are designed to be compatible with quantum computing, their complexity is simplified by inserting up/down constraint Hamiltonians that eliminate auxiliary binary variables. Leveraging quantum annealing and a photonic quantum computer, these Hamiltonians are efficiently solved to explore optimal UC and grid topology. Results on the 6-Bus System validate the centralized QDA, while the consensus-based distributed QDA outperforms Gurobi9 in operational costs and solution time for the IEEE RTS 24-Bus System. The joint UC-OTS optimization reduces costs compared to static networks' UC, demonstrating the mutual influence of unit and topology optimization. This approach won the Grand Prize of the 2024 "Challenge and Leadership Selection" Special Competition of the 19th National Challenge Cup Competition.

TI Enhanced Quantum-Based DNA Sequence Alignment With Noise Handling and
   Error Detection
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB This paper presents an enhanced quantum computing approach for DNA sequence alignment, integrating advanced noise management and robust error detection. We augment existing quantum alignment methodologies by incorporating supplementary qubits for each base, enabling improved alignment in noisy quantum environments. Our method models quantum circuits for matching reference and read DNA sequences using a hardware-calibrated noise model, specifically FakeJakartaV2, which incorporates depolarizing and thermal relaxation error characteristics. A key enhancement involves the integration of Zero-Noise Extrapolation (ZNE) for active error mitigation, with ZNE confidence serving as an early stopping criterion to enhance computational efficiency. Our error detection mechanism complements ZNE, providing an additional layer of verification for alignment integrity even when ZNE confidence is high. Experimental results demonstrate that this combined strategy effectively addresses sequence discrepancies, enhances error resilience, and produces more reliable alignment outcomes in quantum-based DNA alignment tasks compared to classical techniques. We validate our approach using IBM Quantum simulators, showcasing its potential for advancing large-scale genomic data analysis, addressing challenges of noise and errors in quantum DNA sequence alignment, and offering practical value through actionable error mitigation.

We analyze the tachyonic contribution to the modular integrand for the partition function known for odd integers N > 1 and show that it admits an analytic continuation resulting in a finite answer for the modular integral in the physical region 0 < N <= 1. We discuss the flat space limit and the relevance of this computation for quantum gravity near black hole horizons and holography in relation to the thermal entropy.

TI Fast high-fidelity geometric quantum control with quantum
   brachistochrones
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB We experimentally demonstrate fast and high-fidelity geometric control of a quantum system with the brachistochrone method on hybrid spin registers in diamond. Based on the time-optimal universal geometric control, single geometric gates with fidelities over 99.2% on the spin state of the nitrogen-vacancy center are realized with average durations shortened by 21.5% compared with the conventional geometric method. The fidelity of the fast geometric two-qubit gate exceeds 96.5% on the hybrid spin registers. With the fast and high-fidelity universal set of geometric gates available, we implement a quantum entanglement-enhanced phase estimation algorithm and demonstrate the Heisenberg quantum limit of phase estimation at room temperature. Hence our results show that high-fidelity quantum control based on a fast geometric route will be a versatile tool for broad applications of quantum information processing in practice.

TI A Versatile Analytical Model for Fast and Accurate Determination of
   Feedline-Coupled Resonators for Superconducting Qubit Readout
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON MICROWAVE THEORY AND TECHNIQUES
AB Superconducting quantum chips commonly utilize quarter-wavelength ( lambda/4 ) transmission line resonators as readout circuits. An analytical model for the accurate determination of resonance frequencies and coupling Q-factors of feedline-coupled superconducting resonators is introduced. The model leverages four-port microwave network analysis, integrating boundary conditions and conformal mapping techniques to compute even- and odd-mode impedances in edge-coupled coplanar waveguide (CPW) structures. Its versatility allows application to both planar and 3-D heterogeneous architectures, making it a powerful tool for resonator design. To validate the model, a test chip with lambda /4 resonators of varying geometries is fabricated and measured in a cryogenic environment. Comparisons with finite element method (FEM) simulations and experimental measurements confirm the model's accuracy, with resonance frequencies and coupling Q-factors aligning closely across configurations. This proposed model facilitates the design of superconducting resonators in readout circuits for more effective, scalable, and adaptable quantum computing architectures.

TI Aharonov-Bohm effect for confined matter in lattice gauge theories
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Gauge theories arise in physical systems displaying space-time local symmetries. They provide a powerful description of important realms of physics ranging from fundamental interactions to statistical mechanics, condensed matter, and, more recently, quantum computation. As such, a remarkably deep understanding has been achieved in the field. With the advent of quantum technology, lower energy analogs, capable of capturing important features of the original quantum field theories through quantum simulation, have been intensively studied. Here, we propose a specific scheme implementing an analogic quantum simulation of lattice gauge theories constrained to mesoscopic spatial scales. To this end, we study the dynamics of mesons residing in a ring-shaped lattice of mesoscopic size pierced by an effective magnetic field. In particular, we find a type of Aharonov-Bohm effect that goes beyond the particlelike effect, reflecting the features of the confining gauge potential. The coherence properties of the meson are quantified by the persistent current and by specific features of the correlation functions. When the magnetic field is quenched, Aharonov-Bohm oscillations and correlations start a specific matter-wave current dynamics.

TI Quantum Entanglement and Modulation Enhancement of

SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB The modulation and engineering of the free-electron wave function bring new ingredients to the electron-matter interaction. We consider the dynamics of a free-electron passing by a two-level system fully quantum mechanically and study the enhancement of interaction from the modulation of the free-electron wave function. In the presence of resonant modulation of the free-electron wave function, we show that the electron energy loss and gain spectrum is greatly enhanced for a coherent initial state of the two-level system. Thus, a modulated electron can function as a probe of the atomic coherence. We further find that distantly separated two-level atoms can be entangled through interacting with the same free electron. Effects of modulation-induced enhancement can also be observed using a dilute beam of modulated electrons.

TI Combining physics-informed neural networks with the freezing mechanism
   for general Hamiltonian learning
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB The precision required to characterize a Hamiltonian is central to developing advantageous quantum computers, providing powerful advances in quantum sensing and crosstalk mitigation. Traditional methods to determine a Hamiltonian are difficult due to the intricacies of quantum systems, involving numbers of equations and parameters that grow exponentially with the number of qubits. To mitigate these shortcomings, in this paper, we introduce an innovative and effective procedure integrating a physics-informed neural network (PINN) with a freezing mechanism to learn the Hamiltonian parameters efficiently. Although PINN and experimental data alone would become impractical as N increases, the mechanism we introduce freezes the interactions of most of the qubits, leaving just a qubit subsystem to be analyzed by the PINN method. Determination of all physical parameters is accomplished by analyzing the system by parts until completion. We validated the efficacy of our method using simulation data obtained from the IBM quantum computer to obtain the training data and we found that a PINN can learn the two-qubit parameters with high accuracy, achieving a median error of less than 0.1% for systems of up to four qubits. We have successfully combined the PINN analysis of two qubits with the freezing mechanism in the case of a four-qubit system.

TI Bidirectional interconversion of microwave and light with thin-film
   lithium niobate
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Coherent conversion between optical and microwave photonics is needed for future quantum applications. Here, the authors combine thin-film lithium niobate and superconductor platforms as a hybrid electro-optic system to achieve high-efficiency frequency conversion between microwave and optical modes.
   Superconducting cavity electro-optics presents a promising route to coherently convert microwave and optical photons and distribute quantum entanglement between superconducting circuits over long-distance. Strong Pockels nonlinearity and high-performance optical cavity are the prerequisites for high conversion efficiency. Thin-film lithium niobate (TFLN) offers these desired characteristics. Despite significant recent progresses, only unidirectional conversion with efficiencies on the order of 10(-5) has been realized. In this article, we demonstrate the bidirectional electro-optic conversion in TFLN-superconductor hybrid system, with conversion efficiency improved by more than three orders of magnitude. Our air-clad device architecture boosts the sustainable intracavity pump power at cryogenic temperatures by suppressing the prominent photorefractive effect that limits cryogenic performance of TFLN, and reaches an efficiency of 1.02% (internal efficiency of 15.2%). This work firmly establishes the TFLN-superconductor hybrid EO system as a highly competitive transduction platform for future quantum network applications.

TI Chirality-Induced Spin Selectivity: An Enabling Technology for Quantum
   Applications
SO ADVANCED MATERIALS
AB Molecular spins are promising building blocks of future quantum technologies thanks to the unparalleled flexibility provided by chemistry, which allows the design of complex structures targeted for specific applications. However, their weak interaction with external stimuli makes it difficult to access their state at the single-molecule level, a fundamental tool for their use, for example, in quantum computing and sensing. Here, an innovative solution exploiting the interplay between chirality and magnetism using the chirality-induced spin selectivity effect on electron transfer processes is foreseen. It is envisioned to use a spin-to-charge conversion mechanism that can be realized by connecting a molecular spin qubit to a dyad where an electron donor and an electron acceptor are linked by a chiral bridge. By numerical simulations based on realistic parameters, it is shown that the chirality-induced spin selectivity effect could enable initialization, manipulation, and single-spin readout of molecular qubits and qudits even at relatively high temperatures.

TI On the complexity of quantum link prediction in complex networks
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Link prediction methods use patterns in known network data to infer which connections may be missing. Previous work has shown that continuous-time quantum walks can be used to represent path-based link prediction, which we further study here to develop a more optimized quantum algorithm. Using a sampling framework for link prediction, we analyze the query access to the input network required to produce a certain number of prediction samples. Considering both well-known classical path-based algorithms using powers of the adjacency matrix as well as our proposed quantum algorithm for path-based link prediction, we argue that there is a polynomial quantum advantage on the dependence on N, the number of nodes in the network. We further argue that the complexity of our algorithm, although sub-linear in N, is limited by the complexity of performing a quantum simulation of the network's adjacency matrix, which may prove to be an important problem in the development of quantum algorithms for network science in general.

TI Polarization-entangled Bell state generation from an epsilon-near-zero
   metasurface
SO SCIENCE ADVANCES
AB Pairs of polarization-entangled photons are important for diverse quantum technologies, such as quantum communication, computation, and imaging. However, generating complex polarization-entangled states has long been constrained by the available nonlinear susceptibility tensor of natural materials, necessitating cumbersome setups for additional coherent superposition or postselection. In this study, we experimentally demonstrate the generation of pairs of polarization-entangled photons using a plasmonic metasurface strongly coupled to an epsilon-near-zero (ENZ) material. By engineering a resonance at the pump wavelength and leveraging the field enhancement provided by the ENZ effect, the photon pair generation efficiency of the 68-nanometer-thick metasurface is substantially boosted compared to that of an unpatterned indium tin oxide film. More notably, the ENZ metasurface platform facilitates versatile manipulation of the system's anisotropic second-order nonlinear susceptibility tensor, enabling direct control over the polarization states of the photon pairs and generating a polarization-entangled Bell state without additional components. This approach enables simultaneous photon pair generation and quantum state engineering in a compact platform.

TI Skyrmion-mechanical hybrid quantum systems: Manipulation of skyrmion
   qubits via phonons
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Skyrmion qubits are a new highly promising logic element for quantum information processing. However, their scalability to multiple interacting qubits remains challenging. We propose a hybrid quantum setup with skyrmion qubits strongly coupled to nanomechanical cantilevers via magnetic coupling, which harnesses phonons as quantum interfaces for the manipulation of distant skyrmion qubits. A linear drive is utilized to achieve the modulation of the stiffness coefficient of the cantilever, resulting in an exponential enhancement of the coupling strength between the skyrmion qubit and the mechanical mode. We also consider the case of a topological resonator array, which allows us to study interactions between skyrmion qubits and topological phonon band structure, as well as chiral skyrmion-skyrmion interactions. The scheme suggested here offers a fascinating platform for investigating quantum information processing and quantum simulation with magnetic microstructures.

TI Fermionic quantum cellular automata and generalized matrix-product
   unitaries
SO JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL MECHANICS-THEORY AND EXPERIMENT
AB In this paper, we study matrix-product unitary operators (MPUs) for fermionic one-dimensional chains. In stark contrast to the case of 1D qudit systems, we show that (i) fermionic MPUs (fMPUs) do not necessarily feature a strict causal cone and (ii) not all fermionic quantum cellular automata (QCA) can be represented as fMPUs. We then introduce a natural generalization of the latter, obtained by allowing for an additional operator acting on their auxiliary space. We characterize a family of such generalized MPUs that are locality-preserving, and show that, up to appending inert ancillary fermionic degrees of freedom, any representative of this family is a fermionic QCA (fQCA) and vice versa. Finally, we prove an index theorem for generalized MPUs, recovering the recently derived classification of fQCA in one dimension. As a technical tool for our analysis, we also introduce a graded canonical form for fermionic matrix product states, proving its uniqueness up to similarity transformations.

AB Recently, several studies have proposed frameworks for Quantum Federated Learning (QFL). For instance, the Google TensorFlow Quantum (TFQ) and TensorFlow Federated (TFF) libraries have been deployed for realizing QFL. However, developers, in the main, are not as yet familiar with Quantum Computing (QC) libraries and frameworks. A Domain-Specific Modeling Language (DSML) that provides an abstraction layer over the underlying QC and Federated Learning (FL) libraries would be beneficial. This could enable practitioners to carry out software development and data science tasks efficiently while deploying the state of the art in Quantum Machine Learning (QML). In this position paper, we propose extending existing domain-specific Model-Driven Engineering (MDE) tools for Machine Learning (ML) enabled systems, such as MontiAnna, ML-Quadrat, and GreyCat, to support QFL.

TI Continuously distributing entanglement in quantum networks with regular
   topologies
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Small interconnected quantum processors can collaborate to tackle quantum computational problems that typically demand more capable devices. These linked processors, referred to as quantum nodes, can use shared entangled states to execute nonlocal operations. As a consequence, understanding how to distribute entangled states among nodes is essential for developing hardware and software. We analyze a protocol where entanglement is continuously distributed among nodes that are physically arranged in a regular pattern: a chain, a honeycomb lattice, a square grid, and a triangular lattice. These regular patterns allow for the modular expansion of networks for large-scale distributed quantum computing. Within the distribution protocol, we investigate how nodes can optimize the frequency of attempting entanglement swaps, trading off multiple entangled states shared with neighboring nodes for fewer states shared with non-neighboring nodes. We evaluate the protocol's performance using the virtual neighborhood size-a metric indicating the number of other nodes with which a given node shares entangled states. Employing numerical methods, we find that nodes must perform more swaps to maximize the virtual neighborhood size when coherence times are short. In a chain network, the virtual neighborhood size's dependence on swap attempt frequency differs for each node based on its distance from the end of the chain. Conversely, all nodes in the square grid exhibit a qualitatively similar dependence of the virtual neighborhood size on the swap frequency.

TI High-Contrast Plasmonic-Enhanced Shallow Spin Defects in Hexagonal Boron
   Nitride for Quantum Sensing
SO NANO LETTERS
AB The recently discovered spin defects in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN), a layered van der Waals material, have great potential in quantum sensing. However, the photoluminescence and the contrast of the optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) of hBN spin defects are relatively low so far, which limits their sensitivity. Here we report a record-high ODMR contrast of 46% at room temperature and simultaneous enhancement of the photoluminescence of hBN spin defects by up to 17-fold by the surface plasmon of a gold film microwave waveguide. Our results are obtained with shallow boron vacancy spin defects in hBN nanosheets created by low-energy He+ ion implantation and a gold film microwave waveguide fabricated by photolithography. We also explore the effects of microwave and laser powers on the ODMR and improve the sensitivity of hBN spin defects for magnetic field detection. Our results support the promising potential of hBN spin defects for nanoscale quantum sensing.

TI A singlet-triplet hole-spin qubit in MOS silicon
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Holes in silicon quantum dots are promising for spin qubit applications due to the strong intrinsic spin-orbit coupling. The spin-orbit coupling produces complex hole-spin dynamics, providing opportunities to further optimise spin qubits. Here, we demonstrate a singlet-triplet qubit using hole states in a planar metal-oxide-semiconductor double quantum dot. We demonstrate rapid qubit control with singlet-triplet oscillations up to 400 MHz. The qubit exhibits promising coherence, with a maximum dephasing time of 600 ns, which is enhanced to 1.3 mu s using refocusing techniques. We investigate the magnetic field anisotropy of the eigenstates, and determine a magnetic field orientation to improve the qubit initialisation fidelity. These results present a step forward for spin qubit technology, by implementing a high quality singlet-triplet hole-spin qubit in planar architecture suitable for scaling up to 2D arrays of coupled qubits. Hole-spin qubits based on semiconductor quantum dots offer potential advantages over their electron-spin counterparts, such as fast qubit control and enhanced coherence times. Liles et al. report a hole-based singlet-triplet spin qubit in planar Si MOS device and develop a model to describe its dynamics.

TI Quantum computational complexity from quantum information to black holes
   and back
SO EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL C
AB Quantum computational complexity estimates the difficulty of constructing quantum states from elementary operations, a problem of prime importance for quantum computation. Surprisingly, this quantity can also serve to study a completely different physical problem - that of information processing inside black holes. Quantum computational complexity was suggested as a new entry in the holographic dictionary, which extends the connection between geometry and information and resolves the puzzle of why black hole interiors keep growing for a very long time. In this pedagogical review, we present the geometric approach to complexity advocated by Nielsen and show how it can be used to define complexity for generic quantum systems; in particular, we focus on Gaussian states in QFT, both pure and mixed, and on certain classes of CFT states. We then present the conjectured relation to gravitational quantities within the holographic correspondence and discuss several examples in which different versions of the conjectures have been tested. We highlight the relation between complexity, chaos and scrambling in chaotic systems. We conclude with a discussion of open problems and future directions. This article was written for the special issue of EPJ-C Frontiers in Holographic Duality.

TI Spectroscopy and Modeling of 171Yb Rydberg States for
   High-Fidelity Two-Qubit Gates
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW X
AB Highly excited Rydberg states and their interactions play an important role in quantum computing and simulation. These properties can be predicted accurately for alkali atoms with simple Rydberg level structures. However, an extension of these methods to more complex atoms such as alkaline-earth atoms has not been demonstrated or experimentally validated. Here, we present multichannel quantum defect models for highly excited 174Yb and 171Yb Rydberg states with L <= 2. The models are developed using a combination of existing literature data and new, high-precision laser and microwave spectroscopy in an atomic beam, and validated by detailed comparison with experimentally measured Stark shifts and magnetic moments. We then use these models to compute interaction potentials between two Yb atoms, and find excellent agreement with direct measurements in an optical tweezer array. From the computed interaction potential, we identify an anomalous F & ouml;rster resonance that likely degraded the fidelity of previous entangling gates in 171Yb using F = 3/2 Rydberg states. We then identify a more suitable F = 1/2 state, and achieve a state-of-the-art controlled-Z gate fidelity of F = 0.994(1), with the remaining error fully explained by known sources. This work establishes a solid foundation for the continued development of quantum computing, simulation, and entanglement-enhanced metrology with Yb neutral atom arrays.

TI Simulating excited states of the Lipkin model on a quantum computer
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW C
AB We simulate the excited states of the Lipkin model using the recently proposed quantum equation of motion (qEOM) method. The qEOM generalizes the EOM on classical computers and gives access to collective exci-tations based on quasiboson operators O-n(alpha) of increasing configuration complexity alpha. We show, in particular, that the accuracy strongly depends on the fermion to qubit encoding. Standard encoding leads to large errors, but the use of symmetries and the Gray code reduces the quantum resources and improves significantly the results on current noisy quantum devices. With this encoding scheme, we use IBM quantum machines to compute the energy spectrum for a system of N = 2, 3, and 4 particles, and compare the accuracy against the exact solution. We found that the results of the approach with alpha = 2, an analog of the second random phase approximation (SRPA), are, in principle, more accurate than with alpha = 1, which corresponds to the random phase approximation (RPA), but the SRPA is more amenable to noise for large coupling strengths. Thus, the proposed scheme shows potential for achieving higher spectroscopic accuracy by implementations with higher configuration complexity, if a proper error mitigation method is applied.

TI Design constraints for Unruh-DeWitt quantum computers
SO SCIPOST PHYSICS CORE
AB The Unruh -DeWitt particle detector model has found success in demonstrating quantum information channels with non -zero channel capacity between qubits and quantum fields. These detector models provide the necessary framework for experimentally realizable Unruh -DeWitt quantum computers with near -perfect channel capacity. We propose spin-qubits with gate -controlled coupling to Luttinger liquids as a laboratory setting for Unruh -DeWitt detectors and explore general design constraints that underpin their feasibility in this and other settings. We present several experimental scenarios including graphene ribbons, edges states in the quantum spin Hall phase of HgTe quantum wells, and the recently discovered quantum anomalous Hall phase in transition metal dichalcogenides. Theoretically, through bosonization, we show that Unruh -DeWitt detectors can carry out quantum computations and identify when they can make perfect quantum communication channels between qubits via the Luttinger liquid. Our results point the way toward an all -to -all connected solid state quantum computer and the experimental study of quantum information in quantum fields via condensed matter physics.

TI Mechanical quantum sensing in the search for dark matter
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Numerous astrophysical and cosmological observations are best explained by the existence of dark matter, a mass density which interacts only very weakly with visible, baryonic matter. Searching for the extremely weak signals produced by this dark matter strongly motivate the development of new, ultra-sensitive detector technologies. Paradigmatic advances in the control and readout of massive mechanical systems, in both the classical and quantum regimes, have enabled unprecedented levels of sensitivity. In this white paper, we outline recent ideas in the potential use of a range of solid-state mechanical sensing technologies to aid in the search for dark matter in a number of energy scales and with a variety of coupling mechanisms.

AB Quantum sensing has emerged as a promising approach for spaceborne Earth observation (EO) with the potential to offer higher accuracy, sensitivity and stability than instruments used in EO missions so far. While several quantum sensors have been developed and successfully tested in ground-based experiments, with some of them even available as commercial devices, the identification of their potential applications in space remains a challenge. Nevertheless, there are some promising technologies, including cold-atom interferometers, Rydberg receivers, atomic vapor- and Nitrogen-Vacancy center-based magnetometers, and quantum lidar, that show potential for enhancing EO capabilities. In this presentation, we will discuss the latest developments and challenges in quantum sensing for EO at the European Space Agency (ESA), highlighting the most promising technologies and their potential applications. We will also discuss ongoing efforts at ESA to identify potential applications of these sensors and the roadmap for their deployment. Finally, we will conclude with a discussion of the future prospects for quantum sensing in EO and the wider space exploration domain.

TI The tunable 0-π qubit: Dynamics and relaxation
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB In this paper, we present a systematic treatment of a 0-pi qubit in the presence of a time-dependent external flux. A gauge-invariant Lagrangian and the corresponding Hamiltonian are obtained. The effect of the flux noise on the qubit relaxation is obtained using the perturbation theory. Under a time-dependent drive of sinusoidal form, the survival probability, and transition probabilities have been studied for different strengths and frequencies. The driven qubit is shown to possess coherent oscillations among two distinct states for a weak to moderate strength close to resonant frequencies of the unperturbed qubit. The parameters can be chosen to prepare the system in its ground state. This feature paves the way to prolong the lifetime by combining ideas from weak measurement and quantum Zeno effect. We believe that this is an important variation of a topologically protected qubit which is tunable.

TI Quantum compiling by deep reinforcement learning
SO COMMUNICATIONS PHYSICS
AB The general problem of quantum compiling is to approximate any unitary transformation that describes the quantum computation as a sequence of elements selected from a finite base of universal quantum gates. The Solovay-Kitaev theorem guarantees the existence of such an approximating sequence. Though, the solutions to the quantum compiling problem suffer from a tradeoff between the length of the sequences, the precompilation time, and the execution time. Traditional approaches are time-consuming, unsuitable to be employed during computation. Here, we propose a deep reinforcement learning method as an alternative strategy, which requires a single precompilation procedure to learn a general strategy to approximate single-qubit unitaries. We show that this approach reduces the overall execution time, improving the tradeoff between the length of the sequence and execution time, potentially allowing real-time operations.
   Quantum compilers are characterized by a trade-off between the length of the sequences, the precompilation time, and the execution time. Here, the authors propose an approach based on deep reinforcement learning to approximate unitary operators as circuits, and show that this approach decreases the execution time, potentially allowing real-time quantum compiling.

TI Few-photon transport via a multimode nonlinear cavity: Theory and
   applications
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Few-photon transport via waveguide-coupled local quantum systems has attracted extensive theoretical and experimental studies. Most of the study has focused on atomic or atomic-like local quantum systems due to their strong light-matter interaction useful for quantum applications. Here we study few-photon transport via a waveguide-coupled multimode optical cavity with second-order bulk nonlinearity. We develop a Feynman diagram approach and compute the scattering matrix of the one- and two-photon transport. Based on the calculated scattering matrix, we show highly nonclassical photonic effects, including photon blockade and pi-conditional phase shift, are achievable in the waveguide-coupled multimode optical cavity system via quantum interference and linear response engineering. Our results might lead to significant applications of quantum photonic circuits in all-optical quantum information processing and quantum network protocols.

TI Comparison of laser system designs for quantum technologies: BECCAL
   flight system vs. BECCAL ground test bed
SO EPJ QUANTUM TECHNOLOGY
AB We present the design of laser systems for the Bose-Einstein Condensate and Cold Atom Laboratory (BECCAL) payload, enabling numerous quantum technological experiments onboard the International Space Station (ISS), in particular dual species 87Rb and 41K Bose-Einstein condensates. A flight model (FM) and a commercial off the shelf (COTS) based model are shown, both of which meet the BECCAL requirements in terms of functionality, but have differing size, weight and power (SWaP) and environmental requirements. The capabilities of both models are discussed and characteristics compared.The flight model of BECCAL uses specifically developed and qualified custom components to create a compact and robust system suitable for long-term remote operation onboard the ISS. This system is based on ECDL-MOPA lasers and free-space optical benches made of Zerodur, as well as commercial fibre components. The COTS-based system utilizes entirely commercial parts to create a functionally equivalent system for operation in a standard laboratory, without the strict SWaP and environmental constraints of the flight model.

TI Adaptive Advantage in Entanglement-Assisted Communications
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Entanglement is known to boost the efficiency of classical communication. In distributed computation, for instance, exploiting entanglement can reduce the number of communicated bits or increase the probability to obtain a correct answer. Entanglement-assisted classical communication protocols usually consist of two successive rounds: first, a Bell test round, in which the parties measure their local shares of the entangled state, and then a communication round, where they exchange classical messages. Here, we go beyond this standard approach and investigate adaptive uses of entanglement: we allow the receiver to wait for the arrival of the sender's message before measuring their share of the entangled state. We first show that such adaptive protocols improve the success probability in random access codes. Second, we show that once adaptive measurements are used, an entanglement-assisted bit becomes a strictly stronger resource than a qubit in prepare-and-measure scenarios. We briefly discuss the extension of these ideas to scenarios involving quantum communication and we identify resource inequalities.

TI Optimal Transfer of Entanglement in Oscillator Chains in Non-Markovian
   Open Systems
SO ENTROPY
AB We consider the transfer of continuous-variable entangled states in coupled oscillator chains embedded in a generic environment. We demonstrate high-fidelity transfer via optimal control in two configurations-a linear chain and an X-shaped chain. More specifically, we use the Krotov optimization algorithm to design control fields that achieve the desired state transfer. Under environmental memory effects, the Krotov algorithm needs to be modified, since the dissipative terms in non-Markovian dynamics are generally governed by the time-dependent system Hamiltonian. Remarkably, we can achieve high-fidelity transfer by simply tuning the frequencies of the oscillators while keeping the coupling strength constant, even in the presence of open-system effects. For the system under consideration, we find that quantum memory effects can aid in the transfer of entanglement and show improvement over the memoryless case. In addition, it is possible to target a range of entangled states, making it unnecessary to know the parameters of the initial state beforehand.

TI Towards solving the BCS Hamiltonian gap in near-term quantum computers

AB In this work, using a Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) framework, we obtain the gap of a Bardeen- Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) Hamiltonian. This could lead to interesting implications for superconductivity re-search. For such task, we choose to use the Variational Quantum Deflation and analyze the hardware restrictions that are needed to find the energy spectra on current quantum hardware.We also compare two different kinds of classical optimizers, Constrained Optimization BY Linear Approx-imations (COBYLA) and Simultaneous Perturbation Stochastic Approximation (SPSA), and study the effect of decoherence caused by the presence of noise when using simulations in real devices. We apply our method for an example with both 2 and 5 qubits. Furthermore, we show how to approximate the gap within one standard deviation, even with the presence of noise.

TI Deterministic Gaussian conversion protocols for non-Gaussian single-mode
   resources
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB In the context of quantum technologies over continuous variables, Gaussian states and operations are typically regarded as freely available, as they are relatively easily accessible experimentally. In contrast, the generation of non-Gaussian states, as well as the implementation of non-Gaussian operations, pose significant challenges. This divide has motivated the introduction of resource theories of non-Gaussianity. As for any resource theory, it is of practical relevance to identify free conversion protocols between resources, namely, Gaussian conversion protocols between non-Gaussian states. Via systematic numerical investigations, we address the approximate conversion between experimentally relevant single-mode non-Gaussian states via arbitrary deterministic one-to-one mode Gaussian maps. First we show that cat and binomial states are approximately equivalent for finite energy, while this equivalence was previously known only in the infinite-energy limit. Then we consider the generation of cat states from photon-added and photon-subtracted squeezed states, improving over known schemes by introducing additional squeezing operations. The numerical tools that we develop also allow one to devise conversions of trisqueezed into cubic-phase states beyond previously reported performances. Finally, we identify various other conversions which instead are not viable.

TI High-performance photon number resolving detectors for 850-950 nm
   wavelength range
SO APL PHOTONICS
AB Since their first demonstration in 2001 [Gol'tsman et al., Appl. Phys. Lett. 79, 705-707 (2001)], superconducting-nanowire single-photon detectors (SNSPDs) have witnessed two decades of great developments. SNSPDs are the detector of choice in most modern quantum optics experiments and are slowly finding their way into other photon-starved fields of optics. Until now, however, in nearly all experiments, SNSPDs were used as "binary" detectors, meaning that they could only distinguish between 0 and >=1 photons, and photon number information was lost. Recent research has demonstrated proof-of-principle photon-number resolution (PNR) SNSPDs counting 2-5 photons. The photon-number-resolving capability is highly demanded in various quantum-optics experiments, including Hong-Ou-Mandel interference, photonic quantum computing, quantum communication, and non-Gaussian quantum state preparation. In particular, PNR detectors at the wavelength range of 850-950 nm are of great interest due to the availability of high-quality semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) [Heindel et al., Adv. Opt. Photonics 15, 613-738 (2023)] and high-performance cesium-based quantum memories [Ma et al., J. Opt. 19, 043001 (2017)]. In this paper, we demonstrate NbTiN-based SNSPDs with >94% system detection efficiency, sub-11 ps timing jitter for one photon, and sub-7 ps for 2 photons. More importantly, our detectors resolve up to 7 photons using conventional cryogenic electric readout circuitry. Through theoretical analysis, we show that the PNR performance of demonstrated detectors can be further improved by enhancing the signal-to-noise ratio and bandwidth of our readout circuitry. Our results are promising for the future of optical quantum computing and quantum communication. (c) 2024 Author(s).

TI Entangling gates from cabling of knots
SO EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL C
AB While there is a general consensus about the structure of one qubit operations in topological quantum computer, two qubits are as usual a more difficult and complex story of different attempts with varying approaches, problems and effectiveness. In this paper we discuss how to construct an efficient realization of a two qubit gate in topological quantum computer, by using principle of cabling from the knot theory. This allows one to construct a braiding of cables dependent on the parameters of the theory where there is a low probability of moving out of computational space (high fidelity of operation) with a non-trivial entangling two-qubit operation. We also present some examples of these operations for different parameters of the theory.

In this context, the role of quantum correlations is unclear: recent contributions have shown how entanglement is typically very short-ranged, and thus uninformative about long-ranged critical correlations. In this work, we show the existence of finite-temperature phase transitions where a broader form of quantum correlation than entanglement, the entropic quantum discord, can display genuine signatures of critical behavior. We consider integrable bosonic field theories in both two-and three-dimensional lattices, and show how the two-mode Gaussian discord decays algebraically with the distance even in cases where the entanglement negativity vanishes beyond nearest-neighbor separations. Systematically approaching the zero-temperature limit allows us to connect discord to entanglement, drawing a generic picture of quantum correlations and critical behavior that naturally describes the transition between entangled and discordant quantum matter.

TI Trap-integrated superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors with
   improved rf tolerance for trapped-ion qubit state readout
SO APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS
AB State readout of trapped-ion qubits with trap-integrated detectors can address important challenges for scalable quantum computing, but the strong radio frequency (rf) electric fields used for trapping can impact detector performance. Here, we report on NbTiN superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors (SNSPDs) employing grounded aluminum mirrors as electrical shielding that are integrated into linear surface-electrode rf ion traps. The shielded SNSPDs can be operated at applied rf trapping potentials of up to 54 V (peak) at 70 MHz and temperatures of up to 6 K, with a maximum system detection efficiency of 68%. This performance should be sufficient to enable parallel high-fidelity state readout of a wide range of trapped ion species in a typical cryogenic apparatus.

TI Carbon-contaminated topological defects in hexagonal boron nitride for
   quantum photonics
SO NPJ 2D MATERIALS AND APPLICATIONS
AB Topological defects, such as Stone-Wales defects and grain boundaries, are common in 2D materials. In this study, we investigate the intricate interplay of topological defects and carbon contamination in hexagonal boron nitride revealing an intriguing class of color centers. We demonstrate that both carbon contamination and strain can stabilize Stone-Wales configurations and give rise to emitters with desirable optical properties in the visible spectral range. Inspired by these results, we further demonstrate that carbon atoms at grain boundaries can resolve energetic B-B and N-N bonds leading to highly favorable atomic structures that may facilitate the accumulation of carbon contamination at the boundaries. Similarly to contaminated Stone-Wales defects, carbon-doped grain boundaries can also give rise to color centers emitting in the visible spectral range with short radiative lifetime and high Debye-Waller factors. Our discoveries shed light on an exciting class of single photon emitters in hBN that may be readily observed in grained samples and created by irradiating carbon containing hBN flakes.

TI Readout of strongly coupled NV center-pair spin states with deep neural
   networks
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Optically addressable electron spin clusters are of interest for quantum computation, simulation and sensing. However, with interaction length scales of a few tens of nanometers in the strong coupling regime, they are unresolved in conventional confocal microscopy, making individual readout problematic. Here we show that when using a single shot readout technique, collective states of the combined register space become accessible. By using spin to charge conversion of the defects we draw the connection between the intricate photon count statistics with spin state readout using deep neural networks. This approach is particularly versatile with further scaling the number of constituent spins in a cluster due to complexity of the analytical treatment. We perform a proof of concept measurement of the correlated classical signal, paving the way for using our technique in realistic applications.

TI Digital synchronization for continuous-variable quantum key distribution
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Continuous variable quantum key distribution (CV-QKD) is a promising emerging technology for the distribution of secure keys for symmetric encryption. It can be readily implemented using commercial off-the-shelf optical telecommunications components. A key requirement of the CV-QKD receiver is the ability to measure the quantum states at the correct time instance and rate using the correct orthogonal observables, referred to as synchronization. We propose a digital synchronization procedure for a modern CV-QKD system with locally generated local oscillator for coherent reception. Our proposed method is modulation format independent allowing it to be used in a variety of CV-QKD systems. We experimentally investigate its performance with a Gaussian modulated CV-QKD system operating over a 10-20 km span of standard single mode fibre. Since the procedure does not require hardware modifications it paves the way for cost-effective QKD solutions that can adapt rapidly to changing environmental conditions.

TI A Comparative Study on Solving Optimization Problems With Exponentially
   Fewer Qubits
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM ENGINEERING
AB Variational quantum optimization algorithms, such as the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) or the quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA), are among the most studied quantum algorithms. In our work, we evaluate and improve an algorithm based on the VQE, which uses exponentially fewer qubits compared to the QAOA. We highlight the numerical instabilities generated by encoding the problem into the variational ansatz and propose a classical optimization procedure to find the ground state of the ansatz in fewer iterations with a better or similar objective. In addition, we propose a method to embed the linear interpolation of the MaxCut problem on a quantum device. Furthermore, we compare classical optimizers for this variational ansatz on quadratic unconstrained binary optimization and graph partitioning problems.

TI Asymmetric channel phase matching quantum key distribution
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB The phase-matching protocol is a practical and promising protocol that can surpass the linear key generation rate boundary. However, classical phase-matching quantum key distribution requires the channel attenuation between communicating parties to be symmetric. In practice, channels used are often asymmetric, owing to geographical reasons in a quantum key distribution network. To enhance the practicality of phase matching, this paper proposes an asymmetric phase-matching protocol based on the classical framework and establishes a relevant mathematical simulation model to study the influence of channel asymmetry on its performance. The simulation results show that channel asymmetry significantly affects the count rate, error rate, gain, and quantum bit error rate (QBER), ultimately, system performance. As the channel attenuation difference increases, the system performance decreases and the rate of decrease accelerates. Key generation becomes impossible when the channel attenuation difference exceeds 4 dB. Although the decoy-state scheme cannot change the system's tolerance to channel attenuation difference, when the channel attenuation difference is large, the increasing of the number of decoy states significantly can improve system performance, with a three-decoy-state phase-matching protocol outperforming a two-decoy-state protocol. Considering the limited data length, the system performance is improved as the data length increases, and the tolerance to channel attenuation differences gradually increases. When the data length exceeds 1012, this improvement does not continue any more. The system cannot break through the boundary of linear key generation rate when the channel attenuation difference is 2 dB and the data length is less than 1012. Comparing with symmetric channels, the system performance improvement is very significant under asymmetric channel conditions as the data length increases.

TI Qubit-environment-entanglement generation and the spin echo
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We analyze the relationship between qubit-environment entanglement that can be created during the pure dephasing of the qubit and the effectiveness of the spin-echo protocol. We focus here on mixed states of the environment. We show that whereas the echo protocol can obviously counteract classical environmental noise, it can also undo dephasing associated with qubit-environment entanglement, and there is no obvious difference in its efficiency in these two cases. Additionally, we show that qubit-environment entanglement can be generated at the end of the echo protocol even when it is absent at the time of application of the local operation on the qubit (the pi pulse). We prove that this can occur only at isolated points in time, after fine-tuning of the echo protocol duration. Finally, we discuss the conditions under which the observation of specific features of the echo signal can serve as a witness of the entangling nature of the joint qubit-environment evolution.

TI Chronobiology Meets Quantum Biology: A New Paradigm Overlooking the
   Horizon?
SO FRONTIERS IN PHYSIOLOGY
AB Biological processes and physiological functions in living beings are featured by oscillations with a period of about 24 h (circadian) or cycle at the second and third harmonic (ultradian) of the basic frequency, driven by the biological clock. This molecular mechanism, common to all kingdoms of life, comprising animals, plants, fungi, bacteria, and protists, represents an undoubted adaptive advantage allowing anticipation of predictable changes in the environmental niche or of the interior milieu. Biological rhythms are the field of study of Chronobiology. In the last decade, growing evidence hints that molecular platforms holding up non-trivial quantum phenomena, including entanglement, coherence, superposition and tunnelling, bona fide evolved in biosystems. Quantum effects have been mainly implicated in processes related to electromagnetic radiation in the spectrum of visible light and ultraviolet rays, such as photosynthesis, photoreception, magnetoreception, DNA mutation, and not light related such as mitochondrial respiration and enzymatic activity. Quantum effects in biological systems are the field of study of Quantum Biology. Rhythmic changes at the level of gene expression, as well as protein quantity and subcellular distribution, confer temporal features to the molecular platform hosting electrochemical processes and non-trivial quantum phenomena. Precisely, a huge amount of molecules plying scaffold to quantum effects show rhythmic level fluctuations and this biophysical model implies that timescales of biomolecular dynamics could impinge on quantum mechanics biofunctional role. The study of quantum phenomena in biological cycles proposes a profitable "entanglement" between the areas of interest of these seemingly distant scientific disciplines to enlighten functional roles for quantum effects in rhythmic biosystems.

TI Significant improvement of fidelity for encoded quantum bell pairs at
   long and short-distance communication along with generalized circuit
SO HELIYON
AB Quantum entanglement is a unique criterion of the quantum realm and an essential tool to secure quantum communication. Ensuring high-fidelity entanglement has always been a challenging task owing to interaction with the hostile channel environment created due to quantum noise and decoherence. Though several methods have been proposed, correcting almost all arbitrary errors is still a gigantic task. As one of the main contributions of this work, a new model for 'large distance communication' has been proposed, which may correct all bit flip errors or other errors quite extensively if proper encoding and subspace measurements are used. To achieve this purpose, at the very first step, the idea of differentiating the 'long-distance communication' and 'short-distance applications' has been introduced. Short-distance is determined by the maximum range of applying unitary control gates by the qubit technology. How the error correcting ability of Quantum codes change for short and long-distance application is investigated in this work, which was not explored in previous literatures as far as we know. At the beginning, we have applied stabilizer formalism and Repetition Code for decoding to distinguish the error correcting ability in long and short distance communication. Particularly for short-distance communication, it has been demonstrated that a 'properly encoded' bell state can identify all the bit flip, or phase flip errors with 100% accuracy theoretically. In contrast, if the bell states are used in long-distance communication, the error-detecting and correcting ability reduces at huge amounts. To increase the fidelity significantly and correct the errors quite extensively for long-distance communication, a new model based on classical communication protocol has been suggested. All the required circuits in these processes have been generalized for arbitrary (even) numbers of ancilla qubits during encoding. Proposed analytical results have also been verified with the Simulation results of IBM QISKIT QASM.

AB Entanglement is at the heart of emerging technologies such as quantum computing, quantum sensing, and quantum networking. These technologies are developed by interdisciplinary teams of engineers, physicists, software developers, and other scientists. As a result, quantum concepts, such as entanglement, are essential to introduce to a wide range of disciplines. In response, many universities have implemented quantum information science and engineering (QISE) courses for undergraduate students. These QISE courses present quantum concepts to students from diverse disciplines at an introductory level, whereas previously, they were reserved for advanced physics courses. We interviewed students who had recently completed an introductory QISE course to investigate their conceptual and mathematical understanding of entanglement. We found that entanglement was most strongly associated with the idea of correlation between measurements, while only some students productively used the mathematical criterion of whether or not a quantum state was factorable.

TI Out-of-distribution generalization for learning quantum dynamics
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Generalization - that is, the ability to extrapolate from training data to unseen data - is fundamental in machine learning, and thus also for quantum ML. Here, the authors show that QML algorithms are able to generalise the training they had on a specific distribution and learn over different distributions.
   Generalization bounds are a critical tool to assess the training data requirements of Quantum Machine Learning (QML). Recent work has established guarantees for in-distribution generalization of quantum neural networks (QNNs), where training and testing data are drawn from the same data distribution. However, there are currently no results on out-of-distribution generalization in QML, where we require a trained model to perform well even on data drawn from a different distribution to the training distribution. Here, we prove out-of-distribution generalization for the task of learning an unknown unitary. In particular, we show that one can learn the action of a unitary on entangled states having trained only product states. Since product states can be prepared using only single-qubit gates, this advances the prospects of learning quantum dynamics on near term quantum hardware, and further opens up new methods for both the classical and quantum compilation of quantum circuits.

TI Spontaneous Parametric Down-Conversion in 4H-SiC Integrated Platform
SO LASER & PHOTONICS REVIEWS
AB 4H-silicon carbide (SiC) has recently emerged as a promising material for nonlinear photonic integrated circuits, thanks to its low loss, wide bandgap, as well as strong second-order (chi(2)$\chi <^>{(2)}$) and third-order (chi(3)$\chi <^>{(3)}$) nonlinearities. Though its unique crystal structure allows versatile chi(2)$\chi <^>{(2)}$ processes, spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) still remains unrealized. In this work, photon-pair generation in a 4H-SiC-on-insulator integrated platform is demonstrated through modal-phase-matched type-I SPDC. Furthermore, type-0 and type-II chi(2)$\chi <^>{(2)}$ nonlinear interactions are shown in 4H-SiC waveguides, thus highlighting the potential to exploit diverse phase-matching mechanisms on this platform. These results underscore the potential of 4H-SiC for advancing the development of integrated quantum photonics in the realms of quantum information processing and quantum communication.

TI Circuit-noise-resilient virtual distillation
SO COMMUNICATIONS PHYSICS
AB Quantum error mitigation (QEM) is vital for improving quantum algorithms' accuracy on noisy near-term devices. A typical QEM method, called Virtual Distillation (VD), can suffer from imperfect implementation, potentially leading to worse outcomes than without mitigation. To address this, we introduce Circuit-Noise-Resilient Virtual Distillation (CNR-VD), which includes a calibration process using simple input states to enhance VD's performance despite circuit noise, aiming to recover the results of an ideally conducted VD circuit. Simulations show that CNR-VD significantly mitigates noise-induced errors in VD circuits, boosting accuracy by up to tenfold over standard VD. It provides positive error mitigation even under high noise, where standard VD fails. Furthermore, our estimator's versatility extends its utility beyond VD, enhancing outcomes in general Hadamard-Test circuits. The proposed CNR-VD significantly enhances the noise-resilience of VD, and thus is anticipated to elevate the performance of quantum algorithm implementations on near-term quantum devices.
   This study focuses on reducing noise in the circuit used in the quantum error mitigation method called Virtual Distillation (VD). The authors introduce an approach which significantly enhances the noise tolerance of VD and improves the accuracy by an order of magnitude compared to the standard VD.

TI Quantum coherence of a long-lifetime exciton-polariton condensate
SO COMMUNICATIONS MATERIALS
AB In recent years, quantum information science has made significant progress, leading to a multitude of quantum protocols for the most diverse applications. States carrying resources such as quantum coherence are a key component for these protocols. In this study, we optimize the quantum coherence of a nonresonantly excited exciton-polariton condensate of long living polaritons by minimizing the condensate's interaction with the surrounding reservoir of excitons and free carriers. By combining experimental phase space data with a displaced thermal state model, we observe how quantum coherence builds up as the system is driven above the condensation threshold. Our findings demonstrate that a spatial separation between the condensate and the reservoir enhances the state's maximum quantum coherence directly beyond the threshold. These insights pave the way for integrating polariton systems into hybrid quantum devices and advancing applications in quantum technologies.

TI A systematic variational approach to band theory in a quantum computer
SO RSC ADVANCES
AB Quantum computers promise to revolutionize our ability to simulate molecules, and cloud-based hardware is becoming increasingly accessible to a wide body of researchers. Algorithms such as Quantum Phase Estimation and the Variational Quantum Eigensolver are being actively developed and demonstrated in small systems. However, extremely limited qubit count and low fidelity seriously limit useful applications, especially in the crystalline phase, where compact orbital bases are difficult to develop. To address this difficulty, we present a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm to solve the band structure of any periodic system described by an adequate tight-binding model. We showcase our algorithm by computing the band structure of a simple-cubic crystal with one s and three p orbitals per site (a simple model for polonium) using simulators with increasingly realistic levels of noise and culminating with calculations on IBM quantum computers. Our results show that the algorithm is reliable in a low-noise device, functional with low precision on present-day noisy quantum computers, and displays a complexity that scales as omega(M-3) with the number M of tight-binding orbitals per unit-cell, similarly to its classical counterparts. Our simulations offer a new insight into the "quantum" mindset and demonstrate how the algorithms under active development today can be optimized in special cases, such as band structure calculations.

TI Thermal entanglement of superconducting qubits for arbitrary interaction
   strength
SO PHYSICA C-SUPERCONDUCTIVITY AND ITS APPLICATIONS
AB We investigate the thermal entanglement in two superconducting qubits for arbitrary interaction strength and ground state frequencies. We calculate the concurrence of the system to quantify the thermal entanglement. We suggest a scheme, where an external tunable coupler qubit sandwich between two superconducting qubits generates entanglement. The behavior of concurrence is analyzed for three different cases, in which we consider the effects of the temperature, the qubit-qubit effective coupling strength, and the qubit frequencies on the thermal entanglement. What deserves mentioning here is that to achieve maximally entangled states, it is better to use two superconducting qubits with the same frequencies. We also note that for a given temperature, the thermal entanglement can be tuned by qubit internal capacitance and inductance.

TI Multi-Soliton Propagation and Interaction in Λ-Type EIT Media: An
   Integrable Approach
SO PHOTONICS
AB Electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) is well known as a quantum optical phenomenon that permits a normally opaque medium to become transparent due to the quantum interference between transition pathways. This work addresses multi-soliton dynamics in an EIT system modeled by the integrable Maxwell-Bloch (MB) equations for a three-level Lambda-type atomic configuration. By employing a generalized gauge transformation, we systematically construct explicit N-soliton solutions from the corresponding Lax pair. Explicit forms of one-, two-, three-, and four-soliton solutions are derived and analyzed. The resulting pulse structures reveal various nonlinear phenomena, such as temporal asymmetry, energy trapping, and soliton interactions. They also highlight coherent propagation, elastic collisions, and partial storage of pulses, which have potential implications for the design of quantum memory, slow light, and photonic data transport in EIT media. In addition, the conservation of fundamental physical quantities, such as the excitation norm and Hamiltonian, is used to provide direct evidence of the integrability and stability of the constructed soliton solutions.

TI Learning entanglement breakdown as a phase transition by confusion
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB Quantum technologies require methods for preparing and manipulating entangled multiparticle states. However, the problem of determining whether a given quantum state is entangled or separable is known to be an NP-hard problem in general, and even the task of detecting entanglement breakdown for a given class of quantum states is difficult. In this work, we develop an approach for revealing entanglement breakdown using a machine learning technique, which is known as 'learning by confusion'. We consider a family of quantum states, which is parameterized such that there is a single critical value dividing states within this family into separate and entangled. We demonstrate the 'learning by confusion' scheme allows us to determine the critical value. Specifically, we study the performance of the method for the two-qubit, two-qutrit, and two-ququart entangled state. In addition, we investigate the properties of the local depolarization and the generalized amplitude damping channel in the framework of the confusion scheme. Within our approach and setting the parameterization of special trajectories, we obtain an entanglement-breakdown 'phase diagram' of a quantum channel, which indicates regions of entangled (separable) states and the entanglement-breakdown region. Then we extend the way of using the 'learning by confusion' scheme for recognizing whether an arbitrary given state is entangled or separable. We show that the developed method provides correct answers for a variety of states, including entangled states with positive partial transpose. We also present a more practical version of the method, which is suitable for studying entanglement breakdown in noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices. We demonstrate its performance using an available cloud-based IBM quantum processor.

TI Addressing quantum's "fine print" with efficient state preparation and
   information extraction for quantum algorithms and geologic fracture
   networks
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Quantum algorithms provide an exponential speedup for solving certain classes of linear systems, including those that model geologic fracture flow. However, this revolutionary gain in efficiency does not come without difficulty. Quantum algorithms require that problems satisfy not only algorithm-specific constraints, but also application-specific ones. Otherwise, the quantum advantage carefully attained through algorithmic ingenuity can be entirely negated. Previous work addressing quantum algorithms for geologic fracture flow has illustrated core algorithmic approaches while incrementally removing assumptions. This work addresses two further requirements for solving geologic fracture flow systems with quantum algorithms: efficient system state preparation and efficient information extraction. Our approach to addressing each is consistent with an overall exponential speed-up.

AB Two fundamental properties of quantum states that quantum information theory explores are pseudorandomness and provability of destruction. We introduce the notion of quantum pseudorandom states with proofs of destruction (PRSPD) that combines both these properties. Like standard pseudorandom states (PRS), these are efficiently generated quantum states that are indistinguishable from random, but they can also be measured to create a classical string. This string is verifiable (given the secret key) and certifies that the state has been destructed. We show that, similarly to PRS, PRSPD can be constructed from any post-quantum one-way function. As far as the authors are aware, this is the first construction of a family of states that satisfies both pseudorandomness and provability of destruction.
   We show that many cryptographic applications that were shown based on PRS variants using quantum communication can be based on (variants of) PRSPD using only classical communication. This includes symmetric encryption, message authentication, one-time signatures, commitments, and classically verifiable private quantum coins.

TI Elimination of noise in optically rephased photon echoes
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Photon echo is a fundamental tool for the manipulation of electromagnetic fields. Unavoidable spontaneous emission noise is generated in this process due to the strong rephasing pulse, which limits the achievable signal-to-noise ratio and represents a fundamental obstacle towards their applications in the quantum regime. Here we propose a noiseless photon-echo protocol based on a four-level atomic system. We implement this protocol in a Eu3+:Y2SiO5 crystal to serve as an optical quantum memory. A storage fidelity of 0.9520.018 is obtained for time-bin qubits encoded with single-photon-level coherent pulses, which is far beyond the maximal fidelity achievable using the classical measure-and-prepare strategy. In this work, the demonstrated noiseless photon-echo quantum memory features spin-wave storage, easy operation and high storage fidelity, which should be easily extended to other physical systems. Photon echo techniques are difficult to implement in the quantum regime due to coherent and spontaneous emission noise. Here, the authors propose a low-noise photon-echo quantum memory approach based on all-optical control in a four-level system, and demonstrate it using a Eu3+:Y2SiO5 crystal.

TI Highly-efficient quantum Fourier transformations for certain non-Abelian
   groups
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
AB Quantum Fourier transformations are an essential component of many quantum algorithms, from prime factoring to quantum simulation. While the standard Abelian QFrT is well studied, important variants corresponding to non-Abelian groups of interest have seen less development. In particular, fast non-Abelian Fourier transformations are important components for both quantum simulations of field theories as well as approaches to the non-Abelian hidden subgroup problem. In this work, we present fast quantum Fourier transformations for a number of non-Abelian groups of interest for high energy physics, BT, BO, 60(27), 0(54), and Sigma(36 x 3). For each group, we derive explicit quantum circuits and estimate resource scaling for fault-tolerant implementations. Our work shows that the development of a fast Fourier transformation can substantively reduce simulation costs by an up to three orders of magnitude for the finite groups that we have investigated.

TI Individual qubit addressing of rotating ion crystals in a Penning trap
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Trapped ions boast long coherence times and excellent gate fidelities, making them a useful platform for quantum information processing. Penning traps offer the possibility of trapping large two-dimensional crystals of several hundred ions. The ions are confined by controlling the rotation of the ion crystal in the presence of a strong magnetic field. However, the rotation of the ion crystal makes single ion addressability a significant challenge. We propose a protocol that takes advantage of a deformable mirror to introduce AC Stark shift patterns that are static in the rotating frame of the crystal. Through numerical simulations we validate the potential of this protocol to perform high-fidelity single-ion gates in crystalline arrays of hundreds of ions.

TI Variational quantum state discriminator for supervised machine learning
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Quantum state discrimination (QSD) is a fundamental task in quantum information processing with numerous applications. We present a variational quantum algorithm that performs the minimum-error QSD, called the variational quantum state discriminator (VQSD). The VQSD uses a parameterized quantum circuit that is trained by minimizing a cost function derived from the QSD, and finds the optimal positive-operator valued measure (POVM) for distinguishing target quantum states. The VQSD is capable of discriminating even unknown states, eliminating the need for expensive quantum state tomography. Our numerical simulations and comparisons with semidefinite programming demonstrate the effectiveness of the VQSD in finding optimal POVMs for minimum-error QSD of both pure and mixed states. In addition, the VQSD can be utilized as a supervised machine learning algorithm for multi-class classification. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve obtained in numerical simulations with the Iris flower dataset ranges from 0.97 to 1 with an average of 0.985, demonstrating excellent performance of the VQSD classifier.

TI Unitary-coupled restricted Boltzmann machine ansatz for quantum
   simulations
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Neural-network quantum state (NQS) has attracted significant interests as a powerful wave-function ansatz to model quantum phenomena. In particular, a variant of NQS based on the restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM) has been adapted to model the ground state of spin lattices and the electronic structures of small molecules in quantum devices. Despite these progresses, significant challenges remain with the RBM-NQS-based quantum simulations. In this work, we present a state-preparation protocol to generate a specific set of complex-valued RBM-NQS, which we name the unitary-coupled RBM-NQS, in quantum circuits. Our proposal expands the applicability of NQS as prior works deal exclusively with real-valued RBM-NQS for quantum algorithms. With this scheme, we achieve (1) modeling complex-valued wave functions, (2) using as few as one ancilla qubit to simulate M hidden spins in an RBM architecture, and (3) avoiding post-selections to improve scalability.

TI Quantum violation of local causality in an urban network using hybrid
   photonic technologies
SO OPTICA
AB Quantum networks play a crucial role in distributed quantum information processing, enabling the establishment of entanglement and quantum communication among distant nodes. Fundamentally, networks with independent sources allow for new forms of nonlocality, beyond the paradigmatic Bell's theorem. Here we implement the simplest of such networks-the bilocality scenario-in an urban network connecting different buildings with a fully scalable and hybrid approach. Two independent sources using different technologies-a quantum dot and a nonlinear crystal-are used to share a photonic entangled state among three nodes connected through a 270 m free-space channel and fiber links. By violating a suitable nonlinear Bell inequality, we demonstrate the nonlocal behavior of the correlations among the nodes of the network. Our results pave the way towards the realization of more complex networks and the implementation of quantum communication protocols in an urban environment, leveraging the capabilities of hybrid photonic technologies.

TI Low-Depth Unitary Quantum Circuits for Dualities in One-Dimensional
   Quantum Lattice Models
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB A systematic approach to dualities in symmetric (1 + 1)d quantum lattice models has recently been proposed in terms of module categories over the symmetry fusion categories. By characterizing the nontrivial way in which dualities intertwine closed boundary conditions and charge sectors, these can be implemented by unitary matrix product operators. In this Letter, we explain how to turn such duality operators into unitary linear depth quantum circuits via the introduction of ancillary degrees of freedom that keep track of the various sectors. The linear depth is consistent with the fact that these dualities change the phase of the states on which they act. When supplemented with measurements, we show that dualities with respect to symmetries encoded into nilpotent fusion categories can be realized in constant depth. The resulting circuits can for instance be used to efficiently prepare short-and long-range entangled states or map between different gapped boundaries of (2 + 1)d topological models.

TI A fully fiber-integrated ion trap for portable quantum technologies
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Trapped ions are a promising platform for the deployment of quantum technologies. However, traditional ion trap experiments tend to be bulky and environment-sensitive due to the use of free-space optics. Here we present a single-ion trap with integrated optical fibers directly embedded within the trap structure, to deliver laser light as well as to collect the ion's fluorescence. This eliminates the need for optical windows. We characterise the system's performance and measure the ion's fluorescence with signal-to-background ratios on the order of 50, which allows us to perform internal state readout measurements with a fidelity over 99% in 600 mu s. We test the system's resilience to thermal variations in the range between 22 and 53 degrees C, and the system's vibration resilience at 34 Hz and 300 Hz and find no effect on its performance. The combination of compactness and robustness of our fiber-coupled trap makes it well suited for applications in, as well as outside, research laboratory environments, and in particular for highly compact portable quantum technologies, such as portable optical atomic clocks. While our system is designed for trapping Ca-40(+) ions the fundamental design principles can be applied to other ion species.

AB This work details the theory and implementation of a multi-wavelength quantum key distribution (QKD) emulation system with a physical unclonable function (PUF). Multi-wavelength QKD can eliminate the need to share a subsection of the final key for eavesdropper detection and allow for ternary and quaternary data transmission. The inclusion of the PUF adds an additional layer of security. We provide preliminary error analysis of our emulation system. To support this work, we introduce a bitwise transform operator that enables binary output of the PUF to satisfy the ternary and quaternary input requirements of the QKD system.

TI Quantum Interference between Photons and Single Quanta of Stored Atomic
   Coherence
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Essential for building quantum networks over remote independent nodes, the indistinguishability of photons has been extensively studied by observing the coincidence dip in the Hong-Ou-Mandel interferometer. However, indistinguishability is not limited to the same type of bosons. For the first time, we hereby observe quantum interference between flying photons and a single quantum of stored atomic coherence (magnon) in an atom-light beam splitter interface. We demonstrate that the Hermiticity of this interface determines the type of quantum interference between photons and magnons. Consequently, not only the bunching behavior that characterizes bosons is observed, but counterintuitively, fermionlike antibunching as well. The hybrid nature of the demonstrated magnon-photon quantum interface can be applied to versatile quantum memory platforms, and can lead to fundamentally different photon distributions from those occurring in boson sampling.

TI Mapping renormalized coupled cluster methods to quantum computers
   through a compact unitary representation of nonunitary operators
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Nonunitary theories are commonly seen in the classical simulations of quantum systems. Among these theories, the method of moments of coupled cluster equations (MMCCs) and the ensuing classes of the renormalized coupled cluster (CC) approaches have evolved into one of the most accurate approaches to describe correlation effects in various quantum systems. The MMCC formalism provides an effective way for correcting the energies of approximate CC formulations (parent theories) using moments, or CC equations, that are not used to determine approximate cluster amplitudes. In this paper, we propose a quantum algorithm for computing MMCC ground-state energies that provides two main advantages over classical computing or other quantum algorithms: (i) the possibility of forming superpositions of CC moments of arbitrary ranks in the entire Hilbert space and using an arbitrary form of the parent cluster operator for MMCC expansion, and (ii) significant reduction in the number of measurements in quantum simulation through a compact unitary representation for a generally nonunitary operator. We illustrate the robustness of our approach over a broad class of test cases, including similar to 40 molecular systems with varying basis sets encoded using 4-40 qubits, and we exhibit the detailed MMCC analysis for the 8-qubit half-filled, four-site, single impurity Anderson model and the 12-qubit hydrogen fluoride molecular system from the corresponding noise-free and noisy MMCC quantum computations. We also outline the extension of the MMCC formalism to the case of a unitary CC wave-function Ansatz.

TI Hybrid Classical- Quantum Optimization Techniques for Solving
   Mixed-Integer Programming Problems in Production Scheduling
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM ENGINEERING
AB Quantum computing (QC) holds great promise to open up a new era of computing and has been receiving significant attention recently. To overcome the performance limitations of near-term QC, utilizing the current quantum computers to complement classical techniques for solving real-world problems is of utmost importance. In this article, we develop QC-based solution strategies that exploit quantum annealing and classical optimization techniques for solving large-scale scheduling problems in manufacturing systems. The applications of the proposed algorithms are illustrated through two case studies in production scheduling. First, we present a hybrid QC-based solution approach for the job-shop scheduling problem. Second, we propose a hybrid QC-based parametric method for the multipurpose batch scheduling problem with a fractional objective. The proposed hybrid algorithms can tackle optimization problems formulated as mixed-integer linear and mixed-integer fractional programs, respectively, and provide feasibility guarantees. Performance comparison between state-of-the-art exact and heuristic solvers and the proposed QC-based hybrid solution techniques is presented for both job-shop and batch scheduling problems. Unlike conventional classical solution techniques, the proposed hybrid frameworks harness quantum annealing to supplement established deterministic optimization algorithms and demonstrate performance efficiency over standard off-the-shelf optimization solvers.

TI Collective neutrino oscillations on a quantum computer
SO QUANTUM INFORMATION PROCESSING
AB We calculate the energy levels of a system of neutrinos undergoing collective oscillations as functions of an effective coupling strength and radial distance from the neutrino source using the quantum Lanczos (QLanczos) algorithm implemented on IBM Q quantum computer hardware. Our calculations are based on the many-body neutrino interaction Hamiltonian introduced in Patwardhan et al. (Phys Rev D 99, https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevD.99.123013, 2019). We show that the system Hamiltonian can be separated into smaller blocks, which can be represented using fewer qubits than those needed to represent the entire system as one unit, thus reducing the noise in the implementation on quantum hardware. We also calculate transition probabilities of collective neutrino oscillations using a Trotterization method which is simplified before subsequent implementation on hardware. These calculations demonstrate that energy eigenvalues of a collective neutrino system and collective neutrino oscillations can both be computed on quantum hardware with certain simplification to within good agreement with exact results.

TI Exact Quantum Algorithms for Quantum Phase Recognition: Renormalization
   Group and Error Correction
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB We explore the relationship between renormalization-group (RG) flow and error correction by constructing quantum algorithms that exactly recognize one-dimensional symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases protected by finite internal Abelian symmetries. For each SPT phase, our algorithm runs a quantum circuit, which emulates RG flow: an arbitrary input ground-state wave function in the phase is mapped to a unique minimally entangled reference state, thereby allowing for efficient phase identification. This construction is enabled by viewing a generic input state in the phase as a collection of coherent "errors" applied to the reference state, and engineering a quantum circuit to efficiently detect and correct such errors. Importantly, the error-correction threshold is proven to coincide exactly with the phase boundary. We discuss the implications of our results in the context of condensed-matter physics, machine learning, and near-term quantum algorithms.

TI Entanglement and teleportation in thermal states of spin chains with
   nonlinear coupling
SO ALEXANDRIA ENGINEERING JOURNAL
AB The impact of nonlinear coupling on entanglement and teleportation in a two-qubit spin system featuring Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) interaction was investigated while considering both homogeneous and inhomogeneous magnetic fields. Additionally, the dependencies of entanglement and teleportation on temperature and magnetic field for this specific interaction were analyzed. The findings demonstrate that the nonlinear coupling and DM interaction play significant roles in enhancing entanglement and teleportation. Furthermore, the results show that nonlinear coupling can positively affect the negativity and accuracy of teleportation, which are critical factors in quantum information processing. This suggests that nonlinear coupling could be valuable in developing quantum technologies.

TI Speedup of high-order unconstrained binary optimization using quantum Z2
   lattice gauge theory
SO COMMUNICATIONS PHYSICS
AB An important and difficult problem in optimization is the high-order unconstrained binary optimization, which can represent many optimization problems more efficiently than quadratic unconstrained binary optimization, but how to quickly solve it has remained difficult. Here, we present an approach by mapping the high-order unconstrained binary optimization to quantum Z2 lattice gauge theory and propose the gauged local quantum annealing, which is the local quantum annealing protected by the gauge symmetry. We present the quantum algorithm and its corresponding quantum-inspired classical algorithm for this problem and achieve algorithmic speedup by using gauge symmetry. By running the quantum-inspired classical algorithm, we demonstrate that the gauged local quantum annealing reduces the computational time by one order of magnitude from that of the local quantum annealing.

TI Machine-Guided Design of Oxidation-Resistant Superconductors for Quantum
   Information Applications
SO INORGANICS
AB Decoherence in superconducting qubits has long been attributed to two-level systems arising from the surfaces and interfaces present in real devices. A recent significant step in reducing decoherence was the replacement of superconducting niobium by superconducting tantalum, resulting in a tripling of transmon qubit lifetimes (T-1). The identity, thickness, and quality of the native surface oxide, is thought to play a major role, as tantalum only has one oxide whereas niobium has several. Here we report the development of a thermodynamic metric to rank materials based on their potential to form a well-defined, thin, surface oxide. We first computed this metric for known binary and ternary metal alloys using data available from the Materials Project and experimentally validated the strengths and limits of this metric through the preparation and controlled oxidation of eight known metal alloys. Then we trained a convolutional neural network to predict the value of this metric from atomic composition and atomic properties. This allowed us to compute the metric for materials that are not present in the Materials Project, including a large selection of known superconductors, and, when combined with T-c, allowed us to identify new candidate superconductors for quantum information science and engineering (QISE) applications. We tested the oxidation resistance of a pair of these predictions experimentally. Our results are expected to lay the foundation for the tailored and rapid selection of improved superconductors for QISE.

TI A Primer on Quantum Mechanics for Electrical Engineers
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB We introduce here an approach that presents the basics of quantum mechanics to electrical engineers using common matrix algebra and Fourier series knowledge. Designed to quickly impart a fundamental understanding, this strategy bypasses the complex mathematics typically required. Amidst the unfolding second quantum revolution, the accelerated development of quantum engineering in academia and industry underscores the urgent need for a skilled workforce. Scientific and technological fields like quantum computing, quantum sensing, and quantum communications are gaining significant momentum, necessitating the urgent involvement of electrical engineers skilled in management, design, manufacturing, and research. These professionals require foundational quantum mechanics knowledge to effectively integrate these principles with their existing technical skills in areas like automatic control theory and signal processing. Traditionally, educational methods have targeted physicists rather than engineers, often treating quantum mechanics as too abstract for practical engineering applications. However, the rise of quantum technology now demands the inclusion of engineers from diverse backgrounds. Our proposal offers this primer as an innovative, electrical engineering-focused educational tool. We strongly believe that our approach prepares engineers to make significant contributions to the rapidly expanding field of quantum technology.

TI A Missing Link: The Double-Slit Experiment and Quantum Entanglement
SO ENTROPY
AB This article reconsiders the double-slit experiment by establishing a new type of relationship between it and the concept of entanglement. While the role of entanglement in the double-slit experiment has been considered, this particular relationship appears to have been missed in preceding discussions of the experiment, even by Bohr, who extensively used it to support his argument concerning quantum physics. The main reason for this relationship is the different roles of the diaphragm with slits in two setups, S1 and S2, defining the double-slit experiment as a quantum experiment. In S1, in each individual run of the experiment one can in principle (even if not actually) know throughout which slit the quantum object considered has passed; in S2 this knowledge is in principle impossible, which impossibility is coextensive with the appearance of the interference pattern, once a sufficient number of individual runs of the experiment have taken place. The article offers the following argument based on two new concepts, an "experimentally quantum object" and an "ontologically quantum object." In S1 the diaphragm can be treated as part of an observational arrangement and thus considered as a classical object, while the object passing through one or the other slit is considered as an "ontologically quantum object," defined as an object necessary to establish a quantum phenomenon. By contrast, in S2, the diaphragm can, via the concept of Heisenberg-von-Neumann cut, be treated as an "experimentally quantum object," defined as an object treatable by quantum theory, even while possibly being an ontologically classical object. This interaction is not an observation but a quantum entanglement between these two quantum objects, one ontologically and one experimentally quantum. This argument is grounded in a particular interpretation of quantum phenomena and quantum theory, which belongs to the class of interpretations designated here as "reality without realism" (RWR) interpretations. The article also argues that wave-particle complementarity, with which the concept of complementarity is often associated, plays little, if any, role in quantum physics, or in Bohr's thinking, and may be misleading in considering the double-slit experiment, often explained by using this complementarity.

TI Logical qubit behavior model and fast simulation for surface code
SO QUANTUM INFORMATION PROCESSING
AB This study proposes a logical qubit behavior model (LQBM) that calculates the state of the logical qubit based on a surface code after a logical qubit operation. LQBM can simulate the surface code whose distance exceeds 5, which is impossible with conventional quantum simulators. A complex error syndrome measurement must not be executed in this model. LQBM works at the mixed level of a logical and physical qubit. Probability amplitudes and the number of state vectors are designed at the physical qubit level. The state vectors of physical qubits constituting a logical qubit are abstracted to the value of the logical qubit level. LQBM converts all logical qubit operations, which include an initialization, a state injection, universal gates, and lattice surgery operations (e.g., a merge and a split) to simple calculations. LQBM provides a better computational complexity of O(log(distance)) than O(distance(2)). Through simulation experiments, it was found that LQBM performs logical qubit operations up to 24 million times faster than existing quantum simulators in the case of distance = 5.

TI Bound entanglement-assisted prepare-and-measure scenarios based on
   four-dimensional quantum messages
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB We present a class of linear correlation witnesses that detects bound entanglement within a three-party prepare-and-measure scenario with four-dimensional quantum messages. We relate the detection power of our witnesses for two-ququart Bloch-product-diagonal states to that of the computable cross norm-realignment criterion. Several bound entangled states in four or even higher dimensions, including those which are useful in metrology, can exceed the separable bound computed by reliable iterative methods. In particular, we show that a prominent two-ququart bound entangled state with a positive partial transpose can be mixed with up to 40% isotropic noise and still be detected as entangled by our prepare-and-measure witness. Furthermore, our witnesses appear to be experimentally practical, requiring only the use of qubit rotations on Alice's and Bob's sides and product qubit measurements with binary outcomes on Charlie's side.

TI Non-equilibrium dynamics of a dissipative two-site Hubbard model
   simulated on IBM quantum computers
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS A-MATHEMATICAL AND THEORETICAL
AB Many-body physics is one very well suited field for testing quantum algorithms and for finding working heuristics on present quantum computers. We have investigated the non-equilibrium dynamics of one- and two-electron systems, which are coupled to an environment that introduces decoherence and dissipation. In our approach, the electronic system is represented in the framework of a two-site Hubbard model while the environment is modelled by a spin bath. To simulate the non-equilibrium population probabilities of the different states on a quantum computer we have encoded the electronic states and environmental degrees of freedom into qubits and ancilla qubits (bath), respectively. The total evolution time was divided into short time intervals, during which the system evolves. After each of these time steps, the system interacts with ancilla qubits representing the bath in thermal equilibrium. We have specifically studied spin baths leading to both, unital and non-unital dynamics of the electronic system and have found that electron correlations clearly enhance the electron transfer rates in the latter case. For short time periods, the simulation on the quantum computer is found to be in very good agreement with the exact results if error mitigation methods are applied. Our method to simulate also non-unitary time-evolution on a quantum computer can be well extended to simulate electronic systems in correlated spin baths as well as in bosonic and fermionic baths.

TI Ultrabright polarization-entangled photon pair source for
   frequency-multiplexed quantum communication in free-space
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB The distribution of entanglement via satellite links will drastically extend the reach of quantum networks. Highly efficient entangled photon sources are an essential requirement towards overcoming high channel loss and achieving practical transmission rates in long-distance satellite downlinks. Here we report on an ultrabright entangled photon source that is optimized for long-distance free-space transmission. It operates in a wavelength range that is efficiently detected with space-ready single photon avalanche diodes (Si-SPADs), and readily provides pair emission rates that exceed the detector bandwidth (i.e., the temporal resolution). To overcome this limitation, we demultiplex the photon flux into wavelength channels that can be handled by current single photon detector technology. This is achieved efficiently by using the spectral correlations due to hyper-entanglement in polarization and frequency as an auxiliary resource. Combined with recent demonstrations of space-proof source prototypes, these results pave the way to a broadband long-distance entanglement distribution network based on satellites.(c) 2023 Optica Publishing Group under the terms of the Optica Open Access Publishing Agreement

TI Variational quantum algorithm for ergotropy estimation in quantum
   many-body batteries
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Quantum batteries are predicted to have the potential to outperform their classical counterparts and are therefore an important element in the development of quantum technologies. Of particular interest is the role of correlations in many-body quantum batteries and how these can affect the maximal work extraction, quantified by the ergotropy. In this paper we simulate the charging process and work extraction of many-body quantum batteries on noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices and devise the variational quantum ergotropy (VQErgo) algorithm, which finds the optimal unitary operation that maximizes work extraction from the battery. We test VQErgo by calculating the ergotropy of a many-body quantum battery undergoing transverse field Ising dynamics following a sudden quench. We investigate the battery for different system sizes and charging times and analyze the minimum number of ansatz circuit repetitions needed for the variational optimization using both ideal and noisy simulators. We also discuss how the growth of long-range correlations can hamper the accuracy of VQErgo in larger systems, requiring increased repetitions of the ansatz circuit to reduce error. Finally, we optimize part of the VQErgo algorithm and calculate the ergotropy on one of IBM's quantum devices.

TI Path Integral Framework for Characterizing and Controlling Decoherence
   Induced by Nonstationary Environments on a Quantum Probe
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Reliable processing of quantum information is a milestone to achieve for the deployment of quantum technologies. Uncontrolled, out-of-equilibrium sources of decoherence need to be characterized in detail for designing the control of quantum devices to mitigate the loss of quantum information. However, quantum sensing of such environments is still a challenge due to their nonstationary nature that in general can generate complex high-order correlations. We introduce a path integral framework to characterize nonstationary environmental fluctuations by a quantum probe. We find the solution for the decoherence decay of nonstationary, generalized Gaussian processes that induce pure dephasing. This dephasing when expressed in a suitable basis, based on the nonstationary noise eigenmodes, is defined by the overlap of a generalized noise spectral density and a filter function that depends on the control fields. This result thus extends the validity of the similar general expression for the dephasing of open quantum systems coupled to stationary noise processes to out-of-equilibrium environments. We show physical insights for a broad subclass of nonstationary noise processes that are local in time, in the sense that the noise correlation functions contain memory based on constraints of the derivatives of the fluctuating noise paths. Spectral and non-Markovian properties are discussed together with implementations of the framework to treat paradigmatic environments that are out of equilibrium, e.g., due to a quench and a pulsed noise. We show that our results provide tools for probing the spectral and time-correlation properties, and for mitigating decoherence effects of out-of-equilibrium-nonstationary-environments.

TI A variational toolbox for quantum multi-parameter estimation
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB With an ever-expanding ecosystem of noisy and intermediate-scale quantum devices, exploring their possible applications is a rapidly growing field of quantum information science. In this work, we demonstrate that variational quantum algorithms feasible on such devices address a challenge central to the field of quantum metrology: The identification of near-optimal probes and measurement operators for noisy multi-parameter estimation problems. We first introduce a general framework that allows for sequential updates of variational parameters to improve probe states and measurements and is widely applicable to both discrete and continuous-variable settings. We then demonstrate the practical functioning of the approach through numerical simulations, showcasing how tailored probes and measurements improve over standard methods in the noisy regime. Along the way, we prove the validity of a general parameter-shift rule for noisy evolutions, expected to be of general interest in variational quantum algorithms. In our approach, we advocate the mindset of quantum-aided design, exploiting quantum technology to learn close to optimal, experimentally feasible quantum metrology protocols.

TI Quantum computing based hybrid deep learning for fault diagnosis in
   electrical power systems
SO APPLIED ENERGY
AB Quantum computing (QC) and deep learning have shown promise of supporting transformative advances and have recently gained popularity in a wide range of areas. This paper proposes a hybrid QC-based deep learning framework for fault diagnosis of electrical power systems that combine the feature extraction capabilities of conditional restricted Boltzmann machine with an efficient classification of deep networks. Computational challenges stemming from the complexities of such deep learning models are overcome by QC-based training methodologies that effectively leverage the complementary strengths of quantum assisted learning and classical training techniques. The proposed hybrid QC-based deep learning framework is tested on a simulated electrical power system with 30 buses and wide variations of substation and transmission line faults, to demonstrate the framework's applicability, efficiency, and generalization capabilities. High computational efficiency is enjoyed by the proposed hybrid approach in terms of computational effort required and quality of diagnosis performance over classical training methods. In addition, superior and reliable fault diagnosis performance with faster response time is achieved over state-of-the-art pattern recognition methods based on artificial neural networks (ANN) and decision trees (DT).

TI Pulse-controlled qubit in semiconductor double quantum dots
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB We present a numerically-optimized multipulse framework for the quantum control of a single-electron double quantum dot qubit. Our framework defines a set of pulse sequences, necessary for the manipulation of the ideal qubit basis, that avoids errors associated with excitations outside the computational subspace. A novel control scheme manipulates the qubit adiabatically, while also retaining high speed and ability to perform a general single-qubit rotation. This basis generates spatially localized logical qubit states, making readout straightforward. We consider experimentally realistic semiconductor qubits with finite pulse rise and fall times and determine the fastest pulse sequence yielding the highest fidelity. We show that our protocol leads to improved control of a qubit. We present simulations of a double quantum dot in a semiconductor device to visualize and verify our protocol. These results can be generalized to other physical systems since they depend only on pulse rise and fall times and the energy gap between the two lowest eigenstates.

TI Dynamics of quantum information and entanglement in two qubits coupled
   to a Bose-Einstein condensate of microwave-shielded polar molecules
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We theoretically investigate the dynamics of quantum information and entanglement of two distant qubits embedded in a thermal dephasing reservoir consisting of three-dimensional Bose-Einstein condensates of microwave-shielded polar molecules. We calculate the decoherence factors, the quantum Fisher information, and the decay rates in terms of the spatial separation between qubits, temperature, and Rabi frequency that tunes the shielding potential. The results show that the dynamics of decoherence factors and the quantum Fisher information are nonmonotonic with revival oscillations at larger separations due to interqubit and qubit-environment correlations. Within our proposed model we can significantly improve the estimation of the environment parameters such as the spectral density, which exhibits a super-Ohmic behavior, and temperature. We demonstrate that the shielding interaction may drive the system from the Markovian to the non-Markovian regime enabling us to well control the information flow dynamics and to reach higher values of entanglement.

TI Calibrating magnetic flux control in superconducting circuits by
   compensating distortions on timescales from nanoseconds up to tens of
   microseconds
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Fast tuning of the transition frequency of superconducting qubits using magnetic flux is essential, for example, for realizing high-fidelity two-qubit gates with low leakage or for reducing errors in dispersive qubit readout. To apply accurately shaped flux pulses, signal distortions induced by the flux control lines need to be carefully compensated for. This requires their in situ characterization at the reference plane of the qubit. However, many existing approaches are limited in time resolution or in pulse duration. Here, we overcome these limitations and demonstrate accurate flux control with subpermille residual frequency errors on timescales ranging from nanoseconds to tens of microseconds. We achieve this by combining two complementary methods to characterize and compensate for pulse distortions. We have deployed this approach successfully in a quantum error correction experiment calibrating 24 flux-activated two-qubit gates. Reliable calibration methods, as the ones presented here, are essential in experiments scaling up superconducting quantum processors.

TI Quantum optimisation for supply chain: QUBO formulations and QAOA
   solutions for facility location and load balancing
SO RESULTS IN ENGINEERING
AB Quantum computing is emerging as a promising paradigm for solving combinatorial optimisation problems that are intractable for classical methods. Among the most prominent quantum algorithms is the Quantum Approximate Optimisation Algorithm (QAOA), which has demonstrated potential in addressing NP-hard problems using shallow circuits compatible with Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices. While QAOA has been applied to logistics and scheduling tasks, foundational supply chain problems such as Facility Location (FL) and Load Balancing (LB) remain largely unexplored. This paper addresses this gap by formulating FL and LB as Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimisation (QUBO) models and solving them using QAOA under both noiseless and hardware-calibrated noisy conditions. Two encoding methods are compared: the conventional slack-variable approach and the unbalanced penalisation technique. Results show that unbalanced penalisation consistently outperforms the slack-variable method by achieving higher feasibility and optimality rates and by avoiding the qubit inflation that limits slack-based encodings. FL instances, modelled as minimum dominating sets, exhibit strong performance in both noiseless and noisy simulations, whereas LB instances suffer from depth-induced noise due to their denser constraints. Furthermore, we outline the QUBO-to-Ising transformation process, with open-source implementations in PennyLane and Qiskit. To the best of our knowledge, this work represents the first application of QAOA to FL and LB, bridging the gap between quantum algorithm design and practical supply chain optimisation.

AB We evaluate the performance of coherent frequency-shift keying (CFSK) [1], [2] alphabets for communication on quantum channels. We show that, contrarily to what previously thought, the square-root-measurement (SRM) is sub-optimal for discriminating CFSK states. Furthermore, we compute the maximum information transmission rate of the CFSK alphabet, observing that it employs at least as many frequency modes as the signal states, and compare it with standard phase-shift-keying. Finally, we introduce a discretized CFSK alphabet with higher mode-efficiency, exhibiting comparable error-probability performance with respect to CFSK and better rate performance. Our results suggest the existence of a tradeoff between the CFSK reduced error-probability and its mode efficiency.

TI Non-Gaussian quantum state generation by multi-photon subtraction at the
   telecommunication wavelength
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB In the field of continuous-variable quantum information processing, non-Gaussian states with negative values of the Wigner function are crucial for the development of a fault -tolerant universal quantum computer. While several non-Gaussian states have been generated experimentally, none have been created using ultrashort optical wave packets, which are necessary for high-speed quantum computation, in the telecommunication wavelength band where mature optical communication technology is available. In this paper, we present the generation of non -Gaussian states on wave packets with a short 8-ps duration in the 1545.32 nm telecommunication wavelength band using photon subtraction up to three photons. We used a low-loss, quasi-single spatial mode waveguide optical parametric amplifier, a superconducting transition edge sensor, and a phase-locked pulsed homodyne measurement system to observe negative values of the Wigner function without loss correction up to three-photon subtraction. These results can be extended to the generation of more complicated non-Gaussian states and are a key technology in the pursuit of high-speed optical quantum computation.(c) 2023 Optica Publishing Group under the terms of the Optica Open Access Publishing Agreement

Machine learning (ML) has recently shown promise in alleviating these complexities. ML has been applied to almost every stage of CV-QKD protocols, including ML-assisted phase error estimation, excess noise estimation, state discrimination, parameter estimation and optimization, key sifting, information reconciliation, and key rate estimation. This survey provides a comprehensive analysis of the current literature on ML-assisted CV-QKD. In addition, the survey compares the ML algorithms assisting CV-QKD with the traditional algorithms they aim to augment, as well as providing recommendations for future directions for ML-assisted CV-QKD research.

TI Quantum light transport in phase-separated Anderson localization fiber
SO COMMUNICATIONS PHYSICS
AB Anderson localization, a strong localization effect that prevents wave diffusion, is fundamentally important in manipulating wave propagation in a disordered medium. This work uses a phase separated glass Anderson localization optical fiber and demonstrates quantum light transport, which shows the potential for transmission of high dimensional quantum information, thereby enabling quantum imaging and quantum communication applications.
   Propagation of light by Anderson localization has been demonstrated in micro-nano-structured fibers. In this work, we introduce a phase separated glass Anderson localization optical fiber for quantum applications. By using a spontaneous parametric down-conversion source, multi-photon detection with a single-photon avalanche diode array camera, and signal post-processing techniques, we demonstrate quantum light transport, where spatial correlations between photon pairs are preserved after propagation. In order to better understand and improve light transport, we study light localization, observing a dependence on wavelength. Our results indicate that the proposed phase separated fiber may become an effective platform for quantum imaging and communication.

TI Priority-Based Flexible Security Level Quantum Key Resource Allocation
   Scheme
SO LASER & OPTOELECTRONICS PROGRESS
AB During the deployment of quantum key distributed optical networks, limited quantum key resources, uneven distribution of network resources, and chaotic scheduling can result in large-scale business congestion and seriously impact optical network security. To overcome this issue, a quantum key resource allocation scheme is proposed. First, a linear programming constraint model of minimum wavelength and time slot consumption is constructed to reduce resource allocation. Second, considering the security requirements of a business, a key resource allocation method based on business priorities is proposed, combined with a dynamic key update mechanism and flexible security level adjustment strategy. Finally, a routing, wavelength, and time slot allocation algorithm is proposed, using resource evaluation values as routing evaluation indicators to identify paths with adequate resources and fewer hops while enhancing time slot utilization by establishing dynamic threshold values. The simulation results reveal that the proposed scheme can efficiently and uniformly use the resources in the network. Compared with the NPFSL-RWTA and SSL-RWTA algorithms, the success rate of optical path connection requests in the NSFNET (UBN24) network is increased by 7. 9 degrees 0 and 16. 3 degrees 0 (4. 8 degrees 0 and 20. 9 degrees 0), respectively, considerably reducing the occurrence of business congestion and improving the optical network security.

TI Pauli path simulations of noisy quantum circuits beyond average-case
SO QUANTUM
AB For random quantum circuits on n qubits of depth Theta(log n) with depolarizing noise, the task of sampling from the output state can be efficiently performed classically using a Pauli path method [1]. This paper aims to study the performance of this method beyond random circuits. We first consider the classical simulation of local observables in circuits composed of Clifford and T gates - going beyond the average-case analysis, we derive sufficient conditions for simulability in terms of the noise rate and the fraction of gates that are T gates, and show that if noise is introduced at a faster rate than T gates, the simulation becomes classically easy. As an application of this result, we study 2D QAOA circuits that attempt to find low-energy states of classical Ising models on general graphs. There, our results shows that for hard instances of the problem, which correspond to Ising model's graph being geometrically non-local, a QAOA algorithm mapped to a geometrically local circuit architecture using SWAP gates does not have any asymptotic advantage over classical algorithms if depolarized at a constant rate. Finally, we illustrate instances where the Pauli path method fails to give the correct result, and also initiate a study of the trade-off between fragility to noise and classical complexity of simulating a given quantum circuit.

TI Generalization Performance of Quantum Metric Learning Classifiers
SO BIOMOLECULES
AB Quantum computing holds great promise for a number of fields including biology and medicine. A major application in which quantum computers could yield advantage is machine learning, especially kernel-based approaches. A recent method termed quantum metric learning, in which a quantum embedding which maximally separates data into classes is learned, was able to perfectly separate ant and bee image training data. The separation is achieved with an intrinsically quantum objective function and the overall approach was shown to work naturally as a hybrid classical-quantum computation enabling embedding of high dimensional feature data into a small number of qubits. However, the ability of the trained classifier to predict test sample data was never assessed. We assessed the performance of quantum metric learning on test ants and bees image data as well as breast cancer clinical data. We applied the original approach as well as variants in which we performed principal component analysis (PCA) on the feature data to reduce its dimensionality for quantum embedding, thereby limiting the number of model parameters. If the degree of dimensionality reduction was limited and the number of model parameters was constrained to be far less than the number of training samples, we found that quantum metric learning was able to accurately classify test data.

TI Time-frequency encoded single-photon generation and broadband
   single-photon storage with a tunable subradiant state
SO OPTICA
AB An atomic system that can be addressed via a single optical mode, hereafter called a one-dimensional atom, is central for many applications in optical quantum technologies. A cavity with a large Purcell factor is required to collect the emission efficiently, but a small Purcell factor is required for long-time memory storage. Here, we introduce an effective and versatile one-dimensional atom consisting of two interacting quantum emitters efficiently coupled to a cavity mode with a large Purcell factor. The dipole-dipole interaction gives rise to a subradiant state with a tunable bandwidth. We demonstrate generation of time-shaped single photons and implementation of quantum memory. We discuss experimental challenges and practical implementation using different systems. (C) 2021 Optical Society of America under the terms of the OSA Open Access Publishing Agreement

TI Structured position-momentum-entangled two-photon fields
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB Structured optical fields have led to several ground-breaking techniques in classical imaging and microscopy. At the same time, in the quantum domain, position-momentum entangled photon fields have been shown to have several unique features that can lead to beyond-classical imaging and microscopy capabilities. Therefore, it is natural to expect that position-momentum entangled two-photon fields that are structured can push the boundaries of quantum imaging and microscopy even further beyond. Nonetheless, the existing experimental schemes are able to produce either structured two-photon fields without position-momentum entanglement, or position-momentum entangled two-photon fields without structured correlations. In this article, by manipulating the phase-matching condition of the spontaneous parametric down-conversion process, we report experimental generation of two-photon fields with various structures in their spatial correlations. We experimentally measure the minimum bound on the entanglement of formation and thereby verify the position-momentum entanglement of the structured two-photon field. We expect this work to have important implications for quantum technologies related to imaging and sensing.

TI Harnessing the Quantum Behavior of Spins on Surfaces
SO ADVANCED MATERIALS
AB The desire to control and measure individual quantum systems such as atoms and ions in a vacuum has led to significant scientific and engineering developments in the past decades that form the basis of today's quantum information science. Single atoms and molecules on surfaces, on the other hand, are heavily investigated by physicists, chemists, and material scientists in search of novel electronic and magnetic functionalities. These two paths crossed in 2015 when it was first clearly demonstrated that individual spins on a surface can be coherently controlled and read out in an all-electrical fashion. The enabling technique is a combination of scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and electron spin resonance, which offers unprecedented coherent controllability at the Angstrom length scale. This review aims to illustrate the essential ingredients that allow the quantum operations of single spins on surfaces. Three domains of applications of surface spins, namely quantum sensing, quantum control, and quantum simulation, are discussed with physical principles explained and examples presented. Enabled by the atomically-precise fabrication capability of STM, single spins on surfaces might one day lead to the realization of quantum nanodevices and artificial quantum materials at the atomic scale.

TI On the potentials of quantum computing - An interview with Heike Riel
   from IBM Research
SO ELECTRONIC MARKETS
AB In this interview, Dr. Heike Riel, a leading scientist and Fellow at IBM Research, reports on the current state of research in the field of quantum computing. Building on the distinction of gateable quantum computers and quantum annealers, the interview sheds light on how research has evolved on gateable quantum computers, which are the path developed by IBM. These gateable quantum computers are described with their current status as well as the improvements and challenges regarding speed, scale, and quality. All three parameters are important for increasing the performance of these universal quantum computers and for leveraging their potentials compared to classical computers. In particular, complex mathematical problems being present in numerous applications in science and business may be solved. Among the examples mentioned are optimization problems that tend to scale exponentially with the number of parameters, for example, in material and natural sciences or simulation problems in the financial industry and in manufacturing. The interview concludes with a critical assessment of possible risks and expectations for the future.

TI Feasibility of chipscale integration of single-photon switched digital
   loop buffer
SO CHIP
AB A strategy for realizing a microchip-scale single-photon digital loop buffer controlled by low-voltage electronic signals was studied in the context of integrated photonics. A potential implementation for bridging a gap between other technologies used a recirculating loop architecture based on advances in low-loss passive waveguides and a fast electro-optic add-drop switch. Although the requirements of singlephoton buffers are demanding, our analysis suggested that a voltagecontrolled, room-temperature catch-and-store short-term quantum memory for light on a chip may be feasible in certain regimes.

SO PHYSICA STATUS SOLIDI B-BASIC SOLID STATE PHYSICS
AB Optically addressable defects in wide-bandgap semiconductors are of considerable interest as materials platforms for quantum sensing and information systems. Density functional theory is used to identify novel defects in diamond consisting of transition metal + nitrogen complexes with potential for quantum sensing. Defects are characterized with respect to formation energy, ordering and degeneracy of the defect energy levels, optical and charge transition energies, zero-field-splitting energies, and thermodynamic stability. Novel defect sites with optically addressable spin states and viable spin sublevel configurations are identified, and analysis of activation energies for atomic migration indicates stability in the lattice.

TI Coherent Control of a Nuclear Spin via Interactions with a Rare-Earth
   Ion in the Solid State
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Individually addressed Er3+ ions in solid-state hosts are promising resources for quantum repeaters, because of their direct emission in the telecom band and their compatibility with silicon photonic devices. While the Er3+ electron spin provides a spin-photon interface, ancilla nuclear spins could enable multiqubit registers with longer storage times. In this work, we demonstrate coherent coupling between the electron spin of a single Er3+ ion and a single I = 1/2 nuclear spin in the solid-state host crystal, which is a fortuitously located proton (1H). We control the nuclear spin using dynamical-decoupling sequences applied to the electron spin, implementing one- and two-qubit gate operations. Crucially, the nuclear spin coherence time exceeds the electron coherence time by several orders of magnitude, because of its smaller magnetic moment. These results provide a path toward combining long-lived nuclear spin quantum registers with telecom-wavelength emitters for long-distance quantum repeaters.

TI Atomistic insights on P implantation by using molecular ion beams for
   scalable spin-qubit arrays
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS D-APPLIED PHYSICS
AB Quantum information technologies hold immense promise, with quantum computers poised to revolutionize problem-solving capabilities. Among the leading contenders are solid-state spin-qubits, particularly those utilizing the spin of phosphorous donors (31P). While significant progress has been made in enhancing quantum coherence and qubit control, challenges persist, notably in achieving precise and scalable P placement in Si substrate. This paper investigates by means of molecular dynamics the use of molecular PF2 ions for implantation, aiming to reduce placement uncertainty while maintaining detection efficiency. We examine energy transfer, molecule integrity, implantation profiles, electronic signal components, and stable damage. Among other things we find that the assumption that the molecule only breaks apart immediately due to the presence of an a-SiO2 layer on the surface of the crystal and that the intensity of the electronic signal from ion-solid interactions does not correlate necessarily with the penetration depth of P.

TI Quantum machine learning corrects classical forcefields: Stretching DNA
   base pairs in explicit solvent
SO JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS
AB In order to improve the accuracy of molecular dynamics simulations, classical forcefields are supplemented with a kernel-based machine learning method trained on quantum-mechanical fragment energies. As an example application, a potential-energy surface is generalized for a small DNA duplex, taking into account explicit solvation and long-range electron exchange-correlation effects. A long-standing problem in molecular science is that experimental studies of the structural and thermodynamic behavior of DNA under tension are not well confirmed by simulation; study of the potential energy vs extension taking into account a novel correction shows that leading classical DNA models have excessive stiffness with respect to stretching. This discrepancy is found to be common across multiple forcefields. The quantum correction is in qualitative agreement with the experimental thermodynamics for larger DNA double helices, providing a candidate explanation for the general and long-standing discrepancy between single molecule stretching experiments and classical calculations of DNA stretching. The new dataset of quantum calculations should facilitate multiple types of nucleic acid simulation, and the associated Kernel Modified Molecular Dynamics method (KMMD) is applicable to biomolecular simulations in general. KMMD is made available as part of the AMBER22 simulation software. (C) 2022 Author(s).

TI Eigenstate Correlations, the Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis, and
   Quantum Information Dynamics in Chaotic Many-Body Quantum Systems
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW X
AB We consider the statistical properties of eigenstates of the time-evolution operator in chaotic many-body quantum systems. Our focus is on correlations between eigenstates that are specific to spatially extended systems and that characterize entanglement dynamics and operator spreading. In order to isolate these aspects of dynamics from those arising as a result of local conservation laws, we consider Floquet systems in which there are no conserved densities. The correlations associated with scrambling of quantum information lie outside the standard framework established by the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH). In particular, ETH provides a statistical description of matrix elements of local operators between pairs of eigenstates, whereas the aspects of dynamics we are concerned with arise from correlations among sets of four or more eigenstates. We establish the simplest correlation function that captures these correlations and discuss features of its behavior that are expected to be universal at long distances and low energies. We also propose a maximum-entropy ansatz for the joint distribution of a small number n of eigenstates. In the case n = 2, this ansatz reproduces ETH. For n = 4 it captures both the growth with time of entanglement between subsystems, as characterized by the purity of the time-evolution operator, and also operator spreading, as characterized by the behavior of the out-of-time-order correlator. We test these ideas by comparing results from Monte Carlo sampling of our ansatz with exact diagonalization studies of Floquet quantum circuits.

TI Latency considerations for stochastic optimizers in variational quantum
   algorithms
SO QUANTUM
AB Variational quantum algorithms, which have risen to prominence in the noisy intermediate-scale quantum setting, require the implementation of a stochastic optimizer on classical hardware. To date, most re-search has employed algorithms based on the stochastic gradient iteration as the stochas-tic classical optimizer. In this work we pro-pose instead using stochastic optimization al-gorithms that yield stochastic processes em-ulating the dynamics of classical determin-istic algorithms. This approach results in methods with theoretically superior worst -case iteration complexities, at the expense of greater per-iteration sample (shot) complex-ities. We investigate this trade-off both theo-retically and empirically and conclude that preferences for a choice of stochastic opti-mizer should explicitly depend on a function of both latency and shot execution times.

TI A quantum key distribution testbed using a plug&play telecom-wavelength
   single-photon source
SO APPLIED PHYSICS REVIEWS
AB Deterministic solid state quantum light sources are considered key building blocks for future communication networks. While several proof-of-principle experiments of quantum communication using such sources have been realized, most of them required large setups-often involving liquid helium infrastructure or bulky closed-cycle cryotechnology. In this work, we report on the first quantum key distribution (QKD) testbed using a compact benchtop quantum dot single-photon source operating at telecom wavelengths. The plug & play device emits single-photon pulses at O-band wavelengths (1321 nm) and is based on a directly fiber-pigtailed deterministically fabricated quantum dot device integrated into a compact Stirling cryocooler. The Stirling is housed in a 19 in. rack module including all accessories required for stand-alone operation. Implemented in a simple QKD testbed emulating the BB84 protocol with polarization coding, we achieve an multiphoton suppression of g((2))(0) = 0.10 & PLUSMN; 0.01 and a raw key rate of up to ( 4.72 & PLUSMN; 0.13 ) kHz using an external pump laser. In this setting, we further evaluate the performance of our source in terms of the quantum bit error ratios, secure key rates, and tolerable losses expected in full implementations of QKD while accounting for finite key size effects. Furthermore, we investigate the optimal settings for a two-dimensional temporal acceptance window applied on the receiver side, resulting in predicted tolerable losses up to 23.19 dB. Not least, we compare our results with previous proof-of-concept QKD experiments using quantum dot single-photon sources. Our study represents an important step forward in the development of fiber-based quantum-secured communication networks exploiting sub-Poissonian quantum light sources.

TI Temporal work by consultants in nascent market categories: constructing
   a market for knowledge in quantum computing
SO TECHNOLOGY ANALYSIS & STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT
AB The literatures on market categories and temporal work pay limited attention to the agentic role of intermediaries in nascent market categories. Through an inductive analysis of quantum computing, we explore how management consultancies perform temporal work in such settings. We find that management consultancies construct a market for knowledge by engaging in three types of temporal work. First, they bring the future market category into present existence and thus make it an object for action. Second, they construct ultimate uncertainty and ambiguity and therefore a need for external knowledge. Third, they create a sense of urgency for immediate market engagement. Our findings shed light on the active intermediating role of management consultancies in nascent market categories, allowing them to capitalise on novel markets very early on.

SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB The interacting of two qubits and an N-level atom based on su(2) Lie algebra in the presence of both qubit-qubit interaction and dissipation term is considered. The effects of the qubit-qubit interaction and the dissipation term on the dynamics of the proposed system are discussed in detail for certain values of the number of levels. The dynamical expressions of the observable operators are obtained using the Heisenberg equation of motion. The population inversion and linear entropy, as well as the concurrence formula as a measure of entanglement between the two qubits are calculated and discussed. The roles of the number of levels, the qubit-qubit coupling parameter and the dissipation rate on these quantities are also discussed. We explore the sudden birth and sudden death of the entanglement phenomena with and without the dissipation term.

TI Mode-dispersion phase matching single photon source based on thin-film
   lithium niobate
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB In the domain of integrated quantum photonics, the burgeoning superiority of lithium niobate's second order nonlinearity in electro-optic modulation makes thin-film lithium niobate a leading quantum photonic platform after silicon. To date, single-photon sources using thin-film lithium niobate has mainly adopted periodic polarization quasi-phase matching technology, which requires the preparation of complex electrodes for domain inversion in the waveguide to realize quasi-phase matching. This method inevitably introduces complexity, such as complex processing methods, enlarged polarization regions, and compromised integration density. With the development of quantum information technology, the ever-increasing degree of integration constantly creates new demands. Consequently, the development of a streamlined, high-efficiency quantum light source on a lithium niobate platform is a pressing issue. In this study, we propose a novel thin-film lithium niobate parametric down-conversion single-photon source based on mode dispersion phase matching theory. The strategy is different from conventional strategies that utilize periodic polarization to generate single-photon sources in thin-film lithium niobate devices. In contrast to traditional quasi-phase matching techniques that utilize the phase matching between pump fundamental mode light and parametric fundamental mode light, our method employs the phase matching between the pump light's higher-order mode and the parametric light's fundamental mode. The pump light' s higher-order mode is obtained by designing an asymmetric directional coupler. The device's single-photon yield can attain /(s & BULL;mW), satisfying the requirements for optical 3.8 x 107 quantum information processing. This innovative solution is expected to replace the traditional quasi-phase matching single-photon sources, thus further promoting the study of optical quantum information based on thin-film lithium niobate chips.

TI Learning density functionals from noisy quantum data
SO MACHINE LEARNING-SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB The search for useful applications of noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices in quantum simulation has been hindered by their intrinsic noise and the high costs associated with achieving high accuracy. A promising approach to finding utility despite these challenges involves using quantum devices to generate training data for classical machine learning (ML) models. In this study, we explore the use of noisy data generated by quantum algorithms in training an ML model to learn a density functional for the Fermi-Hubbard model. We benchmark various ML models against exact solutions, demonstrating that a neural-network ML model can successfully generalize from small datasets subject to noise typical of NISQ algorithms. The learning procedure can effectively filter out unbiased sampling noise, resulting in a trained model that outperforms any individual training data point. Conversely, when trained on data with expressibility and optimization error typical of the variational quantum eigensolver, the model replicates the biases present in the training data. The trained models can be applied to solving new problem instances in a Kohn-Sham-like density optimization scheme, benefiting from automatic differentiability and achieving reasonably accurate solutions on most problem instances. Our findings suggest a promising pathway for leveraging NISQ devices in practical quantum simulations, highlighting both the potential benefits and the challenges that need to be addressed for successful integration of quantum computing and ML techniques.

TI Single entanglement connection architecture between multi-layer
   bipartite hardware efficient ansatz
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB Variational quantum algorithms are among the most promising algorithms to achieve quantum advantages in the noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) era. One important challenge in implementing such algorithms is to construct an effective parameterized quantum circuit (also called an ansatz). In this work, we propose a single entanglement connection architecture (SECA) for a bipartite hardware efficient ansatz (HEA) by balancing its expressibility, entangling capability, and trainability. Numerical simulations with a one-dimensional Heisenberg model and quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) issues were conducted. Our results indicate the superiority of SECA over the common full entanglement connection architecture in terms of computational performance. Furthermore, combining SECA with gate-cutting technology to construct distributed quantum computation (DQC) can efficiently expand the size of NISQ devices under low overhead. We also demonstrated the effectiveness and scalability of the DQC scheme. Our study is a useful indication for understanding the characteristics associated with an effective training circuit.

AB We inspect the basic ideas underlying Roger Penrose's Conformal Cyclic Cosmology from the perspective of modern quantum information. We show that the assumed loss of degrees of freedom in black holes is not compatible with the quantum notion of entropy. We propose a unitary version of Conformal Cyclic Cosmology, in which quantum information is globally preserved during the entire evolution of our universe, and across the crossover surface to the subsequent aeon. Our analysis suggests that entanglement with specific quantum gravitational degrees of freedom might be at the origin of the second law of thermodynamics and the quantum-to-classical transition at mesoscopic scales.

TI Observation of partial and infinite-temperature thermalization induced
   by repeated measurements on a quantum hardware
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS COMMUNICATIONS
AB On a quantum superconducting processor we observe partial and infinite-temperature thermalization induced by a sequence of repeated quantum projective measurements, interspersed by a unitary (Hamiltonian) evolution. Specifically, on a qubit and two-qubit systems, we test the state convergence of a monitored quantum system in the limit of a large number of quantum measurements, depending on the non-commutativity of the Hamiltonian and the measurement observable. When the Hamiltonian and observable do not commute, the convergence is uniform towards the infinite-temperature state. Conversely, whenever the two operators have one or more eigenvectors in common in their spectral decomposition, the state of the monitored system converges differently in the subspaces spanned by the measurement observable eigenstates. As a result, we show that the convergence does not tend to a completely mixed (infinite-temperature) state, but to a block-diagonal state in the observable basis, with a finite effective temperature in each measurement subspace. Finally, we quantify the effects of the quantum hardware noise on the data by modelling them by means of depolarizing quantum channels.

TI Estimation of Electrostatic Interaction Energies on a Trapped-Ion
   Quantum Computer
SO ACS CENTRAL SCIENCE
AB We present the first hardware implementation of electrostatic interaction energies by using a trapped-ion quantum computer. As test system for our computation, we focus on the reduction of NO to N2O catalyzed by a nitric oxide reductase (NOR). The quantum computer is used to generate an approximate ground state within the NOR active space. To efficiently measure the necessary one-particle density matrices, we incorporate fermionic basis rotations into the quantum circuit without extending the circuit length, laying the groundwork for further efficient measurement routines using factorizations. Measurements in the computational basis are then used as inputs for computing the electrostatic interaction energies on a classical computer. Our experimental results strongly agree with classical noise-less simulations of the same circuits, finding electrostatic interaction energies within chemical accuracy despite hardware noise. This work shows that algorithms tailored to specific observables of interest, such as interaction energies, may require significantly fewer quantum resources than individual ground state energies would require in the straightforward supermolecular approach.

TI Ultraprecision quantum sensing and measurement based on nonlinear hybrid
   optomechanical systems containing ultracold atoms or atomic
   Bose-Einstein condensate
SO AVS QUANTUM SCIENCE
AB In this review, the authors study how a hybrid optomechanical system (OMS), in which a quantum micro- or nano-mechanical oscillator is coupled to the electromagnetic radiation pressure, consisting of an ensemble of ultracold atoms or an atomic Bose-Einstein condensate, can be used as an ultraprecision quantum sensor for measuring very weak signals. As is well-known in any precise quantum measurement, the competition between the shot noise and the backaction noise of measurement executes a limitation on the measurement precision which is the so-called standard quantum limit (SQL). In the case where the intensity of the signal is even lower than the SQL, one needs to perform an ultraprecision quantum sensing to beat the SQL. For this purpose, the authors review three important methods for surpassing the SQL in a hybrid OMS: (i) the backaction evading measurement of a quantum nondemolition variable of the system, (ii) the coherent quantum backaction noise cancelation, and (iii) the so-called parametric sensing, the simultaneous signal amplification, and added noise suppression below the SQL. Furthermore, the authors have shown in this article for the first time how the classical fluctuation of the driving laser phase, the so-called laser phase noise, affects the power spectrum of the output optical field in a standard OMS and induces an additional impression noise which makes the total system noise increase above the SQL. Also, for the first time in this review it has been shown that in the standard OMSs, it is impossible to amplify the signal while suppressing the noise below the SQL simultaneously.

TI Low lying excited states quantum entanglement and continuous quantum
   phase transitions
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB From the perspective of entanglement in low-lying excited states, a profound analysis was carried out regarding the quantum phase transitions within three models that fall outside the Landau-Ginzburg-Wilson (LGW) paradigm. In the context of the deconfined quantum critical point (DQCP) in a one-dimensional quantum spin chain, our findings demonstrate a tight correlation between the reconstruction of low-lying excitation spectra and the DQCP. The precise location of the critical point and its continuous nature can be signaled by the singular behaviors of the entanglement of the first-excited state. Moreover, in comparison with two types of Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) phase transitions, the entanglement presents three different singularity characteristics. These characteristics not only unveil the essence of diverse symmetry types on either side of the DQCP but also expose the disparate causes underlying the formation of the two BKT type phase transitions.

SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB One of the requirements imposed on the realistic quantum computers is to provide computation results which can be repeated and reproduced. In the situation when one needs to repeat the quantum computation procedure several times, it is crucial that the copies of the quantum devices are similar in the sense of the produced results. In this work, we describe a simple procedure based on variational quantum eigensolver which can be utilized to compare quantum devices. The procedure is developed by combining Choi-Jamiolkowski isomorphism with the variational hybrid quantum-classical procedure for matrix diagonalization. We compare the introduced procedure with the scheme based on the standard bounds for the similarity between quantum operations by analysing its action on random quantum channels. We also discuss the sensitivity of the described procedure to the noise, and we provide numerical results demonstrating its feasibility in realistic scenarios by running the procedure on IBM quantum computer.

TI Description of reaction and vibrational energetics of
   CO2-NH3 interaction using quantum computing
   algorithms
SO AVS QUANTUM SCIENCE
AB CO2 capture is critical to solving global warming. Amine-based solvents are extensively used to chemically absorb CO2. Thus, it is crucial to study the chemical absorption of CO2 by amine-based solvents to better understand and optimize CO2 capture processes. Here, we use quantum computing algorithms to quantify molecular vibrational energies and reaction pathways between CO2 and a simplified amine-based solvent model-NH3. Molecular vibrational properties are important to understanding kinetics of reactions. However, the molecule size correlates with the strength of anharmonicity effect on vibrational properties, which can be challenging to address using classical computing. Quantum computing can help enhance molecular vibrational calculations by including anharmonicity. We implement a variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) algorithm in a quantum simulator to calculate ground state vibrational energies of reactants and products of the CO2 and NH3 reaction. The VQE calculations yield ground vibrational energies of CO2 and NH3 with similar accuracy to classical computing. In the presence of hardware noise, Compact Heuristic for Chemistry (CHC) ansatz with shallower circuit depth performs better than Unitary Vibrational Coupled Cluster. The "Zero Noise Extrapolation" error-mitigation approach in combination with CHC ansatz improves the vibrational calculation accuracy. Excited vibrational states are accessed with quantum equation of motion method for CO2 and NH3. Using quantum Hartree-Fock (HF) embedding algorithm to calculate electronic energies, the corresponding reaction profile compares favorably with Coupled Cluster Singles and Doubles while being more accurate than HF. Our research showcases quantum computing applications in the study of CO2 capture reactions.

TI ARC 3.0: An expanded Python toolbox for atomic physics calculations
SO COMPUTER PHYSICS COMMUNICATIONS
AB ARC 3.0 is a modular, object-oriented Python library combining data and algorithms to enable the calculation of a range of properties of alkali and divalent atoms. Building on the initial version of the ARC library (Sibalic et al., 2017), which focused on Rydberg states of alkali atoms, this major upgrade introduces support for divalent atoms. It also adds new methods for working with atom-surface interactions, for modelling ultracold atoms in optical lattices and for calculating valence electron wave functions and dynamic polarisabilities. Such calculations have applications in a variety of fields, e.g., in the quantum simulation of many-body physics, in atom-based sensing of DC and AC fields (including in microwave and THz metrology) and in the development of quantum gate protocols. ARC 3.0 comes with an extensive documentation including numerous examples. Its modular structure facilitates its application to a wide range of problems in atom-based quantum technologies.

TI Exploring the trade-off between computational power and energy
   efficiency: An analysis of the evolution of quantum computing and its
   relation to classical computing
SO JOURNAL OF SYSTEMS AND SOFTWARE
AB Quantum computing is considered a revolutionary technology due to its ability to solve computational problems that are beyond the capabilities of classical computers. However, quantum computing requires great amounts of energy to run. Therefore, a factor in deciding whether to use quantum computing should be not only the complexity of the problem to be solved, but also the energy required to solve it. This paper presents an empirical study developed with the aim of comparing classical and quantum computing in terms of energy efficiency to determine whether the increased power of quantum computers is offset by their higher energy consumption. To achieve this, a variety of problems with different levels of complexity were tested on both types of computers. Specifically, we used the IBM Quantum computers with a maximum of 5 qubits and an Intel i7, as a classical computer. In addition to this we have also analysed the evolution of the quantum computers, performing measurements on three time periods. Our empirical study showed that there is a variability of results obtained in the three time periods and that quantum computing is not recommended for low-complexity problems, given its high energy consumption, particularly when compared to traditional computing.

TI Dynamically Enhancing Qubit-Photon Interactions with Antisqueezing
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB The interaction strength of an oscillator to a qubit grows with the oscillator's vacuum field fluctuations. The well-known degenerate parametric oscillator has revived interest in the regime of strongly detuned squeezing, where its eigenstates are squeezed Fock states. Owing to the amplified field fluctuations in the antisqueezed quadrature, it was recently proposed that squeezing this oscillator would dynamically boost qubit-photon interactions. In a superconducting circuit experiment, we observe a twofold increase in the dispersive interaction between a qubit and an oscillator at 5.5 dB of squeezing, demonstrating in situ dynamical control of qubit-photon interactions. This work initiates the experimental coupling of oscillators of squeezed photons to qubits, and cautiously motivates their dissemination in experimental platforms seeking enhanced interactions.

TI Phase-Matching Continuous-Variable Measurement-Device-Independent
   Quantum Key Distribution
SO SYMMETRY-BASEL
AB Continuous-variable measurement-device-independent quantum key distribution (CV-MDI-QKD) allows remote parties to share information-theoretical secure keys while defending all the side-channel attacks on measurement devices. However, the secure transmission distance and the secret key rate are quite limited due to the high untrusted equivalent excess noise in the Gaussian modulation. More particularly, extremely high-efficiency homodyne detections are required for even non-zero secure transmission distances, which directly restrict its practical realization. Here, we propose a CV-MDI-QKD protocol by encoding the key information into matched discrete phases of two groups of coherent states, which decreases the required detection efficiency for ideally asymmetric cases, and makes it possible to practically achieve secure key distribution with current low-efficiency homodyne detections. Besides, a proof-of-principle experiment with a locally generated oscillator is implemented, which, for the first time, demonstrates the realizability of CV-MDI-QKD using all fiber-based devices. The discrete-modulated phase-matching method provides an alternative direction of an applicable quantum key distribution with practical security.

TI An Efficient Routing Protocol for Quantum Key Distribution Networks
SO ENTROPY
AB Quantum key distribution (QKD) can provide point-to-point information-theoretic secure key services for two connected users. In fact, the development of QKD networks needs more focus from the scientific community in order to broaden the service scale of QKD technology to deliver end-to-end secure key services. Of course, some recent efforts have been made to develop secure communication protocols based on QKD. However, due to the limited key generation capability of QKD devices, high quantum secure key utilization is the major concern for QKD networks. Since traditional routing techniques do not account for the state of quantum secure keys on links, applying them in QKD networks directly will result in underutilization of quantum secure keys. Therefore, an efficient routing protocol for QKD networks, especially for large-scale QKD networks, is desperately needed. In this study, an efficient routing protocol based on optimized link-state routing, namely QOLSR, is proposed for QKD networks. QOLSR considerably improves quantum key utilization in QKD networks through link-state awareness and path optimization. Simulation results demonstrate the validity and efficiency of the proposed QOLSR routing protocol. Most importantly, with the growth of communication traffic, the benefit becomes even more apparent.

TI Training Variational Quantum Algorithms Is NP-Hard
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Variational quantum algorithms are proposed to solve relevant computational problems on near term quantum devices. Popular versions are variational quantum eigensolvers and quantum approximate optimization algorithms that solve ground state problems from quantum chemistry and binary optimization problems, respectively. They are based on the idea of using a classical computer to train a parametrized quantum circuit. We show that the corresponding classical optimization problems are NP-hard. Moreover, the hardness is robust in the sense that, for every polynomial time algorithm, there are instances for which the relative error resulting from the classical optimization problem can be arbitrarily large assuming that P not equal NP. Even for classically tractable systems composed of only logarithmically many qubits or free fermions, we show the optimization to be NP-hard. This elucidates that the classical optimization is intrinsically hard and does not merely inherit the hardness from the ground state problem. Our analysis shows that the training landscape can have many far from optimal persistent local minima This means gradient and higher order descent algorithms will generally converge to far from optimal solutions.

TI Dynamic Quantum Operations at Elevated Temperatures Using Hot-Spot
   Nanoheating of Color Centers
SO NANO LETTERS
AB Temperature fluctuations in materials used for quantum networks can give rise to lattice vibrations that detune, dephase, and decrease the lifetimes of embedded quantum defects that function as qubits. Most experiments demonstrating quantum operations have been performed at cryogenic temperatures ranging from milli- to a few kelvin, thereby reducing these adverse effects. However, encouraged by the relatively long lifetimes recently discovered for group IV color centers, we aim to show that subdiffracted heating, i.e., nanoscale thermal "hot spots", produced by a plasmonic transducer can control the resonant behavior of individual qubits. Our analysis, reported over largely unexplored physical dimensions for the nanoheating of qubits, establishes the ability to perform dynamic quantum operations at elevated temperatures via thermally mediated control of two-photon coherence and subsequent photon-number entanglement. As such, color centers raise encouraging prospects for advancing on-chip quantum photonics and elevating solid-state quantum information processing technologies toward higher temperatures.

TI Can quantum Rabi model with A2-term avoid no-go theoremand
   make quantum simulation of mass-enhancement in SUSYbreaking?
SO QUANTUM STUDIES-MATHEMATICS AND FOUNDATIONS
AB We study the model of a mass enhancement in the supersymmetric quantum mechanics. This modelis so simple that it may be implemented as a quantum simulation of the mass enhancement taking place whensupersymmetry (SUSY) is spontaneously broken. It is evolved from a prototype based on the quantum Rabi model.Here, our quantum simulation means the realization of the target quantum phenomenon as a physical entity withsome quantum-information devices. The original prototype is given as a mathematical model, and has the transitionfrom theN=2 SUSY to its spontaneous breaking, though it has no mass enhancement. It is recently reportedthat the transition is observed for this prototype in a trapped-ion experiment with devising a method experimentallyto realize the transition. The model proposed in this paper describes how the mass enhancement takes place in thefermionic states by the excitation of the 1-mode light boson in the SUSY breaking. In this model, the bosonic andfermionic states are graded by qubits. Although our model's interaction does not have the Higgs potential, the massenhancement in the fermionic states is caused by the radiative enhancement with the help of the X-gate's swapbetween the fermionic and bosonic states

TI Quantum Ising model on two-dimensional anti-de Sitter space
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
AB This paper investigates the transverse Ising model on a discretization of two-dimensional anti-de Sitter space. We use classical and quantum algorithms to simulate real-time evolution and measure out-of-time-ordered correlators (OTOC). The latter can probe thermalization and scrambling of quantum information under time evolution. We compared tensor network-based methods both with simulation on gate-based superconducting quantum devices and analog quantum simulation using Rydberg arrays. While studying this system's thermalization properties, we observed different regimes depending on the radius of curvature of the space. In particular, we find a region of parameter space where the thermalization time depends only logarithmically on the number of degrees of freedom.

TI Application of ZX-calculus to quantum architecture search
SO QUANTUM MACHINE INTELLIGENCE
AB This paper presents a novel approach to quantum architecture search by integrating the techniques of ZX-calculus with Genetic Programming (GP) to optimize the structure of parameterized quantum circuits employed in quantum machine learning (QML). Recognizing the challenges in designing efficient quantum circuits for QML, we propose a GP framework that utilizes mutations defined via ZX-calculus, a graphical language that can simplify visualizing and working with quantum circuits. Our methodology focuses on evolving quantum circuits with the aim of enhancing their capability to approximate functions relevant in various machine learning tasks. We introduce several mutation operators inspired by the transformation rules of ZX-calculus and investigate their impact on the learning efficiency and accuracy of quantum circuits. The empirical analysis involves a comparative study where these mutations are applied to a diverse set of quantum regression problems, measuring performance metrics such as the percentage of valid circuits after the mutation, improvement of the objective, and circuit depth and width. Our results indicate that certain ZX-calculus-based mutations perform significantly better than others for quantum architecture search (QAS) in all metrics considered. They suggest that ZX-diagram-based QAS results in shallower circuits and more uniformly allocated gates than crude genetic optimization based on the circuit model. The code used for the numerical experiments is open source and can be found at TODO https://gitlab.cc-asp.fraunhofer.de/itwm-fm-qc-public/cvqa.

TI Quantum algorithms for one-sided crossing minimization
SO THEORETICAL COMPUTER SCIENCE
AB We present singly-exponential quantum algorithms for the ONE-SIDED CROSSING MINIMIZATION (OSCM) problem. Given an -vertex bipartite graph = (, ,subset of x ), a 2-level drawing (,) of is described by a linear ordering : <-> {1, ... ,| |} of and linear ordering : <-> {1, ... ,| |} of . For a fixed linear ordering of , the OSCM problem seeks to find a linear ordering of that yields a 2-level drawing (, ) of with the minimum number of edge crossings. We show that OSCM can be viewed as a set problem over amenable for exact algorithms with a quantum speedup with respect to their classical counterparts. First, we exploit the quantum dynamic programming framework of Ambainis et al. [Quantum Speedups for Exponential-Time Dynamic Programming Algorithms. SODA 2019] to devise a QRAM-based algorithm that solves OSCM in (9*(1.728) time and space. Second, we use quantum divide and conquer to obtain an algorithm that solves OSCM without using QRAM in (9*(2) time and polynomial space.

TI Reference-Frame-Independent Design of Phase-Matching Quantum Key
   Distribution
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB The recently proposed phase-matching quantum key distribution offers means to overcome the linear key rate-transmittance bound. Since the key information is encoded onto the phases of coherent states, the misalignment between the two remote reference frames would yield errors and significantly degrade the key generation rate from the ideal case. In this work, we propose a reference-frame-independent design of phase-matching quantum key distribution by introducing a high-dimensional key encoding space. With encoded phases spanning the unit circle, the error statistics at arbitrary fixed-phase-reference difference can be recovered and treated separately, from which the misalignment angle can be identified. By naturally extending the binary encoding symmetry and complementarity to high dimensions, we present a security proof of this high-dimensional phase-matching quantum key distribution and demonstrate with simulation that a 17-dimensional protocol is completely immune to any degree of fixed misalignment and robust to slow phase fluctuations. We expect the high-dimensional protocol to be a practical reference-frame independent design for general phase-encoding schemes where high-dimensional encoding is relatively easy to implement.

TI Asymmetric mode-pairing quantum key distribution
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Mode-pairing quantum key distribution (MP-QKD) can surpass the repeaterless rate-transmittance bound (Pirandola-Laurenza-Ottaviani-Banchi bound) without requiring global phase locking, exhibiting remarkable flexibility. However, MP-QKD necessitates equal communication distances in two channels, which is a challenging requirement in practical applications. To address this limitation, we extend the original MP-QKD to asymmetric cases. Our decoy-state estimation confirms that asymmetric channel transmittances and asymmetric intensities do not compromise the security of the protocol. We focus on the pulse-intensity relationship, a key factor for optimizing the performance of asymmetric MP-QKD. Unlike previous asymmetric protocols, the intensities of different bases in asymmetric MP-QKD cannot be decoupled. We introduce an optimal-pulseintensity method, adaptable to various scenarios, to enhance key rates by calculating ideal pulse intensities. Simulation results in various representative scenarios indicate that our method effectively reduces the impact of asymmetric channel distances on MP-QKD performance, enhancing its practical applicability.

The continuous-variable version of quantum key distribution using coherent states offers the advantages of its compatibility with telecom industry, e.g., using commercial laser and homodyne detector, is now going through a booming period. In this review article, we describe the principle of continuous-variable quantum key distribution system; focus on protocols based on coherent states, whose systems are gradually moving from proof-of-principle lab demonstrations to in-field implementations and technological prototypes. We start by reviewing the theoretical protocols and the current security status of these protocols. Then, we discuss the system structure, the key module, and the mainstream system implementations. The advanced progresses for future applications are discussed, including the digital techniques, system on chip, and point-to-multipoint system. Finally, we discuss the practical security of the system and conclude with promising perspectives in this research field.

Our approach utilizes periodic driving of a quantum-dot emitter and an efficient light-matter interface enabled by a photonic crystal waveguide. We assess the quality of the photonic states produced from a real system by including all intrinsic experimental imperfections. Importantly, the protocol is robust against the nuclear spin bath dynamics due to a naturally built-in refocusing method reminiscent to spin echo. We demonstrate the feasibility of producing Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger and one-dimensional cluster states with fidelities and generation rates exceeding those achieved with conventional "fusion" methods in current state-of-the-art experiments. The proposed hardware constitutes a scalable and resource-efficient approach towards implementation of measurement-based quantum computing and quantum communication.

TI Quantum entanglement in nuclear Cooper-pair tunneling with γ rays
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW C
AB While Josephson-like junctions, transiently established in heavy-ion collisions (tau(coll) 10(-21) s) between superfluid nuclei-through which Cooper-pair tunneling (Q-value Q(2n)) proceeds mainly in terms of successive transfer of entangled nucleons-is deprived from the macroscopic aspects of a supercurrent, it displays many of the special effects associated with spontaneous symmetry breaking in gauge space (BCS condensation), which can be studied in terms of individual quantum states and of tunneling of single Cooper pairs. From the results of studies of one- and two-neutron transfer reactions carried out at energies below the Coulomb barrier we estimate the value of the mean-square radius (correlation length) of the nuclear Cooper pair. A quantity related to the largest distance of closest approach for which the absolute two-nucleon tunneling cross section is of the order of the single-particle one. Furthermore, emission of gamma rays of (Josephson) frequency v(J) = Q(2n)/h distributed over an energy range h/tau(coll) is predicted.

TI Reducing T-Count In Quantum String Matching Algorithm Using
   Relative-Phase Fredkin Gate
SO QUANTUM INFORMATION & COMPUTATION
AB The string-matching problem, ubiquitous in computer science, can significantly benefit from quantum algorithms due to their potential for greater efficiency compared to classical approaches. The practical implementation of the quantum string matching (QSM) algorithm requires fault-tolerant quantum computation due to the fragility of quantum information. A major obstacle in implementing fault-tolerant quantum computation is the high cost associated with executing T gates. This paper introduces the relative-phase Fredkin gate as a strategy to notably reduce the number of T gates (T-count) necessary for the QSM algorithm. This reduces the T-count from 14N3/2 log2 N - O(N3/2) to 8N3/2 log2 N - O(N3/2), where N represents the size of the database to be searched. Additionally, we demonstrate that our method is advantageous in terms of other circuit costs, such as the depth of T gates and the number of CNOT gates. This advancement contributes to the ongoing development of the QSM algorithm, paving the way for more efficient solutions in the field of computer science.

TI Transition metal impurities in silicon: computational search for a

SO NPJ COMPUTATIONAL MATERIALS
AB Semiconductors offer a promising platform for physical implementation of qubits, but their broad adoption is presently hindered by limited scalability and/or very low operating temperatures. Learning from the nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond, our goal is to find equivalent optically active point defect centers in crystalline silicon, which could be advantageous for their scalability and integration with classical devices. Transition metal (TM) impurities in silicon are common paramagnetic deep defects, but a comprehensive theoretical study of the whole 3d series that considers generalized Koopmans' condition is missing. We apply the HSE06(+U) method to examine their potential as optically active spin qubits and identify seven TM impurities that have optically allowed triplet-triplet transitions within the silicon band gap. These results provide the first step toward silicon-based qubits with higher operating temperatures for quantum sensing. Additionally, these point defects could lead to spin-photon interfaces in silicon-based qubits and devices for mid-infrared free-space communications.

TI Strongly coupled spins of silicon-vacancy centers inside a nanodiamond
   with sub-megahertz linewidth
SO NANOPHOTONICS
AB The search for long-lived quantum memories, which can be efficiently interfaced with flying qubits, is longstanding. One possible solution is to use the electron spin of a color center in diamond to mediate interaction between a long-lived nuclear spin and a photon. Realizing this in a nanodiamond furthermore facilitates the integration into photonic devices and enables the realization of hybrid quantum systems with access to quantum memories. Here, we investigated the spin environment of negatively charged silicon-vacancy centers in a nanodiamond and demonstrate strong coupling of its electron spin, while the electron spin's decoherence rate remained below 1 MHz. We furthermore demonstrate multi-spin coupling with the potential to establish registers of quantum memories in nanodiamonds.

TI Building Europe's quantum technology education community
SO EPJ QUANTUM TECHNOLOGY
AB In this article, we investigate the development of the European field of Quantum Technology education, by drawing on the framework of activity theory (AT), most frequently employed in the social sciences. Focusing on the QTEdu CSA, an impactful European project intended to unite stakeholders in QT education, we study the evolution of 11 pilot projects, cross-cutting education for members of the public, high schools, universities, and industry. The pilots are modelled as activities, drawing on data from 402 online profiles, 33 written reports, and 13 interviews conducted with pilot coordinators and members. Through identifying their elements in the language of activity theory, we examine the structure of the community, and the interactions between the individuals, which may have contributed to the development of QT education in Europe. To do so, we use activity theoretic concepts such as contradiction and expansive learning, offering a practical explanation for using AT to model communities, such that it may benefit future research studying community-based transformations in STEM education.

TI Tunable double split-ring resonator for quantum sensing using
   nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond
SO OPTICS CONTINUUM
AB For quantum sensing based on nitrogen-vacancies (NV) ensembles, microwave antennas can couple the microwave field to the NV center, which leads it to becoming the core of spin manipulation and can directly affect the sensitivity of quantum sensing. The double split-ring resonator is a widely used microwave device for NV ensembles due to the advantages of high radiation efficiency and uniform magnetic field in millimeter-scale areas. But the bandwidth (30 MHz) is quite narrow which limits the application in quantum sensing with NV ensembles. Here, we experimentally achieve continuous tuning of the resonant frequency of the double split-ring resonator by changing the copper sheet position on the edge of the outer ring. The frequency tuning range can reach 80 MHz, up to 2-3 times the bandwidth, which can cover the transition of the electron spin under different magnetic field conditions. The performance of the tunable antenna in the quantum operation of NV centers is verified by optically detected magnetic resonance and Rabi oscillation. This tunable antenna is promising in the fabrication of integrated and arrayed quantum sensors based on NV ensembles.

TI Electronic Spin Qubit Candidates Arrayed within Layered Two-Dimensional
   Polymers
SO JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY
AB Molecular electronic spin qubits are promising candidates for quantum information science applications because they can be reliably produced and engineered via chemical design. Embedding electronic spin qubits within two-dimensional polymers (2DPs) offers the possibility to systematically engineer inter-qubit interactions while maintaining long coherence times, both of which are prerequisites to their technological utility. Here, we introduce electronic spin qubits into a diamagnetic 2DP by n-doping naphthalene diimide subunits with varying amounts of CoCp2 and analyze their spin densities by quantitative electronic paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy. Low spin densities (e.g., 6.0 x 10(12) spins mm(-3)) enable lengthy spin-lattice (T-1) and spin-spin relaxation (T-2) times across a range of temperatures, ranging from T-1 values of 164 ms at 10 K to 30.2 mu s at 296 K and T-2 values of 2.36 mu s at 10 K to 0.49 mu s at 296 K for the lowest spin density sample examined. Higher spin densities and temperatures were both found to diminish T-1 times, which we attribute to detrimental cross-relaxation from spinspin dipolar interactions and spin-phonon coupling, respectively. Higher spin densities decreased T-2 times and modulated the T-2 temperature dependence. We attribute these differences to the competition between hyperfine and dipolar interactions for electron spin decoherence, with the dominant interaction transitioning from the former to the latter as spin density and temperature increase. Overall, this investigation demonstrates that dispersing electronic spin qubits within layered 2DPs enables chemical control of their inter-qubit interactions and spin decoherence times.

TI Coherent manipulation of a tunable hybrid qubit via microwave control
SO CHINESE PHYSICS B
AB Hybrid qubits enable the hybridization of charge and spin degrees of freedom, which provides a way to realize both a relatively long coherence time and rapid qubit manipulation. Here, we use microwave driving to demonstrate the coherent operation of a tunable hybrid qubit, including X-rotation, Z-rotation, and rotation around an arbitrary axis in the X-Y panel of the Bloch sphere. Moreover, the coherence properties of the qubit and its tunability are studied. The measured coherence time of the X-rotation reaches & SIM;14.3 ns. While for the Z-rotation, the maximum decoherence time is & SIM;5.8 ns due to the larger sensitivity to noise. By employing the Hahn echo sequence to mitigate the influence of the low-frequency noise, we have improved the qubit coherence time from & SIM;5.8 ns to & SIM;15.0 ns. Our results contribute to a further understanding of the hybrid qubit and a step towards achieving high-fidelity qubit gates in the hybrid qubit.

TI Hybrid Quantum Cycle Generative Adversarial Network for Small Molecule

SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM ENGINEERING
AB The drug design process currently requires considerable time and resources to develop each new compound that enters the market. This work develops an application of hybrid quantum generative models based on the integration of parameterized quantum circuits into known molecular generative adversarial networks and proposes quantum cycle architectures that improve model performance and stability during training. Through extensive experimentation on benchmark drug design datasets, quantum machine 9 (QM9) and PubChemQC 9 (PC9), the introduced models are shown to outperform the previously achieved scores. Most prominently, the new scores indicate an increase of up to 30% in the quantitative estimation of druglikeness. The new hybrid quantum machine learning algorithms, as well as the achieved scores of pharmacokinetic properties, contribute to the development of fast and accurate drug discovery processes.

TI Niobium nitride plasmonic perfect absorbers for tunable infrared
   superconducting nanowire photodetection
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Quantum technologies such as quantum computing and quantum cryptography exhibit rapid progress. This requires the provision of high-quality photodetectors and the ability to efficiently detect single photons. Hence, conventional avalanche photodiodes for single photon detection are not the first choice anymore. A better alternative are superconducting nanowire single photon detectors, which use the superconducting to normal conductance phase transition. One big challenge is to reduce the product between recovery time and detection efficiency. To address this problem, we enhance the absorption using resonant plasmonic perfect absorber effects, to reach near-100% absorption over small areas. This is aided by the high resonant absorption cross section and the angle insensitivity of plasmonic resonances. In this work we present a superconducting niobium nitride plasmonic perfect absorber structure and use its tunable plasmonic resonance to create a polarization dependent photodetector with near-100% absorption efficiency in the infrared spectral range. Further we fabricated a detector and investigated its response to an external light source. We also demonstrate the resonant plasmonic behavior which manifests itself through a polarization dependence detector response.

TI Adaptive Grover-driven optimization for quantum-inspired deep learning:
   A gradient-free training framework
SO AIMS MATHEMATICS
AB Training deep neural networks remains difficult due to vanishing gradients, non-convex loss surfaces, and hyperparameter sensitivity. These obstacles are compounded by quantum machine learning, where barren plateaus, circuit depth, and hardware noise restrict the applicability of gradient-based approaches. To overcome these drawbacks, this study presents adaptive Grover-driven parallel quantum optimization (AG-PQO), a hybrid, gradient-free scheme that leverages Grover's quadratic search speedup, along with adaptive loss-aware discretization and fidelity-based regularization. In contrast to more classical optimizers, such as Adam or evolutionary strategies (ES), which are either sensitive to the adequacy of the gradient update or exhibit poor scaling behavior, AG-PQO optimizes by performing Grover-accelerated candidate exploration across layers and reuses high-quality solutions in quantum memory caching. Testing indicates that AG-PQO yields higher accuracy, 2%-3% above Adam and ES, and faster convergence with less end-value loss than Adam, ES, and quantum feedforward-backpropagation (QFB). It is worth noting that AG-PQO remains stable at the simulated noise level of NISQ and has the potential to scale to near-term quantum processors.

TI Braess paradox in a quantum network
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Braess, while working on traffic modeling, noticed that traffic flow in a network can be worsened by adding extra edges to an existing network. This seemingly counterintuitive phenomenon is known as the Braess paradox. We consider a quantum network, where edges represent shared entangled states between spatially separated parties (nodes). The goal is to entangle two previously uncorrelated nodes using entanglement swappings. The amount of entanglement between the distant nodes is quantified by the average concurrence of the states established, as a result of the entanglement swappings. We then introduce an additional edge of maximally entangled Bell states in the network. We show that the introduction of the additional maximally entangled states to this network leads to lower concurrence between the two previously uncorrelated nodes. Thus we demonstrate the occurrence of a phenomenon in a quantum network that is analogous to the Braess paradox in traffic networks.

TI Exponential sensitivity revival of noisy non-Hermitian quantum sensing
   with two-photon drives
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Unique properties of multimode non-Hermitian lattice dynamics can be utilized to construct exponentially sensitive sensors. However, the impact of noise remains unclear, which may severely degrade their sensitivity. We analytically characterize and highlight the impact of loss and gain on the sensitivity revival and stability of non-Hermitian sensors. Defying the general belief that the superiority of quantum sensing will vanish in the presence of loss, we find that by proactively tuning the loss, the exponential sensitivity can be surprisingly regained when the sensing dynamics is stable. Furthermore, we prove that gain is crucial to fully revive the ideally exponential sensitivity and to ensure the stability of non-Hermitian sensing by making a balanced loss and gain. Our paper opens a way to significantly enhance the sensitivity by proactively tuning the loss and gain, which may promote future quantum sensing and quantum engineering.

AB This paper presents the feasibility study of deploying quantum key distribution (QKD) from high altitude platforms (HAPs), as a way of securing future communications applications and services. The paper provides a thorough review of the state of the art HAP technologies and summarises the benefits that HAPs can bring to the QKD services. A detailed link budget analysis is presented in the paper to evaluate the feasibility of delivering QKD from stratospheric HAPs flying at 20 km altitude. The results show a generous link budget under most operating conditions which brings the possibility of using diverged beams, thereby simplifying the pointing, acquisition and tracking of the optical system on the HAPs and ground, potentially widening the range of future use cases where QKD could be a viable solution.

TI Security of Optical Beam Splitter in Quantum Key Distribution
SO PHOTONICS
AB The optical beam splitter is an essential device used for decoding in quantum key distribution. The impact of optical beam splitters on the security of quantum key distribution was studied, and it was found that the realistic device characteristics closely influence the error rate introduced by the wavelength-dependent attack on optical beam splitters. A countermeasure, combining device selection and error rate over-threshold alarms, is proposed to protect against such attacks. Beam splitters made of mirror coatings are recommended, and the variation of splitting ratio should be restricted to lower than 1 dB at 1260-1700 nm. For the partial attack scenario where the eavesdropper attacks only a portion of the quantum signal, a modified secure key rate formula is proposed to eliminate the revealed information of the attacked portion. Numerical results show that the QKD system adopting this countermeasure exhibits good performance with a secure key rate of over 10 kbps at 100 km and a maximum transmission distance of over 150 km, with only a small difference from the no-attack scenario. Additionally, a countermeasure to monitor the light intensity of different wavelengths is proposed to protect against the wavelength-dependent attack on optical beam splitters.

TI Metallated carbon nanowires for potential quantum computing applications
   via substrate proximity
SO ISCIENCE
AB The realization of next-generation quantum computing devices is hindered by the formidable challenge of detecting and manipulating Majorana zero mode (MZM). In this study, we study if MZM exist in metallated carbyne nanowires. Through optimizations of distinct types of metallated carbyne, we have achieved an average magnetic moment surpassing 1mB for the cases of Mo, Tc, and Ru metallated carbyne. where their local moments exceed 2mB. The magnetism of the Ru atom displays periodic variations with increasing carbyne length. associated with a strong average spin-orbital coupling of '140meV. When the ferromagnetic Ru metallated carbyne, coupled with a superconducting Ru substrate, could trigger band inversions at the gamma (G) point and M point, where spin-orbital coupling triggers the transition between the band inversion and the Dirac gap. Our findings present an exciting opportunity to realize carbon-based materials capable of hosting MZM.

TI Modeling Energy Communities: A Case Study of Quantum Approximate
   Optimization on a Superconducting Processor
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB This work explores the use of variational quantum algorithms to optimize energy distribution among users in energy communities, using real data from a community lab. This requires integrating various energy sources, storage solutions, and the ability to respond to variations in demand within energy systems, while maintaining the capacity to adapt to the variability of renewable energy sources. Given the increasing complexity as the problem size grows and the limitations of classical computing methods in addressing it, we study an approach that models the problem using QUBO and solves it applying quantum optimization algorithms. Our analysis includes a comparative study of two variational techniques, QAOA and VQE, and the implementation of the former on Qmio, an actual superconducting quantum processor. Although deploying QAOA on Qmio required specific adaptations to the hardware, we were able to achieve a shift of the probability distribution towards lower-energy solutions without error mitigation techniques, which highlights both QAOA's potential and the intrinsic challenges of quantum optimization.

TI Two-Qubit Engine Fueled by Entanglement and Local Measurements
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB We introduce a two-qubit engine that is powered by entanglement and local measurements. Energy is extracted from the detuned qubits coherently exchanging a single excitation. Generalizing to an N-qubit chain, we show that the low energy of the first qubit can be up-converted to an arbitrarily high energy at the last qubit by successive neighbor swap operations and local measurements. We finally model the local measurement as the entanglement of a qubit with a meter, and we identify the fuel as the energetic cost to erase the correlations between the qubits. Our findings extend measurement-powered engines to composite working substances and provide a microscopic interpretation of the fueling mechanism.

AB The cloud-based environments in which today's and future quantum computers will operate, raise concerns about the security and privacy of user's intellectual property. Quantum circuits submitted to cloud-based quantum computer providers represent sensitive or proprietary algorithms developed by users that need protection. Further, input data is hard-coded into the circuits and leakage of the circuits can expose users' data. Although still in the Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum regime, quantum computers hold promise to be able to execute novel algorithms and create invaluable data. However, just as with any other type of computing resource, they may be vulnerable to security attacks and should have defenses built into their hardware and software design. In classical computing, a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) is an area on the main processor of a device that is separated from the system's main operating system, which ensures data is stored, processed and protected in a secure environment. Similar to the classical computing, by leveraging trusted hardware, we propose Trusted Execution Environments for quantum computers. The proposed thesis will explore the feasibility and the security of the quantum computer Trusted Execution Environment architecture as a novel security primitive. In this prospectus, the challenges and approaches are outlined, current results are presented to show the feasibility of the proposed work and a timeline of future work is given.

TI Efficient and precise quantum simulation of ultrarelativistic
   quark-nucleus scattering
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
AB We present an efficient and precise framework to quantum simulate the dynamics of the ultrarelativistic quark-nucleus scattering. This framework employs the eigenbasis of the asymptotic scattering system and implements a compact scheme for encoding this basis upon lattice discretization. It exploits the operator structure of the light-front Hamiltonian of the scattering system, which enables the Hamiltonian input that utilizes the quantum Fourier transform for efficiency. Our framework simulates the scattering by the efficient and precise algorithm of the truncated Taylor series. The qubit cost of our framework scales logarithmically with the Hilbert space dimension of the scattering system. The gate cost has optimal scaling with the simulation error and near optimal scaling with the simulation time. These scalings make our framework advantageous for large-scale dynamics simulations on future fault-tolerant quantum computers. We demonstrate our framework with a simple scattering problem and benchmark the results with those from the Trotter algorithm and the classical calculations, where good agreement between the results is found. Our framework can be generalized to simulate the dynamics of various scattering problems in quantum chromodynamics.

TI Cryogenic feedforward of a photonic quantum state
SO OPTICA
AB Modulation conditioned on measurements on entangled photonic quantum states is a cornerstone technology of optical quantum information processing. Performing this task with low latency requires combining single-photon-level detectors with both electronic logic processing and optical modulation in close proximity. Here, we demonstrate low-latency feedforward using a quasi-photon-number-resolved measurement on a quantum light source. Specifically, we use a multipixel superconducting nanowire single-photon detector, amplifier, logic, and an integrated electro-optic modulator in situ below 4 K. We modulate the signal mode of a spontaneous parametric down-conversion source, conditional on a photon-number measurement of the idler mode, with a total latency of (23 +/- 3) ns. Furthermore, we investigate the resulting change in the photon statistics. This represents an important benchmark for the fastest quantum photonic feedforward experiments comprising measurement, amplification, logic, and modulation. This has direct applications in quantum computing, communication, and simulation protocols. (c) 2025 Optica Publishing Group under the terms of the Optica Open Access Publishing Agreement

TI QuKAN: A Quantum Circuit Born Machine Approach to Quantum Kolmogorov
   Arnold Networks
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Kolmogorov Arnold Networks (KANs), built upon the Kolmogorov Arnold representation theorem (KAR), have demonstrated promising capabilities in expressing complex functions with fewer neurons. This is achieved by implementing learnable parameters on the edges instead of on the nodes, unlike traditional networks such as Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs). However, KANs potential in quantum machine learning has not yet been well explored. In this work, we present an implementation of these KAN architectures in both hybrid and fully quantum forms using a Quantum Circuit Born Machine (QCBM). We adapt the KAN transfer using pre-trained residual functions, thereby exploiting the representational power of parametrized quantum circuits. In the hybrid model we combine classical KAN components with quantum subroutines, while the fully quantum version the entire architecture of the residual function is translated to a quantum model. We demonstrate the feasibility, interpretability and performance of the proposed Quantum KAN (QuKAN) architecture.

TI Exploring Embeddings for MIMO Channel Decoding on Quantum Annealers
SO INFOCOMMUNICATIONS JOURNAL
AB Quantum Annealing provides a heuristic method leveraging quantum mechanics for solving Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization problems. Existing Quantum Annealing processing units are readily available via cloud platform access for a wide range of use cases. In particular, a novel device, the D-Wave Advantage has been recently released. In this paper, we study the applicability of Maximum Likelihood (ML) Channel Decoder problems for MIMO scenarios in centralized RAN. The main challenge for exact optimization of ML decoders with ever-increasing demand for higher data rates is the exponential increase of the solution space with problem sizes. Since current 5G solutions can only use approximate methodologies, Kim et al. [1] leveraged Quantum Annealing for large MIMO problems with phase shift keying and quadrature amplitude modulation scenarios. Here, we extend upon their work and present embedding limits for both more complex modulation and higher receiver / transmitter numbers using the Pegasus P16 topology of the D-Wave Advantage system.

AB The k-clique problem, which involves identifying complete subgraphs of size k within a graph, is a fundamental challenge in combinatorial optimization with applications in network analysis, bioinformatics, and cryptography. As the number of nodes n grows, classical algorithms become computationally intractable, motivating the exploration of quantum computing to address these limitations. This work introduces two quantum algorithms for solving the k -clique problem: one based on Quantum Amplitude Amplification (QAA) and another leveraging Quantum Walks (QW) over the Johnson graph j(n,k). By exploiting the regular structure of the Johnson graph, the QW approach achieves the same quadratic speedup of the QAA approach over classical algorithms, while remaining applicable to arbitrary undirected, unweighted graphs. We provide detailed quantum circuit designs for both approaches, analyzing their performance in terms of qubit count, gate count, and circuit depth under the NOT-CNOT-Toffoli + arbitrary rotations and Clifford + T gate sets. Compared to state-of-the-art quantum algorithms, our methods achieve significant improvements in scaling, particularly for dense graphs, with speedups ranging from 2(5) to 2(20).

TI Hybrid quantum singular spectrum decomposition for time series analysis
SO AVS QUANTUM SCIENCE
AB Classical data analysis requires computational efforts that become intractable in the age of Big Data. An essential task in time series analysis is the extraction of physically meaningful information from a noisy time series. One algorithm devised for this very purpose is singular spectrum decomposition (SSD), an adaptive method that allows for the extraction of narrow-banded components from non-stationary and non-linear time series. The main computational bottleneck of this algorithm is the singular value decomposition (SVD). Quantum computing could facilitate a speedup in this domain through superior scaling laws. We propose quantum SSD by assigning the SVD subroutine to a quantum computer. The viability for implementation and performance of this hybrid algorithm on a near term hybrid quantum computer is investigated. In this work, we show that by employing randomized SVD, we can impose a qubit limit on one of the circuits to improve scalibility. Using this, we efficiently perform quantum SSD on simulations of local field potentials recorded in brain tissue, as well as GW150914, the first detected gravitational wave event.(c) 2023 Author(s).

TI Enhancing Qubit Readout with Autoencoders
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB In addition to the need for stable and precisely controllable qubits, quantum computers take advantage of good readout schemes. Superconducting qubit states can be inferred from the readout signal transmitted through a dispersively coupled resonator. This work proposes a readout classification method for superconducting qubits based on a neural network pretrained with an autoencoder approach. A neural network is pretrained with qubit readout signals as autoencoders in order to extract relevant features from the data set. Afterward, the pretrained-network inner-layer values are used to perform a classification of the inputs in a supervised manner. We demonstrate that this method can enhance classification performance, particularly for short- and long-time measurements where more traditional methods present inferior performance.

TI Deterministic Quantum Key Distribution with Untrusted Relay and Finite
   Sources
SO QUANTUM INFORMATION & COMPUTATION
AB Measurement-device-independent quantum key distribution (MDI-QKD) is proposed to close all loopholes of detection devices in QKD systems, and it holds the potential to double the limit transmission distance of those one-way QKD protocols. However, most MDI-QKD protocols are nondeterministic, which reduces the potential key rate by nearly half. In this paper, we propose a deterministic QKD protocol with an untrusted detection relay and finite sources, and based on the current technology of QKD devices, we derive the performance formula for it. The simulation results show that the performance of this protocol can exceed the MDI-QKD within the long limit transmission distance range, about 445km.

TI Bounding Quantum Correlations: The Role of the Shannon Information in
   the Information Causality Principle
SO ENTROPY
AB The Information Causality principle was proposed to re-derive the Tsirelson bound, an upper limit on the strength of quantum correlations, and has been suggested as a candidate law of nature. The principle states that the Shannon information about Alice's distant database gained by Bob after receiving an m bit message cannot exceed m bits, even when Alice and Bob share non-local resources. As originally formulated, it can be shown that the principle is violated exactly when the strength of the shared correlations exceeds the Tsirelson bound. However, we demonstrate here that when an alternative measure of information, one of the Renyi measures, is chosen, the Information Causality principle no longer arrives at the correct value for the Tsirelson bound. We argue that neither the assumption of particular 'intuitive' properties of uncertainties measures, nor pragmatic choices about how to optimise costs associated with communication, are sufficient to motivate uniquely the choice of the Shannon measure from amongst the more general Renyi measures. We conclude that the dependence of the success of Information Causality on mere convention undermines its claimed significance as a foundational principle.

TI A Bi-CMOS electronic photonic integrated circuit quantum light detector
SO SCIENCE ADVANCES
AB Complimentary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) integration of quantum technology provides a route to manufacture at volume, simplify assembly, reduce footprint, and increase performance. Quantum noise-limited homodyne detectors have applications across quantum technologies, and they comprise photonics and electronics. Here, we report a quantum noise-limited monolithic electronic-photonic integrated homodyne detector, with a footprint of 80 micrometers by 220 micrometers, fabricated in a 250-nanometer lithography bipolar CMOS process. We measure a 15.3-gigahertz 3-decibel bandwidth with a maximum shot noise clearance of 12 decibels and shot noise clearance out to 26.5 gigahertz, when measured with a 9-decibel-milliwatt power local oscillator. This performance is enabled by monolithic electronic-photonic integration, which goes below the capacitance limits of devices made up of separate integrated chips or discrete components. It exceeds the bandwidth of quantum detectors with macroscopic electronic interconnects, including wire and flip chip bonding. This demonstrates electronic-photonic integration enhancing quantum photonic device performance.

SO IEEE ACCESS
AB The existing body of research on quantum embedding techniques is not only confined in scope but also lacks a comprehensive understanding of the intricacies of the quantum embedding process. To address this critical issue, this article explores quantum encoding schemes, uncovering valuable insights into their encoding algorithms from theoretical foundations to a mathematical perspective, as well as practical applications. Initially, the article briefly overviews classical computing and the limitations associated with classical bits in representing and processing complex information. Next, the article scrutinizes a variety of quantum embedding patterns, including basis encoding, amplitude encoding, Qsample encoding, angle encoding, quantum associative memory encoding, quantum random access memory, superdense encoding, Hamiltonian encoding, and others. In addition, each technique is accompanied by mathematical formulas and examples illustrating how each strategy can be applied. Finally, the article provides a comparative analysis of different quantum embedding/encoding methods, outlining their strengths and limitations. Overall, this insightful article highlights the potential of quantum encoding techniques for efficient information processing beyond classical bits, thereby facilitating scientists and design engineers in selecting the most appropriate encoding technique to develop smart algorithms for revolutionizing the field of quantum computing.

TI Stability of gapped quantum matter and error-correction with adiabatic
   noise
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB The codespace of a quantum error-correcting code can often be identified with the degenerate ground space within a gapped phase of quantum matter. We argue that the stability of such a phase is directly related to a set of coherent error processes against which this quantum error-correcting code (QECC) is robust: such a quantum code can recover from adiabatic noise channels, corresponding to random adiabatic drift of code states through the phase, with asymptotically perfect fidelity in the thermodynamic limit, as long as this adiabatic evolution keeps states sufficiently "close" to the initial ground space. We further argue that when specific decoders-such as minimum-weight perfect matching-are applied to recover this information, an error-correcting threshold is generically encountered within the gapped phase. In cases where the adiabatic evolution is known, we explicitly show examples in which quantum information can be recovered by using stabilizer measurements and Pauli feedback, even up to a phase boundary, though the resulting decoding transitions are in different universality classes from the optimal decoding transitions in the presence of incoherent Pauli noise. This provides examples where nonlocal, coherent noise effectively decoheres in the presence of syndrome measurements in a stabilizer QECC.

TI Neural network enhanced cross entropy benchmark for monitored circuits
SO MACHINE LEARNING-SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB We explore the interplay of quantum computing and machine learning to advance experimental protocols for observing measurement-induced phase transitions (MIPTs) in quantum devices. In particular, we focus on trapped ion monitored circuits and apply the cross entropy benchmark recently introduced by Li et al (2023 Phys. Rev. Lett. 130 220404), which can mitigate the post-selection problem. By doing so, we reduce the number of projective measurements-the sample complexity-required per random circuit realization, which is a critical limiting resource in real devices. Since these projective measurement outcomes form a classical probability distribution, they are suitable for learning with a standard machine learning generative model. In this paper, we use a recurrent neural network to learn a representation of the measurement record for a native trapped-ion MIPT, and show that using this generative model can substantially reduce the number of measurements required to accurately estimate the cross entropy. This illustrates the potential of combining quantum computing and machine learning to overcome practical challenges in realizing quantum experiments.

TI Linear gate bounds against natural functions for position-verification
SO QUANTUM
AB A quantum position-verification scheme attempts to verify the spatial location of a prover. The prover is issued a challenge with quantum and classical inputs and must respond with appropriate timings. We consider two wellstudied position-verification schemes known as f-routing and f-BB84. Both schemes require an honest prover to locally compute a classical function f of inputs of length n, and manipulate O(1) size quantum systems. We prove the number of quantum gates plus single qubit measurements needed to implement a function f is lower bounded linearly by the communication complexity of f in the simultaneous message passing model with shared entanglement. Taking f(x, y) = Sigma(i) x(i)y(i) to be the inner product function, we obtain a ohm(n) lower bound on quantum gates plus single qubit measurements. The scheme is feasible for a prover with linear classical resources and O(1) quantum resources, and secure against sub-linear quantum resources.

TI Interaction-free, single-pixel quantum imaging with undetected photons
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB A typical imaging scenario requires three basic ingredients: (1) a light source that emits light, which in turn interacts and scatters off the object of interest; (2) detection of the light being scattered from the object and (3) a detector with spatial resolution. These indispensable ingredients in typical imaging scenarios may limit their applicability in the imaging of biological or other sensitive specimens due to unavailable photon-starved detection capabilities and inevitable damage induced by interaction. Here, we propose and experimentally realize a quantum imaging protocol that alleviates all three requirements. By embedding a single-photon Michelson interferometer into a nonlinear interferometer based on induced coherence and harnessing single-pixel imaging technique, we demonstrate interaction-free, single-pixel quantum imaging of a structured object with undetected photons. Thereby, we push the capability of quantum imaging to the extreme point in which no interaction is required between object and photons and the detection requirement is greatly reduced. Our work paves the path for applications in characterizing delicate samples with single-pixel imaging at silicon-detectable wavelengths.

TI Identification of Diffracted Vortex Beams at Different Propagation
   Distances Using Deep Learning
SO FRONTIERS IN PHYSICS
AB The Orbital angular momentum (OAM) of light is regarded as a valuable resource in quantum technology, especially in quantum communication and quantum sensing and ranging. However, the OAM state of light is susceptible to undesirable experimental conditions such as propagation distance and phase distortions, which hinders the potential for the realistic implementation of relevant technologies. In this article, we exploit an enhanced deep learning neural network to identify different OAM modes of light at multiple propagation distances with phase distortions. Specifically, our trained deep learning neural network can efficiently identify the vortex beam's topological charge and propagation distance with 97% accuracy. Our technique has important implications for OAM based communication and sensing protocols.

TI IBM Quantum Platforms: A Quantum Battery Perspective
SO BATTERIES-BASEL
AB We characterize for the first time the performances of IBM quantum chips as quantum batteries, specifically addressing the single-qubit Armonk processor. By exploiting the Pulse access enabled to some of the IBM Quantum processors via the Qiskit package, we investigate the advantages and limitations of different profiles for classical drives used to charge these miniaturized batteries, establishing the optimal compromise between charging time and stored energy. Moreover, we consider the role played by various possible initial conditions on the functioning of the quantum batteries. As the main result of our analysis, we observe that unavoidable errors occurring in the initialization phase of the qubit, which can be detrimental for quantum computing applications, only marginally affect energy transfer and storage. This can lead counter-intuitively to improvements of the performances. This is a strong indication of the fact that IBM quantum devices are already in the proper range of parameters to be considered as good and stable quantum batteries comparable to state-of-the-art devices recently discussed in the literature.

TI Amplitude-boosting attack against practical discrete-modulated
   continuous-variable quantum key distribution
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Discrete-modulated continuous-variable quantum key distribution offers significant practical deployment advantages due to its straightforward state preparation and high compatibility with coherent optical communication systems. However, security analysis and parameter estimation of discrete-modulated protocol are different with Gaussian-modulated protocols, which could cause different practical security problems. Herein, we investigate the amplitude- boosting attack against discrete-modulated continuous-variable quantum key distribution systems and assess its impact on system performance. Our findings reveal that this attack could cause overestimation of secret key rate perceived by Alice and Bob, thereby opening a security loophole, and the vulnerability could be severer than Gaussian modulation. Additionally, we summarize defensive countermeasures, marking a crucial step towards enhancing the practical security of discrete-modulated continuous-variable quantum key distribution.

TI Quantum entanglement of masses with nonlocal gravitational interaction
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
AB We examine the quantum gravitational entanglement of two test masses in the context of linearized general relativity with specific nonlocal interaction with matter. To accomplish this, we consider an energy-momentum tensor describing two test particles of equal mass with each possessing some nonzero momentum. After discussing the quantization of the linearized theory, we compute the gravitational energy shift, which is operator valued in this case. As compared to the local gravitational interaction, we find that the change in the gravitational energy due to the self-interaction terms is finite. We then move on to study the quantum-gravity-induced entanglement of masses for two different scenarios. The first scenario involves treating the two test masses as harmonic oscillators with an interaction Hamiltonian given by the aforesaid gravitational energy shift. In the second scenario, each of the test masses is placed in a quantum spatial superposition of two locations, based on their respective spin states, and their entanglement being induced by the gravitational interaction and the shift in the vacuum energy. For these two scenarios, we compute both the concurrence and the von Neumann entropy, showing that an increase in the nonlocality of the gravitational interaction results in a decrease in both of these quantities.

   balanced/unbalanced PT-symmetry systems
SO PHYSICA B-CONDENSED MATTER
AB We study the significance of Photon/Phonons bunching and antibunching on the dynamics of the quantum entanglement in the presence of coupled PT-symmetry systems with balanced/unbalanced gain and loss. We suggest a hybrid electromechanical system to realize a strong and tunable coupling between a CoplanarWaveguide (CPW) microwave cavity and a nanomechanical resonator (NAMR) via a superconducting Transmon qubit. The hybrid electromechanical system consists of a non-hermitian Hamiltonian with balanced/unbalanced gain and loss. The interplay between the quantum entanglement and the PT-symmetry systems is also thoroughly investigated. We frame a connection between Number operators, Photon/Phonons antibunching, and entanglement. It has been observed that the relative Photon/Phonons numbers play a key role in the quantum entanglement dynamics. Furthermore, we study that quantum entanglement can be characterized by defining a Photon/Phonons antibunching. The Photon/Phonons antibunching is strongly dependent on the initial squeezed state and the rate of balanced/unbalanced gain and loss of the system.

TI Solvable entanglement dynamics in quantum circuits with generalized
   space-time duality
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB We study the nonequilibrium dynamics of kicked Ising models in 1 + 1 dimensions which have interactions alternating between odd and even bonds in time. These models can be understood as quantum circuits tiling space-time with the generalized space-time dual properties of triunitarity (three "arrows of time") at the global level, and also second-level dual unitarity at the local level, which constrains the behavior of pairs of local gates underlying the circuit under a space-time rotation. We identify a broad class of initial product states wherein the effect of the environment on a small subsystem can be exactly represented by influence matrices with simple Markovian structures, resulting in the subsystem's full dynamics being efficiently computable. We further find additional conditions under which the dynamics of entanglement can be solved for all times, yielding rich phenomenology ranging from linear growth at half the maximal speed allowed by locality, followed by saturation to maximum entropy (i.e., thermalization to infinite temperature), to entanglement growth with saturation to extensive but submaximal entropy. Intriguingly, for certain parameter regimes, we find a nonchaotic class of dynamics which is neither integrable nor Clifford, exemplified by nonzero operator entanglement growth but with a spectral form factor which exhibits large, apparently time-quasiperiodic revivals.

TI Deterministic Entanglement Swapping with Hybrid Discrete- and
   Continuous-Variable Systems
SO PHOTONICS
AB The study of entanglement between discrete and continuous variables is an important theoretical and experimental topic in quantum information processing, for which entanglement swapping is one of the interesting elements. Entanglement swapping allows two particles without interacting with each other in any way, to form an entangled state by the action of another pair of entangled particles. In this paper, we propose an experimentally feasible scheme to realize deterministic entanglement swapping in the hybrid system with discrete and continuous variables. The process is achieved by preparing two pairs of entangled states, each is formed by a qubit and two quasi-orthogonal coherent state elements of a cavity, performing a Bell-state analysis through nonlocal operations on the continuous variable states of the two cavities, and projecting the two qubits into a maximally entangled state. The present scheme may be applied to other physical systems sustaining such hybrid discrete and continuous forms, providing a typical paradigm for entanglement manipulation through deterministic swapping operations.

AB Quantum correlation is a key resource for a variety of quantum information processing and communication tasks, the efficient utilization of which has been a longstanding concern, and it is also one of the main challenges in the application of quantum technology. In this review, we focus on the interaction between quantum measurements and quantum correlations by designing appropriate measurement strategies, specifically exploring the trade-off between information gain and disturbance degree in weak measurements to ensure that quantum correlations from the same source can be shared among multiple independent observers. We introduce the basic knowledge and classification of quantum measurements, investigate the weak measurement scenario, and show the theoretical model construction of quantum correlation recycling in the original works. We summarize the theoretical and experimental development process and the latest progress in this field. Finally, we provide an outlook for more quantum resource applications that can profit from the optimization of quantum measurement strategies.

TI Post-Quantum Delegated Proof of Luck for Blockchain Consensus Algorithm
SO APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
AB The advancements in quantum computing and the potential for polynomial-time solutions to traditional public key cryptography (i.e., Rivest-Shamir-Adleman (RSA) and elliptic-curve cryptography (ECC)) using Shor's algorithm pose a serious threat to the security of pre-quantum blockchain technologies. This paper proposes an efficient quantum-safe blockchain that incorporates new quantum-safe consensus algorithms. We integrate post-quantum signature schemes into the blockchain's transaction signing and verification processes to enhance resistance against quantum attacks. Specifically, we employ the Falcon signature scheme, which was selected during the NIST post-quantum cryptography (PQC) standardization process. Although the integration of the post-quantum signature scheme results in a reduction in the blockchain's transactions per second (TPSs), we introduce efficient approaches to mitigate this performance degradation. Our proposed post-quantum delegated proof of luck (PQ-DPoL) combines a proof of luck (PoL) mechanism with a delegated approach, ensuring quantum resistance, energy efficiency, and fairness in block generation. Experimental results demonstrate that while post-quantum cryptographic algorithms like Falcon introduce larger signature sizes and slower processing times, the PQ-DPoL algorithm effectively balances security and performance, providing a viable solution for secure blockchain operations in a post-quantum era.

TI Is everything quantum 'spooky and weird'? An exploration of popular
   communication about quantum science and technology in TEDx talks
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Previous studies have identified four potential issues related to the popularisation of quantum science and technology. These include framing quantum science and technology as spooky and enigmatic, a lack of explaining underlying quantum concepts of quantum 2.0 technology, framing quantum technology narrowly in terms of public good and having a strong focus on quantum computing. Before assessing the effect of these potential issues on public perceptions, it is important to first determine whether these issues are actually present in popular communication. To this end, we conducted a content analysis in which we investigated how quantum science and technology are framed in a corpus of 501 TEDx talks. We also examined to what extent quantum experts, such as quantum scientists and leaders at organisations in quantum science and technology, communicate about quantum science and technology differently from non-experts, such as scientists from other disciplines and artists. Results showed that: (1) about a quarter of the talks framed quantum science and technology as spooky/enigmatic; (2) about half of the talks explained at least one underlying quantum concept (superposition, entanglement or contextuality) of quantum 2.0 technology; (3) quantum technology is narrowly framed in terms of public good as we found six times more talks mentioning benefits than risks; and (4) the main focus is on quantum computing at the expense of other quantum technologies. In addition, experts and non-experts differ on three out of four issues (only the fourth issue is similar for both). Our findings thus show that these potential issues related to the popularisation of quantum science and technology are present but not predominant in TEDx talks. Further research should explore their effect on public perceptions of quantum science and technology.

High-dimensional quantum key distribution (HD-QKD) is a brand-new type of QKD protocol that has many excellent advantages. Nonetheless, practical imperfections in realistic devices that are not considered in the theoretical security proof may have an impact on the practical security of realistic HD-QKD systems. In this paper, we research the influence of a realistic intensity modulator on the practical security of HD-QKD systems with the decoy-state method and finite-key effects. We demonstrate that there is a certain impact in the secret key rate and the transmission distance when taking practical factors into security analysis.

AB In an era of increasing data cap constraints, optimizing video streaming quality while adhering to user-defined data caps remains a significant challenge. This paper introduces Bitrate-Adaptive Limit-Aware Netcast Content Enhancement (BALANCE), a novel Quantum framework aimed at addressing this issue. BALANCE intelligently pre-selects video segments based on visual complexity and anticipated data consumption, utilizing the Video Multimethod Assessment Fusion (VMAF) metric to enhance Quality of Experience (QoE). We compare our method against traditional bitrate ladders used in Adaptive Bitrate (ABR) streaming, demonstrating a notable improvement in QoE under equivalent data constraints. We compare the Slack variable approach with the Dynamic Penalization Approach (DPA) by framing the bitrate allocation problem through Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) to effectively enforce data limits. Our results indicate that the DPA consistently outperforms the Slack Variable Method, delivering more valid and optimal solutions as data limits increase. This new quantum approach significantly enhances streaming satisfaction for users with limited data plans.

We describe the proposed scheme in the Heisenberg picture, evaluating it from the point of view of adding an error in teleportation, and show that it allows achieving less error than the original scheme. Repeating the description in the Schrodinger picture, we find the range of the displacement values at which our conclusions are valid. Using the example of teleportation of the vacuum state and the squeezed states, we show that the scheme allows one to achieve high-fidelity values.

Given the interdisciplinary nature of the field, it is necessary to offer diverse educational opportunities to ensure that students are well-prepared for careers emerging from the second quantum revolution. In this paper, we present our findings from a qualitative study involving semi-structured interviews with university QISE educators, who have taken on the challenges and opportunities in developing QISE courses and curricula for undergraduate and graduate students from different academic backgrounds. Our findings focus on common themes across undergraduate and graduate QISE education, as well as advising and mentoring students to prepare them for research in the field. The interviewees discussed the various strategies they had implemented, such as incorporating hands-on lab activities, integration of Python coding with Qiskit, and including project-based learning experiences. Furthermore, their reflections on mentorship and advising students emphasized the importance of recognizing students' prior preparation, providing targeted resources, and supportive learning environments. Our findings are meant to provide guidance for educators looking to implement effective QISE educational strategies that address the changing landscape of quantum information revolution.

TI Quantum Annealing Simulation of Out-of-Equilibrium Magnetization in a
   Spin-Chain Compound
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Geometrically frustrated spin-chain compounds such as Ca3Co2O6 exhibit extremely slow relaxation under a changing magnetic field. Consequently, both low-temperature laboratory experiments and Monte Carlo simulations have shown peculiar out-of-equilibrium magnetization curves, which arise from trapping in metastable configurations. In this work, we simulate this phenomenon in a superconducting quantum annealing processor, allowing us to probe the impact of quantum fluctuations on both the equilibrium and dynamics of the system. Increasing the quantum fluctuations with a transverse field reduces the impact of metastable traps in out-of-equilibrium samples and aids the development of three-sublattice ferrimagnetic (up-up-down) long-range order with magnetization 1/3. At equilibrium, we identify a finite-temperature shoulder in the 1/3-to-saturated phase transition, promoted by quantum fluctuations but with an entropic origin. This work demonstrates the viability of dynamical as well as equilibrium studies of frustrated magnetism using large-scale programmable quantum systems and is therefore an important step toward programmable simulation of dynamics in materials using quantum hardware.

TI Benchmarking Multipartite Entanglement Generation with Graph States
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB As quantum computing technology slowly matures and the number of available qubits on a QPU gradually increases, interest in assessing the capabilities of quantum computing hardware in a scalable manner is growing. One of the key properties for quantum computing is the ability to generate multipartite entangled states. In this study, aspects of benchmarking entanglement generation capabilities of noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices are discussed based on the preparation of graph states and the verification of entanglement in the prepared states. Thereby, entanglement witnesses that are specifically suited for a scalable experiment design are used. This choice of entanglement witnesses can detect A) bipartite entanglement and B) genuine multipartite entanglement for graph states with constant two measurement settings if the prepared graph state is based on a two-colorable graph, e.g., a square grid graph or one of its subgraphs. With this, it is experimentally verified that a bipartite entangled state comprising all qubits can be prepared on a 127-qubit IBM Quantum superconducting QPU, and genuine multipartite entanglement can be detected for states of up to 23 qubits with quantum readout error mitigation.
   As quantum computing technology matures, interest in assessing the capabilities of quantum hardware grows. This study discusses benchmarking entanglement generation in noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices using graph states. Entanglement witnesses are used to detect bipartite and multipartite entanglement in graph states for two-colorable graphs. Experiments verify bipartite entanglement for 127-qubit systems and multipartite entanglement for 23-qubit systems. image

TI 2 μm Ghost Spectroscopy with an Integrated Silicon Quantum Photonics
   Source
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB A ghost spectroscopy measurement with an entangled photon source is demonstrated. The transmission spectrum at the 2 mu$\umu$m absorption peak of gaseous carbon dioxide (CO2) is measured in a highly noisy environment. Despite the noise, a high sensitivity S=(5.7 +/- 0.1)x10-2$S = (5.7\pm 0.1)\times 10<^>{-2}$ (g/l)-1$\mathrm{(g/l)<^>{-1}}$ is obtained, a value that is larger than the one found for a classical spectroscopy measurement performed in the same conditions. The probe photons are time-energy correlated photon pairs generated through intermodal spontaneous four-wave mixing in a silicon waveguide. This observation opens the way to low-cost on-chip MIR sensors insensitive to environmental noise.
   This paper explores the application to quantum ghost spectroscopy of an integrated silicon photonics source of time-energy correlated photon pairs. Carbon dioxide absorption spectroscopy beyond 2 mu$\umu$m is carried out in low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions, at room temperature and without the need of monochromators. It reports for better sensitivity and limit-of-detection compared to classical transmission measurements.image

TI Cyber-physical defense in the quantum Era
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Networked-Control Systems (NCSs), a type of cyber-physical systems, consist of tightly integrated computing, communication and control technologies. While being very flexible environments, they are vulnerable to computing and networking attacks. Recent NCSs hacking incidents had major impact. They call for more research on cyber-physical security. Fears about the use of quantum computing to break current cryptosystems make matters worse. While the quantum threat motivated the creation of new disciplines to handle the issue, such as post-quantum cryptography, other fields have overlooked the existence of quantum-enabled adversaries. This is the case of cyber-physical defense research, a distinct but complementary discipline to cyber-physical protection. Cyber-physical defense refers to the capability to detect and react in response to cyber-physical attacks. Concretely, it involves the integration of mechanisms to identify adverse events and prepare response plans, during and after incidents occur. In this paper, we assume that the eventually available quantum computer will provide an advantage to adversaries against defenders, unless they also adopt this technology. We envision the necessity for a paradigm shift, where an increase of adversarial resources because of quantum supremacy does not translate into a higher likelihood of disruptions. Consistently with current system design practices in other areas, such as the use of artificial intelligence for the reinforcement of attack detection tools, we outline a vision for next generation cyber-physical defense layers leveraging ideas from quantum computing and machine learning. Through an example, we show that defenders of NCSs can learn and improve their strategies to anticipate and recover from attacks.

TI An Overview of Postprocessing in Quantum Key Distribution
SO MATHEMATICS
AB Quantum key distribution (QKD) technology is a frontier in the field of secure communication, leveraging the principles of quantum mechanics to offer information-theoretically secure keys. Postprocessing is an important part of a whole QKD system because it directly impacts the secure key rate and the security of the system. In particular, with the fast increase in the photon transmission frequency in a QKD system, the processing speed of postprocessing becomes an essential issue. Our study embarks on a comprehensive review of the development of postprocessing of QKD, including five subprotocols, namely, parameter estimation, sifting, information reconciliation, privacy amplification, and channel authentication. Furthermore, we emphasize the issues raised in the implementation of these subprotocols under practical scenarios, such as limited computation or storage resources and fluctuations in channel environments. Based on the composable security theory, we demonstrate how enhancements in each subprotocol influence the secure key rate and security parameters, which can provide meaningful insights for future advancements in QKD.

TI Reference frame independent twin field quantum key distribution with
   source flaws
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS COMMUNICATIONS
AB The trade-off between distance and secret key generation rate remains one of the major challenges in the practical implementation of quantum key distribution (QKD). As a solution, a twin field QKD protocol was proposed by Lucamarini et al (2018) to address this challenge. In this protocol, the achievable secret key rate scales with the square root of channel transmittance and can surpass the secret key capacity for repeaterless QKD. However, the protocol exploits phase to encode information which presents the problem of active stabilization of interferometers. We propose a reference frame independent twin field quantum key distribution (RFITF QKD), which does not require the reference frames' alignment. Thus, this reduces the complexity of practical QKD systems in achieving active stabilization of phase. Moreover, we employ the loss-tolerant method proposed by Tamaki et al (2014) which allows us to prove the security of the protocol by considering imperfections in the state preparation. Our simulation results show that our proposed protocol can extract a secure key over a transmission distance of l = 505 km, l = 516 km and l = 530 km for deviation of 8.42 degrees, 7.28 degrees and 5.15 degrees, respectively from the desired phase encoding angle. These results demonstrate that despite the state preparation flaws, the key rates achieved are still comparable to the perfect encoding scenario. When our proposed protocol is implemented with an imperfect source, it achieves a transmission distance beyond the secret key capacity bound for repeaterless QKD.

TI Playing Quantum Nonlocal Games with Six Noisy Qubits on the Cloud
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB Nonlocal games are extensions of Bell inequalities, aimed at demonstrating quantum advantage. These games are well suited for noisy quantum computers because they only require the preparation of a shallow circuit, followed by the measurement of non-commuting observable. Here, the minimal implementation of the nonlocal game proposed in Science 362, 308 (2018) is considered. This game is tested by preparing a 6-qubit cluster state using quantum computers on the cloud by IBM, IonQ, and Honeywell. The present implementation includes several levels of optimization, such as circuit identities and error mitigation, and allows us to cross the classical threshold and demonstrate quantum advantage in one quantum computer. The quantum nature of the cluster state is further studied by a Bell inequality that allows us to observe quantum advantage in less accurate quantum computers, at the expense of probing a larger number of circuits.

TI Entanglement engineering of optomechanical systems by reinforcement
   learning
SO APL MACHINE LEARNING
AB Entanglement is fundamental to quantum information science and technology, yet controlling and manipulating entanglement-so-called entanglement engineering-for arbitrary quantum systems remains a formidable challenge. There are two difficulties: the fragility of quantum entanglement and its experimental characterization. We develop a model-free deep reinforcement-learning (RL) approach to entanglement engineering, in which feedback control together with weak continuous measurement and partial state observation is exploited to generate and maintain desired entanglement. We employ quantum optomechanical systems with linear or nonlinear photon-phonon interactions to demonstrate the workings of our machine-learning-based entanglement engineering protocol. In particular, the RL agent sequentially interacts with one or multiple parallel quantum optomechanical environments, collects trajectories, and updates the policy to maximize the accumulated reward to create and stabilize quantum entanglement over an arbitrary amount of time. The machine-learning-based model-free control principle is applicable to the entanglement engineering of experimental quantum systems in general.

TI Heralding Multiple Photonic Pulsed Bell Pairs via Frequency-Resolved
   Entanglement Swapping
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Entanglement is a unique property of quantum systems and an essential resource for many quantum technologies. The ability to transfer or swap entanglement between systems is an important protocol in quantum information science. Entanglement swapping between photons forms the basis of distributed quantum networks. Here an experiment demonstrating entanglement swapping from two independent multimode time-frequency entangled sources is presented, resulting in multiple heralded frequency-mode Bell states. Entanglement in the heralded states is verified by measuring conditional anticorrelated joint spectra and quantum beating in two-photon interference. Our experiment heralds up to five orthogonal Bell pairs within the same setup, and this number is ultimately limited only by the entanglement of the initial sources.

TI Optimization of VQE-UCC Algorithm Based on Spin State Symmetry
SO FRONTIERS IN PHYSICS
AB The accurate calculation of molecular energy spectra, a very complicated work, is of importance in many applied fields. Relying on the VQE-UCC algorithm, it is very possible to calculate the molecular energy spectrum on a noisy intermediate scale quantum computer. However, due to the limitation of the number of qubits and coherent time in quantum computers, the complexity of VQE-UCC algorithm still needs to be reduced in the simulation of macromolecules. We develop a new VQE-UCC method to calculate the ground state of the molecule according to the symmetry of the system, the complexity of which is reduced. Using this method we get the ground and excite state of four kinds of molecules. The method and the results are of great significance for the promotion of quantum chemical simulations.

TI Optimality and Noise Resilience of Critical Quantum Sensing
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB We compare critical quantum sensing to passive quantum strategies to perform frequency estimation, in the case of single-mode quadratic Hamiltonians. We show that, while in the unitary case both strategies achieve precision scaling quadratic with the number of photons, in the presence of dissipation this is true only for critical strategies. We also establish that working at the exceptional point or beyond threshold provides suboptimal performance. This critical enhancement is due to the emergence of a transient regime in the open critical dynamics, and is invariant to temperature changes. When considering both time and system size as resources, for both strategies the precision scales linearly with the product of the total time and the number of photons, in accordance with fundamental bounds. However, we show that critical protocols outperform optimal passive strategies if preparation and measurement times are not negligible. Our results are applicable to a broad variety of critical sensors whose phenomenology can be reduced to that of a single-mode quadratic Hamiltonian, including systems described by finite-component and fully connected models.

TI Parameter estimation and quantum entanglement in PT symmetrical cavity
   magnonics system
SO RESULTS IN PHYSICS
AB We investigate the parameter estimation in a magnon-cavity-magnon coupled system. PT symmetrical two magnons system can be formed in the gain magnetic materials by the adiabatic elimination of the cavity field mode. We show that the optimal estimation will not appear at the exceptional point due to that the quantum fluctuations are the strongest at the exceptional point. Moreover, we demonstrate that the measurements at the exceptional point tend to be optimal with the increase of prepared time. And the direct photon detection is the optimal measurement for the initial state in the vacuum input state. For the open PT symmetrical two magnons system, the quantum fluctuations will greatly reduce the degree of entanglement. Finally, we show that a higher estimated magnetic sensitivity can be obtained by measuring the frequency of one magnon in the PT symmetrical two magnons system.

The discovery of materials has led to significant development in varied fields such as Science, Engineering and Technology. Computationally simulating molecules has been an area of interest in the industry as well as academia. However, simulating large molecules can be computationally expensive in terms of computing power and complexity. Quantum computing is a recent development that can improve the efficiency in predicting properties of atoms and molecules which will be useful for material design. The Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) is one such quantum algorithm used to calculate the ground state energy of molecules or ions. In this study, we have done a comparative analysis of the parameters that constitute the VQE algorithm. This includes components such as basis, qubit mapping, ansatz, and optimizers used. We have also developed a database consisting of 79 single atoms and their variations of oxidation states and 33 molecules with the data of their Hamiltonian and ground state energy and dipole moment.

TI QRev: migrating quantum code towards hybrid information systems
SO SOFTWARE QUALITY JOURNAL
AB Quantum computing is now a reality, and its incomparable computational power has led companies to show a great interest in being able to work with quantum software in order to support part of their current and future business operations. However, the quantum computing paradigm differs significantly from its classical counterparts, which has brought about the need to revolutionise how the future software is designed, built, and operated in order to work with quantum computers. Since companies cannot discard all their current (and probably mission-critical) information systems, they must adapt their classical information systems to new specific quantum applications, thus evolving towards hybrid information systems. Unfortunately, there are no specific methods with which to deal with this challenge. We believe that reengineering, and more specifically, software modernisation using model-driven engineering principles, could be useful as regard migrating classical systems and existing quantum programs towards hybrid information systems. This paper, therefore, presents QRev, a reverse engineering tool that analyses quantum programs developed in Q# in order to identify its components and interrelationships, and then generates abstract models that can be used in software modernisation processes. The platform-independent models are generated according to the Knowledge Discovery Metamodel (KDM) standard. QRev is validated in a case study involving five quantum programs in order to demonstrate its effectiveness and scalability. The main implication of the study is that QRev can be used in order to attain KDM models, which can subsequently be employed to restructure or add new quantum functionality at a higher abstraction level, i.e. independently of the specific quantum technology.

AB Optical vector modes (VMs), characterized by spatially varying polarization distributions, have become essential tools across microscopy, metrology, optical trapping, nanophotonics, and optical communications. Here, we investigate the Hong-Ou-Mandel (HOM) interference of VMs providing a full spatial characterization of the output state. We find that, by carefully selecting the input VMs, it is possible to simultaneously observe all four polarization Bell states and their superpositions in the spatially varying polarization pattern of the two photons. These results represent a significant step in advancing our understanding of HOM interference within structured photons, offering promising avenues for high-dimensional quantum information processing and, in particular, high-dimensional quantum communication, quantum sensing, and advanced photonic technologies reliant on tailored quantum states of light.

TI Generation of entangled photons via parametric down-conversion in
   semiconductor lasers and integrated quantum photonic systems
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We propose and design a high-brightness, ultracompact electrically pumped GaSb-based laser source of entangled photons generated by mode-matched intracavity parametric down-conversion of lasing modes. To describe the nonlinear mixing in highly dispersive and dissipative waveguides, we develop a nonperturbative quantum theory of parametric down-conversion of waveguide modes which takes into account the effects of modal dispersion, group and phase mismatch, propagation, dissipation, and coupling to noisy reservoirs. We extend our theory to the regime of quantized pump fields with an approach based on the propagation equation for the state vector which solves the nonperturbative boundary-value problem of the parametric decay of a quantized single-photon pump mode and can be generalized to include the effects of dissipation and noise. Our formalism is applicable to a wide variety of three-wave mixing propagation problems. It provides convenient analytic expressions for interpreting experimental results and predicting the performance of monolithic quantum photonic systems.

TI Improved polar-code-based efficient post-processing algorithm for
   quantum key distribution
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Combined with one-time pad encryption scheme, quantum key distribution guarantees the unconditional security of communication in theory. However, error correction and privacy amplification in the post-processing phase of quantum key distribution result in high time delay, which limits the final secret key generation rate and the practicability of quantum key distribution systems. To alleviate this limitation, this paper proposes an efficient post-processing algorithm based on polar codes for quantum key distribution. In this algorithm, by analyzing the channel capacity of the main channel and the wiretap channel respectively under the Wyner's wiretap channel model, we design a codeword structure of polar codes, so that the error correction and privacy amplification could be completed synchronously in a single step. Through combining error correction and privacy amplification into one single step, this efficient post-processing algorithm reduces complexity of the system and lower the post-processing delay.

TI Certification of non-classicality in all links of a photonic star
   network without assuming quantum mechanics
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Networks composed of independent sources of entangled particles that connect distant users are a rapidly developing quantum technology and an increasingly promising test-bed for fundamental physics. Here we address the certification of their post-classical properties through demonstrations of full network nonlocality. Full network nonlocality goes beyond standard nonlocality in networks by falsifying any model in which at least one source is classical, even if all the other sources are limited only by the no-signaling principle. We report on the observation of full network nonlocality in a star-shaped network featuring three independent sources of photonic qubits and joint three-qubit entanglement-swapping measurements. Our results demonstrate that experimental observation of full network nonlocality beyond the bilocal scenario is possible with current technology.
   Full network nonlocality, which certifies nonclassical behaviour in all sources of quantum networks, has so far only been demonstrated in the simplest scenarios. Here, the authors reach a complete experimental demonstration in a complex network involving three-qubit joint measurements.

TI Continuous-variable quantum key distribution over 50.4 km fiber using an
   integrated silicon photonic transmitter and receiver
SO PHOTONICS RESEARCH
AB Quantum key distribution (QKD) is the fastest-growing and relatively mature technology in the field of quantum information, enabling information-theoretically secure key distribution between two remote users. Although QKD based on off-the-shelf telecom components has been validated in both laboratory and field tests, its high cost and large volume remain major obstacles to large-scale deployment. Photonic integration, featured by its compact size and low cost, offers an effective approach to addressing the above challenges faced by QKD. Here, we implement a high-performance, integrated local local oscillator continuous-variable (CV) QKD system based on an integrated silicon photonic transmitter and receiver. By employing a high-speed silicon photonic integrated in-phase and quadrature modulator, a low-noise and high-bandwidth silicon photonic integrated heterodyne detector, and digital signal processing, our CV-QKD system achieves a symbol rate of up to 1.5625 GBaud. Furthermore, the system achieves asymptotic secret key rates of 31.05 and 5.05 Mbps over 25.8 and 50.4 km standard single-mode fiber, respectively, using 8-phase-shift keying discrete modulation. Our integrated CV-QKD system with a high symbol rate and long transmission distance paves the way for the quantum secure communication network in metropolitan areas. (c) 2025 Chinese Laser Press

TI Nitrogen-vacancy centers in epitaxial laterally overgrown diamond:
   towards up-scaling of color center-based quantum technologies
SO MATERIALS FOR QUANTUM TECHNOLOGY
AB Providing high-quality, single-crystal diamond (SCD) with a large area is desirable for up-scaling quantum technology applications that rely on color centers in diamond. Growth methods aiming to increase the area of SCD are an active research area. Native color centers offer a sensitive probe for local crystal quality in such novel materials e.g. via their reaction to stress. In this work, we investigate individual native nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in SCD layers manufactured via laterally overgrowing hole arrays in a heteroepitaxially grown large-scale substrate. Heteroepitaxy has become a common tool for growing large SCDs; however, achieving the high crystal quality needed for quantum applications remains a challenge. In the overgrown layer, we identify NV centers with spin-decoherence times in the order of hundreds of mu s, comparable to high-purity homoepitaxial SCD. We quantify the effective crystal stress in different regions of the overgrown layer, indicating a low stress overall and a stress reduction in the diamond layer above the holes.

TI Probing quantum entanglement from magnetic-sublevels populations: beyond
   spin squeezing inequalities
SO QUANTUM
AB Spin squeezing inequalities (SSI) repre-sent a major tool to probe quantum en-tanglement among a collection of few-level atoms, and are based on collective spin measurements and their fluctuations. Yet, for atomic ensembles of spin -j atoms and ultracold spinor gases, many experiments can image the populations in all Zeeman sublevels s = ???j, ???j + 1, ... , j, potentially revealing finer features of quantum en-tanglement not captured by SSI. Here we present a systematic approach which exploits Zeeman-sublevel population mea-surements in order to construct novel en-tanglement criteria, and illustrate our ap-proach on ground states of spin-1 and spin-2 Bose-Einstein condensates. Beyond these specific examples, our approach al-lows one to infer, in a systematic manner, the optimal permutationally-invariant en-tanglement witness for any given set of col-lective measurements in an ensemble of d -level quantum systems.

TI A Scalable Method for Cavity-Enhanced Solid-State Quantum Sensors
SO ADVANCED SCIENCE
AB Photoluminescent color centers in diamond and hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) are powerful nanoscale solid-state quantum sensors that are explored in a plethora of quantum technologies. Methods for integrating them into macroscopic structures that improve their sensitivity and enable their large-scale deployment are highly sought after. Here, cavity-enhanced photoluminescence (PL) of fluorescent nanodiamonds (FNDs) and hBN nanoparticles (NPs) embedded in polymer-based thin-film optical cavities on the centimeter scale is demonstrated. The cavity resonances efficiently modulate the spectral PL peak position of nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in FNDs across the NV PL spectrum and lead to an up to 2.9-fold Purcell-enhancement of the NV PL decay rate. The brightness of hBN NPs increases by up to a factor of three and the PL decay rate is enhanced by up to 13-fold inside the cavities. Finally, a 4.8 times improved magnetic field sensitivity of 20 nm FNDs is found in thin-film cavities due to cavity-enhanced optically detected magnetic resonance contrast and PL brightness. This study demonstrates a low-cost and scalable method for the fabrication of quantum sensor-doped thin-film cavities, which is an important step toward the development of advanced quantum sensing technologies.

TI Network medicine-based epistasis detection in complex diseases: ready
   for quantum computing
SO NUCLEIC ACIDS RESEARCH
AB Most heritable diseases are polygenic. To comprehend the underlying genetic architecture, it is crucial to discover the clinically relevant epistatic interactions (EIs) between genomic single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (). Existing statistical computational methods for EI detection are mostly limited to pairs of SNPs due to the combinatorial explosion of higher-order EIs. With NeEDL (network-based epistasis detection via local search), we leverage network medicine to inform the selection of EIs that are an order of magnitude more statistically significant compared to existing tools and consist, on average, of five SNPs. We further show that this computationally demanding task can be substantially accelerated once quantum computing hardware becomes available. We apply NeEDL to eight different diseases and discover genes (affected by EIs of SNPs) that are partly known to affect the disease, additionally, these results are reproducible across independent cohorts. EIs for these eight diseases can be interactively explored in the Epistasis Disease Atlas (https://epistasis-disease-atlas.com). In summary, NeEDL demonstrates the potential of seamlessly integrated quantum computing techniques to accelerate biomedical research. Our network medicine approach detects higher-order EIs with unprecedented statistical and biological evidence, yielding unique insights into polygenic diseases and providing a basis for the development of improved risk scores and combination therapies.

TI Computational Advantage from the Quantum Superposition of Multiple
   Temporal Orders of Photonic Gates
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Models for quantum computation with circuit connections subject to the quantum superposition principle have recently been proposed. In them, a control quantum system can coherently determine the order in which a target quantum system undergoes N gate operations. This process, known as the quantum N-switch, is a resource for several information-processing tasks. In particular, it provides a computational advantage-over fixed-gate-order quantum circuits-for phase-estimation problems involving N unknown unitary gates. However, the corresponding algorithm requires an experimentally unfeasible target-system dimension (super)exponential in N. Here, we introduce a promise problem for which the quantum N-switch gives an equivalent computational speedup with target-system dimension as small as 2 regardless of N. We use state-of-the-art multicore optical-fiber technology to experimentally demonstrate the quantum N-switch with N = 4 gates acting on a photonic-polarization qubit. This is the first observation of a quantum superposition of more than N = 2 temporal orders, demonstrating its usefulness for efficient phase estimation.

TI Midcircuit Measurements on a Single-Species Neutral Alkali Atom Quantum
   Processor
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW X
AB We demonstrate midcircuit measurements in a neutral atom array by shelving data qubits in protected hyperfine-Zeeman substates while nondestructively measuring an ancilla qubit. Measurement fidelity is enhanced using microwave repumping of the ancilla during the measurement. The coherence of the shelved data qubits is extended during the ancilla readout with dynamical decoupling pulses, after which the data qubits are returned to m(f) = 0 computational basis states. We demonstrate that the quantum state of the data qubits is well preserved up to a constant phase shift with a state preparation and measurement-corrected process fidelity of F = 97.0(5)%. The measurement fidelities on the ancilla qubit after correction for state preparation errors are F = 94.9(8)% and F = 95.3(1.1)% for |0 > and |1 > qubit states, respectively. We discuss extending this technique to repetitive quantum error correction using quadrupole recooling and microwave-based quantum-state resetting.

TI Wavelength-tunable high-fidelity entangled photon sources enabled by
   dual Stark effects
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB The construction of a large-scale quantum internet requires quantum repeaters containing multiple entangled photon sources with identical wavelengths. Semiconductor quantum dots can generate entangled photon pairs deterministically with high fidelity. However, realizing wavelength-matched quantum-dot entangled photon sources faces two difficulties: the non-uniformity of emission wavelength and exciton fine-structure splitting induced fidelity reduction. Typically, these two factors are not independently tunable, making it challenging to achieve simultaneous improvement. In this work, we demonstrate wavelength-tunable entangled photon sources based on droplet-etched GaAs quantum dots through the combined use of AC and quantum-confined Stark effects. The emission wavelength can be tuned by similar to 1 meV while preserving an entanglement fidelity f exceeding 0.955(1) in the entire tuning range. Based on this hybrid tuning scheme, we finally demonstrate multiple wavelength-matched entangled photon sources with f > 0.919(3), paving the way towards robust and scalable on-demand entangled photon sources for quantum internet and integrated quantum optical circuits.

TI Approximate Degree in Classical and Quantum Computing
SO FOUNDATIONS AND TRENDS IN THEORETICAL COMPUTER SCIENCE
AB The approximate degree of a Boolean function f captures how well f can be approximated pointwise by low-degree polynomials. This monograph surveys what is known about approximate degree and illustrates its applications in theoretical computer science.
   A particular focus of the survey is a method of proving lower bounds via objects called dual polynomials. These represent a reformulation of approximate degree using linear programming duality. We discuss in detail a recent, powerful technique for constructing dual polynomials, called "dual block composition".

TI Qutrit quantum battery: Comparing different charging protocols
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Motivated by recent experimental observations carried out in superconducting transmon circuits, we compare two different charging protocols for three-level quantum batteries based on time-dependent classical pulses. In the first case, the complete charging is achieved through the application of two sequential pulses, while in the second the charging occurs in a unique step applying the two pulses simultaneously. The latter approach is characterized by a shorter charging time, and consequently by a greater charging power. Moreover, both protocols are analytically solvable, leading to a complete control on the dynamics of the quantum system and opening unique perspectives in the manipulation of the so-called qutrits. To support this analysis, we have tested both protocols on IBM quantum devices based on superconducting circuits in the transmon regime. The minimum achieved charging time represents one of the fastest stable charging reported so far in solid-state quantum batteries.

TI High-performance quantum imaging at telecom band with enhanced noise
   resilience
SO APL PHOTONICS
AB Quantum imaging utilizes the correlation of photons to enhance the security, covertness, and noise resilience of optical imaging. Despiterecent advances, developing a quantum imaging system with long-distance and strong noise resilience remains challenging. Here, we presentan experimental demonstration of high-performance quantum imaging at telecom band with enhanced noise resilience. We use a fiber-integrated quantum light source via cascaded second-order nonlinear processes to generate high-quality correlated/entangled photon pairs attelecom band and a fiber-coupled confocal optical system to effectively suppress the background noise and improve the collection efficiency ofecho signal photons by optimizing its bandwidth and aperture. In our demonstration, the quantum imaging with correlated/entangled pho-ton pairs or heralded single photons is achieved at a distance of 11 m under indoor illumination. When the detected environment noise is 33dB stronger than the signal photons, corresponding to a coincidence-to-accidental coincidence ratio of 1.7 +/- 0.1, an imaging contrast of0.23 +/- 0.09 is achieved, which is 46 times higher than single-photon imaging without correlation. The results will open venues for the development of practical quantum imaging techniques. (c) 2025 Author(s).

TI High-efficiency microwave-optical quantum transduction based on a cavity
   electro-optic superconducting system with long coherence time
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Frequency conversion between microwave and optical photons is a key enabling technology to create links between superconducting quantum processors and to realize distributed quantum networks. We propose a microwave-optical transduction platform based on long-coherence time superconducting radio-frequency (SRF) cavities coupled to electro-optic optical cavities to mitigate the loss mechanisms that limit the attainment of high conversion efficiency. We optimize the microwave-optical field overlap and optical coupling losses in the design while achieving long microwave and optical photon lifetime at milli-Kelvin temperatures. This represents a significant enhancement of the transduction efficiency up to 50% under incoming pump power of 140 mu W, which allows the conversion of few-photon quantum signals. Furthermore, this scheme exhibits high resolution for optically reading out the dispersive shift induced by a superconducting transmon qubit coupled to the SRF cavity. We also show that low microwave losses enhance the fidelity of heralded entanglement generation between two remote quantum systems. Finally, high precision in quantum sensing can be reached below the standard quantum limit.

TI Partially Coherent Direct Sum Channels

AB We introduce Partially Coherent Direct Sum (PCDS) quantum channels, as a generalization of the already known Direct Sum quantum channels. We derive necessary and sufficient conditions to identify the subset of those maps which are degradable, and provide a simplified expression for their quantum capacities. Interestingly, the special structure of PCDS allows us to extend the computation of the quantum capacity formula also for quantum channels which are explicitly not degradable (nor antidegradable). We show instances of applications of the results to dephasing channels, amplitude damping channels, and combinations of the two.

TI Ultralong-distance quantum correlations in three-terminal Josephson
   junctions
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB The production of entangled pairs of electrons in ferromagnet-superconductor-ferromagnet or normal metal-superconductor-normal metal three-terminal structures has aroused considerable interest in the last twenty years. In these studies, the distance between the contacts is limited by the zero-energy superconducting coherence length. Here, we demonstrate nonlocality and quantum correlations in voltage-biased three-terminal Josephson junctions over the ultralong distance that exceeds the superconducting coherence length by orders of magnitude. The effect relies on the interplay between the time-periodic Floquet-Josephson dynamics, Cooper pair splitting, and long-range coupling similar to the two-terminal Tomasch effect. We find crossover between the "Floquet-Andreev quartets" (if the spatial separation is smaller than the superconducting coherence length) and the "ultralong-distance Floquet-Tomasch clusters of Cooper pairs" if the separation exceeds the superconducting coherence length, possibly reaching the same similar or equal to 30 mu m as in the Tomasch experiments. The effect can be detected with DC-transport and zero-frequency quantum current-noise cross-correlation experiments, and it can be used for fundamental studies of superconducting quasiparticle quantum coherence in the circuits of quantum engineering.

TI Qubit heating near a hotspot
SO JOURNAL OF HIGH ENERGY PHYSICS
AB Effective theories describing black hole exteriors contain many open-system features due to the large number of gapless degrees of freedom that lie beyond reach across the horizon. A simple solvable Caldeira-Leggett type model of a quantum field interacting within a small area with many unmeasured thermal degrees of freedom was recently proposed in ref. [23] to provide a toy model of this kind of dynamics against which more complete black hole calculations might be compared. We here compute the response of a simple Unruh-DeWitt detector (or qubit) interacting with a massless quantum field phi coupled to such a hotspot. Our treatment differs from traditional treatments of Unruh-DeWitt detectors by using Open-EFT tools to reliably calculate the qubit's late-time behaviour. We use these tools to determine the efficiency with which the qubit thermalizes as a function of its proximity to the hotspot. We identify a Markovian regime in which thermalization does occur, though only for qubits closer to the hotspot than a characteristic distance scale set by the phi-hotspot coupling. We compute the thermalization time, and find that it varies inversely with the phi-qubit coupling strength in the standard way.

TI Quantum technician skills and competencies for the emerging Quantum 2.0
   industry
SO OPTICAL ENGINEERING
AB Quantum-based technologies have been instrumental in the development of a whole range of devices that are used these days (such as lasers, transistors, LiDAR, GPS, MRI, and many more). These technologies that emanated from the Quantum 1.0 Revolution have become ubiquitous in modern civilization over the past 50 years. The product commercialization and mass production were enabled by scientists, researchers, engineers, and most importantly, by the skilled technological workforce. This workforce played a critical support role in transforming inventions into high-volume, marketable products. We are currently at the heart of the Second Quantum Revolution, which is fueled by the research in quantum computing, quantum communication, quantum cryptography, and quantum sensing. The scientific progress that is currently taking place in these areas is going to fundamentally change the way we sense the world around us, approach our security, and process critical information. Governments and private entities across the world have recognized the strategic importance of quantum research-enabled technologies and have invested a significant amount of money to support graduate programs and research institutions where scientists, engineers, and other professionals are earning advanced degrees and immediately being engaged in active Quantum 2.0 research. To the best of our knowledge, and despite considerable investment in quantum research, no active efforts or programs exist that would train a quantum technological workforce at the technician level to support Quantum 2.0. The quantum industry, on the other side, has clearly identified the need for highly skilled quantum technicians that are able to support the commercialization of the new products and inventions. The lack of a trained quantum technician workforce is a major shortcoming that may have a profound negative impact on the long-term prospects and sustainability of the emerging quantum industry. The EdQuantum project, funded through the National Science Foundation (NSF) Advanced Technological Education (ATE) program, is an effort to close this shortcoming and propose a well-defined curriculum through which the incumbent photonic and laser technicians in the United States will be upskilled with the new skills and competencies from quantum research-enabled technologies. This paper presents the results of the first phase of the EdQuantum project-the quantum industry survey. Over the last few months, we sought input from the quantum industry as to what skills and competencies should a future quantum technician possess to support its emerging needs. The results collected during the survey are presented in this paper along with their impact on the proposed educational curriculum. This paper also elaborates on the alignment of the proposed curriculum with a few ongoing initiatives in the skilled technical workforce education (such as NSB Vision 2030, Convergence Accelerators Initiative, and Skilled Technical Workforce Initiative).

TI Mesoscopic and macroscopic quantum correlations in photonic, atomic and
   optomechanical systems
SO PROGRESS IN QUANTUM ELECTRONICS
AB This paper reviews the progress that has been made in our knowledge of quantum correlations at the mesoscopic and macroscopic level. We begin by summarizing the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) argument and the Bell correlations that cannot be explained by local hidden variable theories. It was originally an open question as to whether (and how) such quantum correlations could occur on a macroscopic scale, since this would seem to contradict the correspondence principle. The purpose of this review is to examine how this question has been answered over the decades since the original papers of EPR and Bell. We first review work relating to higher spin measurements which revealed that macroscopic quantum states could exhibit Bell correlations. This covers higher dimensional, multiparticle and continuous-variable EPR and Bell states where measurements on a single system give a spectrum of outcomes, and also multipartite states where measurements are made at multiple separated sites. It appeared that the macroscopic quantum observations were for an increasingly limited span of measurement settings and required a fine resolution of outcomes. Motivated by this, we next review correlations for macroscopic superposition states, and examine predictions for the violation of Leggett-Garg inequalities using dynamical quantum systems. These results reveal Bell correlations for coarse-grained measurements which need only distin-guish between macroscopically distinct states, thus bringing into question the validity of certain forms of macroscopic realism. Finally, we review progress for massive systems, including Bose-Einstein condensates and optomechanical oscillators, where EPR-type correlations have been observed between massive systems. Experiments are summarized which support the predictions of quantum mechanics in mesoscopic regimes.

TI Quantum Density Peak Clustering Algorithm
SO ENTROPY
AB A widely used clustering algorithm, density peak clustering (DPC), assigns different attribute values to data points through the distance between data points, and then determines the number and range of clustering by attribute values. However, DPC is inefficient when dealing with scenes with a large amount of data, and the range of parameters is not easy to determine. To fix these problems, we propose a quantum DPC (QDPC) algorithm based on a quantum DistCalc circuit and a Grover circuit. The time complexity is reduced to O(log(N-2) + 6N + root N), whereas that of the traditional algorithm is O(N-2). The space complexity is also decreased from O(N . inverted right perpendicularlog Ninverted left perpendicular) to O( inverted right perpendicularlog Ninverted left perpendicular).

TI Entanglement in prepare-and-measure scenarios: many questions, a few
   answers
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB Entanglement and quantum communication are paradigmatic resources in quantum information science leading to correlations between systems that have no classical analogue. Correlations due to entanglement when communication is absent have for long been studied in Bell scenarios. Correlations due to quantum communication when entanglement is absent have been studied extensively in prepare-and-measure (PM) scenarios in the last decade. Here, we set out to understand and investigate correlations in scenarios that involve both entanglement and communication, focussing on entanglement-assisted (EA) PM scenarios. In a recent companion paper (arXiv:2103.10748), we investigated correlations based on unrestricted entanglement. Here, our focus is on scenarios with restricted entanglement. We establish several elementary relations between standard classical and quantum communication and their EA counterparts. In particular, while it was already known that bits or qubits assisted by two-qubit entanglement between the sender and receiver constitute a stronger resource than bare bits or qubits, we show that higher-dimensional entanglement further enhance the power of bits or qubits. We also provide a characterisation of generalised dense coding protocols, a natural subset of EA quantum communication protocols, finding that they can be understood as standard quantum communication protocols in real-valued Hilbert space. Though such dense coding protocols can convey up to two bits of information, we provide evidence, perhaps counter-intuitively, that resources with a small information capacity, such as a bare qutrits, can sometimes produce stronger correlations. Along the way we leave several conjectures and conclude with a list of interesting open problems.

TI Quantum Sensing and Imaging of Spin-Orbit-Torque-Driven Spin Dynamics in
   the Non-Collinear Antiferromagnet Mn3Sn
SO ADVANCED MATERIALS
AB Novel non-collinear antiferromagnets with spontaneous time-reversal symmetry breaking, non-trivial band topology, and unconventional transport properties have received immense research interest over the past decade due to their rich physics and enormous promise in technological applications. One of the central focuses in this emerging field is exploring the relationship between the microscopic magnetic structure and exotic material properties. Here, nanoscale imaging of both spin-orbit-torque-induced deterministic magnetic switching and chiral spin rotation in non-collinear antiferromagnet Mn3Sn films using nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers are reported. Direct evidence of the off-resonance dipole-dipole coupling between the spin dynamics in Mn3Sn and proximate NV centers is also demonstrated by NV relaxometry measurements. These results demonstrate the unique capabilities of NV centers in accessing the local information of the magnetic order and dynamics in these emergent quantum materials and suggest new opportunities for investigating the interplay between topology and magnetism in a broad range of topological magnets.

TI Networking Feasibility of Quantum Key Distribution Constellation
   Networks
SO ENTROPY
AB Quantum key distribution constellation is the key to achieve global quantum networking. However, the networking feasibility of quantum constellation that combines satellite-to-ground accesses selection and inter-satellite routing is faced with a lack of research. In this paper, satellite-to-ground accesses selection is modeled as problems to find the longest paths in directed acyclic graphs. The inter-satellite routing is interpreted as problems to find a maximum flow in graph theory. As far as we know, the above problems are initially understood from the perspective of graph theory. Corresponding algorithms to solve the problems are provided. Although the classical discrete variable quantum key distribution protocol, i.e., BB84 protocol, is applied in simulation, the methods proposed in our paper can also be used to solve other secure key distributions. The simulation results of a low-Earth-orbit constellation scenario show that the Sun is the leading factor in restricting the networking. Due to the solar influence, inter-planar links block the network periodically and, thus, the inter-continental delivery of keys is restricted significantly.

TI Mod2VQLS: A Variational Quantum Algorithm for Solving Systems of Linear
   Equations Modulo 2
SO APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
AB This paper presents a system for solving binary-valued linear equations using quantum computers. The system is called Mod2VQLS, which stands for Modulo 2 Variational Quantum Linear Solver. As far as we know, this is the first such proposal. The design is a classical-quantum hybrid. The quantum components are a new circuit design for implementing matrix multiplication modulo 2, and a variational circuit to be optimized. The classical components are the optimizer, which measures the cost function and updates the quantum parameters for each iteration, and the controller that runs the quantum job and classical optimizer iterations. We propose two alternative ansatze or templates for the variational circuit and present results showing that the rotation ansatz designed specifically for this problem provides the most direct path to a valid solution. Numerical experiments in low dimensions indicate that Mod2VQLS, using the custom rotations ansatz, is on par with the block Wiedemann algorithm, which is the best-known to date solution for this problem.

TI Quantum sensing based on strongly interacting nuclear spin systems
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB Quantum sensing utilizes the quantum resources of well-controlled quantum systems to measure small signals with high sensitivity, and has great potential in both fundamental science and concrete applications. Interacting quantum systems have attracted increasing interest in the field of precise measurements, owing to their potential to generate quantum-correlated states and exhibit rich many-body dynamics. These features provide a novel avenue for exploiting quantum resources in sensing applications. Although previous studies have shown that using such systems can improve sensitivity, they mainly focused on measuring individual physical quantities. In experiment, the challenge of using interacting quantum systems to achieve high-precision measurements of multiple physical parameters simultaneously has not been explored to a large extent. In this study, we demonstrate a first realisation of interaction-based multiparameter sensing by using strongly interacting nuclear spins under ultra-low magnetic field conditions. We find that, as the interaction strength among nuclear spins becomes significantly larger than their Larmor frequencies, a different regime emerges where the strongly interacting spins can be simultaneously sensitive to all components of a multidimensional field, such as a three-dimensional magnetic field. Moreover, we observe that the strong interactions between nuclear spins can increase their quantum coherence times to as long as several seconds, thereby improving measurement precision. Our sensor successfully achieves precision measurement of three-dimensional vector magnetic fields with a field sensitivity reaching the order of 10(-11) T and an angular resolution as high as 0.2 rad. Importantly, this approach eliminates the need for external reference fields, thereby avoiding calibration errors and technical noise commonly encountered in traditional magnetometry. Experimentally optimized protocol further enhances the sensitivity of the interacting spin-based sensor by up to five orders of magnitude compared with non-interacting or classical schemes. These results demonstrate the enormous potential of interacting spin systems as a powerful platform for high-precision multi-parameter quantum sensing. The techniques developed here pave the way for a new generation of quantum sensors that use intrinsic spin interactions to exceed the traditional sensitivity limits, presenting a promising route toward ultra-sensitive, calibration-free magnetometry in complex environments.

Tracking the multilevel fluctuating qudit frequencies with a precision enabled by the high coherence of the device allows us to extract the charge offset and quasiparticle dynamics. We observe qualitatively different charge-offset behavior in the tantalum device than those measured in previous low-frequency charge-noise studies. In particular, we find the charge-offset dynamics are dominated by rare, discrete jumps between a finite number of quasistationary charge configurations, a previously unobserved charge-noise process in superconducting qubits.

TI Impact of microwave phase noise on diamond quantum sensing
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Precision optical measurements of the electron-spin precession of nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond form the basis of numerous applications. The most sensitivity-demanding applications, such as femtotesla magnetometry, require the ability to measure changes in GHz spin transition frequencies at the sub-millihertz level, corresponding to a fractional resolution of better than 10(-12). Here we study the impact of microwave (MW) phase noise on the response of an NV sensor. Fluctuations of the phase of the MW waveform cause undesired rotations of the NV spin state. These fluctuations are imprinted in the optical readout signal and, left unmitigated, are indistinguishable from magnetic-field noise. We show that the phase noise of several common commercial MW generators results in an effective pT s(1/2)-range noise floor that varies with the MW carrier frequency and the detection frequency of the pulse sequence. The data are described by a frequency-domain model incorporating the MW phase-noise spectrum and the filter-function response of the sensing protocol. For controlled injection of white and random-walk phase noise, the observed NV magnetic noise floor is described by simple analytic expressions that accurately capture the scaling with pulse sequence length and the number of pi pulses. We outline several strategies to suppress the impact of MW phase noise and implement a version, based on gradiometry, that realizes a >10-fold suppression. Our study highlights an important challenge in the pursuit of sensitive diamond quantum sensors and is applicable to other qubit systems with a large transition frequency.

TI Room-Temperature Quantum Coherence of Reversible Photo-Generated Radical
   and its Film
SO CHEMISTRY-A EUROPEAN JOURNAL
AB Electron spin qubits are becoming an important research direction in the field of quantum computing and information storage. However, the quantum decoherence has seriously hindered the development of this field. So far, few qubits exhibit long phase memory time (Tm), and even fewer qubits that can reach room temperature. Some reports show that the coherence times of radicals are generally long, so radicals may be the preferred spin carriers for qubits. Here, we demonstrate the qubit properties of a photogenerated radical (1 a) based on 2,4,6-Tri(4-pyridyl)-1,3,5-triazine (tpt, 1). More importantly, the photogenerated radical is a spin self-diluting complex, which the dilution is generally used in the investigation of qubits to reduce the interference of environment on qubits in order to overcome the decoherence of qubits. It is surprised that radical tpt has a stable Tm=1.1 mu s above 20 K, even keep it to room temperature. In addition, the tpt-film prepared by the vacuum evaporation is significantly increase the T1 and Tm at low temperature.

TI Multiclass Classification of Metrologically Resourceful Tripartite
   Quantum States with Deep Neural Networks
SO SENSORS
AB Quantum entanglement is a unique phenomenon of quantum mechanics, which has no classical counterpart and gives quantum systems their advantage in computing, communication, sensing, and metrology. In quantum sensing and metrology, utilizing an entangled probe state enhances the achievable precision more than its classical counterpart. Noise in the probe state preparation step can cause the system to output unentangled states, which might not be resourceful. Hence, an effective method for the detection and classification of tripartite entanglement is required at that step. However, current mathematical methods cannot robustly classify multiclass entanglement in tripartite quantum systems, especially in the case of mixed states. In this paper, we explore the utility of artificial neural networks for classifying the entanglement of tripartite quantum states into fully separable, biseparable, and fully entangled states. We employed Bell's inequality for the dataset of tripartite quantum states and train the deep neural network for multiclass classification. This entanglement classification method is computationally efficient due to using a small number of measurements. At the same time, it also maintains generalization by covering a large Hilbert space of tripartite quantum states.

TI Multipartite entanglement serves as a faithful detector for quantum
   phase transitions
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB We investigate quantum phase transitions (QPTs) in various spin chain systems using the multipartite entanglement measure tau SEF based on the monogamy inequality of squared entanglement of formation (EOF). Our results demonstrate that tau SEF is more effective and reliable than bipartite entanglement or bipartite correlation measures such as EOF, von Neumann entropy, and quantum discord in characterizing QPTs. tau SEF not only detects critical points that may go unnoticed by other detectors but also avoids the issue of singularity at non-critical points encountered by other measures. Furthermore, by applying tau SEF , we have obtained the phase diagram for the XY spin chain with three and four interactions and discovered a new quantum phase.

TI Spin structure and resonant driving of spin-1/2 defects in SiC
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB Transition metal (TM) defects in silicon carbide have favorable spin coherence properties and are suitable as quantum memory for quantum communication. To characterize TM defects as quantum spin-photon interfaces, we model defects that have one active electron with spin 1/2 in the atomic D shell. The spin structure, as well as the magnetic and optical resonance properties of the active electron, emerge from the interplay of the crystal potential and spin-orbit coupling, and they are described by a general model derived using group theory. We find that the spin-orbit coupling leads to additional allowed transitions and a modification of the g-tensor. To describe the dependence of the Rabi frequency on the magnitude and direction of the static and driving fields, we derive an effective Hamiltonian. This theoretical description can also be instrumental in performing and optimizing spin control in TM defects.

TI A Quantum Key Distribution Routing Scheme for a Zero-Trust QKD Network
   System: A Moving Target Defense Approach
SO BIG DATA AND COGNITIVE COMPUTING
AB Quantum key distribution (QKD), a key application of quantum information technology and "one-time pad" (OTP) encryption, enables secure key exchange with information-theoretic security, meaning its security is grounded in the laws of physics rather than computational assumptions. However, in QKD networks, achieving long-distance communication often requires trusted relays to mitigate channel losses. This reliance introduces significant challenges, including vulnerabilities to compromised relays and the high costs of infrastructure, which hinder widespread deployment. To address these limitations, we propose a zero-trust spatiotemporal diversification framework for multipath-multi-key distribution. The proposed approach enhances the security of end-to-end key distribution by dynamically shuffling key exchange routes, enabling secure multipath key distribution. Furthermore, it incorporates a dynamic adaptive path recovery mechanism that leverages a recursive penalty model to identify and exclude suspicious or compromised relay nodes. To validate this framework, we conducted extensive simulations and compared its performance against established multipath QKD methods. The results demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves a 97.22% lower attack success rate with 20% attacker pervasiveness and a 91.42% reduction in the attack success rate for single key transmission. The total security percentage improves by 35% under 20% attacker pervasiveness, and security enhancement reaches 79.6% when increasing QKD pairs. Additionally, the proposed scheme exhibits an 86.04% improvement in defense against interception and nearly doubles the key distribution success rate compared to traditional methods. The results demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly improves both security robustness and efficiency, underscoring its potential to advance the practical deployment of QKD networks.

TI Universal Fast-Flux Control of a Coherent, Low-Frequency Qubit
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW X
AB The heavy-fluxonium circuit is a promising building block for superconducting quantum processors due to its long relaxation and dephasing time at the flux-frustration point. However, the suppressed charge matrix elements and low transition frequency make it challenging to perform fast single-qubit gates using standard protocols. We report on new protocols for reset, fast coherent control, and readout that allow high-quality operation of the qubit with a 14 MHz transition frequency, an order of magnitude lower in energy than the ambient thermal energy scale. We utilize higher levels of the fluxonium to read out the qubit state and to initialize the qubit with 97% fidelity corresponding to cooling it to 190 mu K. Instead of using standard microwave pulses, we control the qubit only with fast-flux pulses, generating control fields much larger than the qubit frequency. We develop a universal set of gates based on nonadiabatic Landau-Zener transitions that act in 20-60 ns, less than the single-qubit Larmor period. We measure qubit coherence of T-1, T-2e similar to 300 mu s for a fluxonium in a 2D architecture and realize single-qubit gates with an average gate fidelity of 99.8% as characterized by randomized benchmarking.

TI Coherent manipulation of graph states composed of finite-energy
   Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill-encoded qubits
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Graph states are a central resource in measurement-based quantum information processing. In the photonic qubit architecture based on Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) encoding, the generation of high-fidelity graph states composed of realistic, finite-energy approximate GKP-encoded qubits thus constitutes a key task. We consider the finite-energy approximation of GKP-qubit states given by a coherent superposition of shifted finite-squeezed vacuum states, where the displacements are Gaussian distributed. We present an exact description of graph states composed of such approximate GKP qubits as a coherent superposition of a Gaussian ensemble of randomly displaced ideal GKP-qubit graph states. Using standard Gaussian dynamics, we track the transfor-mation of the covariance matrix and the mean-displacement vector elements of the Gaussian distribution of the ensemble under tools such as GKP-Steane error-correction and fusion operations that can be used to grow large high-fidelity GKP-qubit graph states. The covariance matrix elements capture the noise in the graph state due to the finite-energy approximation of GKP qubits, while the mean displacements relate to the possible absolute shift errors on the individual qubits arising conditionally from the homodyne measurements that are a part of these tools. Our work thus pins down an exact coherent error model for graph states generated from truly finite-energy GKP qubits, which can shed light on their error-correction properties.

TI Quantum Sensing of Insulator-to-Metal Transitions in a Mott Insulator
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB Nitrogen vacancy (NV) centers, optically active atomic defects in diamond, have attracted tremendous interest for quantum sensing, network, and computing applications due to their excellent quantum coherence and remarkable versatility in a real, ambient environment. Taking advantage of these strengths, this paper reports on NV-based local sensing of the electrically driven insulator-to-metal transition (IMT) in a proximal Mott insulator. The resistive switching properties of both pristine and ion-irradiated VO2 thin film devices are studied by performing optically detected NV electron spin resonance measurements. These measurements probe the local temperature and magnetic field in electrically biased VO2 devices, which are in agreement with the global transport measurement results. In pristine devices, the electrically driven IMT proceeds through Joule heating up to the transition temperature while in ion-irradiated devices, the transition occurs nonthermally, well below the transition temperature. The results provide direct evidence for nonthermal electrically induced IMT in a Mott insulator, highlighting the significant opportunities offered by NV quantum sensors in exploring nanoscale thermal and electrical behaviors in Mott materials.

TI Accelerating Decision Diagram-based Multi-node Quantum Simulation with

SP IEEE, IEEE Comp Soc
AB An N-bit quantum state requires a vector of length 2(N), leading to an exponential increase in the required memory with N in conventional statevector-based quantum simulators. A proposed solution to this issue is the decision diagram-based quantum simulator, which can significantly decrease the necessary memory and is expected to operate faster for specific quantum circuits. However, decision diagram-based quantum simulators are not easily parallelizable because data must be manipulated dynamically, and most implementations run on one thread. This paper introduces ring communication-based optimal parallelization and automatic swap insertion techniques for multi-node implementation of decision diagram-based quantum simulators. The ring communication approach is designed so that each node communicates with its neighboring nodes, which can facilitate faster and more parallel communication than broadcasting where one node needs to communicate with all nodes simultaneously. The automatic swap insertion method, an approach to minimize inter-node communication, has been employed in existing multi-node state vector-based simulators, but this paper proposes two methods specifically designed for decision diagram-based quantum simulators. These techniques were implemented and evaluated using the Shor algorithm and random circuits with up to 38 qubits using a maximum of 256 nodes. The experimental results have revealed that multi-node implementation can reduce run-time by up to 26 times. For example, Shor circuits that need 38 qubits can finish simulation in 147 seconds. Additionally, it was shown that ring communication has a higher speed-up effect than broadcast communication, and the importance of selecting the appropriate automatic swap insertion method was revealed.

TI Optimization of etching processes for the fabrication of smooth silicon

SO MICRO AND NANO ENGINEERING
AB Recently, it has been demonstrated that Silicon Carbide (SiC) membranes can be used in quantum sensing and MEMS applications. One of the important steps for the production of such membranes is the removal of the substrate material in order to form membranes of micron or submicron thicknesses confining the active regions of fabricated devices to the high quality, doped controlled, epitaxial layers. Moreover, optical components such as Fabry-Pe ' rot cavities and photonic crystals require membranes with smooth surfaces with roughnesses down to the nanometer scale. We report on the development of doping-selective electrochemical processes for the etching of SiC and investigate the creation of such membranes, including the path towards thinner and smoother layers for improved performance. We demonstrate that the resulting roughness of membranes is substantially reduced by novel lithographic patterning and ion beam etching (IBE) procedures to RMS values down to 6 nm.

TI Compromise-free scaling of qubit speed and coherence
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Across leading qubit platforms, a common trade-off persists: increasing coherence comes at the cost of operational speed, reflecting the notion that protecting a qubit from its noisy surroundings also limits control over it. This speed-coherence dilemma limits qubit performance across various technologies. Here, we demonstrate a hole spin qubit in a Ge/Si core/shell nanowire that triples its Rabi frequency while simultaneously quadrupling its Hahn-echo coherence time, boosting the Q-factor by over an order of magnitude. This is enabled by the direct Rashba spin-orbit interaction, emerging from heavy-hole-light-hole mixing through strong confinement in two dimensions. Tuning a gate voltage causes this interaction to peak, providing maximum drive speed and a point where the qubit is optimally protected from charge noise, allowing speed and coherence to scale together. Our proof-of-concept shows that careful dot design can overcome a long-standing limitation, offering a new approach towards building high-performance, fault-tolerant qubits.

TI Topological order and fractionalized excitations in quantum many-body
   systems
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB The Landau Fermi liquid theory and the Ginzburg-Landau phase transition theory stand as two pivotal cornerstones in traditional condensed matter physics, achieving significant success in addressing crucial physical phenomena such as BCS superconductors and liquid helium superfluids. However, marked by the discoveries of the quantum Hall effect and high-temperature superconductivity in the 1980s, it gradually became evident that for a broad class of novel quantum states, such as fractional quantum Hall states and quantum spin liquids, their properties transcend the Landau Fermi liquid theory and Ginzburg-Landau phase transition theory. Topological order and its related concepts of long-range many-body quantum entanglement and fractionalized excitation have become the key concepts to understand these exotic quantum states. Designing and identifying topologically ordered states of matter in quantum materials and quantum simulation systems, and probing and manipulating their fractionalized excitations, are important research directions in modern condensed matter physics. In recent years, great progress has been made in the quantum simulation and manipulation of topological order on highly controllable quantum simulation platforms, such as Rydberg atomic systems, superconducting quantum processors, and two-dimensional moire superlattices. This article provides a brief overview of recent research advances and challenges in the study of topological order in traditional condensed matter systems and quantum simulation experimental platforms. It also provides prospects for the future developments of this field.

TI Stochastic gradient line Bayesian optimization for efficient
   noise-robust optimization of parameterized quantum circuits
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Optimizing parameterized quantum circuits is a key routine in using near-term quantum devices. However, the existing algorithms for such optimization require an excessive number of quantum-measurement shots for estimating expectation values of observables and repeating many iterations, whose cost has been a critical obstacle for practical use. We develop an efficient alternative optimization algorithm, stochastic gradient line Bayesian optimization (SGLBO), to address this problem. SGLBO reduces the measurement-shot cost by estimating an appropriate direction of updating circuit parameters based on stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and further utilizing Bayesian optimization (BO) to estimate the optimal step size for each iteration in SGD. In addition, we formulate an adaptive measurement-shot strategy and introduce a technique of suffix averaging to reduce the effect of statistical and hardware noise. Our numerical simulation demonstrates that the SGLBO augmented with these techniques can drastically reduce the measurement-shot cost, improve the accuracy, and make the optimization noise-robust.

TI Underwater quantum key distribution with continuous-variable via photon
   additions
SO RESULTS IN PHYSICS
AB Quantum key distribution with continuous-variable (CVQKD) provides an alternative way for the security improvement of underwater optical communication, but facing into the awkward situation of short distance. For this reason, here we exploit photon addition operation at the emitter into enhancing the performance of underwater CVQKD. Based on numerical simulation, it is shown that applying photon-addition non-Gaussian operation between entangled resource and the sender can further enhance both the secure key rate and the transmission distance, compared to apply photon subtraction operation between entangled resource and the receiver. In addition, the influence of seawater quality factors in underwater CVQKD system is also considered, so as to provide technical support for underwater safety communication.

TI Introducing Quantum Variational Circuit for Efficient Management of
   Common Pool Resources
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Common Pool Resources (CPRs) pose a challenge to find balance between individual self-interest and collective cooperation. The current state of art tries to solve the problem using classical Reinforcement Learning techniques. However, due to exponential search space, the training time of these algorithms is very high. On the other hand, quantum computing offers parallel processing that makes it suitable for such complex scenarios. The purpose of this study is to explore Quantum Reinforcement Learning to solve the CPR challenge. We introduced a Variational Quantum Algorithm for attaining quantum speedup in resolving CPR dilemmas and developing cooperative behaviors among agents. The proposed method shows significantly better performance then classical reinforcement learning algorithms in terms of training time and training parameters. This study offers valuable insights into harnessing the quantum advantage in real-life multi-agent scenarios, including cooperative robotics, peer-to-peer networks, and traffic optimization.

TI Lift-connected surface codes
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB We use the recently introduced lifted product to construct a family of quantum low density parity check codes (QLDPC codes). The codes we obtain can be viewed as stacks of surface codes that are interconnected, leading to the name lift-connected surface (LCS) codes. LCS codes offer a wide range of parameters-a particularly striking feature is that they show interesting properties that are favorable compared to the standard surface code. For example, already at moderate numbers of physical qubits in the order of tens, LCS codes of equal size have lower logical error rate or similarly, require fewer qubits for a fixed target logical error rate. We present and analyze the construction and provide numerical simulation results for the logical error rate under code capacity and phenomenological noise. These results show that LCS codes attain thresholds that are comparable to corresponding (non-connected) copies of surface codes, while the logical error rate can be orders of magnitude lower, even for representatives with the same parameters. This provides a code family showing the potential of modern product constructions at already small qubit numbers. Their amenability to 3D-local connectivity renders them particularly relevant for near-term implementations.

TI Robustness of quantum reinforcement learning under hardware errors
SO EPJ QUANTUM TECHNOLOGY
AB Variational quantum machine learning algorithms have become the focus of recent research on how to utilize near-term quantum devices for machine learning tasks. They are considered suitable for this as the circuits that are run can be tailored to the device, and a big part of the computation is delegated to the classical optimizer. It has also been hypothesized that they may be more robust to hardware noise than conventional algorithms due to their hybrid nature. However, the effect of training quantum machine learning models under the influence of hardware-induced noise has not yet been extensively studied. In this work, we address this question for a specific type of learning, namely variational reinforcement learning, by studying its performance in the presence of various noise sources: shot noise, coherent and incoherent errors. We analytically and empirically investigate how the presence of noise during training and evaluation of variational quantum reinforcement learning algorithms affect the performance of the agents and robustness of the learned policies. Furthermore, we provide a method to reduce the number of measurements required to train Q-learning agents, using the inherent structure of the algorithm.

TI Spectral Graph Compression in Deploying Recommender Algorithms on
   Quantum Simulators
SO COMPUTERS
AB This follow-up scientific case study builds on prior research to explore the computational challenges of applying quantum algorithms to financial asset management, focusing specifically on solving the graph-cut problem for investment recommendation. Unlike our prior study, which focused on idealized QAOA performance, this work introduces a graph compression pipeline that enables QAOA deployment under real quantum hardware constraints. This study investigates quantum-accelerated spectral graph compression for financial asset recommendations, addressing scalability and regulatory constraints in portfolio management. We propose a hybrid framework combining the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) with spectral graph theory to solve the Max-Cut problem for investor clustering. Our methodology leverages quantum simulators (cuQuantum and Cirq-GPU) to evaluate performance against classical brute-force enumeration, with graph compression techniques enabling deployment on resource-constrained quantum hardware. The results underscore that efficient graph compression is crucial for successful implementation. The framework bridges theoretical quantum advantage with practical financial use cases, though hardware limitations (qubit counts, coherence times) necessitate hybrid quantum-classical implementations. These findings advance the deployment of quantum algorithms in mission-critical financial systems, particularly for high-dimensional investor profiling under regulatory constraints.

TI Quantum key distribution (QKD) for wireless networks with
   software-defined networking
SO INTERNET TECHNOLOGY LETTERS
AB Network management has been significantly transformed by software-defined networking (SDN), which consolidates control and improves adaptability. As a result of this paradigm shift, security concerns have emerged concurrently. Within SDN environments, maintaining service path integrity is of utmost importance because malicious entities can exploit network flows to gain access to data, resulting in security breaches. Thus, QKD networks require a management plane that can control and manage the QKD resources. Quantum key distribution networks can be controlled and managed separately by SDN, allowing quantum key forwarding to be separated from their control and management. The paper provides an overview of QKD networks enabled by SDN, along with an overview of its architecture, interfaces, and protocols. This paper elaborates on the overall architecture and related interfaces and protocols of QKD networks assisted by SDN. Then, three important paradigms for simulation are presented using three use cases.

TI Hybrid quantum neural networks: harnessing dressed quantum circuits for
   enhanced tsunami prediction via earthquake data fusion
SO EPJ QUANTUM TECHNOLOGY
AB Tsunami is one of the deadliest natural disasters which can occur, leading to great loss of life and property. This study focuses on predicting tsunamis, using earthquake dataset from the year 1995 to 2023. The research introduces the Hybrid Quantum Neural Network (HQNN), an innovative model that combines Neural Network (NN) architecture with Parameterized Quantum Circuits (PmQC) to tackle complex machine learning (ML) problems where deep learning (DL) models struggle, aiming for higher accuracy in prediction while maintaining a compact model size. The hybrid model's performance is compared with the classical model counterpart to investigate the quantum circuit's effectivity as a layer in a DL model. The model has been implemented using 2-6 features through Principle Component Analysis (PCA) method. HQNN's quantum circuit is a combination of Pennylane's embedding (Angle Embedding (AE) and Instantaneous Quantum Polynomial (IQP) Embedding) and layer circuits (Basic Entangler Layers (BEL), Random Layers (RL), and Strongly Entangling Layers (SEL)), along with the classical layers. Results show that the proposed model achieved high performance, with a maximum accuracy up to 96.03% using 4 features with the combination of AE and SEL, superior to the DL model. Future research could explore the scalability and diverse applications of HQNN, as well as its potential to address practical ML challenges.

SO IEEE JOURNAL ON EMERGING AND SELECTED TOPICS IN CIRCUITS AND SYSTEMS
AB The anticipated end of Moore's law, coupled with the breakdown of Dennard scaling, compelled everyone to conceive forthcoming computing systems once transistors reach their limits. Three leading approaches to circumvent this situation are the chiplet paradigm, domain customisation and quantum computing. However, architectural and technological innovations have shifted the fundamental bottleneck from computation to communication. Hence, on-chip and on-package communication play a pivotal role in determining the performance, energy efficiency and scalability of general-purpose, domain-specific and quantum computing systems. This article reviews the recent advances in chip and package-scale interconnects due to the change in architecture, application and technology. The primary objective of this article is to present the current status, key challenges, and impact-worthy opportunities in this research area from the perspective of hardware architectures.

TI Characterizing barren plateaus in quantum ansatze with the adjoint
   representation
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Variational quantum algorithms, a popular heuristic for near-term quantum computers, utilize parameterized quantum circuits which naturally express Lie groups. It has been postulated that many properties of variational quantum algorithms can be understood by studying their corresponding groups, chief among them the presence of vanishing gradients or barren plateaus, but a theoretical derivation has been lacking. Using tools from the representation theory of compact Lie groups, we formulate a theory of barren plateaus for parameterized quantum circuits whose observables lie in their dynamical Lie algebra, covering a large variety of commonly used ansatze such as the Hamiltonian Variational Ansatz, Quantum Alternating Operator Ansatz, and many equivariant quantum neural networks. Our theory provides, for the first time, the ability to compute the exact variance of the gradient of the cost function of the quantum compound ansatz, under mixing conditions that we prove are commonplace.

TI Using cyclic Hadamard masks for single-pixel quantum imaging under
   entangled photon illumination
SO SCIENCE ADVANCES
AB Quantum imaging, operating at extremely low photon flux and accommodating nondegenerate imaging wavelengths, offers a unique approach for imaging light-sensitive structures. Conventional quantum imaging systems often require costly intensified charge-coupled devices together with complex delay line and triggering electronics, limiting broader applications. In this work, we propose an approach for quantum imaging that uses a simple rotating mask coded with cyclic Hadamard patterns, together with single-pixel detectors, eliminating the need for the abovementioned specialized devices. Single-pixel quantum imaging with a resolution of 41 pixels by 43 pixels is performed, and its noise-resistant performance is further studied with an improved gate time of 1 nanosecond using time-correlated single-photon counting. An imaging speed up to 2 frames per second can be achieved, corresponding to a spatial modulation rate of 3.8 kilohertz. Furthermore, quantum ghost imaging with the object and the mask modulation in separate beams is also demonstrated, showing the potential of our system for high-speed, low-cost, and noise-resistant quantum imaging applications.

TI Entanglement-assisted classical capacities of some channels acting as
   radial multipliers on fermion algebras
SO JOURNAL OF FUNCTIONAL ANALYSIS
AB We investigate a new class of unital quantum channels on M2k , acting as radial multipliers when we identify the matrix algebra M2k with a finite-dimensional fermion algebra. Our primary contribution lies in the precise computation of the (optimal) rate at which classical information can be transmitted through these channels from a sender to a receiver when they share an unlimited amount of entanglement. Our approach relies on new connections between fermion algebras with the n- dimensional discrete hypercube {-1, 1}n. Significantly, our calculations yield exact values applicable to the operators of the fermionic Ornstein-Uhlenbeck semigroup. This advancement not only provides deeper insights into the structure and behaviour of these channels but also enhances our understanding of Quantum Information Theory in a dimension-independent context.

TI Research on blockchain smart contract technology based on resistance to
   quantum computing attacks
SO PLOS ONE
AB In recent years, blockchain technology has developed rapidly and has been widely used in medical, financial, energy and other fields. However, in the process of practical application, each blockchain is a small independent ecosystem, with all transactions and operations limited to the chain, resulting in a large number of mutually heterogeneous to independent blockchains. It presents challenges for cross-chain interactions, cross-organization data sharing, and cross-blockchain expansion, and hinders the wider application of blockchain technology. In addition, the traditional digital signature method based on elliptic curve cipher faces the threat of being cracked by quantum computing attacks. To solve the aforementioned problems, this paper proposed a blockchain smart contract technique based on quantum computing attack resistance(BSCTQCAT). The technique first introduces the digital signature of the lattice cipher into the blockchain to resist the quantum search algorithm attack. Then, based on the smart contract authentication scheme, the nodes on multiple heterogeneous chains are organized into an identity agent layer P2P network, through which transactions on the chain will establish a credible identity management and message authentication mechanism between different chains, solving the current problem that each chain is difficult to communicate with each other. In this paper, the performance of the algorithm is evaluated by simulating the Bitcoin transaction scenario and analyzing the experimental data.

TI Trusted Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface for Multi-User Quantum Key
   Distribution
SO IEEE COMMUNICATIONS LETTERS
AB We consider a multi-user quantum key distribution (QKD) system based on free-space optics (FSO) in terrestrial environment. Due to obstacles in the signal path, FSO-QKD is heavily affected by decoherence and other harmful effects. In order to avoid the performance degradation, trusted nodes (TNs) are introduced in the QKD network. However, in absence of alternative signal routes, the classical data and the quantum key are relayed by the same TN, which makes it a promising target for an eavesdropping attack. In order to address this issue, we explore the use of a trusted reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) that passively reflects the classical signals and manipulates them to make the encryption consistent with the distributed keys. The concept is supported by numerical simulations with multiple FSO-QKD users and an eavesdropper. We demonstrate that the level of data protection is very high with the proposed concept even in case of a successful attack on the trusted RIS and a complete key acquisition by the eavesdropper.

AB Quantum comparators hold substantial significance in the scientific community as fundamental components in a wide array of algorithms. In this research, we present an innovative approach where we explore the realm of comparator circuits, specifically focussing on three distinct circuit designs present in the literature. These circuits are notable for their use of T-gates, which have gained significant attention in circuit design due to their ability to enable the utilisation of error-correcting codes. However, it is important to note that T-gates come at a considerable computational cost. One of the key contributions of our work is the optimisation of the quantum gates used within these circuits. We articulate the proposed circuits employing Clifford+T gates, facilitating error correction code implementation. Additionally, we minimise T-gate usage, thereby reducing computational costs and fortifying circuit robustness against errors and environmental disturbances-essential for mitigating the effects of internal and external noise. Our methodology employs a bottom-up examination of comparator circuits, initiating with a detailed study of their gates. Subsequently, we systematically dissect the functions of these gates, thereby advancing towards a comprehensive understanding of the circuit's overall functionality. This meticulous examination forms the foundation of our research, enabling us to identify areas where optimisations can be made to improve their performance.

TI Optimize quantum simulation using a force-gradient integrator
SO EPL
AB Quantum simulation has shown great potential in many fields due to its powerful computational capabilities. However, the limited fidelity can lead to a severe limitation on the number of gate operations, which requires us to find optimized algorithms. Trotter decomposition and high-order Trotter decompositions are widely used in quantum simulations. We find that they can be significantly improved by force-gradient integrator in lattice QCD. By using two applications as examples, we show that the force-gradient decomposition can reduce the number of gate operations up to about a third of those using high-order Trotter decompositions. Therefore, force-gradient decomposition shows a great prospective in future applications of quantum simulation. Copyright (C) 2021 EPLA

TI Stabilizing a Bosonic Qubit Using Colored Dissipation
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Protected qubits such as the 0-pi qubit, and bosonic qubits including cat qubits and Gottesman-KitaevPreskill (GKP) qubits offer advantages for fault tolerance. Some of these protected qubits (e.g., 0-pi qubit and Kerr-cat qubit) are stabilized by Hamiltonians which have (near-)degenerate ground state manifolds with large energy gaps to the excited state manifolds. Without dissipative stabilization mechanisms the performance of such energy-gap-protected qubits can be limited by leakage to excited states. Here, we propose a scheme for dissipatively stabilizing an energy-gap-protected qubit using colored (i.e., frequency selective) dissipation without inducing errors in the ground state manifold. Concretely we apply our colored dissipation technique to Kerr-cat qubits and propose colored Kerr-cat qubits which are protected by an engineered colored single-photon loss. When applied to the Kerr-cat qubits our scheme significantly suppresses leakage-induced bit-flip errors (which we show are a limiting error mechanism) while only using linear interactions. Beyond the benefits to the Kerr-cat qubit we also show that our frequency selective loss technique can be applied to a broader class of protected qubits.

TI A scanning probe microscope compatible with quantum sensing at ambient
   conditions
SO REVIEW OF SCIENTIFIC INSTRUMENTS
AB We designed and built up a new type of ambient scanning probe microscope (SPM), which is fully compatible with state-of-the-art quantum sensing technology based on the nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond. We chose a qPlus-type tuning fork (Q up to similar to 4400) as the current/force sensor of SPM for its high stiffness and stability under various environments, which yields atomic resolution under scanning tunneling microscopy mode and 1.2-nm resolution under atomic force microscopy mode. The tip of SPM can be used to directly image the topography of nanoscale targets on diamond surfaces for quantum sensing and to manipulate the electrostatic environment of NV centers to enhance their sensitivity up to a single proton spin. In addition, we also demonstrated scanning magnetometry and electrometry with a spatial resolution of similar to 20 nm. Our new system not only paves the way for integrating atomic/molecular-scale color-center qubits onto SPM tips to produce quantum tips but also provides the possibility of fabricating color-center qubits with nanoscale or atomic precision.

TI Quantum many-body simulation of finite-temperature systems with sampling
   a series expansion of a quantum imaginary-time evolution
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Simulating thermal-equilibrium properties at finite temperature is crucial for studying quantum many-body systems. Quantum computers are expected to enable us to simulate large systems at finite temperatures, overcoming challenges faced by classical computers, such as the sign problem of the quantum Monte Carlo technique. Conventional methods suitable for fault-tolerant quantum computing (FTQC) devices are designed for studying large-scale quantum many-body systems but require a large number of ancilla qubits and a deep quantum circuit with many basic gates, making them unsuitable for the early stage of the FTQC era, when the availability of qubits and quantum gates is limited. In this paper, we propose a method suitable for quantum devices in this early stage to calculate the thermal-equilibrium expectation value of an observable at finite temperatures. Our proposal, named the Markov chain Monte Carlo with sampled pairs of unitaries (MCMC-SPU) algorithm, involves sampling simple quantum circuits and generating the corresponding statistical ensembles. This approach addresses the issues of resource demand and the decay in probability associated with postselection of measurement outcomes on ancilla qubits. We validate our proposal with a numerical simulation of the one-dimensional transverse-field Ising model as an illustrative example.

TI Three-Party Controlled Authentication Semiquantum Key Agreement Protocol
   for Online Joint Consultation
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM ENGINEERING
AB In Wise Information Technology of Medicine, to ensure both confidentiality and integrity of the data created during online joint consultations, and to solve the problem that ordinary users cannot afford expensive quantum devices and are vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks during communication, this article proposes a three-party controlled authentication semiquantum key agreement protocol, leveraging the measurement retransmission operation and the entanglement properties of cluster states. With the help of a trusted controller with full quantum capabilities, the identities of three semiquantum parties are authenticated, and a shared key is negotiated fairly for subsequent communication. Since the semiquantum participants only need to perform simple quantum state preparation, measurement, and reflection operations, the protocol reduces the requirements for participants' capabilities and equipment. Moreover, the protocol prevents man-in-the-middle attacks by authenticating the identity of participants. The security evaluation demonstrates that the protocol is capable of effectively defending against both internal participant threats and external intrusions. Moreover, a comparison with existing semiquantum key agreement protocols reveals that this protocol offers certain advantages when its functionality and performance are comprehensively evaluated.

TI Quantum key distribution using unknown quantum states
SO AIP ADVANCES
AB This paper proposes a version of quantum key distribution (QKD) by leveraging unknown quantum states. The measurement made on the unknown quantum states is independent of them. As the number of copies of the unknown states increases, the key rate increases, and the disturbance caused by an eavesdropper also increases synchronously. If the unknown quantum states are orthogonal to each other, they cannot be completely distinguished. Our scheme is more efficient than the previous scenarios in QKD, where a set of known quantum states are leveraged. Our work offers a theoretical groundwork for constructing a highly effective QKD by exploiting unknown quantum states. (c) 2025 Author(s).

In the steady-state limit, we show that heat always flows from the measurement apparatus into the qubit regardless of the measured qubit state and derive lower and upper bounds for the heat current between the qubit and the measurement apparatus. Furthermore, we study the transient dynamics of the heat current and the excess heat during the transient regime.

TI Probabilistic channel distillation via indefinite causal order
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB The quantum switch has been widely studied as a prototypical example of indefinite causal order in quantum information processing. However, the potential advantages of utilizing more general forms of indefinite causal orders remain largely unexplored. We study higher-order switches, which involve concatenated applications of the quantum switch, and we demonstrate that they provide a strict advantage over the conventional quantum switch in the task of quantum channel distillation. Specifically, we show that higher-order quantum switches enable the probabilistic distillation of any qubit Pauli channel into the identity channel with nonzero probability. This capability contrasts with the conventional quantum switch, which allows only a limited set of Pauli channels to be distilled with nonzero probability. We observe that, counterintuitively, the distillation rate generally increases the noisier the channel is. We fully characterize the asymptotic distillation rates of higher-order superswitches for qubit Pauli channels. Finally, we prove a no-go result for multiqubit generalizations.

TI Fast Classical Simulation of Quantum Circuits via Parametric Rewriting

CY JUL 14-18, 2025
CL Varna, BULGARIA
AB The ZX-calculus is an algebraic formalism that allows quantum computations to be simplified via asmall number of simple graphical rewrite rules. Recently, it was shown that, when combined witha family of "sum-over-Cliffords" techniques, the ZX-calculus provides a powerful tool for classicalsimulation of quantum circuits. However, for several important classical simulation tasks, such ascomputing the probabilities associated with many measurement outcomes of a single quantum cir-cuit, this technique results in reductions over many very similar diagrams, where much of the samecomputational work is repeated. In this paper, we show that the majority of this work can be sharedacross branches, by developing reduction strategies that can be run parametrically on diagrams withboolean free parameters. As parameters only need to be fixed after the bulk of the simplificationwork is already done, we show that it is possible to perform the final stage of classical simulationquickly utilising a high degree of GPU parallelism. Using these methods, we demonstrate an averagespeedup factor of 78.3 +/- 10.2 for certain classical simulation tasks vs. the non-parametric approach

TI Quantum simulation of the Hubbard model on a graphene hexagon: strengths
   of IQPE and noise constraints
SO EPJ QUANTUM TECHNOLOGY
AB Quantum computing offers transformative potential for simulating real-world materials, providing a powerful platform to investigate complex quantum systems across quantum chemistry and condensed matter physics. In this work, we leverage this capability to simulate the Hubbard model on a six-site graphene hexagon using Qiskit, employing the Iterative Quantum Phase Estimation (IQPE) and adiabatic evolution algorithms to determine its ground-state properties. Our results show that a single Slater determinant is sufficient to initialize IQPE and accurately recover ground-state energies (GSEs) in small-scale Hubbard systems. In noiseless simulations, IQPE converges within a few iterations to exact GSEs, while adiabatic simulations yield charge and spin densities and correlation functions in excellent agreement with exact diagonalization. However, deploying IQPE and adiabatic evolution on today's noisy quantum hardware remains highly challenging. To investigate these limitations in IQPE, we use the Qiskit Aer simulator with a custom noise model tailored to the characteristics of IBM's real hardware. This model includes realistic depolarizing gate errors, thermal relaxation, and readout noise, allowing us to explore how these factors degrade simulation accuracy. Further, we implement the IQPE algorithm on IBM's ibm_strasbourg and ibm_fez devices for a reduced three-site Hubbard model, enabling direct comparison between simulated and real hardware noise. While ibm_fez runs closely match exact results, discrepancies highlight the gap between modeled and physical noise.

AB Combinatorial optimization models a vast range of industrial processes aiming at improving their efficiency. In general, solving this type of problem exactly is computationally intractable. Therefore, practitioners rely on heuristic solution approaches. Variational quantum algorithms are optimization heuristics that can be demonstrated with available quantum hardware. In this case study, we apply four variational quantum heuristics running on IBM's superconducting quantum processors to the job shop scheduling problem. Our problem optimizes a steel manufacturing process. A comparison on 5 qubits shows that the recent filtering variational quantum eigensolver (F-VQE) converges faster and samples the global optimum more frequently than the quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA), the standard variational quantum eigensolver (VQE), and variational quantum imaginary time evolution (VarQITE). Furthermore, F-VQE readily solves problem sizes of up to 23 qubits on hardware without error mitigation post processing.

TI Parametrized entanglement monotone
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Entanglement concurrence has been widely used for featuring entanglement in quantum experiments. As an entanglement monotone it is related to specific quantum Tsallis entropy. Our goal in this paper is to propose a parametrized bipartite entanglement monotone which is named as q-concurrence inspired by general Tsallis entropy. We derive an analytical lower bound for the q-concurrence of any bipartite quantum entanglement state by employing positive partial transposition criterion and realignment criterion, which shows an interesting relationship to the strong separability criteria. The parametrized entanglement monotone is used to characterize bipartite isotropic states. Finally, we provide a computational method to estimate the q-concurrence for any entanglement by superposing two bipartite pure states. It shows that the superposition operations can at most increase one ebit for the q-concurrence in the case that the two states being superposed are biorthogonal or one-sided orthogonal. These results reveal a series of phenomena about the entanglement, which may be interesting in quantum communication and quantum information processing.

TI Adapting the Harrow-Hassidim-Lloyd algorithm to quantum many-body theory
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Rapid progress in developing near-and long-term quantum algorithms for quantum chemistry has provided us with an impetus to move beyond traditional approaches and explore new ways to apply quantum computing to electronic structure calculations. In this work, we identify the connection between quantum many-body theory and a quantum linear solver, and implement the Harrow-Hassidim-Lloyd (HHL) algorithm to make precise predictions of correlation energies for light molecular systems via the (nonunitary) linearized coupled cluster theory, where the term "light molecular systems" refers to those molecules whose constituent atoms have low atomic number. For the purposes of practical computations, we make suitable changes to the HHL framework. This entails two aspects: (1) Adapt, prescribing a novel scaling approach that allows one to scale any arbitrary Hermitian matrix, A, that in turn dictates the controlled-rotation angles without having to precompute the eigenvalues of A, and yet achieve a reasonably high precision in |x), and (2) Lite, for which we devise techniques that reduce the depth of the relevant quantum circuit. In this context, we introduce the following variants of HHL for different eras of quantum computing: AdaptHHLite in its appropriate forms for noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ), late-NISQ, and the early fault-tolerant eras, as well as AdaptHHL for the fault-tolerant quantum computing era. We demonstrate the ability of the NISQ variant of AdaptHHLite to capture correlation energy precisely, while simultaneously being resource lean, using simulation as well as the 11-qubit IonQ quantum hardware.

TI A quantum neural network model for short term wind speed forecasting
   using weather data
SO ENERGY AND AI
AB The use of computational intelligence has become commonplace for accurate wind speed and energy forecasting, however the energy-intensive processes involved in training and tuning stands as a critical issue for the sustainability of AI models. Quantum computing emerges as a key player in addressing this concern, offering a quantum advantage that could potentially accelerate computations or, more significantly, reduce energy consumption. It is a matter of debate if purely quantum machine learning models, as they currently stand, are capable of competing with the classical state of the art on relevant problems. We investigate the efficacy of quantum neural networks (QNNs) for wind speed nowcasting, comparing them to a baseline Multilayer Perceptron (MLP). Utilizing meteorological data from Bahia, Brazil, we develop a QNN tailored for up to six hours ahead wind speed prediction. Our analysis reveals that the QNN demonstrates competitive performance compared to MLP. We evaluate models using RMSE, Pearson's R, and Factor of 2 metrics, emphasizing QNNs' promising generalization capabilities and robustness across various wind prediction scenarios. This study is a seminal work on the potential of QNNs in advancing renewable energy forecasting, advocating for further exploration of quantum machine learning in sustainable energy research.

TI Quantum imaging of biological organisms through spatial and polarization
   entanglement
SO SCIENCE ADVANCES
AB Quantum imaging holds potential benefits over classical imaging but has faced challenges such as poor signal-to-noise ratios, low resolvable pixel counts, difficulty in imaging biological organisms, and inability to quantify full birefringence properties. Here, we introduce quantum imaging by coincidence from entanglement (ICE), using spatially and polarization-entangled photon pairs to overcome these challenges. With spatial entanglement, ICE offers higher signal-to-noise ratios, greater resolvable pixel counts, and the ability to image biological organisms. With polarization entanglement, ICE provides quantitative quantum birefringence imaging capability, where both the phase retardation and the principal refractive index axis angle of an object can be remotely and instantly quantified without changing the polarization states of the photons incident on the object. Furthermore, ICE enables 25 times greater suppression of stray light than classical imaging. ICE has the potential to pave the way for quantum imaging in diverse fields, such as life sciences and remote sensing.

TI QCA: Quantum Computational Approach for Internet of Things with 5G
   Connectivity
SO INFORMATION
AB In this paper, the need for a quantum computing approach is analyzed for IoT applications using the 5G resource spectrum. Most of the IoT devices are connected for data transmission to end users with remote monitoring units, but there are no sufficient data storage units, and more data cannot be processed at minimized time periods. Hence, in the proposed method, quantum information processing protocols and quantum algorithms are integrated where data transmissions are maximized. Further, the system model is designed in such a way for checking the external influence factors that prevent the IoT device from transmitting data to end users. Therefore, with corresponding signal and noise power, it is essential to process the transmissions, thereby increasing data proportions at end connectivity. Once quantum computations are performed, then it is crucial to normalize IoT data units, thus establishing control over entire connected nodes that create a gateway for achieving maximum throughput. The combined system model is tested under four cases where the comparative outcomes prove that with reduced queue reductions of 12%, it is possible to achieve a maximum throughput of 99%.

TI Pneumonia detection by binary classification: classical, quantum, and
   hybrid approaches for support vector machine (SVM)
SO FRONTIERS IN COMPUTER SCIENCE
AB Early diagnosis of pneumonia is crucial to increase the chances of survival and reduce the recovery time of the patient. Chest X-ray images, the most widely used method in practice, are challenging to classify. Our aim is to develop a machine learning tool that can accurately classify images as belonging to normal or infected individuals. A support vector machine (SVM) is attractive because binary classification can be represented as an optimization problem, in particular as a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) model, which, in turn, maps naturally to an Ising model, thereby making annealing-classical, quantum, and hybrid-an attractive approach to explore. In this study, we offer a comparison between different methods: (1) a classical state-of-the-art implementation of SVM (LibSVM); (2) solving SVM with a classical solver (Gurobi), with and without decomposition; (3) solving SVM with simulated annealing; (4) solving SVM with quantum annealing (D-Wave); and (5) solving SVM using Graver Augmented Multi-seed Algorithm (GAMA). GAMA is tried with several different numbers of Graver elements and a number of seeds using both simulating annealing and quantum annealing. We found that simulated annealing and GAMA (with simulated annealing) are comparable, provide accurate results quickly, competitive with LibSVM, and superior to Gurobi and quantum annealing.

TI Controlling the charge-transfer dynamics of two-level systems around
   avoided crossings
SO JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS
AB Two-level quantum systems are fundamental physical models that continue to attract growing interest due to their crucial role as a building block of quantum technologies. The exact analytical solution of the dynamics of these systems is central to control theory and its applications, such as that to quantum computing. In this study, we reconsider the two-state charge transfer problem by extending and using a methodology developed to study (pseudo)spin systems in quantum electrodynamics contexts. This approach allows us to build a time evolution operator for the charge transfer system and to show new opportunities for the coherent control of the system dynamics, with a particular emphasis on the critical dynamic region around the transition state coordinate, where the avoided crossing of the energy levels occurs. We identify and propose possible experimental implementations of a class of rotations of the charge donor (or acceptor) that endow the electronic coupling matrix element with a time-dependent phase that can be employed to realize controllable coherent dynamics of the system across the avoided level crossing. The analogy of these rotations to reference frame rotations in generalized semiclassical Rabi models is discussed. We also show that the physical rotations in the charge-transfer systems can be performed so as to implement quantum gates relevant to quantum computing. From an exquisitely physical-mathematical viewpoint, our approach brings to light situations in which the time-dependent state of the system can be obtained without resorting to the special functions appearing in the Landau-Zener approach.

TI Direct Measurement of Atomic Entanglement via Cavity Photon Statistics
SO ANNALEN DER PHYSIK
AB An experimental scheme for the measurement of entanglement between two two-level atoms is proposed. This scheme requires one of the two entangled atoms to interact with a cavity field dispersively, and it is shown that by measuring the zero time-delay second-order coherence function of the cavity field, one can measure the concurrence of an arbitrary Bell-like atomic two-qubit state. As this scheme requires only one of the atoms to interact with the measured cavity, the entanglement quantification becomes independent of the location of the other atom. Therefore, this scheme can have important implications for entanglement quantification in distributed quantum systems.

TI Protected simultaneous quantum remote state preparation scheme by weak
   and reversal measurements in noisy environments
SO CHINESE PHYSICS B
AB We discuss a quantum remote state preparation protocol by which two parties, Alice and Candy, prepare a single-qubit and a two-qubit state, respectively, at the site of the receiver Bob. The single-qubit state is known to Alice while the two-qubit state which is a non-maximally entangled Bell state is known to Candy. The three parties are connected through a single entangled state which acts as a quantum channel. We first describe the protocol in the ideal case when the entangled channel under use is in a pure state. After that, we consider the effect of amplitude damping (AD) noise on the quantum channel and describe the protocol executed through the noisy channel. The decrement of the fidelity is shown to occur with the increment in the noise parameter. This is shown by numerical computation in specific examples of the states to be created. Finally, we show that it is possible to maintain the label of fidelity to some extent and hence to decrease the effect of noise by the application of weak and reversal measurements. We also present a scheme for the generation of the five-qubit entangled resource which we require as a quantum channel. The generation scheme is run on the IBMQ platform.

TI Quantum Algorithms in Electromagnetic Propagation Modelling for
   Telecommunications
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Modelling of electromagnetic wave propagation in telecommunications has evolved from empirical models to highly deterministic ray tracing and numerical methods. The extraordinary computational effort of these methods and their wave nature seem ideally suited to be approached by quantum algorithms. We first examine current progress by reviewing recent proposals in the field. We scrutinize potentially advantageous quantum architectures, ranging from mainstream gate-level computers and near-term, mid-scale noisy architectures with limited capabilities, to adiabatic and annealing approaches that are already in commercial use. We analyze the weaknesses and strengths of recent proposals. Beyond the core algorithm, mechanisms to bridge the quantum and classical worlds are of particular interest. Extremely diverse algorithm specifications, from those based on Hamiltonian simulations and emulation of variational optimization to the unconstrained binary formulation, are compared with the use of pure gate-level circuits and known quantum subroutines. We show that the graph Laplacian, given its ability to integrate boundary conditions, is uniquely suited for quantum propagation modelling algorithms rooted in differential numerical methods. Quantum computers could overcome the temporal and spatial limitations of classical methods for larger computational domains and, to some extent, address the problems of dispersion and stability in finite-difference approximations. The ability to express the solution of a problem as an eigenvalue problem turns out to be an advantage in the quantum world, where eigenvalues and eigenvectors are inextricably intertwined with quantum mechanics. In this paper, we identify the most promising techniques and scenarios that hold the greatest potential.

Due to these outstanding characteristics, UWBG materials are promising candidates to enable high-performance devices for power electronics, ultraviolet photonics, quantum sensing and quantum computing applications. Despite their great potential, the research of UWBG semiconductors is still at a nascent stage and represents a challenging interdisciplinary research area of physics, materials science and devices engineering.

TI Converting Fixed-Length Binary Strings Into Constant Weight Words:
   Application on Post-Quantum Cryptography
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON DEPENDABLE AND SECURE COMPUTING
AB This paper presents a new algorithm for encoding binary strings of fixed-length into a word of constant Hamming weight and constant length. The primary difference compared to previous publications is that the proposed algorithm can be directly applied to binary strings of fixed-length, without including a variable number of random bits needed to ensure the success of the encoding. The algorithm is useful for many post-quantum encryption schemes, in which a constant weight word is required. Additionally, a constant-time version of the algorithm is proposed, in order to mitigate information leakage vulnerabilities that could be exploited in potential timing attacks. An application based on a post-quantum Classic McEliece cryptosystem, using different security levels, is presented. Experimental results demonstrate the feasibility and correctness of our approach along with its advantages when compared with other solutions proposed in the past.

TI Stabilization of Qubit Relaxation Rates by Frequency Modulation
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB Temporal, spectral, and sample-to-sample fluctuations in coherence properties of qubits form an outstanding challenge for the development of upscaled fault-tolerant quantum computers. A ubiquitous source for these fluctuations in superconducting qubits is a set of atomic scale defects with a two-level structure. Here we propose a way to mitigate these fluctuations and stabilize the qubit performance. We show that frequency modulation of a qubit or, alternatively, of the two-level defects, leads to averaging of the qubit relaxation rate over a wide interval of frequencies.

TI Quantum random number generator using a cloud superconducting quantum
   computer based on source-independent protocol
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Quantum random number generator (QRNG) relies on the intrinsic randomness of quantum mechanics to produce true random numbers which are important in information processing tasks. Due to the presence of the superposition state, a quantum computer can be used as a true random number generator. However, in practice, the implementation of the quantum computer is subject to various noise sources, which affects the randomness of the generated random numbers. To solve this problem, we propose a scheme based on the quantum computer which is motivated by the source-independent QRNG scheme in optics. By using a method to estimate the upper bound of the superposition state preparation error, the scheme can provide certified randomness in the presence of readout errors. To increase the generation rate of random bits, we also provide a parameter optimization method with a finite data size. In addition, we experimentally demonstrate our scheme on the cloud superconducting quantum computers of IBM.

TI FQsun: A Configurable Wave Function-Based Quantum Emulator for
   Power-Efficient Quantum Simulations
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Quantum computers are promising powerful computers for solving complex problems, but access to real quantum hardware remains limited due to high costs. Although software simulators like Qiskit, ProjectQ, and Pennylane offer flexibility and support for many qubits, they struggle with high power consumption and limited processing speed, particularly as qubit counts increase. Accordingly, quantum emulators implemented on dedicated hardware, such as FPGAs and analog circuits, offer a promising path for addressing energy efficiency concerns. However, existing studies on hardware-based emulators still face challenges in terms of limited flexibility and lack of fidelity evaluation. To overcome these gaps, we propose FQsun, a wave function-based quantum emulator that enhances performance by integrating four key innovations: efficient memory organization, a configurable Quantum Gate Unit (QGU), optimized scheduling, and five number precisions implemented on the Xilinx ZCU102. Experimental results demonstrate high fidelity, low mean square error, and high normalized gate speed, particularly with 32-bit versions. Benchmarking on Random Quantum Circuits, Quantum Fourier Transform, and Parameter-Shift Rule reveals that FQsun achieves a superior power-delay product and precisely, outperforms software simulators on CPUs in the processing speed range.

TI Attention to quantum complexity
SO SCIENCE ADVANCES
AB The imminent era of error-corrected quantum computing demands robust methods to characterize quantum state complexity from limited, noisy measurements. We introduce the Quantum Attention Network (QuAN), a classical artificial intelligence (AI) framework leveraging attention mechanisms tailored for learning quantum complexity. Inspired by large language models, QuAN treats measurement snapshots as tokens while respecting permutation invariance. Combined with our parameter-efficient miniset self-attention block, this enables QuAN to access high-order moments of bit-string distributions and preferentially attend to less noisy snapshots. We test QuAN across three quantum simulation settings: driven hard-core Bose-Hubbard model, random quantum circuits, and toric code under coherent and incoherent noise. QuAN directly learns entanglement and state complexity growth from experimental computational basis measurements, including complexity growth in random circuits from noisy data. In regimes inaccessible to existing theory, QuAN unveils the complete phase diagram for noisy toric code data as a function of both noise types, highlighting AI's transformative potential for assisting quantum hardware.

TI QiBAM: Approximate Sub-String Index Search on Quantum Accelerators
   Applied to DNA Read Alignment
SO ELECTRONICS
AB With small-scale quantum processors transitioning from experimental physics labs to industrial products, these processors in a few years are expected to scale up and be more robust for efficiently computing important algorithms in various fields. In this paper, we propose a quantum algorithm to address the challenging field of data processing for genome sequence reconstruction. This research describes an architecture-aware implementation of a quantum algorithm for subsequence alignment. A new algorithm named QiBAM (quantum indexed bidirectional associative memory) is proposed, which uses approximate pattern-matching based on Hamming distances. QiBAM extends the Grover's search algorithm in two ways, allowing: (1) approximate matches needed for read errors in genomics, and (2) a distributed search for multiple solutions over the quantum encoding of DNA sequences. This approach gives a quadratic speedup over the classical algorithm. A full implementation of the algorithm is provided and verified using the OpenQL compiler and QX Simulator framework. Our implementation represents a first exploration towards a full-stack quantum accelerated genome sequencing pipeline design.

TI Simulation of optimal work extraction for quantum systems with work
   storage
SO CHINESE PHYSICS B
AB The capacity to extract work from a quantum heat machine is not only of practical value but also lies at the heart of understanding quantum thermodynamics. In this paper, we investigate optimal work extraction for quantum systems with work storage, where extracting work is completed by a unitary evolution on the composite system. We consider the physical requirement of energy conservation both strictly and on average. For both, we construct their corresponding unitaries and propose variational quantum algorithms for optimal work extraction. We show that maximal work extraction in general can be feasible when energy conservation is satisfied on average. We demonstrate with numeral simulations using a continuous-variable work storage. Our work show an implementation of a variational quantum computing approach for simulating work extraction in quantum systems.

TI Quantum properties of H → VV*: precise predictions in the SM and
   sensitivity to new physics
SO JOURNAL OF HIGH ENERGY PHYSICS
AB We study the quantum properties of the Higgs-boson decays into four fermions via two vector bosons (H -> VV* -> 4f). In particular, we focus on the case of two different-flavour lepton pairs (H -> ZZ* -> mu+mu-e+e-). We compute the quantum-information observables for the corresponding two-qutrit system (ZZ) at next-to-leading order electroweak (NLO EW) accuracy in the SM. We find that NLO EW corrections lead to giant (order 1) effects in some specific cases, significantly altering the extraction of observables quantifying the quantum correlations. We identify observables that are robust and can be used to extract reliable information. Finally, we discuss possible new physics (NP) effects, parametrised via an effective-field-theory approach. We show how quantum observables can increase the sensitivity to NP also for the process considered in this study.

TI Hard superconducting gap in germanium
SO COMMUNICATIONS MATERIALS
AB The difficulty in obtaining a superconducting gap free of subgap states has hindered progress with hybrid superconductor-semiconductor devices in germanium. Here, this challenge is addressed by using a germanosilicide parent superconductor to contact high mobility planar germanium, facilitating scalable quantum information processing.
   The co-integration of spin, superconducting, and topological systems is emerging as an exciting pathway for scalable and high-fidelity quantum information technology. High-mobility planar germanium is a front-runner semiconductor for building quantum processors with spin-qubits, but progress with hybrid superconductor-semiconductor devices is hindered by the difficulty in obtaining a superconducting hard gap, that is, a gap free of subgap states. Here, we address this challenge by developing a low-disorder, oxide-free interface between high-mobility planar germanium and a germanosilicide parent superconductor. This superconducting contact is formed by the thermally-activated solid phase reaction between a metal, platinum, and the Ge/SiGe semiconductor heterostructure. Electrical characterization reveals near-unity transparency in Josephson junctions and, importantly, a hard induced superconducting gap in quantum point contacts. Furthermore, we demonstrate phase control of a Josephson junction and study transport in a gated two-dimensional superconductor-semiconductor array towards scalable architectures. These results expand the quantum technology toolbox in germanium and provide new avenues for exploring monolithic superconductor-semiconductor quantum circuits towards scalable quantum information processing.

   circuits
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB We present a quantum circuit with measurements and postselection that exhibits a panoply of space- and/or time-ordered phases from ferromagnetic order to spin-density waves to time crystals. Unlike the time crystals that have been found in unitary models, those that occur here are incommensurate with the drive frequency. The period of the incommensurate time-crystal phase may be tuned by adjusting the circuit parameters. We demonstrate that the phases of our quantum circuit, including the inherently nonequilibrium dynamical ones, correspond to complex-temperature equilibrium phases of the exactly solvable square-lattice anisotropic Ising model.

SO QUANTUM INFORMATION PROCESSING
AB We report a set of monogamy constraints on one-tangle, two-tangles, three-tangles, and four-way correlations of a general four-qubit pure state. It is found that given a two-qubit marginal state p of a four-qubit pure state vertical bar Psi(4)>, the non-Hermitian matrix rho(rho) over tilde where (rho) over tilde= (sigma(y) circle times sigma(y)) rho* (sigma(y) circle times sigma(y)), contains information not only about the entanglement properties of the two-qubits in state rho but also about three-tangles involving the selected pair as well as four-way correlations of the pair of qubits in vertical bar Psi(4)>. To extract information about tangles of a four-qubit state vertical bar Psi(4)>, the coefficients in the characteristic polynomial of matrix rho(rho) over tilde are analytically expressed in terms of 2 x 2 matrices of state coefficients. Four-tangles distinguish between different types of entangled four-qubit pure states.

AB Quantum Computing is an emerging technology that combines the principles of computer science and quantum mechanics to solve computationally challenging problems significantly faster than classical computers. In this paper, we present a proof-of-principle procedure for generating hardware-executable quantum circuits for Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices that follows the paradigm of approximate computing.
   Our approach starts from the reference circuit and transforms it into an executable circuit with tuneable parameters by replacing the high-level quantum operations by approximate decompositions into hardware-native gates. An inner optimization loop over the rotation gates' angles ensures that the socreated circuit behaves in the same way as the reference one in terms of its expectation-value landscape. This technique is complemented by compiler-based optimizations to further reduce or aggregate gate groups of the optimized circuit. This three-step procedure is embedded into an outer genetic algorithm framework that inspects many different circuit designs with placements of single- and multi-qubit gates according to the hardware's lattice structure, and returns a set of approximate quantum circuits that can be executed on NISQ devices directly.
   We have validated our approach for superconducting quantum systems from IBM and Rigetti for various benchmark algorithms. In nearly all cases, our approach outperforms the vendors' quantum-compiler frameworks and produces significantly smaller circuits with up to 50% reduction in the number of gates.

TI Quantum Circuit for Imputation of Missing Data

In this work, we analyze a variational quantum circuit for the imputation of missing data. We construct variational quantum circuits with gates complexity O(N) and O(N-2) that return the last missing bit of a binary string for a specific distribution. We train and test the performance of the algorithms on a series of datasets finding good convergence of the results. Finally, we test the circuit for generalization to unseen data. For simple systems, we are able to describe the circuit analytically, making it possible to skip the tedious and unresolved problem of training the circuit with repetitive measurements. We find beforehand the optimal values of the parameters and make use of them to construct an optimal circuit suited to the generation of truly random data

In our second orthogonal contribution, we improve the costly Remote State Preparation protocols [Cojocaru et al. 2019; Gheorghiu and Vidick 2019] that can classically fake a quantum channel (this is at the heart of our NIZKoQS protocol) by showing how to create a multi-qubit state from a single superposition. Finally, we generalize these results to a multi-party setting and prove that multiple parties can anonymously distribute a GHZ state in such a way that only participants knowing a secret credential can share this state, which could have applications to quantum anonymous transmission, quantum secret sharing, quantum onion routing and more.

TI Estimating the randomness of quantum circuit ensembles up to 50 qubits
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Random quantum circuits have been utilized in the contexts of quantum supremacy demonstrations, variational quantum algorithms for chemistry and machine learning, and blackhole information. The ability of random circuits to approximate any random unitaries has consequences on their complexity, expressibility, and trainability. To study this property of random circuits, we develop numerical protocols for estimating the frame potential, the distance between a given ensemble and the exact randomness. Our tensor-network-based algorithm has polynomial complexity for shallow circuits and is high-performing using CPU and GPU parallelism. We study 1. local and parallel random circuits to verify the linear growth in complexity as stated by the Brown-Susskind conjecture, and; 2. hardware-efficient ansatze to shed light on its expressibility and the barren plateau problem in the context of variational algorithms. Our work shows that large-scale tensor network simulations could provide important hints toward open problems in quantum information science.

TI Analysis of Quantum Computing's Applicability in Data Analysis:
   Utilizing a Hybrid MCDM Approach With Quantum Spherical Fuzzy Sets
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Quantum computing offers transformative processing capabilities, particularly in data analysis. However, its adoption in developing countries like Vietnam faces significant barriers, such as financial constraints, infrastructural limitations, and skill shortages. This study aims to determine and analyze these barriers' impact weights and evaluate and rank potential solutions for overcoming the most critical barriers. This study proposes a multi-faceted approach integrating Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) methods, including the Delphi Method (DELPHI), Decision Making Trial And Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL), Combined Compromise Solution (COCOSO), Technique for Order Performance by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS), and the Multiplicative form of Multi-objective Optimization based on Ratio Analysis method (MULTIMOORA), alongside the Quantum Spherical Fuzzy (QSF) set analysis. This combination, especially integrating QSF DELPHI and QSF COCOSO models, represents a significant methodological contribution. Results indicate that Vietnam's primary barriers to quantum computing are limited infrastructure, high costs, and a lack of skilled workforce. Correspondingly, the most highly rated solution strategies are cost reduction initiatives, investment in infrastructure, and training and education programs, which should be prioritized and considered to remove potential barriers. These findings highlight the need to prioritize addressing issues in facilities, human resources, and financial resources. This research bridges theoretical insights with actionable recommendations, providing a comprehensive roadmap for mitigating barriers and promoting the integration of quantum computing into Vietnam's data analysis landscape.

TI Quantum W-Type Entanglement in Photonic Systems with Environmental
   Decoherence
SO SYMMETRY-BASEL
AB Preserving quantum entanglement in multipartite systems under environmental decoherence is a critical challenge for quantum information processing. In this work, we investigate the dynamics of W-type entanglement in a system of three photons, focusing on the effects of Markovian and non-Markovian decoherence regimes. Using the lower bound of concurrence (LBC) as a measure of entanglement, we analyze the time evolution of the LBC for photons initially prepared in a W state under the influence of dephasing noise. We explore the dependence of entanglement dynamics on system parameters such as the dephasing angle and refractive-index difference, alongside environmental spectral properties. Our results, obtained within experimentally feasible parameter ranges, reveal how the enhancement of entanglement preservation can be achieved in Markovian and non-Markovian regimes according to the system parameters. These findings provide valuable insights into the robustness of W-state entanglement in tripartite photonic systems and offer practical guidance for optimizing quantum protocols in noisy environments.

TI Hadamard-Free Circuits Expose the Structure of the Clifford Group
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION THEORY
AB The Clifford group plays a central role in quantum randomized benchmarking, quantum tomography, and error correction protocols. Here we study the structural properties of this group. We show that any Clifford operator can be uniquely written in the canonical form F1HSF2, where H is a layer of Hadamard gates, S is a permutation of qubits, and F-i are parameterized Hadamard-free circuits chosen from suitable subgroups of the Clifford group. Our canonical form provides a one-to-one correspondence between Clifford operators and layered quantum circuits. We report a polynomial-time algorithm for computing the canonical form. We employ this canonical form to generate a random uniformly distributed n-qubit Clifford operator in runtime O(n(2)). The number of random bits consumed by the algorithm matches the information-theoretic lower bound. A surprising connection is highlighted between random uniform Clifford operators and the Mallows distribution on the symmetric group. The variants of the canonical form, one with a short Hadamard-free part and one allowing a circuit depth 9n implementation of arbitrary Clifford unitaries in the Linear Nearest Neighbor architecture are also discussed. Finally, we study computational quantum advantage where a classical reversible linear circuit can be implemented more efficiently using Clifford gates, and show an explicit example where such an advantage takes place.

AB The ability to reliably distribute entanglement among the nodes of a network is an essential requirement for the development of effective quantum communication protocols and the realization of useful quantum networks. It has been demonstrated, in different contexts, that two remote systems can be entangled via local interactions with a carrier system that always remains in a separable state with respect to such distant particles. We develop a strategy for entanglement distribution via separable carriers that can be applied to any number of network nodes to achieve various entanglement distribution patterns. We show that our protocol results in multipartite entanglement, while the carrier mediating the process is always in a separable state with respect to the network. We provide examples showcasing the flexibility of our approach and propose a scheme of principle for the experimental demonstration of the protocol.

TI Construction method of hybrid quantum long-short termmemory neural
   network for image classification br
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB Long-short term memory (LSTM) neural network solves the problems of long-term dependence, gradientdisappearance and gradient explosion by introducing memory units, and is widely used in time series analysisand prediction. Combining quantum computing with LSTM neural network will help to improve itscomputational efficiency and reduce the number of model parameters, thus significantly improving theperformance of traditional LSTM neural network. This paper proposes a hybrid quantum LSTM (hybridquantum long-short term memory, HQLSTM) network model that can be used to realize the imageclassification. It uses variable quantum circuits to replace the nerve cells in the classical LSTM network torealize the memory function of the quantum network. At the same time, it introduces Choquet integral operatorto enhance the degree of aggregation between data. The memory cells in the HQLSTM network are composed ofmultiple variation quantum circuits (VQC) that can realize different functions. Each VQC consists of threeparts: the coding layer, which uses angle coding to reduce the complexity of network model design; the variationlayer, which is designed with quantum natural gradient optimization algorithm, so that the gradient descentdirection does not target specific parameters, thereby optimizing the parameter update process and improvingthe generalization and convergence speed of the network model; the measurement layer, which uses the Pauli Zgate to measure, and the expected value of the measurement result is input to the next layer to extract usefulinformation from the quantum circuit. The experimental results on the MNIST, FASHION-MNIST and CIFARdatasets show that the HQLSTM model achieves higher image classification accuracy and lower loss value thanthe classical LSTM model and quantum LSTM model. At the same time, the network space complexity ofHQLSTM and quantum LSTM are significantly reduced compared with the classical LSTM network

In this paper we present a hybrid, cloud-based reference architecture that lowers the entry barrier to start new experiments with a wide range of quantum compute resources. The solution facilitates the execution of distributed quantum computing simulations in traditional cloud environments, and also access to several remote quantum compute resources. The reference architecture is highly portable to various cloud platforms, resulting in efficient adaptation and application possibilities by research communities. The paper describes our related experiences using commercial cloud providers and on the federated, OpenStack-based research infrastructure of the Hungarian Research Network (abbreviated as HUN-REN).

TI A new non-commutative key exchange protocol on combinatorial semigroup
SO AUTOMATIKA
AB Since the launch of the post-quantum cryptography standardization project by NIST, post-quantum cryptography has become a prominent research area. Non-commutative cryptography constructed using NP-complete problems is widely regarded resistant to quantum computing attacks, so it has become an important branch of post-quantum cryptography. Nonetheless, the existing non-commutative cryptographic protocol still exhibits certain shortcomings. In this paper, a non-commutative combinatorial semigroup with matrix power function is constructed from a modified medial semigroup by the method of semidirect product, and then a key exchange protocol is developed on it to provide a kind of novel non-commutative cryptographic protocol. Due to the non-commutativity of cryptographic platform, the proposed protocol could perform well in respect of antiquantum computing attack, which is superior to traditional cryptographic protocol. In addition, the security analysis shows that the protocol has significant advantages in resisting algebraic and brute force attacks, as well as aganist quantum cryptanalysis; the complexity analysis demonstrates that computation and storage complexities are of polynomial order, ensuring efficient operation even for large matrix sizes.

AB Quantum computation is inevitably subject to imperfections in its implementation. These imperfections arise from various sources, including environmental noise at the hardware level and the introduction of approximate implementations by quantum algorithm designers, such as lower-depth computations. Given the significant advantage of relational logic in program reasoning and the importance of assessing the robustness of quantum programs between their ideal specifications and imperfect implementations, we design a proof system to verify the approximate relational properties of quantum programs. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by providing the first formal verification of the renowned low-depth approximation of the quantum Fourier transform. Furthermore, we validate the approximate correctness of the repeat-until-success algorithm. From the technical point of view, we develop approximate quantum coupling as a fundamental tool to study approximate relational reasoning for quantum programs, a novel generalization of the widely used approximate probabilistic coupling in probabilistic programs, answering a previously posed open question for projective predicates.

TI Circuit design for clique problem and its implementation on quantum
   computer
SO IET QUANTUM COMMUNICATION
AB Finding cliques in a graph has a wide range of applications due to its pattern matching ability. The k-clique problem, a subset of the clique problem, determines whether or not an arbitrary network has a clique of size k. Modern-day applications include a variation of the k-clique problem that lists all cliques of size k. However, the quantum implementation of such a variation of the k-clique problem has not been addressed yet. In this work, apart from the theoretical solution of such a k-clique problem, practical quantum-gate-based implementation has been addressed using Grover's algorithm. In a classicalquantum hybrid architecture, this approach is extended to build the circuit for the maximum clique problem. Our technique is generalised since the program automatically builds the circuit for any given undirected and unweighted graph and any chosen k. For a small k with regard to a big graph, the proposed solution to addressing the k-clique issue has shown a reduction in qubit cost and circuit depth when compared to the state-of-the-art approach. A framework is also presented for mapping the automated generated circuit for clique problems to quantum devices. Using IBM's Qiskit, an analysis of the experimental results is demonstrated.

TI Reference-Frame-Independent Mode-Pairing Quantum Key Distribution with
   Advantage Distillation
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB The coordination between distance and the secure key rate is one of the main challenges in the practical application of quantum key distribution (QKD). Mode-pairing quantum key distribution is one of the schemes that can surpass the secret key capacity for repeaterless QKD. However, the protocol utilizes phase to encode the information, which leads to the problem of active stabilization in the interferometer. In this paper, a reference-frame-independent mode-pairing quantum key distribution (RFI-MP-QKD) is proposed as an effective scheme to solve this problem. Moreover, the performance of the RFI-MP-QKD protocol is improved by applying the Advantage Distillation (AD) method in data post-processing, which separates the highly correlated raw key bits from the weakly correlated information. The simulation results show that the secure key rate of RFI-MP-QKD has almost no degradation for reference frame deviation angles of 0 degrees similar to 7 degrees. Compared to RFI-MP-QKD without AD method, the AD method decreases the quantum bit error rate from 0.04 to 0.012 and increases the maximum transmission distance from 406 to 450 km. The scheme proposed is expected to facilitate the practical implementation of RFI-MP-QKD, especially in cases of concerning reference frame alignment and high channel loss.

TI Quantum Algorithm for Variant Maximum Satisfiability
SO ENTROPY
AB In this paper, we proposed a novel quantum algorithm for the maximum satisfiability problem. Satisfiability (SAT) is to find the set of assignment values of input variables for the given Boolean function that evaluates this function as TRUE or prove that such satisfying values do not exist. For a POS SAT problem, we proposed a novel quantum algorithm for the maximum satisfiability (MAX-SAT), which returns the maximum number of OR terms that are satisfied for the SAT-unsatisfiable function, providing us with information on how far the given Boolean function is from the SAT satisfaction. We used Grover's algorithm with a new block called quantum counter in the oracle circuit. The proposed circuit can be adapted for various forms of satisfiability expressions and several satisfiability-like problems. Using the quantum counter and mirrors for SAT terms reduces the need for ancilla qubits and realizes a large Toffoli gate that is then not needed. Our circuit reduces the number of ancilla qubits for the terms T of the Boolean function from T of ancilla qubits to asymptotic to log(2 )T+1. We analyzed and compared the quantum cost of the traditional oracle design with our design which gives a low quantum cost.

TI Designing arbitrary single-axis rotations robust against perpendicular
   time-dependent noise
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB Low-frequency time-dependent noise is one of the main obstacles on the road toward a fully scalable quantum computer. The majority of solid-state qubit platforms, from superconducting circuits to spins in semiconductors, are greatly affected by 1/f noise. Among the different control techniques used to counteract noise effects on the system, dynamical decoupling sequences are one of the most effective. However, most dynamical decoupling sequences require unbounded and instantaneous pulses, which are unphysical and can only implement identity operations. Among methods that do restrict to bounded control fields, there remains a need for protocols that implement arbitrary gates with lab-ready control fields. In this work, we introduce a protocol to design bounded and continuous control fields that implement arbitrary single-axis rotations while shielding the system from low-frequency time-dependent noise perpendicular to the control axis. We show the versatility of our method by presenting a set of non-negative-only control pulses that are immediately applicable to quantum systems with constrained control, such as singlet-triplet spin qubits. Finally, we demonstrate the robustness of our control pulses against classical 1/f noise and noise modeled with a random quantum bath, showing that our pulses can even outperform ideal dynamical decoupling sequences.

TI Non-Markovian dynamics of a superconducting qubit in a phononic bandgap
SO NATURE PHYSICS
AB Reducing decoherence in quantum computers rapidly decreases the overhead needed to construct a logical qubit from physical qubits. In solid-state systems, a class of defects known as two-level systems is a major source of decoherence. Currently, superconducting qubit experiments reduce dissipation due to the two-level systems by using large device dimensions. However, this approach only provides partial protection and results in a trade-off between qubit size and dissipation. In this work, we instead engineer the interactions between a qubit and the surrounding two-level systems using phononics. We fabricate a superconducting qubit on a phononic-bandgap metamaterial that suppresses phonon emission mediated by the two-level systems. The phonon-engineered bath of two-level systems shows increased lifetime and affects the thermalization dynamics of the qubit. Within the phononic bandgap, we observe the emergence of a non-Markovian qubit behaviour. Combined with qubit miniaturization, our approach could substantially extend the qubit relaxation times.

TI Stable Single-Mode 795 nm Vertical-Cavity Surface-Emitting Laser for
   Quantum Sensing
SO MATERIALS
AB Vertical-cavity surface-emitting lasers (VCSELs) are essential for exhibiting single-transverse-mode output characteristics, which are critical for applications in quantum sensing, optical interconnection, and laser printing. In this study, we achieved stable single-transverse-mode lasing using extended-2 lambda-cavity with an oxide aperture diameter of 7.08 mu m. The device demonstrated a high output power of 6.8 mW and a narrow linewidth of 49.8 MHz at room temperature. Additionally, it maintained stable single-mode emission at 794.8 nm and achieved a side-mode suppression ratio (SMSR) exceeding 40 dB within the temperature range of 25 degrees C similar to 85 degrees C, thereby meeting the requirements of 87Rb atom quantum sensors. The fabricated device obtained high-power and narrow linewidth single-transverse-mode operation by a monolithic extended cavity without introducing additional processing procedures, which is expected to promote the commercial viability of VCSELs in quantum sensing.

This review considers how nanomaterials (i.e., materials with intrinsic quantum confinement) may offer inherent advantages over conventional materials for QISE. The materials challenges for specific types of qubits, along with how emerging nanomaterials may overcome these challenges, are identified. Challenges for and progress toward nanomaterials-based quantum devices are condidered.

TI Efficient quantum information probes of nonequilibrium quantum
   criticality
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Quantum information-based approaches, in particular the fidelity, have been flexible probes for phase boundaries of quantum matter. A major hurdle to a more widespread application of fidelity and other quantum information measures to strongly correlated quantum materials is the inaccessibility of the fidelity susceptibility to most state-of-the-art numerical methods. This is particularly apparent away from equilibrium where, at present, no general critical theory is available and many standard techniques fail. Motivated by the usefulness of quantum information-based measures we show that a widely accessible quantity, the single-particle affinity, is able to serve as a versatile instrument to identify phase transitions beyond Landau's paradigm. We demonstrate that it not only is able to signal previously identified nonequilibrium phase transitions but also has the potential to detect hitherto unknown phases in models of quantum matter far from equilibrium.

TI Neural-network-based qubit-environment characterization
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB The exact microscopic structure of the environments that produce 1/f noise in superconducting qubits remains largely unknown, hindering our ability to create robust simulations and harness the noise. In this paper we show how it is possible to infer information about such an environment based on a single measurement of the qubit coherence, circumventing any need for separate spectroscopy experiments. Similarly to other spectroscopic techniques, the qubit is used as a probe which interacts with its environment. The complexity of the relationship between the observed qubit dynamics and the impurities in the environment makes this problem ideal for machine learning methods-more specifically neural networks. With our algorithm we are able to reconstruct the parameters of the most prominent impurities in the environment, as well as differentiate between different environment models, paving the way towards a better understanding of 1/f noise in superconducting circuits.

TI A simple relation of guessing probability in quantum key distribution
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB Given a communication system using quantum key distribution (QKD), the receiver can be seen as one who tries to guess the sender's information just as potential eavesdroppers do. The receiver-eavesdropper similarity thus implies a simple relation in terms of guessing probability and correctness of sifted keys, related with the distance-based, information-theoretic security. The tolerable regions of error rates determined by such a guessing-probability-based relation are shown to be close to those determined by security criteria. Thus, an alternative perspective on applying guessing probability in analyzing QKD issues is here provided. Examples of two specific protocols are illustrated. Our results contribute to evaluating an important element in communication study, and may provide useful reference for the security analysis of QKD protocols.

TI Speeding up quantum perceptron via shortcuts to adiabaticity

AB The quantum perceptron is a fundamental building block for quantum machine learning. This is a multidisciplinary field that incorporates abilities of quantum computing, such as state superposition and entanglement, to classical machine learning schemes. Motivated by the techniques of shortcuts to adiabaticity, we propose a speed-up quantum perceptron where a control field on the perceptron is inversely engineered leading to a rapid nonlinear response with a sigmoid activation function. This results in faster overall perceptron performance compared to quasi-adiabatic protocols, as well as in enhanced robustness against imperfections in the controls.

TI Decentralization Using Quantum Blockchain: A Theoretical Analysis
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM ENGINEERING
AB Blockchain technology has been prominent recently due to its applications in cryptocurrency. Numerous decentralized blockchain applications have been possible due to blockchains' nature of distributed, secured, and peer-to-peer storage. One of its technical pillars is using public-key cryptography and hash functions, which promise a secure, pseudoanonymous, and distributed storage with nonrepudiation. This security is believed to be difficult to break with classical computational powers. However, recent advances in quantum computing have raised the possibility of breaking these algorithms with quantum computers, thus, threatening the blockchains' security. Quantum-resistant blockchains are being proposed as alternatives to resolve this issue. Some propose to replace traditional cryptography with postquantum cryptography-others base their approaches on quantum computer networks or quantum internets. Nonetheless, a new security infrastructure (e.g., access control/authentication) must be established before any of these could happen. This article provides a theoretical analysis of the quantum blockchain technologies that could be used for decentralized identity authentication. We put together a conceptual design for a quantum blockchain identity framework and give a review of the technical evidence. We investigate its essential components and feasibility, effectiveness, and limitations. Even though it currently has various limitations and challenges, we believe a decentralized perspective of quantum applications is noteworthy and likely.

TI Quantum computing with two independent control functions: Optimal
   solutions to the teleportation protocol
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB A central problem in quantum computing is the finding of an unknown target state that encodes the solution of a certain computational task. To accomplish this goal, the evolution from a given initial state is performed with an associated total Hamiltonian, which is a time-dependent combination of two time-independent Hamiltonians: the problem-Hamiltonian, whose ground state is the unknown target, and a driving-Hamiltonian, whose ground state is the initial state. Here, we analyze this computational problem in the light of optimal control theory, considering each Hamiltonian modulated by an independent control function. For bounded controls, there is a minimum total evolution time beyond which the target state can be exactly prepared. We show that below this minimum time a possible optimal solution consists of both controls constantly tuned at their upper bound, provided the gradients of the associated control Hamiltonian with respect to the controls (the switching functions) are positive. We refer to this type of solution as the double-bang solution. We show that the double-bang solution is optimal for a teleportation protocol up to the minimum time. Additionally, we combine the double-bang solution and the adiabatic gate teleportation protocol to implement universal quantum computing. This approach to quantum computing is very appealing because of its simplicity and experimental feasibility. To corroborate our analytical results, we propose the use of a numerical quantum optimal control technique adapted to limit the amplitude of the controls, which converges to the double-bang solution when the final evolution time is shorter than the minimum time. We compare the fidelity of the teleported state obtained for the numerically optimized two control functions with the usual one-control function scheme and with the quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA). We find that the two-control approach has a better performance than the other approaches. Moreover, we investigate the energetic cost and the robustness against systematic errors in the teleportation protocol, considering different schemes.

TI Field-based design of a resonant dielectric antenna for coherent
   spin-photon interfaces
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB We propose a field-based design for dielectric antennas to interface diamond color centers in dielectric membranes with a Gaussian propagating far field. This antenna design enables an efficient spin-photon interface with a Purcell factor exceeding 400 and a 93% mode overlap to a 0.4 numerical aperture far-field Gaussian mode. The antenna design with the back reflector is robust to fabrication imperfections, such as variations in the dimensions of the dielectric perturbations and the emitter dipole location. The field-based dielectric antenna design provides an efficient free-space interface for closely packed arrays of quantum memories for multiplexed quantum repeaters, arrayed quantum sensors, and modular quantum computers.

TI Dynamical scaling symmetry and asymptotic quantum correlations for
   time-dependent scalar fields
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
AB In time-independent quantum systems, entanglement entropy possesses an inherent scaling symmetry that the energy of the system does not have. The symmetry also assures that entropy divergence can be associated with the zero modes. We generalize this symmetry to time-dependent systems all the way from a coupled harmonic oscillator with a time-dependent frequency, to quantum scalar fields with time -dependent mass. We show that such systems have dynamical scaling symmetry that leaves the evolution of various measures of quantum correlations invariant; entanglement entropy, GS fidelity, the Loschmidt echo, and circuit complexity. Using this symmetry, we show that several quantum correlations are related at late times when the system develops instabilities. We then quantify such instabilities in terms of scrambling time and Lyapunov exponents. The delayed onset of exponential decay of the Loschmidt echo is found to be determined by the largest inverted mode in the system. On the other hand, a zero mode retains information about the system for a considerably longer time, finally resulting in a power-law decay of the Loschmidt echo. We extend the analysis to time-dependent massive scalar fields in (1 thorn 1)-dimensions and discuss the implications of zero modes and inverted modes occurring in the system at late times. We explicitly show the entropy scaling oscillates between the area-law and volume-law for a scalar field with stable modes or zero modes. We then provide a qualitative discussion of the above effects for scalar fields in cosmological and black hole spacetimes.

TI Variational quantum eigensolver approach to prime factorization on IBM's
   noisy intermediate scale quantum computer
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB This paper presents a hybrid quantum-classical approach to prime factorization. The proposed algorithm is based on the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE), which employs a classical optimizer to find the ground state of a given Hamiltonian. A numerical study is presented, evaluating the performance of the proposed method across various instances on both IBM's real quantum computer and its classical simulator. The results demonstrate that the method is capable of successfully factorizing numbers up to 253 on a real quantum computer and up to 1 048 561 on a classical simulator. These findings show the potential of the approach for practical applications on near-term quantum computers.

TI Quantum Volume in Practice: What Users Can Expect From NISQ Devices
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM ENGINEERING
AB Quantum volume (QV) has become the de-facto standard benchmark to quantify the capability of noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices. While QV values are often reported by NISQ providers for their systems, we perform our own series of QV calculations on 24 NISQ devices currently offered by IBM Q, IonQ, Rigetti, Oxford Quantum Circuits, and Quantinuum (formerly Honeywell). Our approach characterizes the performances that an advanced user of these NISQ devices can expect to achieve with a reasonable amount of optimization but without white-box access to the device. In particular, we compile QV circuits to standard gate sets of the vendor using compiler optimization routines where available, and we perform experiments across different qubit subsets. We find that running QV tests requires very significant compilation cycles, QV values achieved in our tests typically lag behind officially reported results and also depend significantly on the classical compilation effort invested.

AB The data representation in a machine-learning model strongly influences its performance. This becomes even more important for quantum machine learning models implemented on noisy intermediate scale quantum (NISQ) devices. Encoding high dimensional data into a quantum circuit for a NISQ device without any loss of information is not trivial and brings a lot of challenges. While simple encoding schemes (like single qubit rotational gates to encode high dimensional data) often lead to information loss within the circuit, complex encoding schemes with entanglement and data re-uploading lead to an increase in the encoding gate count. This is not well-suited for NISQ devices. This work proposes 'incremental data-uploading', a novel encoding pattern for high dimensional data that tackles these challenges. We spread the encoding gates for the feature vector of a given data point throughout the quantum circuit with parameterized gates in between them. This encoding pattern results in a better representation of data in the quantum circuit with a minimal pre-processing requirement. We show the efficiency of our encoding pattern on a classification task using the MNIST and Fashion-MNIST datasets, and compare different encoding methods via classification accuracy and the effective dimension of the model.

TI Improved analytical bounds on delivery times of long-distance
   entanglement
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB The ability to distribute high-quality entanglement between remote parties is a necessary primitive for many quantum communication applications. A large range of schemes for realizing the long-distance delivery of remote entanglement has been proposed, for both bipartite and multipartite entanglement. For assessing the viability of these schemes, knowledge of the time at which entanglement is delivered is crucial. Specifically, if the communication task requires multiple remote-entangled quantum states and these states are generated at different times by the scheme, the earlier states will need to wait and thus their quality will decrease while being stored in an (imperfect) memory. For the remote-entanglement delivery schemes which are closest to experimental reach, this time assessment is challenging, as they consist of nondeterministic components such as probabilistic entanglement swaps. For many such protocols even the average time at which entanglement can be distributed is not known exactly, in particular when they consist of feedback loops and forced restarts. In this work, we provide improved analytical bounds on the average and on the quantiles of the completion time of entanglement distribution protocols in the case that all network components have success probabilities lower bounded by a constant. A canonical example of such a protocol is a nested quantum repeater scheme which consists of heralded entanglement generation and entanglement swaps. For this scheme specifically, our results imply that a common approximation to the mean entanglement distribution time, the 3-over-2 formula, is in essence an upper bound to the real time. Our results rely on a novel connection with reliability theory.

TI Three-dimensional quantum imaging of dynamic targets using quantum
   compressed sensing
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Quantum imaging based on entangled light sources exhibits enhanced background resistance compared to conventional imaging techniques in low -light conditions. However, direct imaging of dynamic targets remains challenging due to the limited count rate of entangled photons. In this paper, we propose a quantum imaging method based on quantum compressed sensing that leverages the strong correlation characteristics of entangled photons and the randomness inherent in photon pair generation and detection. This approach enables the construction of a compressed sensing system capable of directly imaging high-speed dynamic targets. The results demonstrate that our system successfully achieves imaging of a target rotating at a frequency of 10 kHz, while maintaining an impressive data compression rate of 10-6. This proposed method introduces a pioneering approach for the practical implementation of quantum imaging in real -world scenarios.

TI Quantum-correlation-based free-space optical link with an active
   reflector
SO CURRENT APPLIED PHYSICS
AB We present a quantum-correlation-based free-space optical(FSO) link over 250 m using an outdoor active reflector 125 m from the transceiver station. The performance of free-space optical communication can be significantly degraded by atmospheric turbulence effects, such as beam wander and signal fluctuations. We used a 660 nm tracking laser to reduce atmospheric effects, by analyzing the fast beam wander and slow temporal beam drift, using this information to correct the quantum channel alignment of the 810 nm signal photons. In this work, the active reflector consisted of a mirror, a 6-axis hexapod stage, and a long-range wireless bridge. The slow drift of the beam path due to outdoor temperature changes was steered and controlled using wireless optical feedback between the receiver units and the active reflector. Our work provides useful knowledge for improved control of beam paths in outdoor conditions, which can be developed to ensure high quality quantum information transfer in real-world scenarios, such as an unmanned FSO link for urban quantum communication or retro-reflective quantum communication links.

TI QUANTUM VERSUS RANDOMIZED COMMUNICATION COMPLEXITY, WITH EFFICIENT
   PLAYERS
SO COMPUTATIONAL COMPLEXITY
AB We study a new type of separations between quantum and classical communication complexity, separations that are obtained using quantum protocols where all parties are efficient, in the sense that they can be implemented by small quantum circuits, with oracle access to their inputs. Our main result qualitatively matches the strongest known separation between quantum and classical communication complexity Gavinsky (2016) and is obtained using a quantum protocol where all parties are efficient. More precisely, we give an explicit partial Boolean function f over inputs of length N, such that:
   (1) f can be computed by a simultaneous-message quantum protocol with communication complexity polylog(N) (where at the beginning of the protocol Alice and Bob also have polylog(N) entangled EPR pairs).
   (2) Any classical randomized protocol for f, with any number of rounds, has communication complexity at least (Omega) over tilde (N-1/4).
   (3) All parties in the quantum protocol of Item (1) (Alice, Bob and the referee) can be implemented by quantum circuits of size polylog(N) (where Alice and Bob have oracle access to their inputs).
   Items (1), (2) qualitatively match the strongest known separation between quantum and classical communication complexity, proved by Gavinsky (2016). Item (3) is new. (Our result is incomparable to the one of Gavinsky. While he obtained a quantitatively better lower bound of Omega (N-1/2) in the classical case, the referee in his quantum protocol is inefficient).
   Exponential separations of quantum and classical communication complexity have been studied in numerous previous works, but to the best of our knowledge the efficiency of the parties in the quantum protocol has not been addressed, and in most previous separations the quantum parties seem to be inefficient. The only separations that we know of that have efficient quantum parties are the recent separations that are based on lifting Gobs et al. (2017), Chattopadhyay et al. (2019a). However, these separations seem to require quantum protocols with at least two rounds of communication, so they imply a separation of two-way quantum and classical communication complexity, but they do not give the stronger separations of simultaneous-message quantum communication complexity vs. two-way classical communication complexity (or even one-way quantum communication complexity vs. two-way classical communication complexity).
   Our proof technique is completely new, in the context of communication complexity, and is based on techniques from Raz & Tal (2019). Our function f is based on a lift of the FORRELATION problem, using XOR as a gadget.

By inserting the "temporal" scaling of the AdS metric by hand via the bulk Hamiltonian interaction strength, we recover a toy model with consistent causality structure. This leads to an interesting implication between two topics in quantum information: if position-based verification is secure against attacks with small entanglement then there are new fundamental lower bounds for resources required for one Hamiltonian to simulate another.

TI Measurement and Entanglement Phase Transitions in All-To-All Quantum
   Circuits, on Quantum Trees, and in Landau-Ginsburg Theory
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB A quantum many-body system whose dynamics includes local measurements at a nonzero rate can be in distinct dynamical phases, with differing entanglement properties. We introduce theoretical approaches to measurement-induced phase transitions (MPTs) and also to entanglement transitions in random tensor networks. Many of our results are for "all-to-all" quantum circuits with unitaries and measurements, in which any qubit can couple to any other, and related settings where some of the complications of low-dimensional models are reduced. We also propose field-theory descriptions for spatially local systems of any finite dimensionality. To build intuition, we first solve the simplest "minimal cut" toy model for entanglement dynamics in all-to-all circuits, finding scaling forms and exponents within this approximation. We then show that certain all-to-all measurement circuits allow exact results by exploiting local treelike structure in the circuit geometry. For this reason, we make a detour to give general universal results for entanglement phase transitions in a class of random tree tensor networks with bond dimension 2, making a connection with the classical theory of directed polymers on a tree. We then compare these results with numerics in all-to-all circuits, both for the MPT and for the simpler "forced-measurement phase transition" (FMPT). We characterize the two different phases in all-to-all circuits using observables that are sensitive to the amount of information that is propagated between the initial and final time. We demonstrate signatures of the two phases that can be understood from simple models. Finally we propose Landau-Ginsburg-Wilson-like field theories for the measurement phase transition, the forced-measurement phase transition, and for entanglement transitions in random tensor networks. This analysis shows a surprising difference between the measurement phase transition and the other cases. We discuss variants of the measurement problem with additional structure (for example free-fermion structure), and questions for the future.

TI Quantum algorithm for dynamic mode decomposition integrated with a

SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB We present a quantum algorithm that analyzes time series data simulated by a quantum differential equation solver. The proposed algorithm is a quantum version of a dynamic mode decomposition algorithm used in diverse fields such as fluid dynamics, molecular dynamics, and epidemiology. Our quantum algorithm can also compute matrix eigenvalues and eigenvectors by analyzing the corresponding linear dynamical system. Our algorithm handles a broad range of matrices, particularly those with complex eigenvalues. The complexity of our quantum algorithm is O (poly log N ) for an N-dimensional system. This is an exponential speedup over known classical algorithms with at least O ( N ) complexity. Thus, our quantum algorithm is expected to enable high-dimensional dynamical systems analysis and large matrix eigenvalue decomposition, intractable for classical computers.

TI Uncertainty relation and the constrained quadratic programming
SO PHYSICA SCRIPTA
AB The uncertainty relation is a fundamental concept in quantum theory, plays a pivotal role in various quantum information processing tasks. In this study, we explore the additive uncertainty relation pertaining to two or more observables, in terms of their variance, by utilizing the generalized Gell-Mann representation in qudit systems. We find that the tight state-independent lower bound of the variance sum can be characterized as a quadratic programming problem with nonlinear constraints in optimization theory. As illustrative examples, we derive analytical solutions for these quadratic programming problems in lower-dimensional systems, which align with the state-independent lower bounds. Additionally, we introduce a numerical algorithm tailored for solving these quadratic programming instances, highlighting its efficiency and accuracy. The advantage of our approach lies in its potential ability to simultaneously achieve the optimal value of the quadratic programming problem with nonlinear constraints but also precisely identify the extremal state where this optimal value is attained. This enables us to establish a tight state-independent lower bound for the sum of variances, and further identify the extremal state at which this lower bound is realized.

TI Detection of bidirectional system-environment information exchanges
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Quantum memory effects can be related to a bidirectional exchange of information between an open system and its environment, which in turn modifies the state and dynamical behavior of the last one. Nevertheless, non-Markovianity can also be induced by environments whose dynamics is not affected during the system evolution, implying the absence of any physical information exchange. An unsolved open problem in the formulation of quantum memory measures is the apparent impossibility of discerning between both paradigmatic cases. Here we present an operational scheme that, based on the outcomes of successive measurements processes performed over the system of interest, allows one to distinguish between both kinds of memory effects. The method accurately detects bidirectional information flows in diverse dissipative and dephasing non-Markovian open system dynamics.

TI Simulation and detection of the topological properties of phonon-photon
   in frequency-tunable optomechanical lattice
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB We propose a one-dimensional lattice theory scheme based on a coupled optomechanical system consisting of multiple cavity field modes and mechanical modes, where their frequencies can be tuned. In this system, by manipulating parameters to obtain collective dynamical evolution of the system, we study topological properties and topological quantum channels in the system. Firstly, the topological insulator properties and topological quantum channels of the system are studied by modulating the periodic coupling parameters of the system and analyzing the characteristics of the energy spectrum and edge states of the system. It is found that edge state distributions can exhibit flipping processes, which can be applied to quantum information processing. Secondly, based on the scattering theory of topological insulators and the relationship between input and output, the variation characteristics of the steady-state average photon number of the cavity field and the winding number of the reflection coefficient phase are analyzed. It is found that the dissipation of the cavity field has a certain influence on the locality of the distribution of the average photon number in the lattice, and it also indirectly explains the locality of the edge states of the system, and the topological invariants are detected by the winding number. In addition, considering the effect of disordered defects on topological properties, we further analyze their effects on the energy spectrum of the system, the winding number of the reflection coefficient phase and the average photon number of the cavity field. It is found that two defects in the system cause different physical effects, and when their values are small, the edge states of the system are robust to it, which also shows that the system has the characteristics of topological protection. However, when disorder and perturbation are larger than the energy gap, the topological properties of the system will be annihilated, so that the edge states will be indistinguishable, and the topological invariants will change at the same time. The research results of this system can be generalized to other types of models and can be applied to quantum communication and quantum information processing, which will have certain constructive suggestions for the development of future quantum technology.

TI Five Open Problems in Quantum Information Theory
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB We identify five selected open problems in the theory of quantum information, which are rather simple to formulate, are well studied in the literature, but are technically not easy. As these problems enjoy diverse mathematical connections, they offer a huge breakthrough potential. The first four concern existence of certain objects relevant for quantum information, namely a family of symmetric informationally complete generalized measurements in an infinite sequence of dimensions, mutually unbiased bases in dimension six, measurements saturating multiparameter Cramer-Rao bound and bound entangled states with negative partial transpose. The fifth problem requires checking whether a certain state of a two-ququart system is two-copy distillable.

TI Finite-key analysis of decoy model semi-quantum key distribution based
   on four-state protocol
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB Semi-quantum key distribution allows a full quantum user Alice and a classical user Bob to share a pair of security keys guaranteed by physical principles. Semi-quantum key distribution is proposed while verifying its robustness. Subsequently, its unconditional security of semi-quantum key distribution system is verified theoretically. In 2021, the feasibility of semi-quantum key distribution system based on mirror protocol was verified experimentally. However, the feasibility experimental system still uses the laser pulse with strong attenuation. It has been proved in the literature that the semi-quantum key distribution system still encounters the risk of secret key leakage under photon number splitting attack. Therefore, the actual security of key distribution can be further reasonably evaluated by introducing the temptation state and conducting the finite-key analysis in the key distribution process. In this work, for the model of adding one-decoy state only to Alice at the sending based on a four state semi-quantum key distribution system, the length of the security key in the case of finite-key is analyzed by using Hoeffding inequality, and then the formula of the security key rate is obtained. It is found in the numerical simulation that when the sample size is 10(5), the security key rate of 10(-4), which is close to the security key rate of the asymptotic limits, can be obtained in the case of close range. It is very important for the practical application of semi-quantum key distribution system.

TI Multiple electron spin resonance echoes observed for paramagnetic
   defects in diamond at room temperature
SO JOURNAL OF MAGNETIC RESONANCE OPEN
AB Magnetic resonance offers an invaluable testbed for observing and studying the fundamental concepts of quantum cavity interactions with two-level systems in the microwave regime. Typically, these experiments are conducted at low cryogenic temperatures, utilizing spin systems embedded within a high-quality (Q-factor) superconducting cavity. Recent studies indicate that under these conditions, especially in a high-cooperativity regime with strong collective coupling between an electron spin system and a microwave cavity, multiple spin echoes can be detected. These echoes are interpreted as manifestations of coherent quantum effects. To put it simply, photons within the cavity can excite the spin system, which subsequently can stimulate the cavity, creating a feedback loop. In our research, we demonstrate that a specially designed moderate-Q cavity, paired with diamond crystals rich in nitrogen vacancy (NV) centers, allows us to observe such nonlinear quantum phenomena, even at ambient temperatures. Crucially, our experimental design necessitates amplifying the net number of spins for a specific, limited spin concentration. This is achieved by lowering the spins' thermodynamic temperature (as opposed to their physical temperature) to a few kelvins. Notably, we find that maintaining high cooperativity or strong coupling is not essential for these observations. The potential to observe significant microwave cavity quantum effects at room temperature could be useful for future applications, such as quantum memories and quantum sensing.

TI Multiparameter Estimation with Two-Qubit Probes in Noisy Channels
SO ENTROPY
AB This work compares the performance of single- and two-qubit probes for estimating several phase rotations simultaneously under the action of different noisy channels. We compute the quantum limits for this simultaneous estimation using collective and individual measurements by evaluating the Holevo and Nagaoka-Hayashi Cramer-Rao bounds, respectively. Several quantum noise channels are considered, namely the decohering channel, the amplitude damping channel, and the phase damping channel. For each channel, we find the optimal single- and two-qubit probes. Where possible we demonstrate an explicit measurement strategy that saturates the appropriate bound and we investigate how closely the Holevo bound can be approached through collective measurements on multiple copies of the same probe. We find that under the action of the considered channels, two-qubit probes show enhanced parameter estimation capabilities over single-qubit probes for almost all non-identity channels, i.e., the achievable precision with a single-qubit probe degrades faster with increasing exposure to the noisy environment than that of the two-qubit probe. However, in sufficiently noisy channels, we show that it is possible for single-qubit probes to outperform maximally entangled two-qubit probes. This work shows that, in order to reach the ultimate precision limits allowed by quantum mechanics, entanglement is required in both the state preparation and state measurement stages. It is hoped the tutorial-esque nature of this paper will make it easily accessible.

TI Optimal supplier of single-error-type entanglement via coherent-state
   transmission
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Compared with entanglement with multiple types of noise, entanglement including only one type of error is a favorable fundamental resource not only for quantum communication but also for distributed quantum computation. We consider protocols that present single-error-type entanglement for distant qubits via coherent-state transmission over a lossy channel. Such a protocol is regarded as a subroutine to serve entanglement for larger protocol to yield a final output, such as ebits or pbits. In this paper, we provide a subroutine protocol which achieves the global optimal for typical jointly convex yield functions monotonically nondecreasing with respect to the singlet fraction, such as an arbitrary convex function of a singlet fraction, two-way distillable entanglement, and two-way distillable key. Entanglement generation based on remote nondestructive parity measurement protocol [K. Azuma et al., Phys. Rev. A 85, 062309 (2012)] is identified as such an optimal subroutine.

TI From quantum link models to D-theory: a resource efficient framework for
   the quantum simulation and computation of gauge theories
SO PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY A-MATHEMATICAL PHYSICAL
   AND ENGINEERING SCIENCES
AB Quantum link models provide an extension of Wilson's lattice gauge theory in which the link Hilbert space is finite-dimensional and corresponds to a representation of an embedding algebra. In contrast to Wilson's parallel transporters, quantum links are intrinsically quantum degrees of freedom. In D-theory, these discrete variables undergo dimensional reduction, thus giving rise to asymptotically free theories. In this way (1 + 1)-d CP(N - 1) models emerge by dimensional reduction from (2 + 1)-d SU(N) quantum spin ladders, the (2 + 1)-d confining U(1) gauge theory emerges from the Abelian Coulomb phase of a (3 + 1)-d quantum link model, and (3 + 1)-d QCD arises from a non-Abelian Coulomb phase of a (4 + 1)-d SU(3) quantum link model, with chiral quarks arising naturally as domain wall fermions. Thanks to their finite-dimensional Hilbert space and their economical mechanism of reaching the continuum limit by dimensional reduction, quantum link models provide a resource efficient framework for the quantum simulation and computation of gauge theories.

TI Steady-state dynamics and nonlocal correlations in thermoelectric Cooper
   pair splitters
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Recent experiments on Cooper pair splitters using superconductor-quantum dot hybrids have embarked on creating entanglement in the solid-state, by engineering the sub-gap processes in the superconducting region. Using the thermoelectric Cooper pair splitter setup [Nat. Comm., 12, 21, (2021)] as a prototype, we present a comprehensive analysis of the fundamental components of the observed transport signal, aiming to critically clarify the operating regimes and confirm the nonlocal and nonclassical nature of correlations arising from crossed Andreev processes. By making a nexus with quantum discord, we identify operating points of nonlocal quantum correlations in the CPS device-information that cannot be extracted from the transport signal alone. A notable consequence of our analysis is the finding that contact-induced level broadening of the quantum dot's discrete energy spectrum, along with its hybridization with the superconducting segment, can lead to shifted resonances in the crossed Andreev process as well as a parity reversal in the thermoelectric current. Our work thereby provides detailed insights into the gate voltage control of the quantum correlations in superconducting-hybrid Cooper pair splitters, revealing new avenues for harnessing quantum correlations in solid-state systems.

TI Bethe states on a quantum computer: success probability and correlation
   functions
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS A-MATHEMATICAL AND THEORETICAL
AB A probabilistic algorithm for preparing Bethe eigenstates of the spin-1/2 Heisenberg spin chain on a quantum computer has recently been found. We derive an exact formula for the success probability of this algorithm in terms of the Gaudin determinant, and we study its large-length limit. We demonstrate the feasibility of computing antiferromagnetic ground-state spin-spin correlation functions for short chains. However, the success probability decreases exponentially with the chain length, which precludes the computation of these correlation functions for chains of moderate length. Some conjectures for estimates of the Gaudin determinant are noted in an appendix.

These five different benchmark tasks display different resource requirements and scalability properties. We introduce a metric to evaluate the quality of the output of a tested quantum hardware, called distinguishability cost, defined as the minimal number of gates that a perfect quantum computer would have to run to certify that the output of the benchmarked hardware is incorrect.

TI Quantum circuits with SINIS structures
SO BEILSTEIN JOURNAL OF NANOTECHNOLOGY
AB The superconductor-insulator-normal metal-insulator-superconductor (SINIS) tunnel junction structure is the basic building block for various cryogenic devices. Microwave detectors, electron coolers, primary thermometers, and Aharonov-Bohm interferometers have been fabricated by various methods and measured at temperatures down to 100 mK. The manufacturing methods included Dolan-type shadow evaporation, Manhattan-type shadow evaporation, and magnetron sputtering with selective etching of superconducting and normal metal electrodes. Improvement in ultimate sensitivity is achieved by suspending the absorber above the substrate. Best responsivity of up to 30 electrons per photon at a frequency of 350 GHz, or 72000 A/W, and voltage responsivity up to 3.9 x 109 V/W were obtained with a black body radiation source and series of band-pass filters. The specially designed SINIS arrays are intended to detect 90 GHz radiation at the "Big Telescope Alt-azimuthal" (romanized Russian: "Bolshoi Teleskop Altazimutalnyi", BTA) with noise equivalent power of less than 10-16 W<middle dot>Hz-1/2. The receiver in a 3He cryostat with an optical window was mounted at the Nasmyth focus of the BTA and tested at a temperature of 260 mK with a IMPATT diode radiation source.

AB The Quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) is a leading hybrid classical-quantum algorithm for solving complex combinatorial optimization problems. QAOA-in-QAOA (QAOA(2)) uses a divide-and -conquer heuristic to solve large-scale Maximum Cut (MaxCut) problems, where many sub graph problems can be solved in parallel. In this work, an implementation of the QAOA2 method for the scalable solution of the MaxCut problem is presented, based on the Classiq platform. The framework is executed on an IIPE-Cray EX supercomputer by means of the Message Passing Interface (MPI) and the SLURM workload manager. The limits of the GoemansWilliamson (GIN') algorithm as a purely classical alternative to QAOA are investigated to understand if QAOA2 could benefit from solving certain sub-graphs classically. Results from largescale simulations of up to 33 qubits are presented, showing the advantage of QAOA in certain cases and the efficiency of the implementation, as well as the adequacy of the workflow in the preparation of real quantum devices. For the considered graphs, the best choice for the sub-graphs does not significantly improve results and is still outperformed by GIN.

Originally conceived as a theoretical manifestation of Maxwell's demon, QET has developed into a versatile tool for probing quantum correlations, diagnosing phase transitions, and powering emergent quantum thermodynamic technologies. This brief review provides a pedagogical introduction to the theoretical foundations and recent developments of QET, including quantum operations, entropic and fidelity-based bounds, and resource analyses involving quantum discord. Additionally, recent experimental realizations on superconducting quantum computers are revisited.

AB Deep learning is one of the most successful and far-reaching strategies used in machine learning today. However, the scale and utility of neural networks is still greatly limited by the current hardware used to train them. These concerns have become increasingly pressing as conventional computers are soon expected to approach the physical limitations that will slow their performance improvements in the near future. For these reasons, scientists have begun to explore alternative computing platforms, like quantum computers, for training neural networks. In recent years, variational quantum circuits have emerged as one of the most successful approaches to quantum deep learning on noisy intermediate scale quantum devices. We propose a hybrid quantum-classical neural network architecture where each neuron is a variational quantum circuit. We empirically analyze the performance of this hybrid neural network on a series of binary classification data sets using a simulated IBM universal quantum computer and a state-of-the-art IBM universal quantum computer. On the simulated hardware, we observe that the hybrid neural network achieves around 10% higher classification accuracy and 20% better minimization of the cost function than an individual variational quantum circuit. On the quantum hardware, we observe that each model only performs well when the qubit and gate count is sufficiently small.

TI Ising model formulation for highly accurate topological color codes
   decoding
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Quantum error correction is an essential ingredient for reliable quantum computation for theoretically provable quantum speedup. Topological color codes, one of the quantum error correction codes, have an advantage against the surface codes in that all Clifford gates can be implemented transversally. However, the hardness of decoding makes the color codes not suitable as the best candidate for experimentally feasible implementation of quantum error correction. Here we propose an Ising model formulation that enables highly accurate decoding of the color codes. In this formulation, we map stabilizer operators to classical spin variables to represent an error satisfying the syndrome. Then we construct an Ising Hamiltonian that counts the number of errors and formulate the decoding problem as an energy minimization problem of an Ising Hamiltonian, which is solved by simulated annealing. In numerical simulations on the (4.8.8) lattice, we find an error threshold of 10.36(5)% for bit-flip noise model, 18.47(5)% for depolarizing noise model, and 2.90(4)% for phenomenological noise model (bit-flip error is located on each of data and measurement qubits), all of which are higher than the thresholds of existing efficient decoding algorithms. Furthermore, we verify that the achieved logical error rates are almost optimal in the sense that they are almost the same as those obtained by exact optimizations by CPLEX with smaller decoding time in many cases. Since the decoding process has been a bottleneck for performance analysis, the proposed decoding method is useful for further exploration of the possibility of the topological color codes.

SO CHEMICAL SCIENCE
AB The multiexciton quintet state, (TT)-T-5, generated as a singlet fission intermediate in pairs of molecular chromophores, is a promising candidate as a qubit or qudit in future quantum information science schemes. In this work, we synthesize a pyrene-bridged parallel tetracene dimer, TPT, with an optimized interchromophore coupling strength to prevent the dissociation of (TT)-T-5 to two decorrelated triplet (T-1) states, which would contaminate the spin-state mixture. Long-lived and strongly spin-polarized pure (TT)-T-5 state population is observed via transient absorption spectroscopy and transient/pulsed electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy, and its lifetime is estimated to be >35 mu s, with the dephasing time (T-2) for the (TT)-T-5-based qubit measured to be 726 ns at 10 K. Direct relaxation from (TT)-T-1 to the ground state does diminish the overall excited state population, but the exclusive (TT)-T-5 population at large enough persistent density for pulsed echo determination of spin coherence time is consistent with recent theoretical models that predict such behavior for strict parallel chromophore alignment and large exchange coupling.

TI Evaluation of quantum contouring algorithms for treatment planning on MR
   abdominal images
SO FRONTIERS IN ONCOLOGY
AB Introduction Quantum computing is increasingly being investigated for integration into medical radiology and healthcare applications worldwide. Given its potential to enhance clinical care and medical research, there is growing interest in evaluating its practical applications in clinical workflows.Methods We developed an evaluation of quantum computing-based auto-contouring methods to introduce medical physicists to this emerging technology. We implemented existing quantum algorithms as prototypes tailored for specific quantum hardware, focusing on their application to auto-contouring in medical imaging. The evaluation was performed using a medical resonance imaging (MRI) abdominal dataset, comprising 102 patient scans.Results The quantum algorithms were applied to the dataset and assessed for their potential in auto-contouring tasks. One of the quantum-based auto contouring methods demonstrated conceptual feasibility, practical performance is still limited by current available quantum hardware and scalability constraints.Discussion Our findings suggest that while quantum computing for auto-contouring shows promise, it remains in its early stages. At present, artificial intelligence-based algorithms continue to be the preferred choice for auto-contouring in treatment planning due to their greater efficiency and accuracy. As quantum hardware and algorithms mature, their integration into clinical workflows may become more viable.

TI Dynamical mean field theory for real materials on a quantum computer
SO NPJ COMPUTATIONAL MATERIALS
AB Quantum computers (QC) could harbor the potential to significantly advance materials simulations, particularly at the atomistic scale involving strongly correlated fermionic systems, where an accurate description of quantum many-body effects scales unfavorably with size. While a full-scale treatment of condensed matter systems with currently available noisy quantum computers remains elusive, quantum embedding schemes like dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) allow the mapping of an effective, reduced subspace Hamiltonian to available devices to improve the accuracy of ab initio calculations such as density functional theory (DFT). Here, we report on the development of a hybrid quantum-classical DFT + DMFT simulation framework which relies on a quantum impurity solver based on the Lehmann representation of the impurity Green's function. Hardware experiments with up to 14 qubits on the IBM Quantum system are conducted, using advanced error mitigation methods and a novel calibration scheme for an improved zero-noise extrapolation to effectively reduce adverse effects from inherent noise on current quantum devices. We showcase the utility of our quantum DFT + DMFT workflow by assessing the correlation effects on the electronic structure of a real material, Ca2CuO2Cl2, which is mapped to an effective single-band Hubbard Hamiltonian and the subsequently derived Anderson impurity model solved with up to 6 bath sites on available quantum hardware. Further, we carefully benchmark our quantum results with respect to exact reference solutions and experimental spectroscopy measurements. While challenges remain to scale our approach to larger, multi-orbital and multi-site systems with more bath sites, the present work marks an important milestone towards achieving utility-scale quantum computation in materials simulation.

SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB The preparation of thermal equilibrium states is important for the simulation of condensed matter and cosmology systems using a quantum computer. We present a method to prepare such mixed states with unitary operators and demonstrate this technique experimentally using a gate-based quantum processor. Our method targets the generation of thermofield double states using a hybrid quantum-classical variational approach motivated by quantum-approximate optimization algorithms, without prior calculation of optimal variational parameters by numerical simulation. The fidelity of generated states to the thermal-equilibrium state smoothly varies from 99 to 75% between infinite and near-zero simulated temperature, in quantitative agreement with numerical simulations of the noisy quantum processor with error parameters drawn from experiment.

TI Qu8its for quantum simulations of lattice quantum chromodynamics
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
AB We explore the utility of d = 8 qudits, qu8its, for quantum simulations of the dynamics of 1 + 1D SU(3) lattice quantum chromodynamics, including a mapping for arbitrary number of flavors and lattice size and a reorganization of the Hamiltonian for efficient time evolution. Recent advances in parallel gate applications, along with the shorter application times of single-qudit operations compared with two-qudit operations, lead to significant projected advantages in quantum simulation fidelities and circuit depths using qu8its rather than qubits. The number of two-qudit entangling gates required for time evolution using qu8its is found to be more than a factor of 5 fewer than for qubits. We anticipate that the developments presented in this work will enable improved quantum simulations to be performed using emerging quantum hardware.

TI Toward the Quantum-Safe Web: Benchmarking Post-Quantum TLS
SO IEEE NETWORK
AB The transition to a quantum-resistant Internet is a complex process that depends on the integration of post-quantum cryptographic primitives into existing security protocols. This paper analyzes the impact that the primitives selected by NIST in their post-quantum cryptography competition has on a critical Internet security protocol, the TLS protocol. The analysis is facilitated by a framework that enables the implementation of an evaluation scenario in which different post-quantum primitives can be tested under identical conditions, ensuring a fair comparison. Our results indicate that the computational overhead introduced by current post-quantum standards in TLS is comparable to that of traditional algorithms, and even more efficient at high security levels. However, their significant impact on data transmission constrains the transition to a full-fledged quantum-safe web.

TI Exploratory factor analysis of a precollege quantum information science
   and technology survey: exploring career aspiration formation and student
   interest
SO EPJ QUANTUM TECHNOLOGY
AB The present study examined student outcomes from a quantum information science and technology (QIST) summer outreach program for U.S. secondary students. The program focused on foundational principles and skills from classical physics, quantum physics, and quantum computing. Students' attitudes towards QIST learning and careers were measured through a pretest/posttest research design. Exploratory factor analysis was utilized to identify latent attitudinal themes, followed by comparisons of means to measure changes in these factors and analysis of covariance to assess whether these changes were related to student demographics and prior academic coursework. Two latent themes were identified: (1) QIST career aspiration formation and self-concept, and (2) QIST interest and behavioral intentions. Results indicated that students improved their QIST career aspiration formation and self-concept with a medium to large effect size, yet their QIST interest and behavioral intentions were unchanged. These results were independent of student demographics (gender, ethnicity, grade level) and prior mathematics and computer science course enrollment; however, students who had previously taken chemistry and physics were more likely to improve QIST career aspiration formation and self-concept. Students also increased their intention to take four years of elective mathematics and science with a small effect size. These results suggest that early exposure to QIST principles, skills, and applications may increase students' consideration of related careers and academic coursetaking plans; however, their interest in QIST may be independent of career aspiration formation. Further research is needed to measure attitudinal sub-domains that may be influenced by early QIST education and specific programmatic elements.

TI Design Methodologies for Integrated Quantum Frequency Processors
SO JOURNAL OF LIGHTWAVE TECHNOLOGY
AB Frequency-encoded quantum information offers intriguing opportunities for quantum communications and networking, with the quantum frequency processor paradigm-based on electro-optic phase modulators and Fourier-transform pulse shapers-providing a path for scalable construction of quantum gates. Yet all experimental demonstrations to date have relied on discrete fiber-optic components that occupy significant physical space and impart appreciable loss. In this article, we introduce a model for the design of quantum frequency processors comprising microring resonator-based pulse shapers and integrated phase modulators. We estimate the performance of single and parallel frequency-bin Hadamard gates, finding high fidelity values that extend to frequency bins with relatively wide bandwidths. By incorporating multi-order filter designs as well, we explore the limits of tight frequency spacings, a regime extremely difficult to obtain in bulk optics. Overall, our model is general, simple to use, and extendable to other material platforms, providing a much-needed design tool for future frequency processors in integrated photonics.

TI Probing Spin Dynamics on Diamond Surfaces Using a Single Quantum Sensor
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Understanding the dynamics of a quantum bit's environment is essential for the realization of practical systems for quantum information processing and metrology. We use single nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond to study the dynamics of a disordered spin ensemble at the diamond surface. Specifically, we reduce the density of "dark" surface spins to interrogate their contribution to the decoherence of shallow NV center spin qubits. When the average surface spin spacing exceeds the NV center depth, we find that the surface spin contribution to the NV center free induction decay can be described by a stretched expo-nential with variable power n. We show that these observations are consistent with a model in which the spatial positions of the surface spins are fixed for each measurement, but some of them reconfigure between measurements. In particular, we observe a depth-dependent critical time associated with a dynamical tran-sition from Gaussian (n = 2) decay to n = 2/3, and show that this transition arises from the competition between the small decay contributions of many distant spins and strong coupling to a few proximal spins at the surface. These observations demonstrate the potential of a local sensor for understanding complex systems and elucidate pathways for improving and controlling spin qubits at the surface.

TI Sharp Finite Statistics for Quantum Key Distribution
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB The performance of quantum key distribution (QKD) heavily depends on statistical inference. For a broad class of protocols, the central statistical task is a random sampling problem, customarily addressed using a hypergeometric tail bound due to Serfling. Here, we provide an alternative solution for this task of unprecedented tightness among QKD security analyses. As a by-product, confidence intervals for the average of nonidentical Bernoulli parameters follow too. These naturally fit in statistical analyses of decoy-state QKD and also outperform standard tools. Last, we show that, in a vast parameter regime, the use of tail bounds is not enforced because the cumulative mass function of the hypergeometric distribution is accurately computable. This sharply decreases the minimum block sizes necessary for QKD, and reveals the tightness of our analytical bounds when moderate-to-large blocks are considered.

TI Near MDS and near quantum MDS codes via orthogonal arrays
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Near maximum distance separable (NMDS) codes are closely related to interesting objects in finite geometry and have nice applications in combinatorics and cryptography. But there are many unsolved problems about construction of NMDS codes. In this paper, by using symmetrical orthogonal arrays (OAs), we construct a lot of NMDS, m-MDS and almost extremal NMDS codes. Quantum error-correcting codes (QECCs) play a central role in quantum information processing and can protect quantum information from various quantum noises. We present a general method for constructing QECCs over mixed alphabets through asymmetrical OAs. Since quantum maximum distance separable (QMDS) codes over mixed alphabets with the dimension equal to one have not been found in all the literature so far, the definition of a near QMDS code over mixed alphabets is proposed. By using asymmetrical OAs, we obtain many such codes.

We propose a quantum observable Markov decision process planning algorithm for quantum circuit design. Our algorithm does not require state tomography, and hence has low readout sample complexity. Numerical simulations for entangled states preparation and energy minimization are demonstrated. The results show that the proposed method can be used to design quantum circuits to prepare the state and to minimize the energy.

TI A fast quantum algorithm for solving partial differential equations
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB The numerical solution of partial differential equations (PDEs) is essential in computational physics. Over the past few decades, various quantum-based methods have been developed to formulate and solve PDEs. Solving PDEs incurs high-time complexity for high-dimensional real-world problems, and using traditional methods becomes practically inefficient. This paper presents a fast hybrid classical-quantum paradigm based on successive over-relaxation (SOR) to accelerate solving PDEs. Using the discretization method, this approach reduces the PDE solution to solving a system of linear equations, which is then addressed using the block SOR method. The block SOR method is employed to address qubit limitations, where the entire system of linear equations is decomposed into smaller subsystems. These subsystems are iteratively solved block-wise using Advantage quantum computers developed by D-Wave Systems, and the solutions are subsequently combined to obtain the overall solution. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated by solving the heat equation for a square plate with fixed boundary temperatures and comparing the results with the best existing method. Experimental results show that the proposed method can accelerate the solution of high-dimensional PDEs by using a limited number of qubits up to 2 times the existing method.

TI Dimer states of Rydberg atoms on the Kagome lattice as resources for
   universal measurement-based quantum computation
SO AIP ADVANCES
AB We show that the quantum dimer state on the Kagome lattice, which was recently realized with high fidelity in a Rydberg quantum simulator [G. Semeghini et al., Science 374, 6572 (2021)], offers a sufficient resource for universal measurement-based quantum computations. In particular, we provide an efficient encoding of logical qubits in this state and give explicit measurement sequences that implement a universal set of gates on these qubits. Since the building blocks of the proposed measurements have already been experimentally implemented, our work highlights one possible path toward promoting Rydberg simulators to universal quantum computers relying on the measurement-based model of quantum computation with currently existing technology.

TI An Evaluation of Hardware-Efficient Quantum Neural Networks for Image
   Data Classification
SO ELECTRONICS
AB Quantum computing is expected to fundamentally change computer systems in the future. Recently, a new research topic of quantum computing is the hybrid quantum-classical approach for machine learning, in which a parameterized quantum circuit, also called quantum neural network (QNN), is optimized by a classical computer. This hybrid approach can have the benefits of both quantum computing and classical machine learning methods. In this early stage, it is of crucial importance to understand the new characteristics of quantum neural networks for different machine learning tasks. In this paper, we will study quantum neural networks for the task of classifying images, which are high-dimensional spatial data. In contrast to previous evaluations of low-dimensional or scalar data, we will investigate the impacts of practical encoding types, circuit depth, bias term, and readout on classification performance on the popular MNIST image dataset. Various interesting findings on learning behaviors of different QNNs are obtained through experimental results. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that considers various QNN aspects for image data.

TI Reducing circuit complexity in optical quantum computation using 3D
   architectures
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Integrated photonic architectures based on optical waveguides are one of the leading candidates for the future realisation of large-scale quantum computation. One of the central challenges in realising this goal is simultaneously minimising loss whilst maximising interferometric visibility within waveguide circuits. One approach is to reduce circuit complexity and depth. A major constraint in most planar waveguide systems is that beamsplitter transformations between distant optical modes require numerous intermediate SWAP operations to couple them into nearest neighbour proximity, each of which introduces loss and scattering. Here, we propose a 3D architecture which can significantly mitigate this problem by geometrically bypassing trivial intermediate operations. We demonstrate the viability of this concept by considering a worst-case 2D scenario, where we interfere the two most distant optical modes in a planar structure. Using femtosecond laser direct-writing technology we experimentally construct a 2D architecture to implement Hong-Ou-Mandel interference between its most distant modes, and a 3D one with corresponding physical dimensions, demonstrating significant improvement in both fidelity and efficiency in the latter case. In addition to improving fidelity and efficiency of individual non-adjacent beamsplitter operations, this approach provides an avenue for reducing the optical depth of circuits comprising complex arrays of beamsplitter operations.

TI Qubit-photon bound states in superconducting metamaterials
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB We study quantum features of electromagnetic radiation propagating in a one-dimensional superconducting quantum metamaterial composed of an infinite chain of charge qubits placed within two stripe massive superconducting resonators. The quantum-mechanical model is derived assuming weak fields and that, at low temperatures, each qubit is either unoccupied or occupied by a single Cooper pair. We demonstrate the emergence of two bands of single-photon qubit bound states with the energies lying outside the photon continuum???one is above and the second slightly below the linear photon band. The higher energy band varies slowly with the qubit-photon center of mass quasimomentum. It becomes practically flat provided that the electromagnetic energy is far below the Josephson energy when the latter is small compared to the charging energy. The dispersion of the lower band is practically identical to that of free photons. The emergence of bound states may cause radiation trapping indicating possible applicability for the control of photon transport in superconducting qubit-based artificial media.

TI Probing the topology of the two-photon bands via time-dependent quantum
   walks
SO OPTICS LETTERS
AB Topological protection of quantum correlations opens new horizons and opportunities in quantum technologies. A variety of topological effects has recently been observed in qubit networks. However, the experimental identification of the topological phase still remains challenging, especially in the entangled many-body case. Here, we propose an approach to independently probe single- and two-photon topological invariants from the time evolution of the two-photon state in a one-dimensional array of qubits. Extending the bulk-boundary correspondence to the two-photon scenario, we show that an appropriate choice of the initial state enables the retrieval of the topological invariant for the different types of the two-photon states in the interacting Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model. Our analysis of the Zak phase reveals additional facets of topological protection in the case of collapse of bound photon pairs. (C) 2021 Optical Society of America

SO NPJ COMPUTATIONAL MATERIALS
AB Computer-aided design of novel molecules and compounds is a challenging task that can be addressed with quantum computing (QC) owing to its notable advances in optimization and machine learning. Here, we use QC-assisted learning and optimization techniques implemented with near-term QC devices for molecular property prediction and generation tasks. The proposed probabilistic energy-based deep learning model trained in a generative manner facilitated by QC yields robust latent representations of molecules, while the proposed data-driven QC-based optimization framework performs guided navigation of the target chemical space by exploiting the structure-property relationships captured by the energy-based model. We demonstrate the viability of the proposed molecular design approach by generating several molecular candidates that satisfy specific property target requirements. The proposed QC-based methods exhibit an improved predictive performance while efficiently generating novel molecules that accurately fulfill target conditions and exemplify the potential of QC for automated molecular design, thus accentuating its utility.

TI Potential of the Path Integral and Quantum Computing for the Study of
   Humanities: An Underlying Principle of Human Evolution and the Function
   of Consciousness
SO GLOBAL PERSPECTIVES
AB The "(classical) scientific view of the world" that characterizes the modern history of human civilization has been successful by objectifying nature, humans, and society, for reductive analysis into (approximate) linear causation to allow prediction and control. However, because of its growing maturity and complexity, our modern society now confronts the complexity of multilayered causal structures underlying the real phenomena, which classical science has abstracted through reductive approximation, and consequently, modern scientists are perplexed by the limitations on comprehension, predictability, and controllability. The "uncertainty principle" of quantum physics, discovered a century ago, has overthrown this classical mechanistic and deterministic worldview, but the "(quantum) scientific worldview" remained confined at the level of microscopic science and has to date never extended onward to the life-size human world. However, as practical applications of the quantum computer are now becoming realistic, it might provide us with an innovative way to manipulate such complex causal structures and open up a new era in the history of civilization. In this paper, we build ideas on our earlier research findings in the context of the evolutionary patterns of human cognition, so as to extrapolate them to advance speculations on the mechanism of the phase transition of worldviews from classical to quantum causal structure-based ones, expecting to obtain insights into practical ways of computation to realize such a transition. The paper begins with a section examining the origin of the linear approximation adopted in classical science, back casting from the evolutionary history of the (linguistic) consciousness of our human ancestors. In the next section, we show how human intelligence and civilization have in fact evolved as analog with quantum laws, and review the limitations of modern science in finding an expression of these laws in Eastern philosophy. This section proceeds to show the potential of quantum computation to not only realize a fusion of Eastern and Western approaches but also integrate the humanities and natural sciences. The final section concludes that this new framework can expand and develop the structure and function of human "consciousness" and build a bridgehead against recent "anti-scientism" that is rooted in skepticism concerning the (classical) scientific view of the world and humanity.

TI Full qubit control of the double quantum transition in NV centers for
   low-field or high-frequency sensing
SO EPJ QUANTUM TECHNOLOGY
AB We present a scheme for the implementation of fast arbitrary qubit gates in the ground state of the negatively charged nitrogen-vacancy (NV) defect in diamond. The protocol is especially useful for sensing in two regimes: on the one hand, in the low-field limit where the Zeeman splitting of the NV-center is smaller than the MW Rabi frequency; on the other hand, for the detection of high-frequency signals, comparable to the Zeeman splitting of the NV center. It constitutes an extension to the NV-ERC technique, which has demonstrated efficient initialization and readout of the double quantum transition with no leakage to any third level thanks to an effective Raman coupling. Here we derive a full theoretical framework of the scheme, identifying the complete unitary associated to the approach, and more specifically the relevant basis transformation for each of two characteristic pulse durations. Based on this insight, we propose a scheme to perform fast single qubit gates in the double quantum transition. We study its robustness with respect to pulse-timing errors resulting from faulty identification of system parameters or phase-control limitations. We finally demonstrate that the technique can also be implemented in the presence of unknown electric or strain fields and numerically test its effectiveness in a Hahn echo sequence in the high-frequency or low-field regime.

TI Quaternary Reversible Circuit Optimization for Scalable Multiplexer and
   Demultiplexer
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Information loss is generally related to power consumption. Therefore, reducing information loss is an interesting challenge in designing digital systems. Quaternary reversible circuits have received significant attention due to their low-power design applications and attractive advantages over binary reversible logic. Multiplexer and demultiplexer circuits are crucial parts of computing circuits in ALU, and their efficient design can significantly affect the processors' performance. A new scalable realization of quaternary reversible 4 x 1 multiplexer and 1 x 4 demultiplexer, based on quaternary 1-qudit Shift, 3-qudit Controlled Feynman, and 2-qudit Muthukrishnan-Stroud gates, is presented in this paper. Moreover, the corresponding generalized quaternary reversible n x 1 multiplexer and 1 x n demultiplexer circuits are proposed. The comparison, with respect to the current literature, shows that the proposed circuits are more efficient in terms of quantum cost, the number of garbage outputs, and the number of constant inputs.

TI Hybrid classical and quantum computing for enhanced glioma tumor
   classification using TCGA data
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Gliomas are the most prevalent malignant primary brain tumors and present diagnostic challenges due to varying survival rates and treatment responses between low-grade gliomas (LGGs) and high-grade gliomas (HGGs). Accurate classification is crucial for effective treatment and prognosis. While classical AI methods have shown promise in glioma classification, the growing volume of medical data, inherent noise, and limitations of classical vector spaces present significant challenges. However, quantum computing-based AI methods have the potential to process data in parallel by leveraging quantum properties such as superposition and entanglement, analyze higher-dimensional data more efficiently, and solve certain problems that classical methods struggle with more rapidly and effectively. This study introduces a novel hybrid classical and quantum computing model to distinguish LGGs from HGGs using data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). In the classical part, an ensemble feature selection method was employed to identify the most informative molecular markers and clinical features in the TCGA. In the quantum component, six variational quantum classifier (VQC) models with varying hyperparameters were evaluated. These classifiers utilize selected features to differentiate LGGs from HGGs. Among these, the VQC-1 model, which employs \documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$\:{R}_{x}$$\end{document} and CX gates in the feature map and \documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$\:{\:R}_{y},$$\end{document}\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$\:{R}_{z}$$\end{document} and CY gates in the parameterized quantum circuit, achieved the highest classification accuracy of 0.74 using the AQCD optimization method. Additionally, VQC-1 identified IDH1, age at diagnosis, PTEN, EGFR, and ATRX, in descending order of importance, as the most informative features distinguishing LGGs from HGGs. Compared to classical machine learning models, VQC-1 demonstrated performance comparable to that of XGBoost and GBM, while outperformed KNN, SVC, DTC, and RFC in five-fold cross-validation experiments. This study provides a novel perspective on glioma classification by integrating classical and quantum computing, offering valuable insights into hybrid computational approaches.

TI Interplay between polarization and quantum correlations of confined
   polaritons
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB We investigate polariton quantum correlations in a coherently driven box cavity in the low driving regime, with a particular focus on accounting for the polarization degree of freedom. The possibility of having different interaction strengths between co- and cross-circularly polarized polaritons as well as a realistic linear-polarization splitting allows one to model the system as two coupled nonlinear resonators with both self- and cross-Kerr-like nonlinearities, thus making our results potentially relevant for other experimental platforms. Within an effective wave-function approach, we obtain analytical expressions for the steady-state polarization-resolved polariton populations and second-order correlation functions, which agree very well with our numerical results obtained from a Lindblad master equation. Notably, we highlight that depending on the excitation polarization (circular or linear), both the unconventional (interference-mediated) and conventional (mediated by nonlinearities) antibunchings can be investigated in a single cavity. Moreover, using our results, we argue that recent experiments on confined fiber-cavity polaritons are likely to have probed a regime where the dominant interaction is between cross-polarized polaritons, which is characteristic of the polariton Feshbach resonance. We furthermore investigate the regime close to resonance using a two-channel model and we show that systems with large biexciton binding energies, such as atomically thin semiconductors, are promising platforms for realizing strong polariton antibunching.

AB Integrated photonics represents a technology that could greatly improve quantum communication networks in terms of cost, size, scaling, and robustness. A key benchmark for this is to demonstrate their performance in complex quantum networking protocols, such as entanglement swapping between truly independent photon-pair sources. Here, using two independent, asynchronously-pumped, integrated Si3N4 microring resonator photon-pair sources, operating in the continuous-wave regime with time-resolved detections, we obtained state of the art Hong-Ou-Mandel (93.2 +/- 1.6%) and entanglement swapping (91.2 +/- 3.4%) visibilities, while maintaining high rates. The time-resolved detection facilitates high spectral purities without the need for spectral filtering. Our results demonstrate the potential of such telecom-band sources for practical, real-world quantum communication.

TI Estimating the link budget of satellite-based Quantum Key Distribution
   (QKD) for uplink transmission through the atmosphere
SO EPJ QUANTUM TECHNOLOGY
AB Satellite-based quantum communications including quantum key distribution (QKD) represent one of the most promising approaches toward global-scale quantum communications. To determine the viability of transmitting quantum signals through the atmosphere, it is essential to conduct atmospheric simulations for both uplink and downlink quantum communications. In the case of the uplink scenario, the initial phase of the beam's propagation involves interaction with the atmosphere, making simulation particularly critical. To analyze the atmosphere over the Indian subcontinent, we begin by validating our approach by utilizing atmospheric data obtained from the experiments carried out in the Canary Islands within the framework of Quantum Communication (QC). We also verify our simulation methodology by reproducing simulation outcomes from diverse Canadian locations, taking into account both uplink and downlink scenarios in Low Earth Orbit (LEO). In this manuscript, we explore the practicality of utilizing three different ground station locations in India for uplink-based QC, while also considering beacon signals for both uplink and downlink scenarios. The atmospheric conditions of various geographical regions in India are simulated, and a dedicated link budget analysis is performed for each location, specifically focusing on three renowned observatories: IAO Hanle, Aries Nainital, and Mount Abu. The analysis involves computing the overall losses of the signal and beacon beams. The findings indicate that the IAO Hanle site is a more suitable choice for uplink-based QC when compared to the other two sites.

AB Cybersecurity of control systems is an important issue in next-generation manufacturing that can impact both operational objectives (safety and performance) as well as process designs (via hazard analysis). Cyberattacks differ from faults in that they can be coordinated efforts to exploit system vulnerabilities to create otherwise unlikely hazard scenarios. Because coordination and targeted process manipulation can be characteristics of attacks, some of the tactics previously analyzed in our group from a control system cybersecurity perspective have incorporated randomness to attempt to thwart attacks. The underlying assumption for the generation of this randomness has been that it can be achieved on a classical computer; however, quantum computers can also create random behavior in the results of computations. This work explores how errors in quantum hardware that can create non-deterministic outputs from quantum computers interact with control system cybersecurity. These studies serve as a reminder of the need to incorporate cybersecurity considerations at the process design stage. Copyright (C) 2022 The Authors.

TI Virtual Quantum Key Distribution Network Ecosystem: The National Czech
   QKD Network
SO IEEE NETWORK
AB Network emulators are essential in testing network systems, applications, and protocols. Emulators bridge the gap between simulation setups that lack realism in results and real-world trials that are accurate but often expensive, non-reproducible, and uncontrollable. This paper describes the simulations and emulations of the national Czech QKD network. Using emulation techniques, a unique ecosystem is formed that includes the processes of generating, processing, storing, and consuming cryptographic keys. The presented tool will undoubtedly spur future development, understanding, and teaching, and it is critical for testing novel applications and protocols applied to QKD networks.

TI 6G-enabled qubit-based concealed communication with AI-driven breach
   detection in autonomous fleets
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) rely on secure neighbors and proactive infrastructures for robust communications. The heterogeneous communication scenario exploits concealed media for secure information exchange. Concealed communications assist precise navigation, information exchange, object detection, etc. In this process, the end-to-end computations are complex in converting a vehicle communication stream to an encrypted stream. This article introduces a Secure Module for Concealed Navigation Communication (SM-CNC) in AV environments. The information identified is transmitted by attaching volatile authentication that disintegrates if a communication source (vehicle or access point, etc.) is intercepted. Contrarily, the information is dropped in the communication medium if adverse or unauthorized vehicles intercept. This process is monitored during the relaying and end-to-end validation processes. The proposed secure module relies on quantum computing and recurrent learning for multiple recommendations from the information relay points. The information points are modeled as qubits for low-complex processing to administer security and ensure reliable communication. This prevents security breaches in the concealed medium through authentication failures and unauthorized access detection based on vehicle information allocated to individual qubits. The learning paradigm analyzes the qubits for their availability for secure information exchange throughout the navigation. The performance of the proposed module is verified using the metrics of communication failure, complexity, and authentication rate. The proposed secure module improves the authentication rate by 9.29% and reduces the communication failure and computation complexity by 11.87% and 12.13% respectively, for the maximum communication requests/ interval.

TI Improving Josephson junction reproducibility for superconducting quantum
   circuits: junction area fluctuation
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Josephson superconducting qubits and parametric amplifiers are prominent examples of superconducting quantum circuits that have shown rapid progress in recent years. As such devices become more complex, the requirements for reproducibility of their electrical properties across a chip are being tightened. Critical current of the Josephson junction Ic is the essential electrical parameter in a chip. So, its variation is to be minimized. According to the Ambegaokar-Baratoff formula, critical current is related to normal-state resistance, which can be measured at room temperature. In this study, we focused on the dominant source of non-uniformity for the Josephson junction critical current-junction area variation. We optimized Josephson junction fabrication process and demonstrated resistance variation of 9.8-4.4% and 4.8-2.3% across 22 x 22 mm(2) and 5 x 10 mm(2) chip areas, respectively. For a wide range of junction areas from 0.008 to 0.12 mu m2, we ensure a small linewidth standard deviation of 4 nm measured over 4500 junctions with linear dimensions from 80 to 680 nm. We found that the dominate source of junction area variation limiting I-c reproducibility is the imperfection of the evaporation system. The developed fabrication process was tested on superconducting highly coherent transmon qubits (T1 > 100 mu s) and a nonlinear asymmetric inductive element parametric amplifier.

TI Universality of the cross-entropy in Z2 symmetric monitored quantum
   circuits
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB The linear cross-entropy (LXE) has been recently proposed as a scalable probe of the measurement-driven phase transition between volume- and area-law-entangled phases of pure-state trajectories in certain monitored quantum circuits. Here, we demonstrate that the LXE can distinguish distinct area-law-entangled phases of monitored circuits with symmetries, and extract universal behavior at the critical points separating these phases. We focus on (1+1)-dimensional monitored circuits with an onsite Z2 symmetry. For an appropriate choice of initial states, the LXE distinguishes the area-law-entangled spin-glass and paramagnetic phases of the monitored trajectories. At the critical point, described by two-dimensional percolation, the LXE exhibits universal behavior which depends sensitively on boundary conditions, and the choice of initial state. With open boundary conditions, we show that the LXE relates to crossing probabilities in critical percolation, and is thus given by a known universal function of the aspect ratio of the dynamics, which quantitatively agrees with numerical studies of the LXE at criticality. The LXE probes correlations of other operators in percolation with periodic boundary conditions. We show that the LXE is sensitive to the richer phase diagram of the circuit model in the presence of symmetric unitary gates. Last, we consider the effect of noise during the circuit evolution, and propose potential solutions to counter it.

TI Enhancing the performance of coupled quantum Otto thermal machines
   without entanglement and quantum correlations
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS B-ATOMIC MOLECULAR AND OPTICAL PHYSICS
AB We start with a revision study of two coupled spin-1/2 under the influence of Kaplan-Shekhtman-Entin-Wohlman-Aharony interaction and a magnetic field. We first show the role of idle levels, i.e. levels that do not couple to the external magnetic field, when the system is working as a heat engine as well as when it is a refrigerator. Then we extend the results reported in Altintas and Mustecapliog?lu (2015 Phys. Rev. E 92 022142) by showing that it is not necessary to change both the magnetic field as well as the coupling parameters to break the extensive property of the work extracted globally from two coupled spin-1/2 as has been demonstrated there. Then we study the role of increasing the number of coupled spins on efficiency, extractable work, and coefficient of performance (COP). First, we consider two-and three-coupled spin-1/2 Heisenberg XXX-chain. We prove that the latter can outperform the former in terms of efficiency, extractable work, and COP. Then we consider the Ising model, where the number of interacting spins ranges from two to six. We show that only when the number of interacting spins is odd the system can work as a heat engine in the strong coupling regime. The enhancements in efficiency and COP are explored in detail. Finally, this model confirms the idea that entanglement and quantum correlations are not the reasons behind the enhancements observed in efficiency, extractable work, and COP, but only due to the structure of the energy levels of the Hamiltonian of the working substance. In addition to this, the extensive property of global work as well, is not affected by entanglement and quantum correlations.

TI Enhancing the energy gap of random graph problems via XX-catalysts in
   quantum annealing
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB One of the main challenges in solving combinatorial optimisation problems with quantum annealers is the emergence of extremely small energy gaps between the ground state and the first excited state of the annealing Hamiltonian. These small gaps may be symptoms of an underlying first-order phase transition, which, according to the adiabatic theorem, can significantly extend the required anneal time, making practical implementation effectively infeasible. In this paper we demonstrate that attaching an XX-catalyst on all the edges of a graph upon which a MWIS (Maximum Weighted Independent Set) problem is defined, significantly enhances the minimum energy gap. Remarkably, our analysis shows that the smaller the energy gap, the more effective the catalyst is in opening it. This result is based on a detailed statistical analysis performed on a large number of randomly generated MWIS problem instances on both Erd & otilde;s-R & eacute;nyi and Barab & aacute;asi-Albert graphs. We perform the analysis using both stoquastic and non-stoquastic catalysts.

TI Coherent dynamics of a photon-dressed qubit
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB We consider the dynamics and stationary regime of a capacitively shunted transmon-type qubit in front of a mirror. The qubit is affected by probe and dressing signals. By varying the parameters of these signals and then analyzing the probe signal (reflected by the "atom plus mirror" system), it is possible to explore the system dynamics, which can be described by the Bloch equation. The obtained time-dependent occupation probabilities are related to the experimentally measured reflection coefficient. The study of this type of dynamics opens up new horizons for better understanding the "qubit plus mirror" circuit properties and the underlying physical processes, such as Landau-Zener-Stuckelberg-Majorana transitions.

TI High polarization extinction superconducting nanowire single-photon
   detectors through grating engineering
SO JOURNAL OF OPTICS
AB Polarization-resolved single-photon detection is a key requirement for advanced quantum photonic applications, including polarization-encoded quantum communication and polarimetric imaging. Although various superconducting nanowire single-photon detector architectures have demonstrated high polarization extinction ratios, concurrently achieving high optical absorption efficiency remains a nontrivial challenge. We propose a compact detector design in which a superconducting nanowire is embedded within a polarization-sensitive silicon grating cavity. The cavity supports distinct longitudinal resonances depending on the incident polarization, thereby enabling selective enhancement of absorption for the desired polarization state. Notably, this configuration introduces minimal fabrication complexity compared to conventional SNSPDs, as the grating cavity can be etched concurrently with the nanowire meander. In numerical simulations, our detector design achieves an absorption efficiency of up to 89.96% and a polarization extinction ratio of 32.39dB, with a fill factor of just 7%. These results represent a significant advancement toward realizing high-performance, polarization-discriminating single-photon detectors.

SO JOURNAL OF THE EUROPEAN OPTICAL SOCIETY-RAPID PUBLICATIONS
AB Recent developments in quantum technologies involving atomic systems highlight the need for complex optical waveforms at visible wavelengths, where available wideband modulation devices able to handle high optical power are hard to obtain. A promising solution uses sum frequency generation (SFG) with a telecom wavelength laser and a pump laser to create wideband optical waveforms in the visible. However, during this frequency conversion, additional photons from parasitic nonlinear processes can be generated, which may disrupt the atomic systems afterwards. This study presents a qualitative and quantitative analysis of the parasitic noise produced during the SFG process, aiming to produce optical waveforms for programming and controlling solid-state quantum memories.

TI Near-Term Quantum Classification Algorithms Applied to Antimalarial Drug
   Discovery
SO JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL INFORMATION AND MODELING
AB Computational approaches are widely applied in drug discovery to explore properties related to bioactivity, physiochemistry, and toxicology. Over at least the last 20 years, the exploitation of machine learning on molecular data sets has been used to understand the structure-activity relationships that exist between biomolecules and druggable targets. More recently, these methods have also seen application for phenotypic screening data for neglected diseases such as tuberculosis and malaria. Herein, we apply machine learning to build quantum Quantitative Structure Activity Relationship models from antimalarial data sets. There is a continual need for new antimalarials to address drug resistance, and the readily available in vitro data sets could be utilized with newer machine learning approaches as these develop. Furthermore, quantum machine learning is a relatively new method that uses a quantum computer to perform the calculations. First, we present a classical-quantum hybrid computational approach by building a Latent Bernoulli Autoencoder machine learning model for compressing bit-vector descriptors to a size that can be adapted to quantum computers for classification tasks with limited loss of embedded information. Second, we apply our method for feature map compression to quantum classification algorithms, including a completely novel machine learning algorithm with no analogy in classical computers: the Quantum Fourier Transform Classifier. We apply both these approaches to build quantum machine learning models for small-molecule antimalarials with quantum simulation software and then benchmark these quantum models against classical machine learning approaches. While there are many challenges currently facing the development of reliable quantum computers, our results demonstrate that there is potential for the use of this technology in the field of drug discovery.

TI Optical ground station diversity for satellite quantum key distribution

SO EPJ QUANTUM TECHNOLOGY
AB Space quantum communications is a potential means for establishing global secure communications and quantum networking. Despite pioneering demonstrations of satellite quantum key distribution, considerable challenges remain for wide deployment such as the local effects of the atmosphere on the transmission of single-photon level quantum signals. As part of Ireland's efforts to establish quantum links with the rest of Europe and further afield, we present a preliminary study of the feasibility of satellite quantum key distribution taking into account geographic and weather effects on the space-Earth channel. Weather data over 5 years covering 4 locations across Ireland were used to assess performance and the prospects of optical ground station (OGS) geographic diversity to improve service availability. Despite significant cloud cover that may reduce the performance of a single OGS location, the use of a 4-OGS network can provide up to 45% improvement for a single satellite exploiting anti-correlation in cloud cover, though most gains are achieved with 2 or 3 OGSs.

TI Analysis of learnability of a novel hybrid quantum-classical
   convolutional neural network in image classification
SO CHINESE PHYSICS B
AB We design a new hybrid quantum-classical convolutional neural network (HQCCNN) model based on parameter quantum circuits. In this model, we use parameterized quantum circuits (PQCs) to redesign the convolutional layer in classical convolutional neural networks, forming a new quantum convolutional layer to achieve unitary transformation of quantum states, enabling the model to more accurately extract hidden information from images. At the same time, we combine the classical fully connected layer with PQCs to form a new hybrid quantum-classical fully connected layer to further improve the accuracy of classification. Finally, we use the MNIST dataset to test the potential of the HQCCNN. The results indicate that the HQCCNN has good performance in solving classification problems. In binary classification tasks, the classification accuracy of numbers 5 and 7 is as high as 99.71%. In multivariate classification, the accuracy rate also reaches 98.51%. Finally, we compare the performance of the HQCCNN with other models and find that the HQCCNN has better classification performance and convergence speed.

TI Quadratic Speed-ups in Quantum Kernelized Binary Classification
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB Classification is at the core of data-driven prediction and decision-making, representing a fundamental task in supervised machine learning. Recently, several quantum machine learning algorithms that use quantum kernels as a measure of similarities between data have emerged to perform binary classification on datasets encoded as quantum states. The potential advantages of quantum kernels arise from the ability of quantum computers to construct kernels that are more effective than their classical counterparts in capturing patterns in data or computing kernels more efficiently. However, existing quantum kernel-based classification algorithms do not harness the capability of having data samples in quantum superposition for additional enhancements. This work demonstrates how such capability can be leveraged in quantum kernelized binary classifiers (QKCs) through Quantum Amplitude Estimation (QAE) for quadratic speed-up. Additionally, new quantum circuits are proposed for the QKCs in which the number of qubits is reduced by one, and the circuit depth is reduced linearly with respect to the number of sample data. The quadratic speed-up over previous methods is verified through numerical simulations on the Iris dataset.
   This paper presents advancements in quantum machine learning for binary classification. By leveraging the ability to superpose multiple data samples and Quantum Amplitude Estimation, the study achieves quadratic speed-ups with respect to the target estimation error in quantum kernelized binary classification. image

TI Secure Continuous-Variable Quantum Key Distribution with Machine
   Learning
SO PHOTONICS
AB Quantum key distribution (QKD) offers information-theoretical security, while real systems are thought not to promise practical security effectively. In the practical continuous-variable (CV) QKD system, the deviations between realistic devices and idealized models might introduce vulnerabilities for eavesdroppers and stressors for two parties. However, the common quantum hacking strategies and countermeasures inevitably increase the complexity of practical CV systems. Machine-learning techniques are utilized to explore how to perceive practical imperfections. Here, we review recent works on secure CVQKD systems with machine learning, where the methods for detections and attacks were studied.

TI Simulability of High-Dimensional Quantum Measurements
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB We investigate the compression of quantum information with respect to a given set M of high-dimensional measurements. This leads to a notion of simulability, where we demand that the statistics obtained from M and an arbitrary quantum state p are recovered exactly by first compressing p into a lower-dimensional space, followed by some quantum measurements. A full quantum compression is possible, i.e., leaving only classical information, if and only if the set M is jointly measurable. Our notion of simulability can thus be seen as a quantification of measurement incompatibility in terms of dimension. After defining these concepts, we provide an illustrative example involving mutually unbiased bases, and develop a method based on semidefinite programming for constructing simulation models. In turn we analytically construct optimal simulation models for all projective measurements subjected to white noise or losses. Finally, we discuss how our approach connects with other concepts introduced in the context of quantum channels and quantum correlations.

TI A Grover-Operator-Based Quantum Variant of Particle Swarm Optimization
   for Robot Manipulators' Inverse Kinematics: Theory and Simulation
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is a widely used solver for the Inverse Kinematics (IK) problem, offering competitive convergence rates compared to methods like Damped Least Squares and Forward and Backward Reaching Inverse Kinematics. However, PSO's high computational cost per iteration remains a challenge. While many PSO variants focus on reducing the number of iterations, this work introduces a novel approach to decrease the computational cost per iteration by minimizing direct kinematics calculations. Leveraging quantum computing algorithms, specifically Quantum Amplitude Amplification (QAA), we developed Quantum-Grover PSO (QG-PSO), which identifies a suboptimal particle to guide the swarm. This approach capitalizes on QAA's quadratic speedup for unstructured search problems. Simulated experiments demonstrate that QG-PSO significantly reduces computational costs compared to classical PSO when solving the IK problem for robotic manipulators with 7 and 15 joints, highlighting the potential of quantum computing in robotics. In addition to position correction, we considered orientation correction while respecting joint limits and avoiding obstacles.

TI Optimal Single-Shot Decoding of Quantum Codes
SO IEEE COMMUNICATIONS LETTERS
AB We discuss single-shot decoding of quantum Calderbank-Shor-Steane codes with faulty syndrome measurements. We state the problem as a joint source-channel coding problem. By adding redundant rows to the code's parity-check matrix, we obtain an additional syndrome error correcting code which addresses faulty syndrome measurements. Thereby, the redundant rows are chosen to obtain good syndrome error correction capabilities while keeping the stabilizer weights low. Optimal joint decoding rules are derived which, though too complex for general codes, can be evaluated for short quantum codes.

TI Analogous Hawking radiation and quantum entanglement in two-component
   Bose-Einstein condensates: The gapped excitations
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
AB The condensates of cold atoms at zero temperature in the tunable binary Bose-Einstein condensate system are studied with the Rabi transition between atomic hyperfine states where the system can be represented by a coupled two-field model of gapless excitations and gapped excitations. We set up the configuration of the supersonic and subsonic regimes with the acoustic horizon between them in the elongated two-component Bose-Einstein condensates, trying to mimic Hawking radiations, in particular due to the gapped excitations. The simplified steplike sound speed change is adopted for the subsonic-supersonic transition so that the model can be analytically treatable. The effective-energy gap term in the dispersion relation of the gapped excitations introduces the threshold frequency omega(min) in the subsonic regime, below which the propagating modes do not exist. Thus, the particle spectrum of the Hawking modes significantly deviates from that of the gapless cases near the threshold frequency due to the modified gray-body factor, which vanishes as the mode frequency is below omega(min). The influence from the gapped excitations to the quantum entanglement of the Hawking mode and its partner of the gapless excitations is also studied according to the Peres-Horodecki-Simon (PHS) criterion. It is found that the presence of the gapped excitations will deteriorate the quantumness of the pair modes of the gapless excitations when the frequency of the pair modes in particular is around omega similar to omega(min). On top of that, when the coupling constant between the gapless and gapped excitations becomes large enough, the huge particle density of the gapped excitations in the small omega regime will significantly disentangle the pair modes of the gapless excitations. The detailed time-dependent PHS criterion will he discussed.

TI Reference-frame-independent quantum key distribution based on imperfect

SO SCIENTIA SINICA-PHYSICA MECHANICA & ASTRONOMICA
AB Quantum key distribution (QKD) utilizes the principles of quantum physics to achieve unconditional security in key distribution. Reference-frame-independent (RFI) QKD has gained greater attention as it does not require alignment of the reference frame for its applications. However, the current assumptions needed to implement existing RFI-QKD protocols are challenging, and there are fewer security analyses based on imperfect devices. This paper mainly focuses on the influence of imperfections in the light source and detector in RFI-QKD, designs RFI-QKD protocol using imperfect devices, and analyzes the security. Through simulation, the paper intuitively demonstrates the changes in secure transmission distance and secure key rate of the RFI-QKD protocol under different light sources and detector imperfections. The paper offers guidance for the practical application of RFI-QKD protocols in the presence of imperfections.

TI Quantum Sensor for Nanoscale Defect Characterization
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB The optical and electronic properties of semiconductors are strongly affected by structural and stoichiometric defects. The precise incorporation of dopants and the control of impurities are essentially what makes semiconductors useful materials for a broad range of devices. The standard defect and impurity characterization methods are sensitive only on a macroscopic scale, like the most widely used method of deep-level transient spectroscopy (DLTS). We perform time-resolved measurements of the resonance fluorescence of a single self-assembled (In,Ga)As quantum dot (QD) at low temperatures (4.2 K). By pulsing the applied gate voltage, we are able to selectively occupy and unoccupy individual defects in the vicinity of the dot. We address the exciton transition of the QD with a tunable diode laser. Our time resolved measurements exhibit a shift of the resonance energy of the optical transition. We attribute this to a change of the electric field in the dot?s vicinity, caused by electrons tunneling from a reservoir to the defect sites. Furthermore, we are able to characterize the defects concerning their position and activation energy by modeling our experimental data. Our results thus demonstrate how a quantum dot can be used as a quantum sensor to characterize the position and activation energy of individual shallow defects on the nanoscale.

TI Regression-decision-tree based parameter optimization of
   measurement-device-independent quantum key distribution
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB The parameter configuration of quantum key distribution (QKD) has a great effect on the communication effect, and in the practical application of the QKD network in the future, it is necessary to quickly realize the parameter configuration optimization of the asymmetric channel measurement-device-independent QKD according to the communication state, so as to ensure the good communication effect of the mobile users, which is an inevitable requirement for real-time quantum communication. Aiming at the problem that the traditional QKD parameter optimization configuration scheme cannot guarantee real-time, in this paper we propose to apply the supervised machine learning algorithm to the QKD parameter optimization configuration, and predict the optimal parameters of TF-QKD and MDI-QKD under different conditions through the machine learning model. First, we delineate the range of system parameters and evenly spaced (linear or logarithmic) values through experimental experience, and then use the traditional local search algorithm (LSA) to obtain the optimal parameters and take them as the optimal parameters in this work. Finally, we train various machine learning models based on the above data and compare their performances. We compare the supervised regression learning models such as neural network, K-nearest neighbors, random forest, gradient tree boosting and classification and regression tree (CART), and the results show that the CART decision tree model has the best performance in the regression evaluation index, and the average value of the key rate (of the prediction parameters) and the optimal key rate ratio is about 0.995, which can meet the communication needs in the actual environment. At the same time, the CART decision tree model shows good environmental robustness in the residual analysis of asymmetric QKD protocol. In addition, compared with the traditional scheme, the new scheme based on CART decision tree greatly improves the real-time performance of computing, shortening the single prediction time of the optimal parameters of different environments to the microsecond level, which well meets the real-time communication needs of the communicator in the movable state. This work mainly focuses on the parameter optimization of discrete variable QKD (DV-QKD). In recent years, the continuous variable QKD (CV-QKD) has developed also rapidly. At the end of the paper, we briefly introduce academic attempts of applying machine learning to the parameter optimization of CV-QKD system, and discuss the applicability of the scheme in CV-QKD system.

TI Security Analysis of Gaussian and Discrete Modulations in FSO/CV-QKD
   Systems Employing LLO Under Phase and Amplitude Attacks
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Continuous variable quantum key distribution (CV-QKD) using a local-local oscillator (LLO) is recently proposed to overcome security issues in conventional CV-QKD systems. However, Eve can manipulate the phase or amplitude of the phase reference pulse (PRP) transmitted over the insecure quantum channel, which has opened the door to new security issues. Maintaining optimal performance and preventing Eve's activities on the quantum channel depends on such a choice of modulation technique. In this paper, the performance of CV-QKD employing LLO over the free space optical (FSO) channel under weak turbulence conditions is investigated. Channel transmittance is introduced into the system model according to the log-negative Weibull distribution. We have adopted the trusted noise model and included the channel phase distortion in the excess noise calculations. We have also evaluated the secret key rate (SKR) using Gaussian modulation (GM) and discrete modulation (DM) protocols. We have reported the superiority of GM in achieving the highest SKR over long distances with the optimum choice of the modulation variance under Eve's attack on the PRP. Moreover, we analyzed phase and amplitude attacks on the PRP and showed that phase attacks are more severe and deteriorate the communication link more rapidly than amplitude attacks.

TI A repetitive amplitude encoding method for enhancing the mapping ability
   of quantum neural networks
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB With the rapid development of quantum machine learning, quantum neural networks (QNNs) have become a research hotspot. However, the quantum gates used to implement feature mapping in this model are all linear transformations, which directly affects the mapping ability of the model. Therefore, how to enhance the mapping capability of QNN is an important issue that has not yet been effectively addressed. This paper proposes a repetitive amplitude encoding method that encodes the probability amplitudes of multiple qubit blocks by repeatedly using the same set of classical data, effectively improving the mapping capability of QNN. Taking the MNIST dataset as an example, the experimental results comparing the repetitive amplitude encoding method with several existing encoding methods show that, firstly, when the number of classes is fixed, the repetitive amplitude encoding is superior to other methods. Secondly, when the number of hidden layers in QNN is fixed, as the number of classes increases, the performance of repetitive amplitude encoding not only consistently outperforms other methods, but this advantage becomes increasingly apparent. Finally, the repetitive amplitude encoding-based QNN was applied to reservoir lithology identification in the field of oil and gas exploration, IRIS and WINe classification datasets. By comparing with classical neural networks, the proposed method was validated for its adaptability to different classification problems and superior classification performance compared to classical neural networks.

Current quantum-safe communication systems are based on quantum key distribution (QKD) technology at their core. In the most recent years, a remarkable effort has been put into practical implementations of QKD with a focus on their integration into classical optical networks, some of which are becoming commercially available. However, even with the ongoing development of QKD systems, there are efforts toward their miniaturization, power efficiency improvement, and enhancement of their flexibility and functionality.
   In this paper, we outline major QKD protocols and review recent advances in QKD systems based on photonic integrated circuits. Finally, we will discuss the potential feasibility of multi-protocol QKD chips leveraging the advantages of different protocols in one solution.

TI "QuantumIrrigation" - a new quantum computing python package for
   irrigation demand assessment
SO SMART AGRICULTURAL TECHNOLOGY
AB Accurate estimation of irrigation demand is a cornerstone of precision agriculture, typically achieved through modeling crop reference evapotranspiration (ETo) and soil moisture dynamics. In this study, we developed QuantumIrrigation-a novel Python package that integrates quantum computing with deep learning to predict ETo and soil moisture (expressed as soil water tension). The framework was tested using data from an experimental research farm in Camilla, Georgia. QuantumIrrigation's performance was benchmarked against two stateof-the-art deep learning architectures widely used for time-series prediction: Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and the Patch Time-Series Transformer (PatchTST). The package incorporates two quantum models-Variational Quantum Circuit (VQC) and Quantum LSTM (QLSTM)-which were evaluated both as standalone models and within four hybrid configurations: hybrid LSTM-VQC, hybrid LSTM-QLSTM, hybrid PatchTST-VQC, and hybrid PatchTST-QLSTM. For ETo prediction, LSTM and QLSTM achieved the strongest performance across all evaluation metrics, while the hybrid variants offered no additional gains in predictive accuracy. In contrast, LSTMbased hybrid quantum models outperformed all other configurations for soil water tension prediction, effectively combining LSTM's temporal memory with quantum properties of superposition and entanglement. These hybrids delivered superior predictive accuracy and greater computational efficiency compared to both standalone quantum and other hybrid models. Sensitivity analysis identified solar radiation as the most influential variable for ETo prediction and lagged soil water tension values as the dominant predictors for soil moisture dynamics. Overall, the results highlight the domain-specific advantages of quantum-classical hybrid modeling and demonstrate the potential of the QuantumIrrigation package to advance irrigation demand forecasting and support more efficient, data-driven irrigation decision making.

TI Simplification of the Gram Matrix Eigenvalue Problem for Quadrature
   Amplitude Modulation Signals
SO ENTROPY
AB In quantum information science, it is very important to solve the eigenvalue problem of the Gram matrix for quantum signals. This allows various quantities to be calculated, such as the error probability, mutual information, channel capacity, and the upper and lower bounds of the reliability function. Solving the eigenvalue problem also provides a matrix representation of quantum signals, which is useful for simulating quantum systems. In the case of symmetric signals, analytic solutions to the eigenvalue problem of the Gram matrix have been obtained, and efficient computations are possible. However, for asymmetric signals, there is no analytic solution and universal numerical algorithms that must be used, rendering the computations inefficient. Recently, we have shown that, for asymmetric signals such as amplitude-shift keying coherent-state signals, the Gram matrix eigenvalue problem can be simplified by exploiting its partial symmetry. In this paper, we clarify a method for simplifying the eigenvalue problem of the Gram matrix for quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) signals, which are extremely important for applications in quantum communication and quantum ciphers. The results presented in this paper are applicable to ordinary QAM signals as well as modified QAM signals, which enhance the security of quantum cryptography.

The results show that both the non-Markovian environment and the classical driving can speed up the evolution process, this quantum speedup process is induced by the non-Markovianity and the critical points only depend on the qubit velocity. Moreover, the qubit motion will delay the evolution process, but this negative effect of the qubit velocity on the quantum speedup can be suppressed by the classical driving. Finally, we give the corresponding physical explanation by using the decoherence rates.

TI Quantum cryptographic resource distillation and entanglement
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB We look into multipartite quantum states on which quantum cryptographic protocols including quantum key distribution and quantum secret sharing can be perfectly performed, and define the quantum cryptographic resource distillable rate as the asymptotic rate at which such multipartite state can be distilled from a given multipartite state. Investigating several relations between entanglement and the rate, we show that there exists a multipartite bound entangled state whose quantum cryptographic resource distillable rate is strictly positive, that is, there exists a multipartite entangled state which is not distillable, but can be useful for quantum cryptography such as quantum key distribution and quantum secret sharing.

TI Optimality Condition for the Petz Map
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB In quantum error correction, the Petz map serves as a perfect recovery map when the Knill-Laflamme conditions are satisfied. Notably, while perfect recovery is generally infeasible for most quantum channels of finite dimension, the Petz map remains a versatile tool with near-optimal performance in recovering quantum states. This work introduces and proves, for the first time, the necessary and sufficient conditions for the optimality of the Petz map in terms of entanglement fidelity. In some special cases, the violation of this condition can be easily characterized by a simple commutator that can be efficiently computed. We provide multiple examples that substantiate our new findings.

TI Transparent qubit manipulations with spin-orbit coupled two-electron
   nanowire quantum dot
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB We report on the first set of exact orthonormalized states to an ac driven one-dimensional (1D) two-electron nanowire quantum dot with the Rashba-Dresselhaus coexisted spin-orbit coupling (SOC) and the controlled magnetic field orientation and trapping frequency. In the ground state case, it is shown that the spatiotemporal evolutions of probability densities occupying internal spin states and the transfer rates between different spin states can be adjusted by the ac electric field and the intensities of SOC and magnetic field. Effects of the system parameters and initial-state-dependent constants on the mean entanglement are revealed, where the approximately maximal entanglement associated with the stronger SOC and its insensitivity to the initial and parametric perturbations are demonstrated numerically. A novel resonance transition mechanism is found, in which the ladder-like time-evolution process of expected energy and the transition time between two arbitrary exact states are controlled by the ac field strength. Using such maximally entangled exact states to encode qubits can render the qubit control more transparent and robust. The results could be extended to 2D case and to an array of two-electron quantum dots with weak neighboring coupling for quantum information processing.

The quantum model is based on a completely different paradigm with respect to the one followed in classical colorimetry and it relies on the hypothesis that color sensations are the result of (perceptual) quantum measurements performed by human observers.

AB In quantum theory, the modulus-square of the inner product of two normalized Hilbert space elements is to be interpreted as the transition probability between the pure states represented by these elements. A probabilistically motivated and more general definition of this transition probability was introduced in a preceding paper and is extended here to a general type of quantum logics: the orthomodular partially ordered sets. A very general version of the quantum no-cloning theorem, creating promising new opportunities for quantum cryptography, is presented and an interesting relationship between the transition probability and Jordan algebras is highlighted.

TI Entangling Independent Particles by Path Identity
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Quantum entanglement-correlations of particles that are stronger than any classical analog-is the basis for research on the foundations of quantum mechanics and for practical applications such as quantum networks. Traditionally, entanglement is achieved through local interactions or via entanglement swapping, where entanglement at a distance is generated through previously established entanglement and Bell-state measurements. However, the precise requirements enabling the generation of quantum entanglement without traditional local interactions remain less explored. Here, we demonstrate that independent particles can be entangled without the need for direct interaction, prior established entanglement, or Bell-state measurements, by exploiting the indistinguishability of the origins of photon pairs. Our demonstrations challenge the long-standing belief that the prior generation and measurement of entanglement are necessary prerequisites for generating entanglement between independent particles that do not share a common past. In addition to its foundational interest, we show that this technique might lower the resource requirements in quantum networks, by reducing the complexity of photon sources and the overhead photon numbers.

AB Quantum compilers play a crucial role in quantum computing by converting these algorithmic quantum circuits into forms compatible with specific quantum computer hardware. However, untrusted quantum compilers present considerable risks, including the potential theft of quantum circuit intellectual property (IP) and compromise of the functionality (e.g. Trojan insertion). Quantum circuit obfuscation techniques protect quantum IP by transforming a quantum circuit into a key-dependent version before compilation and restoring the compiled circuit's functionality with the correct key. This prevents the untrusted compiler from knowing the circuit's original functionality. Existing quantum circuit obfuscation techniques focus on inserting key qubits to control key gates. One added key gate can represent at most one Boolean key bit. In this paper, we propose OPAQUE, a phase-based quantum circuit obfuscation approach where we use the angle of rotation gates as the secret keys. The rotation angle is a continuous value, which makes it possible to represent multiple key bits. Moreover, phase gates are usually implemented as virtual gates in quantum hardware, diminishing their cost and impact on accuracy.

TI Erbium-implanted materials for quantum communication applications
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB Erbium-doped materials can serve as spin-photon interfaces with optical transitions in the telecom C band, making them an exciting class of materials for long-distance quantum communication. However, the spin and optical coherence times of Er3+ ions are limited by currently available host materials, motivating the development of new Er3+-containing materials. Here we demonstrate the use of ion implantation to efficiently screen prospective host candidates, and show that disorder introduced by ion implantation can be mitigated through post-implantation thermal processing to achieve inhomogeneous linewidths comparable to bulk linewidths in as-grown samples. We present optical spectroscopy data for each host material, which allows us to determine the level structure of each site, allowing us to compare the environments of Er3+ introduced via implantation and via doping during growth. We demonstrate that implantation can generate a range of local environments for Er3+, including those observed in bulk-doped materials, and that the populations of these sites can be controlled with thermal processing.

TI Extending the coherence time limit of a single-alkali-atom qubit by
   suppressing phonon-jumping-induced decoherence
SO OPTICA
AB In the fields of quantum metrology and quantum information processing with the system of optically trapped single neutral atoms, the coherence time of a qubit encoded in the electronic states is regarded as one of the most important parameters. A longer coherence time is always pursued for higher precision of measurement and quantum manipulation. The coherence time is usually assumed to be merely determined by the relative stability of the energy between the electronic states, and the analysis of the decoherence was conducted by treating the atom motion classically. We proposed a complete description of the decoherence of a qubit encoded in two ground electronic states of an optically trapped alkali atom by adopting a full description of the atomic wavefunction. The motional state, i.e., the phonon state, is taken into account. In addition to decoherence due to the variance of the differential light shift (DLS), a new, to our knowledge, decoherence mechanism, phonon-jumping-induced decoherence (PJID), was discovered and verified experimentally. The coherence time of a single-cesium-atom qubit can be extended to T 2 approximate to 20 s by suppressing both the variances of DLS and PJID by trapping the atom in a blue-detuned bottle beam trap (BBT) and preparing the atom in its three-dimensional motional ground states. The coherence time is the longest for a qubit encoded in an optically trapped single alkali atom. Our work provides a deep understanding of the decoherence mechanism for single atom qubits and thus provides a new way to extend the coherence time limit. The method can be applied for other atoms and molecules, opening up new prospects for high-precision control of the quantum states of optically trapped atoms or molecules.

TI Exploring the boundary of quantum correlations with a time-domain
   optical processor
SO SCIENCE ADVANCES
AB Contextuality is a hallmark feature of the quantum theory that captures its incompatibility with any noncontextual hidden-variable model. The Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ)-type paradoxes are proofs of contextuality that reveal this incompatibility with deterministic logical arguments. However, the GHZ-type paradox whose events can be included in the fewest contexts and that brings the strongest nonclassicality remains elusive. Here, we derive a GHZ-type paradox with a context-cover number of 3 and show that this number saturates the lower bound posed by quantum theory. We demonstrate the paradox with a time-domain fiber optical platform and recover the quantum prediction in a 37-dimensional setup based on high-speed modulation, convolution, and homodyne detection of time-multiplexed pulsed coherent light. By proposing and studying a strong form of contextuality in high-dimensional Hilbert space, our results pave the way for the exploration of exotic quantum correlations with time-multiplexed optical systems.

TI Hybrid quantum-classical convolutional neural networks
SO SCIENCE CHINA-PHYSICS MECHANICS & ASTRONOMY
AB Deep learning has been shown to be able to recognize data patterns better than humans in specific circumstances or contexts. In parallel, quantum computing has demonstrated to be able to output complex wave functions with a few number of gate operations, which could generate distributions that are hard for a classical computer to produce. Here we propose a hybrid quantum-classical convolutional neural network (QCCNN), inspired by convolutional neural networks (CNNs) but adapted to quantum computing to enhance the feature mapping process. QCCNN is friendly to currently noisy intermediate-scale quantum computers, in terms of both number of qubits as well as circuit's depths, while retaining important features of classical CNN, such as nonlinearity and scalability. We also present a framework to automatically compute the gradients of hybrid quantum-classical loss functions which could be directly applied to other hybrid quantum-classical algorithms. We demonstrate the potential of this architecture by applying it to a Tetris dataset, and show that QCCNN can accomplish classification tasks with learning accuracy surpassing that of classical CNN with the same structure.

TI On the (relation between) efficiency and secret key rate of QKD
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB The processes of evaluation and comparison play a vital role in the development of a scientific field. In the field of quantum cryptography (especially quantum key distribution, QKD), the so-called secret key rate is used for characterizing the performance of a protocol (scheme). However the current definition of this quantity is incomplete. It does not consider the classical communication process taking place in a QKD protocol. There exists a quantity that involves all the procedures (resources) in a communication process: it is the efficiency (total efficiency). This paper reports a definition of this parameter. Also the relation between the total efficiency and key rate is found. By means of this relation, the total secret key rate of a QKD protocol is expressed. An application of the total key rate is demonstrated: the original twin-field QKD (TF-QKD) is evaluated in terms of this rate. The paper also shows a comparison between the total key rate and the standard key rate of a TF-QKD.

TI Onset of Scrambling as a Dynamical Transition in Tunable-Range Quantum
   Circuits
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB In a fast-scrambling many-body quantum system, information is spread and entanglement is built up on a time scale that grows logarithmically with the system size. This is of fundamental interest in understand -ing the dynamics of many-body systems, as well as in efficiently producing entangled resource states and error-correcting codes. In this work, we identify a dynamical transition marking the onset of scrambling in quantum circuits with different levels of long-range connectivity. In particular, we show that as a function of the interaction range for circuits of different structures, the tripartite mutual information exhibits a scal-ing collapse around a critical point between two clearly defined regimes of different dynamical behavior. We study this transition analytically in a related long-range Brownian-circuit model and show how the transition can be mapped onto the statistical mechanics of a long-range Ising model in a particular region of parameter space. This mapping predicts mean-field critical exponents nu = -1/(1 + sc), which are con-sistent with the critical exponents extracted from Clifford-circuit numerics. In addition to systems with conventional power-law interactions, we identify the same phenomenon in deterministic sparse circuits that can be realized in experiments with neutral-atom arrays.

TI Phase-Matching Quantum Key Distribution with Discrete Phase
   Randomization
SO ENTROPY
AB The twin-field quantum key distribution (TF-QKD) protocol and its variations have been proposed to overcome the linear Pirandola-Laurenza-Ottaviani-Banchi (PLOB) bound. One variation called phase-matching QKD (PM-QKD) protocol employs discrete phase randomization and the phase post-compensation technique to improve the key rate quadratically. However, the discrete phase randomization opens a loophole to threaten the actual security. In this paper, we first introduce the unambiguous state discrimination (USD) measurement and the photon-number-splitting (PNS) attack against PM-QKD with imperfect phase randomization. Then, we prove the rigorous security of decoy state PM-QKD with discrete phase randomization. Simulation results show that, considering the intrinsic bit error rate and sifting factor, there is an optimal discrete phase randomization value to guarantee security and performance. Furthermore, as the number of discrete phase randomization increases, the key rate of adopting vacuum and one decoy state approaches infinite decoy states, the key rate between discrete phase randomization and continuous phase randomization is almost the same.

TI Simultaneous transmission of hyper-entanglement in three degrees of
   freedom through a multicore fiber
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Entanglement distribution is at the heart of most quantum communication protocols. Inevitable loss of photons along quantum channels is a major obstacle for distributing entangled photons over long distances, as the no-cloning theorem forbids the information to simply be amplified along the way as is done in classical communication. It is therefore desirable for every successfully transmitted photon pair to carry as much entanglement as possible. Spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) creates photons entangled in multiple high-dimensional degrees of freedom simultaneously, often referred to as hyper-entanglement. In this work, we use a multicore fiber (MCF) to show that energy-time and polarization degrees of freedom can simultaneously be transmitted in multiple fiber cores, even maintaining path entanglement across the cores. We verify a fidelity to the ideal Bell state of at least 95% in all degrees of freedom. Furthermore, because the entangled photons are created with a center wavelength of 1560 nm, our approach can readily be integrated into modern telecommunication infrastructure, thus paving the way for high-rate quantum key distribution and many other entanglement-based quantum communication protocols.

TI Characterisation of a single photon event camera for quantum imaging
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB We show a simple yet effective method that can be used to characterize the per pixel quantum efficiency and temporal resolution of a single photon event camera for quantum imaging applications. Utilizing photon pairs generated through spontaneous parametric down-conversion, the detection efficiency of each pixel, and the temporal resolution of the system, are extracted through coincidence measurements. We use this method to evaluate the TPX3CAM, with appended image intensifier, and measure an average efficiency of 7.4 +/- 2% and a temporal resolution of 7.3 ns. Furthermore, this technique reveals important error mechanisms that can occur in post-processing. We expect that this technique, and elements therein, will be useful to characterise other quantum imaging systems.

TI Three phases of quantum annealing: Fast, slow, and very slow
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Currently, existing quantum annealers have proven themselves as viable technology for the first practical applications in the noisy-intermediate-scale-quantum era. However, to fully exploit their capabilities, a comprehensive characterization of their finite-time excitations is instrumental. To this end, we develop a phase diagram for driven Ising chains, from which the scaling behavior of the excess work can be read off as a function of process duration and system size. "Fast" processes are well described by the Kibble-Zurek mechanism; "slow" process are governed by effective Landau-Zener dynamics; and "very slow" processes can be approximated with adiabatic perturbation theory.

TI On the universality of Sn -equivariant k-body
   gates
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB The importance of symmetries has recently been recognized in quantum machine learning from the simple motto: if a task exhibits a symmetry (given by a group B), the learning model should respect said symmetry. This can be instantiated via B-equivariant quantum neural networks (QNNs), i.e. parametrized quantum circuits whose gates are generated by operators commuting with a given representation of B. In practice, however, there might be additional restrictions to the types of gates one can use, such as being able to act on at most k qubits. In this work we study how the interplay between symmetry and k-bodyness in the QNN generators affect its expressiveness for the special case of B=S-n, the symmetric group. Our results show that if the QNN is generated by one- and two-body S-n-equivariant gates, the QNN is semi-universal but not universal. That is, the QNN can generate any arbitrary special unitary matrix in the invariant subspaces, but has no control over the relative phases between them. Then, we show that in order to reach universality one needs to include n-body generators (if n is even) or (n-1)-body generators (if n is odd). As such, our results brings us a step closer to better understanding the capabilities and limitations of equivariant QNNs.

AB Quantum information technology is an emerging discipline that combines quantum mechanics with information science, promising revolutionary advancements in computing, communication, and precision measurement. Optical quantum systems, known for their low transmission loss and low-noise coupling at room temperature, are crucial components of quantum information technology. To effectively utilize the low noise and strong quantum correlation properties of optical quantum systems, phase-locked control technology is widely applied in quantum state generation, mode regulation, and quantum state detection.

TI Hybrid Quantum-Safe integration of TLS in SDN networks
SO COMPUTER NETWORKS
AB Shor's algorithm efficiently solves factoring and discrete logarithm problems using quantum computers, compromising all public key schemes used today. Algorithms such as RSA, DHKE, and ECC will not work in a world with quantum computers, since they can easily invert the functions that provide their computational strength in the classical world. These schemes rely on assumptions on their computational complexity, which quantum computers can easily bypass. The solutions have to come from new algorithms - called PostQuantum Cryptography (PQC) - or from new methods, such as Quantum Key Distribution (QKD). The former replicate the computational security ideas of classical public key algorithms, while the latter recurs to use the quantum properties of nature, which also brings a mathematical security proof, potentially offering Information-Theoretic Security. To secure data in the future, we must adopt these paradigms. With the speed of quantum computing advancements, the transition to quantum-safe cryptography within the next decade is critical. Delays could expose long-lived confidential data, as current encryption may be broken before its value expires. However, the shift must balance the adoption of new technologies with maintaining proven systems to protect against present and future threats. In this work, we have selected Transport Layer Security (TLS), one of the most widely used protocols, as the foundation to hybridize classical, quantum, and post-quantum cryptography in a way suitable for broad adoption in Software-Defined Networking (SDN), the most flexible networking paradigm that has been used to deploy integrated quantum-classical networks. To this end, we use standards for QKD key extraction and SDN integration. The purposed implementation is based on the latest version of TLS (1.3) and demonstrates advanced capabilities such as rekeying and key transport across a large QKD network, while supporting crypto-agility and maintaining backward compatibility through the use of ciphersuites. The performance of this approach has been demonstrated using a deployed production infrastructure.

TI Theoretical study of the spectroscopic measurements of Kerr nonlinear
   resonators with four-body interaction
SO JAPANESE JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS
AB Quantum annealing provides a promising way to solve combinational optimization problems where the solutions correspond to the ground state of the Ising Hamiltonian. We can implement quantum annealing using the Kerr nonlinear resonators (KNRs), with bifurcation phenomena emerging when subjected to a parametric drive. These bifurcated states can function as bases of qubits. Moreover, integrating four-body interactions between physical qubits enables the establishment of effective all-to-all long-range interactions between logical qubits, which is essential for practical quantum annealing. While theoretical proposals exist for creating four-body interactions within KNRs, there has not been experimental verification through their spectroscopic signatures. In this paper, we theoretically investigate the spectroscopic measurements of KNRs featuring four-body interaction. We identify six distinct frequencies exhibiting population changes by employing resonant driving on one resonator and weak driving on another. Analytical and numerical calculations validate these findings. Our study demonstrates the potential of spectroscopy in characterizing systems with four-body interactions, offering insights for realizing quantum annealing with Kerr parametric oscillators.

TI Coherent light scattering from a telecom C-band quantum dot
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Quantum networks have the potential to transform secure communication via quantum key distribution and enable novel concepts in distributed quantum computing and sensing. Coherent quantum light generation at telecom wavelengths is fundamental for fibre-based network implementations, but Fourier-limited emission and subnatural linewidth photons have so far only been reported from systems operating in the visible to near-infrared wavelength range. Here, we use InAs/InP quantum dots to demonstrate photons with coherence times much longer than the Fourier limit at telecom wavelength via elastic scattering of excitation laser photons. Further, we show that even the inelastically scattered photons have coherence times within the error bars of the Fourier limit. Finally, we make direct use of the minimal attenuation in fibre for these photons by measuring two-photon interference after 25 km of fibre, demonstrating finite interference visibility for photons emitted about 100,000 excitation cycles apart.
   Developing quantum networks would require reliable sources of coherent quantum light at telecom wavelengths. Here, the authors employ elastic scattering of excitation laser photons on InAs/InP quantum dots to demonstrate the emission of telecom photons with coherence times longer than the Fourier limit.

TI Constraining new physics in entangled two-qubit systems: top-quark,
   tau-lepton and photon pairs
SO EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL C
AB The measurement of quantum entanglement can provide a new and most sensitive probe to physics beyond the Standard Model. We use the concurrence of the top-quark pair spin states produced at colliders to constrain the magnetic dipole term in the coupling between top quark and gluons, that of tau-lepton pair spin states to bound contact interactions and that of tau-lepton pairs or two-photons spin states from the decay of the Higgs boson in trying to distinguish between CP-even and odd couplings. These four examples show the power of the new approach as well as its limitations. We show that differences in the entanglement in the top-quark and tau-lepton pair production cross sections can provide constraints better than those previously estimated from total cross sections or classical correlations. Instead, the final states in the decays of the Higgs boson remain maximally entangled even in the presence of CP-odd couplings and cannot be used to set bounds on new physics. We discuss the violation of Bell inequalities featured in all four processes.

TI Quantum correlation measure based on min relative entropy for
   two-partition and k-partition br
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB As a peculiar resource of quantum mechanics, quantum correlation has been applied to many aspects. Inquantum information processing and quantum computing, the quantum correlation plays an extremelyimportant role, and it has been a subject of further studies, principally due to the general belief that it is afundamental resource for different quantum information processing tasks. In addition, correlation measure is avery important physical quantity in studying the quantum correlation. A well-defined correlation measure needsto have some necessary properties. By proving these necessary properties, we can deepen our understanding ofcorrelation measure. As one of the key concepts of quantum information theory, relative entropy is always usedto measure the uncertainty contained in the state of physical system. In order to better understand theproperties and applications of correlation measure based on relative entropy, in this paper, according to theproperties of the min relative entropy, we give the quantum correlation measure based on min relative entropyfor two-partition and k-partition. Furthermore, we prove that it satisfies some necessary properties of quantumcorrelation measures, including the nonnegativity, the invariance under local unitary operators, and themonotonicity under completely positive trace-preserving. By proving these properties, we show that the givencorrelation measure is well-defined. Security of communication has received much attention since ancient times.In today's society, the internet, instant messaging and e-commerce applications are all related to theinformation security, and the information security is related to the vital interests of everyone. The informationencryption is one of the important methods to ensure information security. As an important way to ensureinformation security, quantum channel has received more and more attention. At the end of the paper, weintroduce the concept of quantum channel, and discuss the influence of quantum channel on the correlationmeasure based on min relative entropy under k-partition. By proposing a new correlation measure and provingthe effect quantum channel on the measure, we can better describe the uncertainty contained in the state of physical system

TI High-precision chemical quantum sensing in flowing monodisperse
   microdroplets
SO SCIENCE ADVANCES
AB A method is presented for high-precision chemical detection that integrates quantum sensing with droplet microfluidics. Using nanodiamonds (ND) with fluorescent nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers as quantum sensors, rapidly flowing microdroplets containing analyte molecules are analyzed. A noise-suppressed mode of optically detected magnetic resonance is enabled by pairing controllable flow with microwave control of NV electronic spins, to detect analyte-induced signals of a few hundredths of a percent of the ND fluorescence. Using this method, paramagnetic ions in droplets are detected with low limit-of-detection using small analyte volumes, with exceptional measurement stability over >10(3) s. In addition, these droplets are used as microconfinement chambers by co-encapsulating ND quantum sensors with various analytes such as single cells, suggesting wide-ranging applications including single-cell metabolomics and real-time intracellular measurements from bioreactors. Important advances are enabled by this work, including portable chemical testing devices, amplification-free chemical assays, and chemical imaging tools for probing reactions within microenvironments.

SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB The preparation of ground states of spin systems is a fundamental operation in quantum computing and serves as the basis of adiabatic quantum computing. This form of quantum computation is subject to the adiabatic theorem which in turn poses a fundamental speed limit. We show that by employing diabatic transitions via counterdiabatic driving, a less strict requirement on adiabaticity applies. We demonstrate a scaling advantage from local and multispin counterdiabatic driving in the ground-state fidelity compared to their adiabatic counterpart, for different Ising spin models.

TI Qubits based on merons in magnetic nanodisks
SO COMMUNICATIONS MATERIALS
AB A meron is a classical topological soliton having a half topological charge. It could be materialized in a magnetic disk. However, it will become a quantum mechanical object when its size is of the order of nanometers. Here, we propose to use a nanoscale meron in a magnetic nanodisk as a qubit, where the up and down directions of the core spin are assigned to be the qubit states vertical bar 0 > and vertical bar 1 >. We first numerically show that a meron with the radius containing as small as 7 spins can be stabilized in a ferromagnetic nanodisk classically. Then, we show theoretically that universal quantum computation is possible based on merons by explicitly constructing the arbitrary phase-shift gate, Hadamard gate, and CNOT gate. They are executed by applying a magnetic field or spin-polarized current. Our results may be useful for the implementation of quantum computation based on topological spin textures in nanomagnets.

TI Quench dynamics of the Schwinger model via variational quantum
   algorithms
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
AB We investigate the real-time dynamics of the (1 + 1)-dimensional U(1) gauge theory known as the Schwinger model via variational quantum algorithms. Specifically, we simulate quench dynamics in the presence of an external electric field. First, we use a variational quantum eigensolver to obtain the ground state of the system in the absence of an external field. With this as the initial state, we perform real-time evolution under an external field via a fixed-depth, parameterized circuit whose parameters are updated using McLachlan's variational principle. We use the same ansatz for initial-state preparation and time evolution, by which we are able to reduce the overall circuit depth. We test our method with a classical simulator and confirm that the results agree well with exact diagonalization.

TI Design Optimization of Noise Filter Using Quantum Annealer
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB The use of quantum annealers in black-box optimization to obtain the desired properties of a product with a small number of trials has attracted attention. However, the application of this technique to engineering design problems has been limited. Here, we demonstrate the applicability of black-box optimization with a quantum annealer to the design of electric circuit systems, focusing on p-type noise filters as an example. We develop a framework that uses quantum annealing to find the optimal location of electrical components and conductor paths connecting the components, and confirm that the learning process appropriately works over a number of trials to efficiently search for a design with high performance. The results show the potential applicability of quantum annealing to design problems of electric circuit systems.

TI Quantum JIDOKA. Integration of Quantum Simulation on a CNC Machine for
   In-Process Control Visualization
SO SENSORS
AB With the advent of the Industry 4.0 paradigm, the possibilities of controlling manufacturing processes through the information provided by a network of sensors connected to work centers have expanded. Real-time monitoring of each parameter makes it possible to determine whether the values yielded by the corresponding sensor are in their normal operating range. In the interplay of the multitude of parameters, deterministic analysis quickly becomes intractable and one enters the realm of "uncertain knowledge". Bayesian decision networks are a recognized tool to control the effects of conditional probabilities in such systems. However, determining whether a manufacturing process is out of range requires significant computation time for a decision network, thus delaying the triggering of a malfunction alarm. From its origins, JIDOKA was conceived as a means to provide mechanisms to facilitate real-time identification of malfunctions in any step of the process, so that the production line could be stopped, the cause of the disruption identified for resolution, and ultimately the number of defective parts minimized. Our hypothesis is that we can model the internal sensor network of a computer numerical control (CNC) machine with quantum simulations that show better performance than classical models based on decision networks. We show a successful test of our hypothesis by implementing a quantum digital twin that allows for the integration of quantum computing and Industry 4.0. This quantum digital twin simulates the intricate sensor network within a machine and permits, due to its high computational performance, to apply JIDOKA in real time within manufacturing processes.

TI Hacking measurement-device-independent quantum key distribution
SO OPTICA
AB Decoy-state measurement-device-independent quantum key distribution (MDI-QKD) is regarded as one of the most promising protocols since it is physically immune to all fatal detection-side attacks. However, the loopholes in the source side still open side channels to eavesdroppers. Previous work has indicated that a system is insecure if its decoy-state modulation is inaccurate, but a practical method for Eve to exploit the inaccurate modulation is still absent. In this work, we propose a practical hacking method and provide a detailed theoretical analysis. Using our method, we experimentally hacked a MDI-QKD system and successfully obtained all final keys. By demonstrating the hacking experiment, we hope to bring attention to source-side security and provide inspiration for the development of protocols with better source-side security.

AB In recent years, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have made significant strides in various applications, demonstrating their potential in handling complex networked data. Simultaneously, quantum machine learning has emerged as a rapidly advancing and promising field, leveraging quantum computing principles to enhance machine learning models. Benefiting from the advancements in both GNNs and quantum machine learning, we propose a novel hybrid model called CTQW-GraphSAGE. This model aims to combine the strengths of classical and quantum approaches to improve performance on graph-related tasks. The model is built on the GraphSAGE framework, enhanced with quantum feature mapping and Continuous-Time Quantum Walk (CTQW). These enhancements are used to calculate aggregation weights for neighboring nodes relative to the target node, thereby integrating quantum properties into the classical model. We evaluate the proposed model on various benchmark datasets and compared our results with several baseline graph neural network methods. CTQW-GraphSAGE achieves comparable results to the classical models on most of the selected datasets on node classification tasks.

AB We investigate minimum-error (ME) discrimination for mixed qubit states using a geometric approach. By analyzing positive operator-valued measure (POVM) solutions and introducing Lagrange operator G, we develop a four-step structured instruction to find G for N mixed qubit states. Our method covers optimal solutions for two, three, and four mixed qubit states, including a novel result for four qubit states. We introduce geometric-based POVM classes and non-decomposable subsets for constructing optimal solutions, enabling us to find all possible answers for the general problem of minimum-error discrimination for N mixed qubit states with arbitrary a priori probabilities.

TI Wilsonian renormalization as a quantum channel and the separability of
   fixed points
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
AB We show that the Wilsonian formulation of the renormalization group (RG) defines a quantum channel acting on the momentum-space density matrices of a quantum field theory. This information theoretical property of the RG allows us to derive a remarkable consequence for the vacuum of theories at a fixed point: they have no entanglement between momentum scales. Our result can be understood as deriving from the scale symmetry of such theories and leads to constraints on the form of the ground state and on expectation values of momentum-space operators.

The nitrogen-vacancy (NV) color center has attracted a particular interest, thanks to its outstanding spin properties and optical addressability. The NV center has been used to realize innovative multimode quantum-enhanced sensors that offer an unprecedented combination of high sensitivity and spatial resolution at room temperature. The technological progress and the widening of potential sensing applications have induced an increasing demand for performance advances of NV quantum sensors. Quantum control plays a key role in responding to this demand.

TI Quantum bit with telecom wave-length emission from a simple defect in Si
SO COMMUNICATIONS PHYSICS
AB Defect-related spin-to-photon interfaces in silicon promise the realization of quantum repeaters by combining advanced semiconductor and photonics technologies. Recently, controlled creation/erasure of simple carbon interstitial defects have been successfully realised in silicon. This defect has a stable structure near room temperature and coherently emits in the wave-length where the signal loss is minimal in optical fibres used in communication technologies. Our in-depth theoretical characterization confirms the assignment of the observed emission to the neutral charge state of this defect, as arising due to the recombination of a bound exciton. We also identified a metastable triplet state that could be applied as a quantum memory. Based on the analysis of the electronic structure of the defect and its similarities to a known optically detected magnetic resonance centre in silicon, we propose that a carbon interstitial can act as a quantum bit and may realize a spin-to-photon interface in complementary metal-oxide semiconductor-compatible platforms.
   This work presents a theoretical investigation of the single carbon interstitial (Ci) defect in silicon as a potential candidate for spin-photon interfaces. Computed charge transition levels and optical properties show good agreement with the experimental results and allow assigning the experimentally observed telecom zero-phonon emission (1448 nm) to the neutral Ci defect.

TI High-speed thin-film lithium niobate quantum processor driven by a

SO SCIENCE ADVANCES
AB Scalable photonic quantum computing architectures pose stringent requirements on photonic processing devices. The needs for low-loss high-speed reconfigurable circuits and near-deterministic resource state generators are some of the most challenging requirements. Here, we develop an integrated photonic platform based on thin-film lithium niobate and interface it with deterministic solid-state single-photon sources based on quantum dots in nanophotonic waveguides. The generated photons are processed with low-loss circuits programmable at speeds of several gigahertz. We realize a variety of key photonic quantum information processing functionalities with the high-speed circuits, including on-chip quantum interference, photon demultiplexing, and reprogrammability of a four-mode universal photonic circuit. These results show a promising path forward for scalable photonic quantum technologies by merging integrated photonics with solid-state deterministic photon sources in a heterogeneous approach to scaling up.

TI Quantum Linear System Solver Based on Time-optimal Adiabatic Quantum
   Computing and Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm
SO ACM TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM COMPUTING
AB We demonstrate that with an optimally tuned scheduling function, adiabatic quantum computing (AQC) can readily solve a quantum linear system problem (QLSP) with O(kappa poly(log(kappa/epsilon))) runtime, where kappa is the condition number, and epsilon is the target accuracy. This is near optimal with respect to both kappa and epsilon, and is achieved without relying on complicated amplitude amplification procedures that are difficult to implement. Our method is applicable to general non-Hermitian matrices, and the cost as well as the number of qubits can be reduced when restricted to Hermitian matrices, and further to Hermitian positive definite matrices. The success of the time-optimal AQC implies that the quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) with an optimal control protocol can also achieve the same complexity in terms of the runtime. Numerical results indicate that QAOA can yield the lowest runtime compared to the time-optimal AQC, vanilla AQC, and the recently proposed randomization method.

TI Circuit-Based Compact Model of Electron Spin Qubit
SO ELECTRONICS
AB Today, an electron spin qubit on silicon appears to be a very promising physical platform for the fabrication of future quantum microprocessors. Thousands of these qubits should be packed together into one single silicon die in order to break the quantum supremacy barrier. Microelectronics engineers are currently leveraging on the current CMOS technology to design the manipulation and read-out electronics as cryogenic integrated circuits. Several of these circuits are RFICs, as VCO, LNA, and mixers. Therefore, the availability of a qubit CAD model plays a central role in the proper design of these cryogenic RFICs. The present paper reports on a circuit-based compact model of an electron spin qubit for CAD applications. The proposed model is described and tested, and the limitations faced are highlighted and discussed.

TI Large-scale quantum approximate optimization on nonplanar graphs with
   machine learning noise mitigation
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Quantum computers are increasing in size and quality but are still very noisy. Error mitigation extends the size of the quantum circuits that noisy devices can meaningfully execute. However, state-of-the-art error mitigation methods are hard to implement and the limited qubit connectivity in superconducting qubit devices restricts most applications to the hardware's native topology. Here we show a quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) on nonplanar random regular graphs with up to 40 nodes enabled by a machine learning-based error mitigation. We use a swap network with careful decision-variable-to-qubit mapping and a feed-forward neural network to optimize a depth-two QAOA on up to 40 qubits. We observe a meaningful parameter optimization for the largest graph which requires running quantum circuits with 958 two-qubit gates. Our paper emphasizes the need to mitigate samples, and not only expectation values, in quantum approximate optimization. These results are a step towards executing quantum approximate optimization at a scale that is not classically simulable. Reaching such system sizes is key to properly understanding the true potential of heuristic algorithms like QAOA.

TI Entangling two exciton modes placed in two separate
   exciton-optomechanical cavities
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Distributing robust and long-distance entanglement between repeater nodes is a critical task for both foundational tests of quantum physics and the development of scalable quantum networks. In this paper, we propose a scheme for entangling two spatially separated exciton modes located in two exciton-optomechanical cavities. Each cavity, consisting of a semiconductor optomechanical cavity integrated with a quantum well, is simultaneously driven by a red-detuned laser and a squeezed vacuum light. Under realistic experimental conditions, we show that steady-state entanglement can be established between the two exciton modes by transferring quantum correlations from the squeezed light to them. Maximum entanglement is achieved when the exciton modes are tuned to resonance with the anti-Stokes sidebands of the driving lasers. With a high mechanical quality factor, the resulting entanglement exhibits robust behavior against thermal noise and remains significantly nonzero even at room temperature. Furthermore, we discuss a method to access and detect the excitonic entanglement. Our scheme provides a promising platform for practical long-distance entanglement distribution, which is of fundamental importance for quantum information processing and network architectures.

TI Single-Step High-Fidelity Three-Qubit Gates by Anisotropic Chiral
   Interactions
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Direct multiqubit gates are becoming critical to facilitate quantum computations in near-term devices by reducing the gate counts and circuit depth. Here, we demonstrate that fast and high-fidelity three-qubit gates can be realized in a single step by leveraging small anisotropic and chiral three-qubit interactions. These ingredients naturally arise in state-of-the-art spin-based quantum hardware through a combination of spin-orbit interactions and orbital magnetic fields. These interactions resolve the key synchronization issues inherent in protocols relying solely on two-qubit couplings, which significantly limit gate fidelity. We confirm with numerical simulations that our single-step three-qubit gate can outperform existing protocols, potentially achieving infidelity < 10(-4) in 80-100 ns under current experimental conditions. To further benchmark its performance, we also propose an alternative composite three-qubit gate sequence based on anisotropic two-qubit interactions with built-in echo sequence and show that the single-step protocol can outperform it, making it highly suitable for near-term quantum processors.

TI Bell inequalities and quantum entanglement in weak gauge boson
   production at the LHC and future colliders
SO EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL C
AB Quantum entanglement of weak interaction gauge bosons produced at colliders can be explored by computing the corresponding polarization density matrix. To this end, we consider the Higgs boson decays H -> WW* and H -> ZZ*, in which W* and Z* are off-shell states, and the WW, WZ and ZZ di-boson production in proton collisions. The polarization density matrix of the di-boson state is determined by the amplitude of the production process and can be experimentally reconstructed from the angular distribution of the momenta of the final states into which the gauge bosons decay. We show that a suitable instance of the Bell inequality is violated in H -> ZZ* to a degree that can be tested at the LHC with future data. The same Bell inequality is violated in the production of WW and ZZ boson pairs for invariant masses above 900 GeV and scattering angles close to pi/2 in the center of mass frame. LHC data in this case are not sufficient to establish the violation of the Bell inequality. We also analyze the prospects for detecting Bell inequality violations in di-boson final states at future e(+)e(-) and muon colliders. A further observable that provides a lower bound on the amount of polarization entanglement in the di-boson system is computed for each of the examined processes. The analytic expressions for the polarization density matrices are presented in full in an Appendix. We also provide the unitary matrices required in the optimization procedure necessary in testing the Bell inequalities.

TI Enhanced quantum sensing with room-temperature solid-state masers
SO SCIENCE ADVANCES
AB Quantum sensing with solid-state electron spin systems finds broad applications in diverse areas ranging from material and biomedical sciences to fundamental physics. Exploiting collective behavior of noninteracting spins holds the promise of pushing the detection limit to even lower levels, while to date, those levels are scarcely reached because of the broadened linewidth and inefficient readout of solid-state spin ensembles. Here, we experimentally demonstrate that such drawbacks can be overcome by a reborn maser technology at room tem-perature in the solid state. Owing to maser action, we observe a fourfold reduction in the electron paramag-netic resonance linewidth of an inhomogeneously broadened molecular spin ensemble, which is narrower than the same measured from single spins at cryogenic temperatures. The maser-based readout applied to near zero-field magnetometry showcases the measurement signal-to-noise ratio of 133 for single shots. This technique would be an important addition to the toolbox for boosting the sensitivity of solid-state ensemble spin sensors.

TI Quantum Information-Empowered Graph Neural Network for Hyperspectral
   Change Detection
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
AB Change detection (CD) is a critical remote sensing technique for identifying changes in the Earth's surface over time. The outstanding substance identifiability of hyperspectral images (HSIs) has significantly enhanced the detection accuracy, making hyperspectral CD (HCD) an essential technology. The detection accuracy can be further upgraded by leveraging the graph structure of HSIs, motivating us to adopt the graph neural networks (GNNs) in solving HCD. For the first time, this work introduces a quantum deep network (QUEEN) into HCD. Unlike GNN and CNN, both extracting the affine-computing features, QUEEN provides fundamentally different unitary-computing features. We demonstrate that through the unitary feature extraction procedure, QUEEN provides radically new information for deciding whether there is a change or not. Hierarchically, a graph feature learning (GFL) module exploits the graph structure of the bitemporal HSIs at the superpixel level, while a quantum feature learning (QFL) module learns the quantum features at the pixel level, as a complementary to GFL by preserving pixel-level detailed spatial information not retained in the superpixels. In the final classification stage, a quantum classifier is designed to cooperate with a traditional fully connected classifier. The superior HCD performance of the proposed QUEEN-empowered GNN (i.e., QUEEN- G ) will be experimentally demonstrated on real hyperspectral datasets.

AB More than a half century ago, the NMR spectra of diamagnetic products resulting from radical pair reactions were observed to have strongly enhanced absorptive and emissive resonances. At the same time, photogenerated radical pairs were discovered to exhibit unusual electron paramagnetic resonance spectra that also had such resonances. These non-Boltzmann, spin-polarized spectra were observed in both chemical systems as well as in photosynthetic reaction center proteins following photodriven charge separation. Subsequent studies of these phenomena led to a variety of chemical electron donor-acceptor model systems that provided a broad understanding of the spin dynamics responsible for these spectra. When the distance between the two radicals is restricted, these observations result from the formation of spin-correlated radical pairs (SCRPs) in which the spin-spin exchange and dipolar interactions between the two unpaired spins play an important role in the spin dynamics. Early on, it was recognized that SCRPs photogenerated by ultrafast electron transfer are entangled spin pairs created in a well-defined spin state. These SCRPs can serve as spin qubit pairs (SQPs), whose spin dynamics can be manipulated to study a wide variety of quantum phenomena intrinsic to the field of quantum information science. This Perspective highlights the role of SCRPs as SQPs, gives examples of possible quantum manipulations using SQPs, and provides some thoughts on future directions.

TI ON CYCLIC AND NEGACYCLIC CODES WITH ONE-DIMENSIONAL HULLS AND THEIR
   APPLICATIONS
SO ADVANCES IN MATHEMATICS OF COMMUNICATIONS
AB Linear codes over finite fields with small dimensional hulls have received much attention due to their applications in cryptology and quantum computing. In this paper, we study cyclic and negacyclic codes with onedimensional hulls. We determine precisely when cyclic and negacyclic codes over finite fields with one-dimensional hulls exist. We also introduce onedimensional linear complementary pairs of cyclic and negacyclic codes. As an application, we obtain numerous optimal or near optimal cyclic codes with onedimensional hulls over different fields and, by using these codes, we present new entanglement-assisted quantum error-correcting codes (EAQECCs). In particular, some of these EAQEC codes are maximal distance separable (MDS). We also obtain one-dimensional linear complementary pairs of cyclic codes, which are either optimal or near optimal.

TI Topological computation by non-Abelian braiding in classical
   metamaterials
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB We propose a realization of the one-dimensional Kitaev topological superconductor in classical mechanical metamaterials. By designing appropriate braiding protocols, we demonstrate that the system's midgap vibrational modes, termed classical Majorana zero modes (MZMs), accurately reproduce the braiding statistics predicted by quantum theory. Encoding four MZMs as a classical analog of a qubit, we implement all single-qubit Clifford gates through braiding, enabling the simulation of topological quantum computation in a classical system. Furthermore, we establish the system's topological protection by demonstrating its robustness against mechanical defects. This work provides a different framework for exploring topological quantum computation using classical metamaterials and offers a pathway to realizing stable vibrational systems protected by topology.

TI Enhancing qubit readout with Bayesian learning
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We introduce an efficient and accurate readout measurement scheme for single and multiqubit states. Our method uses Bayesian inference to build an assignment probability distribution for each qubit state based on a reference characterization of the detector response functions. This allows us to account for system imperfections and thermal noise within the assignment of the computational basis. We benchmark our protocol on a quantum device with five superconducting qubits, testing initial state preparation for single- and two-qubit states and an application of the Bernstein-Vazirani algorithm executed on five qubits. Our method shows a substantial reduction of the readout error and promises advantages for near -term and future quantum devices.

TI A reduction from an LWE problem to maximum independent set problems
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB The learning with errors (LWE) problem is a problem derived from machine learning that is believed to be intractable for quantum computers. This paper proposes a method that can reduce an LWE problem to a set of maximum independent set (MIS) problems, which are graph problems that are suitable for a quantum annealing machine to solve. The reduction algorithm can reduce an n-dimensional LWE problem to several small MIS problems with at most 2O(vn) nodes when the lattice-reduction algorithm used in the LWE-reduction method successfully finds short vectors. The algorithm is useful for solving LWE problems in a quantum-classical hybrid manner by using an existing quantum algorithm to solve the MIS problems. For example, the smallest LWE challenge problem is reduced to MIS problems with about 40,000 vertices. This result means that the smallest LWE challenge problem will be within the scope of a real quantum computer in the near future.

TI Complexity of Local Quantum Circuits under Nonunital Noise
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB It is widely accepted that noisy quantum devices are limited to logarithmic depth circuits unless midcircuit measurements and error correction are employed. However, this conclusion holds only for unital error channels, such as depolarizing noise. Building on the idea of the "quantum refrigerator" Ben-Or et al. [Quantum refrigerator, arXiv1301.1995 (2013)], we improve upon previous results and show that geometrically local circuits in the presence of nonunital noise, in any dimension d >= 1, can correct errors without midcircuit measurements and extend computation to any depth, with only polylogarithmic overhead in the depth and the number of qubits. This implies that local quantum dynamics subjected to sufficiently weak nonunital noise are computationally universal and nearly as hard to simulate as noiseless dynamics. Additionally, we quantify the contraction property of local random circuits in the presence of nonunital noise.

TI Improved decoy-state quantum key distribution with uncharacterized
   heralded single-photon sources
SO CHINESE PHYSICS B
AB Encoding system plays a significant role in quantum key distribution (QKD). However, the security and performance of QKD systems can be compromised by encoding misalignment due to the inevitable defects in realistic devices. To alleviate the influence of misalignments, a method exploiting statistics from mismatched basis is proposed to enable uncharacterized sources to generate secure keys in QKD. In this work, we propose a scheme on four-intensity decoy-state quantum key distribution with uncharacterized heralded single-photon sources. It only requires the source states are prepared in a two-dimensional Hilbert space, and can thus reduce the complexity of practical realizations. Moreover, we carry out corresponding numerical simulations and demonstrate that our present four-intensity decoy-state scheme can achieve a much higher key rate compared than a three-intensity decoy-state method, and meantime it can obtain a longer transmission distance compared than the one using weak coherent sources.

Among them, security is a crucial aspect, particularly considering open and disaggregated networks. Continuous variable quantum key distribution (CV-QKD) is proposed as an appealing solution to ensure long-term security, while facilitating the coexistence with conventional optical communications for a sustainable integration of QKD technology in future 6G networks. In this work, the adoption of CV-QKD in future optical networks is discussed, focusing on the network resources and infrastructure sharing, exploring advanced features, flexibility and programmability, further enabled by software defined networking (SDN).

TI Position correlation enabled quantum imaging with undetected photons
SO OPTICS LETTERS
AB Quantum imaging with undetected photons (QIUP) is a unique imaging technique that does not require the detection of the light used for illuminating the object. This technique requires a correlated pair of photons. In the existing implementations of QIUP, the imaging is enabled by the momentum correlation between the twin photons. We investigate the complementary scenario in which the imaging is instead enabled by the position correlation between the two photons. We present a general theory and show that the properties of the images obtained in these two cases are significantly distinct. (C) 2021 Optical Society of America

TI Advances in device-independent quantum key distribution
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Device-independent quantum key distribution (DI-QKD) provides the gold standard for secure key exchange. Not only does it allow for information-theoretic security based on quantum mechanics, but it also relaxes the need to physically model the devices, thereby fundamentally ruling out many quantum hacking threats to which non-DI QKD systems are vulnerable. In practice though, DI-QKD is very challenging. It relies on the loophole-free violation of a Bell inequality, a task that requires high quality entanglement to be distributed between distant parties and close to perfect quantum measurements, which is hardly achievable with current technology. Notwithstanding, recent theoretical and experimental efforts have led to proof-of-principle DI-QKD implementations. In this article, we review the state-of-the-art of DI-QKD by highlighting its main theoretical and experimental achievements, discussing recent proof-of-principle demonstrations, and emphasizing the existing challenges in the field.

AB This paper presents a control-theoretic survey of four representative quantum consensus algorithms, with a focus on their convergence properties and implementation feasibility. The selected algorithms-ranging from gossip-based method to measurement-based feedback method and geometric control methods-exhibit fundamentally different convergence targets, including symmetric state consensus and directional alignment of Bloch vectors. Each approach is analyzed in terms of its dynamical structure, physical requirements, and control complexity. To show their performance, numerical simulations are conducted on a 3-qubit network under a fully connected topology. The results imply the trade-offs between convergence strength, coherence preservation, and practical implementability, offering insights for the design of distributed control protocols in quantum networks.

TI Fault-tolerant one-bit addition with the smallest interesting color code
SO SCIENCE ADVANCES
AB Fault-tolerant operations based on stabilizer codes are the state of the art in suppressing error rates in quantum computations. Most such codes do not permit a straightforward implementation of non-Clifford logical operations, which are necessary to define a universal gate set. As a result, implementations of these operations must use either error-correcting codes with more complicated error correction procedures or gate teleportation and magic states, which are prepared at the logical level, increasing overhead to a degree that precludes near-term implementation. Here, we implement a small quantum algorithm, one-qubit addition, fault-tolerantly on a trapped-ion quantum computer, using the [[ 8 , 3 , 2 ]] color code. By removing unnecessary error correction circuits and using low-overhead techniques for fault-tolerant preparation and measurement, we reduce the number of error-prone two-qubit gates and measurements to 36. We observe arithmetic errors with a rate of similar to 1.1 x 10(-3) for the fault-tolerant circuit and similar to 9.5 x 10(-3) for the unencoded circuit.

TI Dispersive nonreciprocity between a qubit and a cavity
SO SCIENCE ADVANCES
AB The dispersive interaction between a qubit and a cavity is ubiquitous in circuit and cavity quantum electrodynamics. It describes the frequency shift of one quantum mode in response to excitations in the other and, in closed systems, is necessarily bidirectional, i.e., reciprocal. Here, we present an experimental study of a nonreciprocal dispersive-type interaction between a transmon qubit and a superconducting cavity, arising from a common coupling to dissipative intermediary modes with broken time reversal symmetry. We characterize the qubit-cavity dynamics, including asymmetric frequency pulls and photon shot noise dephasing, under varying degrees of nonreciprocity by tuning the magnetic field bias of a ferrite component in situ. We introduce a general master equation model for nonreciprocal interactions in the dispersive regime, providing a compact description of the observed qubit-cavity dynamics agnostic to the intermediary system. Our result provides an example of quantum nonreciprocal phenomena beyond the typical paradigms of non-Hermitian Hamiltonians and cascaded systems.

TI Inverse design of spontaneous parametric downconversion for generation
   of high-dimensional qudits
SO OPTICA
AB Spontaneous parametric downconversion (SPDC) in quantum optics is an invaluable resource for the realization of high-dimensional qudits with spatial modes of light. One of the main open challenges is how to directly generate a desirable qudit state in the SPDC process. This problem can be addressed through advanced computational learning methods; however, due to difficulties in modeling the SPDC process by a fully differentiable algorithm, progress has been limited. Here, we overcome these limitations and introduce a physically constrained and differentiable model, validated against experimental results for shaped pump beams and structured crystals, capable of learning the relevant interaction parameters in the process. We avoid any restrictions induced by the stochastic nature of our physical model and integrate the dynamic equations governing the evolution under the SPDC Hamiltonian. We solve the inverse problem of designing a nonlinear quantum optical system that achieves the desired quantum state of downconverted photon pairs. The desired states are defined using either the second-order correlations between different spatial modes or by specifying the required density matrix. By learning nonlinear photonic crystal structures as well as different pump shapes, we successfully show how to generate maximally entangled states. Furthermore, we simulate all-optical coherent control over the generated quantum state by actively changing the profile of the pump beam. Our work can be useful for applications such as novel designs of high-dimensional quantum key distribution and quantum information processing protocols. In addition, our method can be readily applied for controlling other degrees of freedom of light in the SPDC process, such as spectral and temporal properties, and may even be used in condensed-matter systems having a similar interaction Hamiltonian.

TI Light-Front Field Theory on Current Quantum Computers
SO ENTROPY
AB We present a quantum algorithm for simulation of quantum field theory in the light-front formulation and demonstrate how existing quantum devices can be used to study the structure of bound states in relativistic nuclear physics. Specifically, we apply the Variational Quantum Eigensolver algorithm to find the ground state of the light-front Hamiltonian obtained within the Basis Light-Front Quantization (BLFQ) framework. The BLFQ formulation of quantum field theory allows one to readily import techniques developed for digital quantum simulation of quantum chemistry. This provides a method that can be scaled up to simulation of full, relativistic quantum field theories in the quantum advantage regime. As an illustration, we calculate the mass, mass radius, decay constant, electromagnetic form factor, and charge radius of the pion on the IBM Vigo chip. This is the first time that the light-front approach to quantum field theory has been used to enable simulation of a real physical system on a quantum computer.

TI Ancilla-Mediated Higher Entanglement as T-Duality, a Categorial
   Conjecture
SO QUANTUM REPORTS
AB In this article, I start with a general presentation of the ideas behind sigma models and higher gauge theories and introduce the possibility of a higher entanglement structure. Using a higher categorial interpretation of entanglement involving gauge theories and sigma-models instead of qubits, one recovers T-duality as a form of ancilla aided entanglement generation. This opens the way towards new dualities in gauge theories and sigma-models produced by means of analogies with quantum circuits of various types.

TI Very-large-scale integrated quantum graph photonics
SO NATURE PHOTONICS
AB Graphs have provided an expressive mathematical tool to model quantum-mechanical devices and systems. In particular, it has been recently discovered that graph theory can be used to describe and design quantum components, devices, setups and systems, based on the two-dimensional lattice of parametric nonlinear optical crystals and linear optical circuits, different to the standard quantum photonic framework. Realizing such graph-theoretical quantum photonic hardware, however, remains extremely challenging experimentally using conventional technologies. Here we demonstrate a graph-theoretical programmable quantum photonic device in very-large-scale integrated nanophotonic circuits. The device monolithically integrates about 2,500 components, constructing a synthetic lattice of nonlinear photon-pair waveguide sources and linear optical waveguide circuits, and it is fabricated on an eight-inch silicon-on-insulator wafer by complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor processes. We reconfigure the quantum device to realize and process complex-weighted graphs with different topologies and to implement different tasks associated with the perfect matching property of graphs. As two non-trivial examples, we show the generation of genuine multipartite multidimensional quantum entanglement with different entanglement structures, and the measurement of probability distributions proportional to the modulus-squared hafnian (permanent) of the graph's adjacency matrices. This work realizes a prototype of graph-theoretical quantum photonic devices manufactured by very-large-scale integration technologies, featuring arbitrary programmability, high architectural modularity and massive manufacturing scalability.
   A graph-theoretical programmable quantum photonic device composed of about 2,500 components is fabricated on a silicon substrate within a 12 mm x 15 mm footprint. It shows the generation, manipulation and certification of genuine multiphoton multidimensional entanglement, as well as the implementations of scattershot and Gaussian boson sampling.

TI Highly Tunable 2D Silicon Quantum Dot Array with Coupling beyond Nearest
   Neighbors
SO NANO LETTERS
AB Scaling up quantum dots to two-dimensional (2D) arrays is a crucial step for advancing semiconductor quantum computation. However, maintaining excellent tunability of quantum dot parameters, including both nearest-neighbor and next-nearest-neighbor couplings, during 2D scaling is challenging, particularly for silicon quantum dots due to their relatively small size. Here, we present a highly controllable and interconnected 2D quantum dot array in planar silicon, demonstrating independent control over electron fillings and the tunnel couplings of nearest-neighbor dots. More importantly, we also demonstrate the wide tuning of tunnel couplings between next-nearest-neighbor dots, which play a crucial role in 2D quantum dot arrays. This excellent tunability enables us to alter the coupling configuration of the array as needed. These results open up the possibility of utilizing silicon quantum dot arrays as versatile platforms for quantum computing and quantum simulation.

SO QUANTUM MACHINE INTELLIGENCE
AB Quantum computing technologies are in the process of moving from academic research to real industrial applications, with the first hints of quantum advantage demonstrated in recent months. In these early practical uses of quantum computers, it is relevant to develop algorithms that are useful for actual industrial processes. In this work, we propose a quantum pipeline, comprising a quantum autoencoder followed by a quantum classifier, which are used to first compress and then label classical data coming from a separator, i.e., a machine used in one of Eni's Oil Treatment Plants. This work represents one of the first attempts to integrate quantum computing procedures in a real-case scenario of an industrial pipeline, in particular using actual data coming from physical machines, rather than pedagogical data from benchmark datasets.

TI Extending the QMM Framework to the Strong and Weak Interactions
SO ENTROPY
AB We extend the Quantum Memory Matrix (QMM) framework, originally developed to reconcile quantum mechanics and general relativity by treating space-time as a dynamic information reservoir, to incorporate the full suite of Standard Model gauge interactions. In this discretized, Planck-scale formulation, each space-time cell possesses a finite-dimensional Hilbert space that acts as a local memory, or quantum imprint, for matter and gauge field configurations. We focus on embedding non-Abelian SU(3)c (quantum chromodynamics) and SU(2)L x U(1)Y (electroweak interactions) into QMM by constructing gauge-invariant imprint operators for quarks, gluons, electroweak bosons, and the Higgs mechanism. This unified approach naturally enforces unitarity by allowing black hole horizons, or any high-curvature region, to store and later retrieve quantum information about color and electroweak charges, thereby preserving subtle non-thermal correlations in evaporation processes. Moreover, the discretized nature of QMM imposes a Planck-scale cutoff, potentially taming UV divergences and modifying running couplings at trans-Planckian energies. We outline major challenges, such as the precise formulation of non-Abelian imprint operators and the integration of QMM with loop quantum gravity, as well as possible observational strategies-ranging from rare decay channels to primordial black hole evaporation spectra-that could provide indirect probes of this discrete, memory-based view of quantum gravity and the Standard Model.

TI Phase transitions in the frustrated Ising ladder with stoquastic and
   nonstoquastic catalysts
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB The role of nonstoquasticity in the field of quantum annealing and adiabatic quantum computing is an actively debated topic. We study a strongly-frustrated quasi-one-dimensional quantum Ising model on a two-leg ladder to elucidate how a first-order phase transition with a topological origin is affected by interactions of the +/- XX-type. Such interactions are sometimes known as stoquastic (negative sign) and nonstoquastic (positive sign) "catalysts". Carrying out a symmetry-preserving real-space renormalization group analysis and extensive density-matrix renormalization group computations, we show that the phase diagrams obtained by these two methods are in qualitative agreement with each other and reveal that the first-order quantum phase transition of a topological nature remains stable against the introduction of both XX-type catalysts. This is the first study of the effects of nonstoquasticity on a first-order phase transition between topologically distinct phases. Our results indicate that nonstoquastic catalysts are generally insufficient for removing topological obstacles in quantum annealing and adiabatic quantum computing.

TI Lattice holography on a quantum computer
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
AB We explore the potential application of quantum computers to the examination of lattice holography, which extends to the strongly coupled bulk theory regime. With adiabatic evolution, we compute the ground state of a spin system on a (2 + 1)-dimensional hyperbolic lattice, and measure the spin-spin correlation function on the boundary. Notably, we observe that with achievable resources for coming quantum devices, the correlation function demonstrates an approximate scale-invariant behavior, aligning with the pivotal theoretical predictions of the anti-de Sitter/conformal field theory correspondence.

AB Multiparty Session Types (MPSTs) offer a structured way of specifying communication protocols and guarantee relevant communication properties, such as deadlock-freedom. In this paper, we extend a minimal MPST system with quantum data and operations, enabling the specification of quantum protocols. Quantum MPSTs (QMPSTs) provide a formal notation to describe quantum protocols, both at the abstract level of global types, describing which communications can take place in the system and their dependencies, and at the concrete level of local types and quantum processes, describing the expected behavior of each participant in the protocol. Type-checking relates these two levels formally, ensuring that processes behave as prescribed by the global type. Beyond usual communication properties, QMPSTs also allow us to prove that qubits are owned by a single process at any time, capturing the quantum no-cloning and no-deleting theorems. We use our approach to verify four quantum protocols from the literature, respectively Teleportation, Secret Sharing, Bit-Commitment, and Key Distribution.

TI Driving Enhanced Quantum Sensing in Partially Accessible Many-Body
   Systems
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB The ground-state criticality of many-body systems is a resource for quantum-enhanced sensing, namely, the Heisenberg precision limit, provided that one has access to the whole system. We show that, for partial accessibility, the sensing capabilities of a block of spins in the ground state reduces to the sub-Heisenberg limit. To compensate for this, we drive the Hamiltonian periodically and use a local steady state for quantum sensing. Remarkably, the steady-state sensing shows a significant enhancement in precision compared to the ground state and even achieves super-Heisenberg scaling for low frequencies. The origin of this precision enhancement is related to the closing of the Floquet quasienergy gap. It is in close correspondence with the vanishing of the energy gap at criticality for ground-state sensing with global accessibility. The proposal is general to all the integrable models and can be implemented on existing quantum devices.

TI Unravelling physics beyond the standard model with classical and quantum
   anomaly detection
SO MACHINE LEARNING-SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Much hope for finding new physics phenomena at microscopic scale relies on the observations obtained from High Energy Physics experiments, like the ones performed at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). However, current experiments do not indicate clear signs of new physics that could guide the development of additional Beyond Standard Model (BSM) theories. Identifying signatures of new physics out of the enormous amount of data produced at the LHC falls into the class of anomaly detection and constitutes one of the greatest computational challenges. In this article, we propose a novel strategy to perform anomaly detection in a supervised learning setting, based on the artificial creation of anomalies through a random process. For the resulting supervised learning problem, we successfully apply classical and quantum support vector classifiers (CSVC and QSVC respectively) to identify the artificial anomalies among the SM events. Even more promising, we find that employing an SVC trained to identify the artificial anomalies, it is possible to identify realistic BSM events with high accuracy. In parallel, we also explore the potential of quantum algorithms for improving the classification accuracy and provide plausible conditions for the best exploitation of this novel computational paradigm.

TI Coherence based on positive operator-valued measures for standard and
   concatenated quantum state discrimination with inconclusive results
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB The optimal measurement that discriminates nonorthogonal quantum states with fixed rates of inconclusive outcomes (FRIO) can be decomposed into an assisted separation of the inputs, yielding conclusive and inconclusive outputs, followed by a minimum-error (ME) measurement for the conclusive ones (standard FRIO) or both ones (concatenated FRIO). The implementation of these measurements is underpinned by quantum resources, and here we investigate coherence based on positive operator-valued measures (POVMs) as a resource for both strategies in discriminating equally probable symmetric states of arbitrary dimension. First, we show that the POVM coherence in the assisted separation stage decomposes into the coherence of the ancillary state and the quantum discord between the system and the ancilla, evidencing coherence as a more elementary resource than quantum correlations. Next, it is demonstrated that the POVM coherence for standard and concatenated FRIO decomposes into the POVM coherence measures for state separation and ME measurement, weighted by the probabilities of occurrence of each event. Due to the ME discrimination of inconclusive states, the coherence required for the concatenated scheme is shown to be greater than that of the standard one. We discuss other general aspects of our results by characterizing the POVM coherence in the discrimination of qutrit states, with respect to the distinguishability of the inputs and the inconclusive rate. Finally, by exploiting POVM-based coherence as a quantifier of cryptographic randomness gain, we discuss the standard and concatenated FRIO strategies from the perspective of generating random bits that are secret to an eavesdropper.

TI Complementary monogamy and polygamy properties among multipartite
   systems
SO CHINESE PHYSICS B
AB Monogamy and polygamy relations are essential properties of quantum entanglement, which characterize the distributions of entanglement in multipartite systems. In this paper, we establish the general monogamy relations for gamma-th (0 <= gamma <= alpha, alpha >= 1) power of quantum entanglement based on unified-(q,s) entanglement and polygamy relations for delta-th (delta >= beta, 0 <= beta <= 1) power of entanglement of assistance based on unified-(q,s) entanglement of assistance, which provides a complement to the previous research in terms of different parameter regions of gamma and delta. These results are then applied to specific quantum correlations, e.g., entanglement of formation, Renyi-q entanglement of assistance and Tsallis-q entanglement of assistance to get the corresponding monogamy and polygamy inequalities. Moreover, typical examples are presented for illustration.

TI Systematic characterization of nanoscale h-BN quantum sensor
   spots created by helium-ion microscopy
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB The nanosized boron vacancy (V-B) defect spot in hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) is promising for a local magnetic field quantum sensor. One of its advantages is that a helium-ion microscope can make a spot at any location in an h-BN flake with nanometer accuracy. In this study, we investigate the properties of the created nanosized V-B defect spots by systematically varying three conditions: the helium-ion dose, the thickness of the h-BN flakes, and the substrate on which the h-BN flakes are attached. The physical background of the results obtained is successfully interpreted using Monte Carlo calculations. From the findings obtained here, a guideline for their optimal creation conditions is obtained to maximize its performance as a quantum sensor concerning sensitivity and localization.

TI Rotationally Invariant Circuits: Universality with the Exchange
   Interaction and Two Ancilla Qubits
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Universality of local unitary transformations is one of the cornerstones of quantum computing with many applications and implications that go beyond this field. However, it has recently been shown that this universality does not hold in the presence of continuous symmetries: generic symmetric unitaries on a composite system cannot be implemented, even approximately, using local symmetric unitaries on the subsystems. In this Letter, we show that, despite these constraints, any SU(2) rotationally invariant unitary can be realized with the Heisenberg exchange interaction, which is 2 -local and rotationally invariant, provided that the system interacts with a pair of ancilla qubits. We also show that a single ancilla is not enough to achieve universality. Furthermore, we study qubit circuits formed from k -local rotationally invariant unitaries and fully characterize the constraints imposed by locality on the realizable unitaries. We also find an interpretation of these constraints in terms of the average energy of states with a fixed angular momentum.

TI Classification of Pneumonia via a Hybrid ZFNet-Quantum Neural
   Network Using a Chest X-ray Dataset
SO CURRENT MEDICAL IMAGING
AB Introduction: Deep neural networks (DNNs) have made significant contributions to diagnosing pneumonia from chest X-ray imaging. However, certain aspects of diagnosis and planning can be further enhanced through the implementation of a quantum deep neural network (QDNN). Therefore, we introduced a technique that integrates neural networks with quantum algorithms named the ZFNet-quantum neural network for detecting pneumonia using 5863 X-ray scans with binary cases. Methods: The hybrid model efficiently pre-processes complex and high-dimensional data by extracting significant features from the ZFNet model. These significant features are given to the quantum circuit algorithm and further embedded into a quantum device. The parameterized quantum circuit algorithm using qubits, superposition theorem, and entanglement phenomena generates 4 features from 4098 features extracted from images via a deep transfer learning model. Moreover, to validate the outcome measures of the proposed technique, we used various PennyLane quantum devices to detect pneumonia and normal control images. By using the Adam optimizer, which exploits an adaptive learning rate that is fixed to 10-6 and six layers of a quantum circuit composed of quantum gates, the proposed model achieves an accuracy of 96.5%, corresponding to 25 epochs. Results: The integrated ZFNet-quantum learning network outperforms the deep transfer learning network in terms of testing accuracy, as the accuracy gained by the convolutional neural network (CNN) is 94%. Therefore, we use a hybrid classical-quantum model to detect pneumonia in which a variational quantum algorithm enhances the outcomes of a ZFNet transfer learning method. Conclusion: This approach is an efficient and automated method for detecting pneumonia and could significantly enhance outcome measures related to the speed and accuracy of the network in the clinical and healthcare sectors.

TI Unraveling the origin of higher success probabilities in quantum
   annealing versus semi-classical annealing
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS B-ATOMIC MOLECULAR AND OPTICAL PHYSICS
AB Quantum annealing aims at finding optimal solutions to complex optimization problems using a suitable quantum many body Hamiltonian encoding the solution in its ground state. To find the solution one typically evolves the ground state of a soluble, simple initial Hamiltonian adiabatically to the ground state of the designated final Hamiltonian. Here we explore whether and when a full quantum representation of the dynamics leads to higher probability to end up in the desired ground when compared to a classical mean field approximation. As simple but nontrivial example we target the ground state of interacting bosons trapped in a tight binding lattice with small local defect by turning on long range interactions. Already two atoms in four sites interacting via two cavity modes prove complex enough to exhibit significant differences between the full quantum model and a mean field approximation for the cavity fields mediating the interactions. We find a large parameter region of highly successful quantum annealing, where the semi-classical approach largely fails. Here we see strong evidence for the importance of entanglement to end close to the optimal solution. The quantum model also reduces the minimal time for a high target occupation probability. Surprisingly, in contrast to naive expectations that enlarging the Hilbert space is beneficial, different numerical cut-offs of the Hilbert space reveal an improved performance for lower cut-offs, i.e. an nonphysical reduced Hilbert space, for short simulation times. Hence a less faithful representation of the full quantum dynamics sometimes creates a higher numerical success probability in even shorter time. However, a sufficiently high cut-off proves relevant to obtain near perfect fidelity for long simulations times in a single run. Overall our results exhibit a clear improvement to find the optimal solution based on a quantum model versus simulations based on a classical field approximation.

TI Flexible quantum data bus for quantum networks
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB We consider multipath generation of Bell states in quantum networks, where a preprepared multipartite entangled two-dimensional cluster state serves as a resource to perform different tasks on demand. We show how to achieve parallel connections between multiple, freely chosen groups of parties by performing appropriate local measurements along a diagonal, staircase-shaped path on a two-dimensional cluster state. Remarkably, our measurement scheme preserves the entanglement structure of the cluster state such that the remaining state is again a two-dimensional cluster state. We demonstrate strategies for generating crossing, turning, and merging of multiple measurement lines along the two-dimensional cluster state. The results apply to local area as well as to long-distance networks.

TI Quantum-Enhanced Facial Biometrics: A Hybrid Framework with Post-Quantum
   Security
SO QUANTUM REPORTS
AB Face recognition systems are widely used for biometric authentication but face two major problems. First, processing high-resolution images and large databases requires extensive computational time. Second, emerging quantum computers threaten to break the encryption methods that protect stored facial templates. Quantum computers will soon be able to decrypt current security systems, putting biometric data at permanent risk since facial features cannot be changed like passwords. This paper presents a solution that uses quantum computing to speed up face recognition while adding quantum-resistant security. It applies quantum principal component analysis (QPCA) and the SWAP test to reduce the computational complexity and implement lattice-based cryptography, which quantum computers cannot break. Experimental evaluation demonstrates a significant overall speedup with improved accuracy. The proposed framework achieves a significant improvement in performance, provides 125-bit security against quantum attacks and compresses the data storage requirements significantly. These results demonstrate that quantum-enhanced face recognition can solve both the speed and security challenges facing current biometric systems, making it practical for real-world deployment as quantum technology advances.

TI Voltage detected single spin dynamics in diamond at ambient conditions
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Defect centres in crystals like diamond or silicon find a wide application in quantum technology, where the detection and control of their quantum states is crucial for their implementation as quantum sensors and qubits. The quantum information is usually encoded in the spin state of these defect centres, but they also often possess a charge which is typically not utilized. We report here the detection of elementary charges bound to single nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centres several nanometres below the diamond surface using Kelvin Probe Force Microscopy (KPFM) under laser illumination. Moreover, the measured signal depends on the NV's electron spin state, thus allowing to perform a non-optical single spin readout, a technique we refer to as "Surface Voltage Detected Magnetic Resonance" (SVDMR). Our method opens a way of coherent spin dynamics detection for quantum sensing applications and could be potentially applied to other solid state systems. We believe that this voltage-based readout would help to simplify the design of devices for quantum technology.

TI Control of microwave photon transmissions in microwave quantum networks
   by elastic scattering
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB Elastic scattering is one of the useful methods to control the transmission behaviors of microwave photons transporting in microwave quantum networks without energy consumption. Therefore, it is of practical significance for developing microwave quantum devices and constructing multi-node microwave quantum networks. The transmission line embedded by a single Josephson junction can be described by different circuit models (series and parallel). In this work, we first theoretically analyze the transmission characteristics of microwave photons scattered by different elastic scattering models described by series or parallel embedding models, generated by a single LC loop or a nonlinear Josephson junction device, respectively. The classical microwave transport theory predicts that the series LC loop and the parallel LC loop lead to different elastic scattering behaviors of microwave photons, i.e. the series LC circuit yields the resonant reflection and the parallel LC circuit leads alternatively to the resonant transmission. Recently, the transport properties of microwave photons scattered by a Josephson junction embedded in a transmission line have been discussed, and the results suggested that the Josephson junction embedded in the transmission line can be described by a series embedding circuit, which implies the resonant reflection. We argue here that if the Josephson junction is embedded in parallel in the transmission line, the elastically scattered microwave photons should be transmitted by resonant transmission. In order to test which of the above two different embedding circuit models yielding the completely different elastic scattering behaviors, is physically correct, we then fabricate such a device, i.e. a single Joseph junction device embedded in a transmission line, and measure its elastic scattering transmission coefficient at an extremely low temperature. The results are consistent with the expected effect of the parallel embedding circuit model, but inconsistent with the behaviors predicted by the series embedding circuit model in the literature. According to the above theoretical and experimental analyses of the elastic scattering of a single Josephson junction device, we further propose a scheme to control the elastic scattering behavior of microwave photons by modulating a DC superconducting quantum interference device with a bypass current, which can be applied to the construction of a microwave quantum network based on elastic scattering node controls.

TI On-Demand Single-Photon Extraction for Underwater Quantum Communication
SO PROGRESS IN ELECTROMAGNETICS RESEARCH LETTERS
AB Single-photon sources with high repetition rates have been a focal point of modern research for decades. However, their application in underwater environments is significantly limited due to the absorption properties of water, which hinder the propagation of most optical wavelengths. This study addresses the challenge by reporting on-demand single-photon extraction suitable for underwater quantum communication. The use of plasmonic nanoantennas can significantly enhance the spontaneous emission of single-photon sources. Nonetheless, a primary challenge is the nanoscale guiding of emitted photons in underwater environments. To overcome this, a more sophisticated design is required to enhance photon emission and achieve momentum matching with water. Here, we present a topology-optimized design of underwater plasmonic nanoantennas to mitigate these limitations. The nanoantenna consists of an optimized gold pattern and a silicon nitride substrate. Consequently, the normalized extraction decay rate (gamma(e)/gamma(0)) can reach 4.02 at a wavelength of 517 nm, which is within the blue-green spectral range, when using an objective lens with a numerical aperture of 0.6 (cross-section angle of 26.7(degrees)). The proposed design approach for plasmonic nanoantennas is versatile and holds promising potential for various applications, particularly in advancing single-photon technologies for quantum communication.

TI Time-reversed biphoton source of the double-Λ spontaneous four-wave
   mixing process
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Utilizing the double-Lambda spontaneous four-wave mixing (SFWM) process, the biphoton source generates narrow-linewidth pairs of signal and probe photons. In a medium, the signal photon propagates at nearly the speed of light in a vacuum, while the probe photon propagates as slow light. Typically, signal photons arrive at the detector first and are used as the heralding photons in conventional biphoton sources. In this work, we propose using probe photons as the heralding photons to enhance the heralding probability, an approach that has been overlooked previously. We also investigate a time-reversed double-Lambda SFWM biphoton source using heated atomic vapor. Compared with the conventional biphoton source under the same experimental conditions, the time-reversed one exhibits a time-reversed temporal profile with a similar full-width-at-half-maximum linewidth of 3.4 MHz, increased the heralding efficiency by a factor of 5.3, and enhanced the detection rate by 1.3 times. With the time-reversed source, we achieved a heralding probability of 82 +/- 6% and a generation rate of (1.8 +/- 0.2)x 106 pairs/s, referring to biphotons collected within polarization-maintained single-mode optical fibers. Furthermore, the time-reversed temporal profile is more suitable for quantum memory. Simulation results show that, at an optical depth of 150 (or 50), the storage efficiency of a quantum memory using the time-reversed source can reach 91% (or 81%), compared with 81% (or 67%) using the conventional source. This study demonstrates the significance of using the slow-light photon in biphoton pairs as the heralding photon for quantum operations. We have achieved a biphoton source with high heralding probability, high generation rate, and narrow linewidth in a room-temperature or hot medium.

TI A multi-channel quantum image representation model with qubit sequences
   for quantum-inspired image and image retrieval
SO AIMS MATHEMATICS
AB Quantum image processing (QIP) has become one of the most significant fields in quantum computing (QC); it merges quantum mechanics with image processing to improve classical image-processing speed, which involves various operations to advance quantum image representation (QIR). Accordingly, we introduce two new QIRs: The first is based on the wavelength and bit plane, called the quantum image representation bit plane (QIRBP), and the second is based on the wavelength and adjacency pixels, which is called the quantum image representation wavelength correlation (QIRWC). The QIRBP model uses b + 2n + 6 quantum bit (qubits) to store a digital color image of size 2n x 2n. In contrast, the QIRWC needs 2b + 4n + 8 qubits to store a digital color image of size 2n x 2n and to entangle the wavelength between two neighboring pixels. While the QIRWC approach is more complex, it is also more efficient on the basis of the transformation data. The complexity arises from the level of information being transmitted. In this work, two new representation methods (QIRBP and QIRWC) are proposed to overcome existing QIR weaknesses by enhancing storage efficiency, enabling compact high-resolution representation, improving data transformation through wavelength correlation and pixel adjacency, reducing noise, achieving greater versatility, and advancing scalable QIR. To prove the efficiency of the proposed methods, they were analyzed and compared with other efficient quantum image representations, outlining their similar and different aspects.

TI Universal constraint for relaxation rates of semigroups of qubit Schwarz
   maps
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS A-MATHEMATICAL AND THEORETICAL
AB Unital qubit Schwarz maps interpolate between positive and completely positive maps. It is shown that the relaxation rates of the qubit semigroups of unital maps enjoying the Schwarz property satisfy a universal constraint, which provides a modification of the corresponding constraint known for completely positive semigroups. As an illustration, we consider two paradigmatic qubit semigroups: Pauli dynamical maps and phase-covariant dynamics. This result has two interesting implications: it provides a universal constraint for the spectra of qubit Schwarz maps and gives rise to a necessary condition for a Schwarz qubit map to be Markovian.

TI Topological quantum computation on a chiral Kondo chain
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB We describe the chiral Kondo chain model based on the symplectic Kondo effect and demonstrate that it has a quantum critical ground state populated by non-Abelian anyons. We show that the fusion channel of two arbitrary anyons can be detected by locally coupling the two anyons to an extra single channel of chiral current and measuring the corresponding conductance at a finite frequency. Based on such measurements, we propose that the chiral Kondo chain model with symplectic symmetry can be used for the implementation of measurement-only topological quantum computations, and it possesses several distinct features favorable for such applications. The sources and effects of errors in the proposed system are analyzed and possible material realizations are discussed.

TI Combining quantum processors with real-time classical communication
SO NATURE
AB Quantum computers process information with the laws of quantum mechanics. Current quantum hardware is noisy, can only store information for a short time and is limited to a few quantum bits, that is, qubits, typically arranged in a planar connectivity1. However, many applications of quantum computing require more connectivity than the planar lattice offered by the hardware on more qubits than is available on a single quantum processing unit (QPU). The community hopes to tackle these limitations by connecting QPUs using classical communication, which has not yet been proven experimentally. Here we experimentally realize error-mitigated dynamic circuits and circuit cutting to create quantum states requiring periodic connectivity using up to 142 qubits spanning two QPUs with 127 qubits each connected in real time with a classical link. In a dynamic circuit, quantum gates can be classically controlled by the outcomes of mid-circuit measurements within run-time, that is, within a fraction of the coherence time of the qubits. Our real-time classical link enables us to apply a quantum gate on one QPU conditioned on the outcome of a measurement on another QPU. Furthermore, the error-mitigated control flow enhances qubit connectivity and the instruction set of the hardware thus increasing the versatility of our quantum computers. Our work demonstrates that we can use several quantum processors as one with error-mitigated dynamic circuits enabled by a real-time classical link.
   A 142-qubit processor can be realized by connecting two smaller quantum processors using classical communications and circuit cutting.

TI Unidimensional Continuous Variable Quantum Key Distribution under Fast
   Fading Channel
SO ANNALEN DER PHYSIK
AB In this paper, the performance of a unidimensional continuous variable quantum key distribution protocol is analyzed using Gaussian modulated coherent state under fast fading channel. In the fast fading channel, both parties are connected in free space, resulting in a harsh propagation environment and pollution caused by atmospheric turbulence. This pollution makes it difficult for the communicators to determine the channel transmittance, which can only be estimated based on a probability distribution. To address this, only one modulator is used to code, which demonstrates performance equivalent to that of the symmetric modulated Gaussian coherent state protocol. The security of the protocol in the face of collective attacks is analyzed and it is proved that it can accept a certain amount of excessive channel noise while simplifying operations. Simultaneously, the impact of finite-key length effects on the protocol is analyzed. It is also demonstrated that this protocol can reduce costs within an acceptable range of performance losses, making it more practical.

TI Quantum simulation of conical intersections using trapped ions
SO NATURE CHEMISTRY
AB Conical intersections often control the reaction products of photochemical processes and occur when two electronic potential energy surfaces intersect. Theory predicts that the conical intersection will result in a geometric phase for a wavepacket on the ground potential energy surface, and although conical intersections have been observed experimentally, the geometric phase has not been directly observed in a molecular system. Here we use a trapped atomic ion system to perform a quantum simulation of a conical intersection. The ion's internal state serves as the electronic state, and the motion of the atomic nuclei is encoded into the motion of the ions. The simulated electronic potential is constructed by applying state-dependent optical forces to the ion. We experimentally observe a clear manifestation of the geometric phase using adiabatic state preparation followed by motional state measurement. Our experiment shows the advantage of combining spin and motion degrees for quantum simulation of chemical reactions.

TI Resource estimate for quantum many-body ground-state preparation on a
   quantum computer
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We estimate the resources required to prepare the ground state of a quantum many-body system on a quantum computer of intermediate size. This estimate is made possible using a combination of quantum many-body methods and analytic upper bounds. Our routine can also be used to optimize certain design parameters for specific problem instances. Lastly, we propose and benchmark an improved quantum state preparation procedure. We find that it reduces the circuit T-depth by a factor as large as 10(6) for intermediate-size lattices.

TI Distributing entanglement with separable states: assessment of encoding
   and decoding imperfections
SO QUANTUM INFORMATION PROCESSING
AB Entanglement can be distributed using a carrier which is always separable from the rest of the systems involved. Up to now, this effect has predominantly been analyzed in the case where the carrier-system interactions take the form of ideal unitary operations, thus leaving untested its robustness against either non-unitary or unitary errors. We address this issue by considering the effect of incoherent dynamics acting alongside imperfect unitary interactions. In particular, we determine the restrictions that need to be placed on the interaction time, as well as the strength of the incoherent dynamics. We find that with non-unitary errors, we can still successfully distribute entanglement, provided we measure the carrier in a suitable basis. Introducing imperfections in the unitary dynamics, we show that entanglement gain is possible even with substantial unitary errors. Moreover, certain variations in the strength of the unitary dynamics can allow for greater robustness against non-unitary errors. Therefore, even in experimental settings where unitary operations cannot be carried out without imperfections, it is still possible to generate entanglement between two systems using a separable carrier.

TI High-rate continuous-variable quantum key distribution over 100 km fiber
   with composable security
SO OPTICA
AB Quantum key distribution (QKD), providing a way to generate secret keys with information-theoretic security, is arguably one of the most significant achievements in quantum information. The continuous-variable QKD (CV-QKD) offers the potential advantage of achieving a higher secret key rate (SKR) within a metro area, as well as being compatible with the mature telecom industry. However, the SKR and transmission distance of state-of-the-art CV-QKD systems are currently limited. Here, based on the proposed orthogonal-frequency-division-multiplexing (OFDM) CV-QKD protocol, we demonstrate a high-rate multi-carrier (MC) CV-QKD with a 10 GHz symbol rate that achieves Gbps SKR within 10 km and Mbps SKR over 100 km in the finite-size regime under composable security against collective attacks. The results are achieved by suitable optimization of subcarrier number and modulation variance, well-controlled excess noise induced by both the OFDM mechanism and the efficient DSP scheme, and high-performance post-processing capacity realized by the heterogeneous computing scheme. The composable finite-size SKR reaches 1779.45 Mbps@5 km, 1025.49 Mbps@10 km, 370.50 Mbps@25 km, 99.93 Mbps@50 km, 25.70 Mbps@75 km, and 2.25 Mbps@100 km, which improves the SKR by two orders of magnitude and quintuples the maximal transmission distance compared to the most recently reported CV-QKD results [Nat. Commun. 13,4740 (2022)]. Interestingly, it is experimentally verified that the SKR of the proposed MC CV-QKD can approach five times larger than that of the single-carrier CV-QKD with the same symbol rate without additional hardware costs. Our work constitutes a critical step toward future high-speed quantum metropolitan and access networks.

TI An enhanced approach for predicting air pollution using quantum support
   vector machine
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB The essence of quantum machine learning is to optimize problem-solving by executing machine learning algorithms on quantum computers and exploiting potent laws such as superposition and entanglement. Support vector machine (SVM) is widely recognized as one of the most effective classification machine learning techniques currently available. Since, in conventional systems, the SVM kernel technique tends to sluggish down and even fail as datasets become increasingly complex or jumbled. To compare the execution time and accuracy of conventional SVM classification to that of quantum SVM classification, the appropriate quantum features for mapping need to be selected. As the dataset grows complex, the importance of selecting an appropriate feature map that outperforms or performs as well as the classification grows. This paper utilizes conventional SVM to select an optimal feature map and benchmark dataset for predicting air quality. Experimental evidence demonstrates that the precision of quantum SVM surpasses that of classical SVM for air quality assessment. Using quantum labs from IBM's quantum computer cloud, conventional and quantum computing have been compared. When applied to the same dataset, the conventional SVM achieved an accuracy of 91% and 87% respectively, whereas the quantum SVM demonstrated an accuracy of 97% and 94% respectively for air quality prediction. The study introduces the use of quantum Support Vector Machines (SVM) for predicting air quality. It emphasizes the novel method of choosing the best quantum feature maps. Through the utilization of quantum-enhanced feature mapping, our objective is to exceed the constraints of classical SVM and achieve unparalleled levels of precision and effectiveness. We conduct precise experiments utilizing IBM's state-of-the-art quantum computer cloud to compare the performance of conventional and quantum SVM algorithms on a shared dataset.

TI Tunable Josephson Generator for Qubit Excitation and Two-Tone
   Spectroscopy
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB We present a tunable Josephson generator that enables direct qubit excitation and two-tone spectroscopy while reducing cryogenic wiring complexity and thermal load. The device consists of a current-biased Josephson junction integrated with a superconducting spiral resonator, forming a microwave source that operates at cryogenic temperatures. Unlike conventional qubit drive setups that require coaxial microwave lines from room temperature to the base stage, our system requires only a single direct current (DC) bias line from room temperature. The generated microwave signal is delivered to the qubit via a short coaxial line between the 4 K and 20 mK stages, significantly reducing wiring complexity, thermal load in the cryostat and leveraging unused volume at the 4 K stage. We demonstrate continuous-wave excitation of a superconducting qubit and perform tunable two-tone spectroscopy using the Josephson generator as the drive source, resolving qubit spectra with performance comparable to a standard microwave source. Our generator is characterized by low phase noise and can be phase-locked to an external reference for enhanced stability. Operating at 4 K temperature, this self-contained source offers a low-noise, space-efficient solution for qubit control and spectroscopy, paving the way for scalable cryogenic quantum control architectures.

TI Two-way unclonable encryption with a vulnerable sender
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Unclonable Encryption, introduced by Gottesman in 2003 [Quantum Inform. Comput. 3 (2003) 581], is a quantum protocol that guarantees the secrecy of a successfully transferred classical message even when all keys leak at a later time. We propose an Unclonable Encryption protocol with the additional property that the sender's key material is allowed to leak even in the case of an unsuccessful run. This extra feature makes it possible to achieve secure quantum encryption even when one of the parties is unable to protect its keys against after-protocol theft. Such an asymmetry occurs e.g. in case of server-client scenarios, where the client device is resource constrained and/or located in a hostile environment. Our protocol makes use of a bidirectional quantum channel in a manner similar to the two-way protocol LM05 [Phys. Rev. Lett. 94 (2005) 140501]. Bob sends random qubit states to Alice. Alice flips the states in a way that depends on the message and a shared key, and sends the resulting states back to Bob. Bob recovers Alice's message by measuring the flips. We prove that our protocol satisfies the definition of unclonable encryption and additionally that the message remains secure even if all of Alice's keys leak after the protocol. Furthermore, we show that some of the key materials can be safely re-used. Our security proof is formulated in terms of diamond norms, which makes it composable, and allows for noisy quantum channels. We work out the details only for the asymptotics in the limit of long messages. As a side result, we construct a two-way QKD scheme with a high key rate. We show that its key rate is higher than the rate of the two-way QKD scheme LM05 proven by Beaudry et al. [Phys. Rev. A 88 (2013) 062302] for the case of independent channel noise.

TI High-Throughput Post-Quantum Cryptographic System: CRYSTALS-Kyber with
   Computational Scheduling and Architecture Optimization
SO ELECTRONICS
AB With the development of a quantum computer in the near future, classical public-key cryptography will face the challenge of being vulnerable to quantum algorithms, such as Shor's algorithm. As communication technology advances rapidly, a great deal of personal information is being transmitted over the Internet. Based on our observation that the Kyber algorithm exhibits a significant number of idle cycles during execution when implemented following the conventional software procedure, this paper proposes a high-throughput scheduling for Kyber by parallelizing the SHA-3 function, the sampling algorithm, and the NTT computations to improve hardware utilization and reduce latency. We also introduce the 8-stage pipelined SHA-3 architecture and multi-mode polynomial arithmetic module to increase area efficiency. By also optimizing the hardware architecture of the various computational modules used by Kyber, according to the implementation result, an aggregate throughput of 877.192 kOPS in Kyber KEM can be achieved on TSMC 40 nm. In addition, our design not only achieves the highest throughput among existing studies but also improves the area and power efficiencies.

TI Cooling a Qubit Using n Others
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB In the task of unitarily cooling a quantum system with access to a larger quantum system, known as the machine or reservoir, how does the structure of the machine impact an agent's ability to cool and the complexity of their cooling protocol? Focusing on the task of cooling a single qubit given access to n separable, thermal qubits with arbitrary energy structure, we answer these questions by giving two new perspectives on this task. First, we show that a set of inequalities related to the energetic structure of the n-qubit machine determines the protocol which cools the qubit to the coldest reachable state, which parts of the machine contribute to this protocol and give rise to a Carnot-like bound. Second, we show that cooling protocols can be represented as perfect matchings on bipartite graphs enabling the optimization of cost functions, e.g., gate complexity or dissipation. Our results generalize the algorithmic cooling problem, establish new fundamental bounds on quantum cooling and offer a framework for designing novel autonomous thermal machines and cooling algorithms.

TI Quantum Nanophotonics in Two-Dimensional Materials
SO ACS PHOTONICS
AB The field of two-dimensional (2D) materials-based nanophotonics has been growing at a rapid pace, triggered by the ability to design nanophotonic systems with in situ control, unprecedented number of degrees of freedom, and to build material heterostructures from the bottom up with atomic precision. A wide palette of polaritonic dasses have been identified, comprising ultraconfined optical fields, even approaching characteristic lengthscales of a single atom. These advances have been a real boost for the emerging field of quantum nanophotonics, where the quantum mechanical nature of the electrons and polaritons and their interactions become relevant. Examples include quantum nonlocal effects, ultrastrong light-matter interactions, Cherenkov radiation, access to forbidden transitions, hydrodynamic effects, single-plasmon nonlinearities, polaritonic quantization, topological effects, and so on. In addition to these intrinsic quantum nanophotonic phenomena, 2D material systems can also be used as sensitive probes for the quantum properties of the material that carries the nanophotonics modes or quantum materials in its vicinity. Here, polaritons act as a probe for otherwise invisible excitations, for example, in superconductors, or as a new tool to monitor the existence of Berry curvature in topological materials and superlattice effects in twisted 2D materials. In this Perspective, we present an overview of the emergent field of 2D-material quantum nanophotonics and provide a future perspective on the prospects of both fundamental emergent phenomena and emergent quantum technologies, such as quantum sensing, single-photon sources, and quantum emitters manipulation. We address four main implications: (i) quantum sensing, featuring polaritons to probe superconductivity and explore new electronic transport hydrodynamic behaviors, (ii) quantum technologies harnessing single-photon generation, manipulation, and detection using 2D materials, (iii) polariton engineering with quantum materials enabled by twist angle and stacking order control in van der Waals heterostructures, and (iv) extreme light-matter interactions enabled by the strong confinement of light at atomic level by 2D materials, which provide new tools to manipulate light fields at the nanoscale (e.g., quantum chemistry, nonlocal effects, high Purcell enhancement).

TI High-Performance and Reliable Probabilistic Ising Machine Based on
   Simulated Quantum Annealing
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW X
AB Probabilistic computing with p-bits is emerging as a computational paradigm for machine learning and for facing combinatorial optimization problems (COPs) with the so-called probabilistic Ising machines (PIMs). From a hardware point of view, the key elements that characterize a PIM are the random number generation, the nonlinearity, the network of coupled probabilistic bits, and the energy-minimization algorithm. Regarding the energy-minimization algorithm in this work we show that PIMs using the simulated quantum annealing (SQA) schedule exhibit better performance as compared to simulated annealing and parallel tempering in solving a number of COPs, such as maximum satisfiability problems, the planted Ising problem, and the traveling salesman problem. Additionally, we design and simulate the architecture of a fully connected CMOS-based PIM that is able to run the SQA algorithm having a spinupdate time of 8 ns with a power consumption of 0.22 mW. Our results also show that SQA increases the reliability and the scalability of PIMs by compensating for device variability at an algorithmic level enabling the development of their implementation combining CMOS with different technologies such as spintronics. This work shows that the characteristics of the SQA are hardware agnostic and can be applied in the codesign of any hybrid analog-digital Ising machine implementation. Our results open a promising direction for the implementation of a new generation of reliable and scalable PIMs.

TI Dispersive qubit readout of temperature
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Squeezed light can exponentially increase the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of dispersive qubit readout, especially using a combination of injected external squeezing (IES) and intracavity squeezing (ICS). We further investigate whether IES and ICS can also exponentially improve the measurement precision of temperature. In the case of fully thermalized qubits isolated from a thermal bath, the measurement precision of temperature can be improved exponentially when the temperature, the measurement time, or the input photon number approaches 0. In general, thermal fluctuations prevent the action of squeezed light. When multiple qubits maintain interacting with the thermal bath, the Heisenberg scaling can be achieved if the loss rate of the cavity is large and the coupling between the qubit and the optical cavity is weak enough. In the meantime, IES can also further promote the improvement of the measurement precision of the temperature exponentially.

TI Measurement-device-independent quantum key distribution with insecure
   sources
SO OPTICS LETTERS
AB Measurement-device-independent quantum key distribution (MDI-QKD) can remove all detection side channels but still makes additional assumptions on sources that can be compromised through uncharacterized side channels in practice. Here, we combine a recently proposed reference technique to prove the security of MDI-QKD against possible source imperfections and/or side channels. This requires some reference states and an upper bound on the parameter that describes the quality of the sources. With this formalism we investigate the asymptotic performance of single-photon sources, and the results show that the side channels have a great impact on the key rates.

TI Teleportation-based speed meter for precision measurement
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB We propose a quantum teleportation-based speed meter for interferometric displacement sensing. The primary motivation is to transform a conventional position-sensing interferometer into a quantum non-demolition speed measurement device, without modifying its fundamental optical configuration. Two equivalent implementations are presented: an online approach that uses real-time displacement operation and an offline approach that relies on post-processing. Both implementations reduce quantum radiation pressure noise and surpass the standard quantum limit of measuring displacement, and they can be applied to a wide range of interferometer configurations. We discuss potential applications to gravitational-wave detectors, where our scheme enhances low-frequency sensitivity without requiring modifications to the core optics of a conventional Michelson interferometer (e.g., substrate or coating properties). This approach offers a new path to back-action evasion enabled by quantum entanglement.

TI Improved statistical fluctuation analysis for two decoy-states
   phase-matching quantum key distribution
SO CHINESE PHYSICS B
AB Phase-matching quantum key distribution is a promising scheme for remote quantum key distribution, breaking through the traditional linear key-rate bound. In practical applications, finite data size can cause significant system performance to deteriorate when data size is below 10(10). In this work, an improved statistical fluctuation analysis method is applied for the first time to two decoy-states phase-matching quantum key distribution, offering a new insight and potential solutions for improving the key generation rate and the maximum transmission distance while maintaining security. Moreover, we also compare the influence of the proposed improved statistical fluctuation analysis method on system performance with those of the Gaussian approximation and Chernoff-Hoeffding boundary methods on system performance. The simulation results show that the proposed scheme significantly improves the key generation rate and maximum transmission distance in comparison with the Chernoff-Hoeffding approach, and approach the results obtained when the Gaussian approximation is employed. At the same time, the proposed scheme retains the same security level as the Chernoff-Hoeffding method, and is even more secure than the Gaussian approximation.

TI Achieving the volume-law entropy regime with random-sign Dicke states
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Manipulating entanglement, which reflects nonlocal correlations in a quantum system and defines the complexity of describing its wave function, represents the extremely tough challenge in the fields of quantum computing, quantum information, and condensed matter physics. In this work, by the example of the well- structured Dicke states we demonstrate that the complexity of these real-valued wave functions can be accurately tuned by introducing a random-sign structure, which allows us to explore the regime of the volume-law entanglement. Importantly, setting nontrivial sign structure one can increase the entanglement entropy of the Dicke state to the values that are close to Page's estimates for Haar-random states. The practical realization of these random-sign Dicke states is possible on different physical platforms with shallow quantum circuits. On the level of the measurements the change in the quantum state complexity due to sign structure can be traced out with the dissimilarity measure that estimates multiscale variety of patterns in bit-string arrays.

TI Quantum Algorithms Applied to Satellite Mission Planning for Earth
   Observation
SO IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE
   SENSING
AB Earth imaging satellites are a crucial part of our everyday lives that enable global tracking of industrial activities. Use cases span many applications, from weather forecasting to digital maps, carbon footprint tracking, and vegetation monitoring. However, there are limitations; satellites are difficult to manufacture, expensive to maintain, and tricky to launch into orbit. Therefore, satellites must be employed efficiently. This poses a challenge known as the satellite mission planning problem, which could be computationally prohibitive to solve on large scales. However, close-to-optimal algorithms, such as greedy reinforcement learning and optimization algorithms can often provide satisfactory resolutions. This article introduces a set of quantum algorithms to solve the mission planning problem and demonstrate an advantage over the classical algorithms implemented thus far. The problem is formulated as maximizing the number of high-priority tasks completed on real datasets containing thousands of tasks and multiple satellites. This work demonstrates that through solution-chaining and clustering, optimization and machine learning algorithms offer the greatest potential for optimal solutions. This article notably illustrates that a hybridized quantum-enhanced reinforcement learning agent can achieve a completion percentage of 98.5% over high-priority tasks, significantly improving over the baseline greedy methods with a completion rate of 75.8%. The results presented in this work pave the way to quantum-enabled solutions in the space industry and, more generally, future mission planning problems across industries.

TI Memory-Optimized Cubic Splines for High-Fidelity Quantum Operations
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM ENGINEERING
AB Radio frequency pulses are preponderant for the control of quantum bits and the execution of operations in quantum computers. The ability to fine-tune key pulse parameters, such as time-dependent amplitude, phase, and frequency, is essential to achieve maximal gate fidelity and mitigate errors. As systems increase in scale, a larger proportion of the control electronic processing will move closer to the qubits, to enhance integration and minimize latency in operations requiring fast feedback. This will constrain the space available in the memory of the control electronics to load time-resolved pulse parameters at high sampling rates. Cubic spline interpolation is a powerful and commonly used technique that divides the pulse into segments of cubic polynomials. We show an optimized implementation of this strategy, using a two-stage curve-fitting process and additional symmetry operations to load a high-sampling pulse output on an field-programmable gate array. This results in a favorable accuracy-versus-memory-footprint tradeoff. By simulating single-qubit population transfer and atom transport on a neutral-atom device, we show that high fidelities can be achieved with low memory requirements. This is instrumental for scaling up the number of qubits and gate operations in environments where memory is a limited resource.

TI Quantum Electrodynamics in a Topological Waveguide
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW X
AB While designing the energy-momentum relation of photons is key to many linear, nonlinear, and quantum optical phenomena, a new set of light-matter properties may be realized by employing the topology of the photonic bath itself. In this work we experimentally investigate the properties of superconducting qubits coupled to a metamaterial waveguide based on a photonic analog of the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model. We explore topologically induced properties of qubits coupled to such a waveguide, ranging from the formation of directional qubit-photon bound states to topology-dependent cooperative radiation effects. Addition of qubits to this waveguide system also enables direct quantum control over topological edge states that form in finite waveguide systems, useful for instance in constructing a topologically protected quantum communication channel. More broadly, our work demonstrates the opportunity that topological waveguide-QED systems offer in the synthesis and study of many-body states with exotic long-range quantum correlations.

TI Harnessing the Power of Long-Range Entanglement for Clifford Circuit
   Synthesis
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM ENGINEERING
AB In superconducting architectures, limited connectivity remains a significant challenge for the synthesis and compilation of quantum circuits. We consider models of entanglement-assisted computation where long-range operations are achieved through injections of large Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) states. These are prepared using ancillary qubits acting as an "entanglement bus," unlocking global operation primitives such as multiqubit Pauli rotations and fan-out gates. We derive bounds on the circuit size for several well-studied problems, such as CZ circuit, CX circuit, and Clifford circuit synthesis. In particular, in an architecture using one such entanglement bus, we give a synthesis scheme for arbitrary Clifford operations requiring at most 2n+1 layers of entangled state injections, which can be computed classically in O(n(3)) time. In a square-lattice architecture with two entanglement buses, we show that a graph state can be synthesized using at most [1/2n]+1 layers of GHZ state injections, and Clifford operations require only [3/2n]+ O(root n) layers of GHZ state injections.

TI Self-Testing Mutually Unbiased Bases in Higher Dimensions with
   Space-Division Multiplexing Optical Fiber Technology
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB In the device-independent quantum-information approach, the implementation of a given task can be self-tested solely from the recorded statistics and without detailed models for the employed devices. Even though experimentally demanding, it provides appealing verification schemes for advanced quantum technologies that naturally fulfil the associated requirements. In this work, we experimentally study whether self-testing protocols can be adopted to certify the proper functioning of quantum devices built with modern space-division multiplexing optical fiber technology. Specifically, we consider the prepare-and-measure protocol of Farkas and Kaniewski [Phys. Rev. A 99, 032316 (2019)] for self-testing measurements corresponding to mutually unbiased bases (MUBs) in a dimension d > 2. In our scheme, the state preparation and measurement stages are implemented using a multiarm interferometer built with multicore optical fibers and related components. Due to the high overlap of the interferometer's optical modes achieved with this technology, we are able to reach the required visibilities for self-testing the implementation of two four-dimensional MUBs. We also quantify two operational quantities of the measurements: (i) the incompatibility robustness, connected to Bell violations, and (ii) the randomness extractable from the outcomes. Since MUBs lie at the core of several quantum-information protocols, our results are of practical interest for future quantum works relying on space-division multiplexing optical fibers.

TI Today's interdisciplinary quantum information classroom: Themes from a

SO PHYSICAL REVIEW PHYSICS EDUCATION RESEARCH
AB Interdisciplinary introduction to quantum information science (QIS) courses are proliferating at universities across the US, but the experiences of instructors in these courses have remained largely unexplored in the discipline-based education research (DBER) communities. Hem, we address this gap by reporting on the findings of a survey of instructors teaching introduction to QIS courses at institutions across the U.S., primarily at the undergraduate or hybrid undergraduate and graduate level, as well as follow-up focus interviews with six individual instructors. Key themes from this analysis include challenges and opportunities associated with the diversity of instructor and student backgrounds, student difficulties with the mathematical formalism (especially though not exclusively with linear algebra), and the need for better textbooks and curricular materials. We also find that while course topics are ostensibly similar, each course is crafted by its instructor to tell a different story about QIS and to uniquely balance goals such as accessibility and academic rigor, such that no canonical introduction to QIS course emerges from our dataset. We discuss the implications of this finding with regard to the benefits and risks associated with standardization of curricula as QIS coursework matures.

TI Learning Infused Quantum-Classical Distributed Optimization Technique
   for Power Generation Scheduling
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM ENGINEERING
AB The advent of quantum computing can potentially revolutionize how complex problems are solved. This article proposes a two-loop quantum-classical solution algorithm for generation scheduling by infusing quantum computing, machine learning, and distributed optimization. The aim is to facilitate employing noisy near-term quantum machines with a limited number of qubits to solve practical power system optimization problems, such as generation scheduling. The outer loop is a three-block quantum alternating direction method of multipliers (QADMM) algorithm that decomposes the generation scheduling problem into three subproblems, including one quadratically unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) and two non-QUBOs. The inner loop is a trainable quantum approximate optimization algorithm (T-QAOA) for solving QUBO on a quantum computer. The proposed T-QAOA translates interactions of quantum-classical machines as sequential information and uses a recurrent neural network to estimate variational parameters of the quantum circuit with a proper sampling technique. The T-QAOA determines the QUBO solution in a few quantum-learner iterations instead of hundreds of iterations needed for a quantum-classical solver. The outer three-block alternating direction method of multipliers coordinates QUBO and non-QUBO solutions to obtain the solution to the original problem. The conditions under which the proposed QADMM is guaranteed to converge are discussed. Two mathematical and three generation scheduling cases are studied. Analyses performed on quantum simulators and classical computers show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. The advantages of T-QAOA are discussed and numerically compared with QAOA, which uses a stochastic-gradient-descent-based optimizer.

TI Neural network-based prediction of the secret-key rate of quantum key
   distribution
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Numerical methods are widely used to calculate the secure key rate of many quantum key distribution protocols in practice, but they consume many computing resources and are too time-consuming. In this work, we take the homodyne detection discrete-modulated continuous-variable quantum key distribution (CV-QKD) as an example, and construct a neural network that can quickly predict the secure key rate based on the experimental parameters and experimental results. Compared to traditional numerical methods, the speed of the neural network is improved by several orders of magnitude. Importantly, the predicted key rates are not only highly accurate but also highly likely to be secure. This allows the secure key rate of discrete-modulated CV-QKD to be extracted in real time on a low-power platform. Furthermore, our method is versatile and can be extended to quickly calculate the complex secure key rates of various other unstructured quantum key distribution protocols.

TI Genuine multipartite entanglement in a one-dimensional Bose-Hubbard
   model with frustrated hopping
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB Frustration and quantum entanglement are two exotic quantum properties in quantum many-body systems. However, despite several efforts, an exact relationship between them remains elusive. In this work, we explore the relationship between frustration and quantum entanglement in a physical model describing strongly correlated ultracold bosonic atoms in optical lattices. In particular, we consider the one-dimensional Bose-Hubbard model comprising both nearest-neighbor (t(1)) and frustrated next-nearest neighbor (t(2)) hoppings and examine how the interplay of on-site interaction (U) and hoppings results in different quantum correlations dominating the ground state of the system. We then analyze the behavior of quantum entanglement in the model. In particular, we compute genuine multipartite entanglement as quantified through the generalized geometric measure and make a comparative study with bipartite entanglement and other relevant order parameters. We observe that genuine multipartite entanglement has a very rich behavior throughout the considered parameter regime and frustration does not necessarily favor generating a high amount of it. Moreover, we show that in the region with strong quantum fluctuations, the particles remain highly delocalized in all momentum modes and share a very low amount of both bipartite and multipartite entanglement. Our work illustrates the necessity to give separate attention to dominating ordering behavior and quantum entanglement in the ground state of strongly correlated systems.

TI Quantum Image Processing: Opportunities and Challenges
SO MATHEMATICAL PROBLEMS IN ENGINEERING
AB Quantum image processing (QIP) is a research branch of quantum information and quantum computing. It studies how to take advantage of quantum mechanics' properties to represent images in a quantum computer and then, based on that image format, implement various image operations. Due to the quantum parallel computing derived from quantum state superposition and entanglement, QIP has natural advantages over classical image processing. But some related works misuse the notion of quantum superiority and mislead the research of QIP, which leads to a big controversy. In this paper, after describing this field's research status, we list and analyze the doubts about QIP and argue "quantum image classification and recognition" would be the most significant opportunity to exhibit the real quantum superiority. We present the reasons for this judgment and dwell on the challenges for this opportunity in the era of NISQ (Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum).

TI Fast Quantum State Discrimination with Nonlinear Positive
   Trace-Preserving Channels
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB Models of nonlinear quantum computation based on deterministic positive trace-preserving (PTP) channels and evolution equations are investigated. The models are defined in any finite Hilbert space, but the main results are for dimension N=2$ N \! = \! 2$. For every normalizable linear or nonlinear positive map phi on bounded linear operators X, there is an associated normalized PTP channel phi(X)/tr[phi(X)]$ \phi (X) / {\rm tr}[\phi (X)]$. Normalized PTP channels include unitary mean field theories, such as the Gross-Pitaevskii equation for interacting bosons, as well as models of linear and nonlinear dissipation. They classify into four types, yielding three distinct forms of nonlinearity whose computational power are explored. In the qubit case, these channels support Bloch ball torsion and other distortions studied previously, where it has been shown that such nonlinearity can be used to increase the separation between a pair of close qubit states, suggesting an exponential speedup for state discrimination. Building on this idea, the authors argue that this operation can be made robust to noise by using dissipation to induce a bifurcation to a novel phase where a pair of attracting fixed points create an intrinsically fault-tolerant nonlinear state discriminator.

TI Genuine multipartite entanglement in time
SO SCIPOST PHYSICS
AB While spatial quantum correlations have been studied in great detail, much less is known about the genuine quantum correlations that can be exhibited by temporal processes. Employing the quantum comb formalism, processes in time can be mapped onto quantum states, with the crucial difference that temporal correlations have to satisfy causal ordering, while their spatial counterpart is not constrained in the same way. Here, we exploit this equivalence and use the tools of multipartite entanglement theory to provide a comprehensive picture of the structure of correlations that (causally ordered) temporal quantum processes can display. First, focusing on the case of a process that is probed at two points in time - which can equivalently be described by a tripartite quantum state - we provide necessary as well as sufficient conditions for the presence of bipartite entanglement in different splittings. Next, we connect these scenarios to the previously studied concepts of quantum memory, entanglement breaking superchannels, and quantum steering, thus providing both a physical interpretation for entanglement in temporal quantum processes, and a determination of the resources required for its creation. Additionally, we construct explicit examples of W-type and GHZ-type genuinely multipartite entangled two-time processes and prove that genuine multipartite entanglement in temporal processes can be an emergent phenomenon. Finally, we show that genuinely entangled processes across multiple times exist for any number of probing times.

TI Nonadiabatic molecular dynamics on quantum computers: challenges and
   opportunities
SO PURE AND APPLIED CHEMISTRY
AB In this Perspective, we discuss how quantum computers may advance the simulation of nonadiabatic molecular dynamics, a framework central to describing excited-state processes in photochemistry, biology, and materials science. Classical approaches span from exponentially scaling full quantum dynamics to more approximate mixed quantum-classical techniques such as surface hopping and Ehrenfest dynamics. Hybrid quantum-classical algorithms - particularly those based on the variational quantum eigensolver - offer a transformative alternative by providing access to the key electronic properties needed to drive nonadiabatic molecular dynamics simulations, including energies, gradients, and nonadiabatic couplings. We examine recent proof-of-principle quantum simulations of reduced model systems which, despite being restricted to small molecules and limited active spaces due to constraints of qubit number and device noise, already showcase the potential of quantum devices to capture phenomena such as conical intersections and ultrafast relaxation. Although practical applications are not yet feasible in the present noisy intermediate-scale quantum era, these efforts underline the conceptual and methodological advances of quantum algorithms paving the way for large-scale quantum simulations of nonadiabatic processes. Framed within the 2025 International Year of Quantum Science and Technology, such progress exemplifies how quantum computing may open new horizons for chemistry and beyond.

TI Hexagons govern three-qubit contextuality
SO QUANTUM
AB Split Cayley hexagons of order two are distinguished finite geometries living in the three-qubit symplectic polar space in two different forms, called classical and skew. Although neither of the two yields observable-based contextual configurations of their own, classically-embedded copies are found to fully encode contextuality properties of the most prominent three-qubit contextual configurations in the following sense: for each set of unsatisfiable contexts of such a contextual configuration there exists some classically-embedded hexagon sharing with the configuration exactly this set of contexts and nothing else. We demonstrate this fascinating property first on the configuration comprising all 315 contexts of the space and then on doilies, both types of quadrics as well as on complements of skew-embedded hexagons. In connection with the lastmentioned case and elliptic quadrics we also conducted some experimental tests on a findings.

TI Simulating charging characteristics of lithium iron phosphate by
   electro-ionic optimization on a quantum annealer
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB The rapid evolution of quantum computing hardware opens up new avenues in the simulation of energy materials. Today's quantum annealers are able to tackle complex combinatorial optimization problems. A formidable challenge of this type is posed by materials with site-occupational disorder for which atomic arrangements with a low, or lowest, energy must be found. In this article, a method is presented for the identification of the correlated ground-state distribution of both lithium ions and redox electrons in lithium iron phosphate (LFP), a widely employed cathode material in lithium-ion batteries. The point-charge Coulomb energy model employed correctly reproduces the LFP charging characteristics. As is shown, grand-canonical transformation of the energy cost function makes the combinatorial distribution problem solvable on quantum annealing (QA) hardware. The QA output statistics follow a pseudothermal behavior characterized by a problem-dependent effective sampling temperature, which has bearings on the estimated scaling of the QA performance with system size. This work demonstrates the potential of quantum computation for the joint simulation of the electronic and ionic structure in energy materials.

TI Extracting Topological Orders of Generalized Pauli Stabilizer Codes in
   Two Dimensions
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB In this paper, we introduce an algorithm for extracting topological data from translation invariant generalized Pauli stabilizer codes in two-dimensional systems, focusing on the analysis of anyon excitations and string operators. The algorithm applies to Zd qudits, including instances where d is a nonprime number. This capability allows the identification of topological orders that differ from the Zd toric codes. It extends our understanding beyond the established theorem that Pauli stabilizer codes for Zp qudits (with p being a prime) are equivalent to finite copies of Zp toric codes and trivial stabilizers. The algorithm is designed to determine all anyons and their string operators, enabling the computation of their fusion rules, topological spins, and braiding statistics. The method converts the identification of topological orders into computational tasks, including Gaussian elimination, the Hermite normal form, and the Smith normal form of truncated Laurent polynomials. Furthermore, the algorithm provides a systematic approach for studying quantum error-correcting codes. We apply it to various codes, such as self-dual CSS quantum codes modified from the two-dimensional honeycomb color code and non-CSS quantum codes that contain the double semion topological order or the six-semion topological order.

TI Quasiprobabilistic Readout Correction of Midcircuit Measurements for
   Adaptive Feedback via Measurement Randomized Compiling
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Quantum measurements are a fundamental component of quantum computing. However, on presentday quantum computers, measurements can be more error prone than quantum gates and are susceptible to nonunital errors as well as nonlocal correlations due to measurement crosstalk. While readout errors can be mitigated in postprocessing, this is inefficient in the number of qubits due to a combinatorially large number of possible states that need to be characterized. In this work, we show that measurement errors can be tailored into a simple stochastic error model using randomized compiling, enabling the efficient mitigation of readout errors via quasiprobability distributions reconstructed from the measurement of a single preparation state in an exponentially large confusion matrix. We demonstrate the scalability and power of this approach by correcting readout errors without matrix inversion on a large number of different preparation states applied to a register of eight superconducting transmon qubits. Moreover, we show that this method can be extended to midcircuit measurements used for active feedback via quasiprobabilistic error cancellation, and we demonstrate the correction of measurement errors on an ancilla qubit used to detect and actively correct bit-flip errors on an entangled memory qubit. Our approach enables the correction of readout errors on large numbers of qubits and offers a strategy for correcting readout errors in adaptive circuits in which the results of midcircuit measurements are used to perform conditional operations on nonlocal qubits in real time.

TI Mitigating errors by quantum verification and postselection
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Correcting errors due to noise in quantum circuits run on current and near-term quantum hardware is essential for any convincing demonstration of quantum advantage. Indeed, in many cases it has been shown that noise renders quantum circuits efficiently classically simulable, thereby destroying any quantum advantage potentially offered by an ideal (noiseless) implementation of these circuits. Although the technique of quantum error correction (QEC) allows correcting these errors very accurately, QEC usually requires a large overhead of physical qubits which is not reachable with currently available quantum hardware. This has been the motivation behind the field of quantum error mitigation, which aims at developing techniques to correct an important part of the errors in quantum circuits, while also being compatible with current and near-term quantum hardware. In this work, we present a technique for quantum error mitigation which is based on a technique from quantum verification, the so-called accreditation protocol, together with postselection. Our technique allows for correcting the expectation value of an observable O, which is the output of multiple runs of noisy quantum circuits, where the noise in these circuits is at the level of preparations, gates, and measurements. We discuss the sample complexity of our procedure and provide rigorous guarantees of errors being mitigated under some realistic assumptions on the noise. Our technique is tailored to time-dependent behaviors, as we allow for the output states to be different between different runs of the accreditation protocol. We validate our findings by running our technique on currently available quantum hardware.

TI Noncommutative metasurfaces enabled diverse quantum path entanglement of
   structured photons
SO OPTO-ELECTRONIC SCIENCE
AB Quantum entanglement, a fundamental concept in quantum mechanics, lies at the heart of many current and future quantum technologies. A pivotal task is the generation and control of diverse quantum entangled states in a more compact and flexible manner. Here, we introduce an approach to achieve diverse path entanglement by exploiting the interaction between noncommutative metasurfaces and entangled photons. Different from other path entanglements, our quantum path entanglement is evolution path entanglement of photons on Poincar & eacute; sphere. Due to quantum entanglement between idler photons and structured signal photons, evolution path of idler photons on the fundamental Poincar & eacute; sphere can be nonlocally mirrored by structured signal photons on any higher-order Poincar & eacute; sphere, resulting in quantum path entanglement. Benefiting from noncommutative metasurfaces, diverse quantum path entanglement can be switched across different higher-order Poincar & eacute; spheres using distinct combination sequences of metasurfaces. Our method allows for the tuning of diverse quantum path entanglement across a broad spectrum of quantum states, offering a significant advancement in the manipulation of quantum entanglement.

TI General implementation of quantum physics-informed neural networks

AB Recently, a novel type of Neural Network (NNs): the Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs), was discovered to have many applications in computational physics. By integrating knowledge of physical laws and processes in Partial Differential Equations (PDEs), fast convergence and effective solutions are obtained. Since training modern Machine Learning (ML) systems is a computationally intensive endeavour, using Quantum Computing (QC) in the ML pipeline attracts increasing interest. Indeed, since several Quantum Machine Learning (QML) algorithms have already been implemented on present-day noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices, experts expect that ML on reliable, large-scale quantum computers will soon become a reality. However, after potential benefits from quantum speedup, QML may also entail reliability, trustworthiness, safety, and security risks. To solve the challenges of QML, we combine classical information processing, quantum manipulation, and processing with PINNs to accomplish a hybrid QML model named quantum based PINNs.

TI A Quantum Approach to News Verification from the Perspective of a News
   Aggregator
SO INFORMATION
AB In the dynamic landscape of digital information, the rise of misinformation and fake news presents a pressing challenge. This paper takes a completely new approach to verifying news, inspired by how quantum actors can reach agreement even when they are spatially spread out. We propose a radically new-to the best of our knowledge-algorithm that uses quantum "entanglement" (think of it as a special connection) to help news aggregators "sniff out" bad actors, whether they are other news sources or even fact-checkers trying to spread misinformation. This algorithm does not rely on quantum signatures; it merely uses basic quantum technology which we already have, in particular, special pairs of particles called "EPR pairs" that are much easier to create than other options. More elaborate entangled states are like juggling too many balls-they are difficult to make and slow things down, especially when many players are involved. So, we adhere to Bell states, the simplest form of entanglement, which are easy to generate no matter how many players are involved. This means that our algorithm is faster to set up, works for any number of participants, and is more practical for real-world use. Additionally, as a "bonus point", it finishes in a fixed number of steps, regardless of how many players are involved, making it even more scalable. This new approach may lead to a powerful and efficient way to fight misinformation in the digital age, using the weird and wonderful world of quantum mechanics.

TI Investigating the potential for a limited quantum speedup on protein
   lattice problems
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB Protein folding is a central challenge in computational biology, with important applications in molecular biology, drug discovery and catalyst design. As a hard combinatorial optimisation problem, it has been studied as a potential target problem for quantum annealing. Although several experimental implementations have been discussed in the literature, the computational scaling of these approaches has not been elucidated. In this article, we present a numerical study of quantum annealing applied to a large number of small peptide folding problems, aiming to infer useful insights for near-term applications. We present two conclusions: that even naive quantum annealing, when applied to protein lattice folding, has the potential to outperform classical approaches, and that careful engineering of the Hamiltonians and schedules involved can deliver notable relative improvements for this problem. Overall, our results suggest that quantum algorithms may well offer improvements for problems in the protein folding and structure prediction realm.

TI Deterministic Loading of Microwaves onto an Artificial Atom Using a

SO NANO LETTERS
AB Loading quantum information deterministically onto a quantum node is an important step toward a quantum network. Here, we demonstrate that coherent-state microwave photons with an optimal temporal waveform can be efficiently loaded onto a single superconducting artificial atom in a semi-infinite one-dimensional (1D) transmission-line waveguide. Using a weak coherent state (the number of photons (N) contained in the pulse MUCH LESS-THAN1) with an exponentially rising waveform, whose time constant matches the decoherence time of the artificial atom, we demonstrate a loading efficiency of 94.2% +/- 0.7% from 1D semifree space to the artificial atom. The high loading efficiency is due to time-reversal symmetry: the overlap between the incoming wave and the time-reversed emitted wave is up to 97.1% +/- 0.4%. Our results open up promising applications in realizing quantum networks based on waveguide quantum electrodynamics.

TI A Comparative Study of Quantum Haar Wavelet and Quantum Fourier
   Transforms for Quantum Image Transmission
SO INFORMATION
AB Quantum communication has achieved significant performance gains compared to classical systems but remains sensitive to channel noise and decoherence. These limitations become especially critical in quantum image transmission, where high-dimensional visual data must be preserved with both structural fidelity and robustness. In this context, transform-based quantum encoding methods have emerged as promising approaches, yet their relative performance under noisy conditions has not been fully explored. This paper presents a comparative study of two such methods, the quantum Fourier transform (QFT) and the quantum Haar wavelet transform (QHWT), within an image transmission framework. The process begins with source coding (JPEG/HEIF), followed by channel coding to enhance error resilience. The bitstreams are then mapped into quantum states using variable qubit encoding and transformed using either QFT or QHWT prior to transmission over noisy quantum channels. At the receiver, the corresponding decoding operations are applied to reconstruct the images. Simulation results demonstrate that the QFT achieves superior performance under noisy conditions, consistently delivering higher Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR), Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM), and Universal Quality Index (UQI) values across different qubit sizes and image formats compared to the QHWT. This advantage arises because QFT uniformly spreads information across all basis states, making it more resilient to noise. By contrast, QHWT generates localized coefficients that capture structural details effectively but become highly vulnerable when dominant coefficients are corrupted. Consequently, while QHWT emphasizes structural fidelity, QFT provides superior robustness, underscoring a fundamental trade-off in quantum image communication.

TI Radial polarization imaging of entangled biphoton state
SO APL PHOTONICS
AB Polarization entanglement of single photons is a key element to enable quantum 2.0 applications, such as quantum computing, quantum networks, and quantum sensing. Verification and fidelity assessment of the entanglement state are typically performed by sequential coincidence measurements with single-pixel photon detectors. Quantum imaging techniques that use single-photon imaging cameras for visualizing an entangled biphoton state and calculating Bell's inequality have been reported. Their performances are limited for practical use due to low photon flux and low speed. Here, we introduce a new approach to image polarization-entangled biphoton states using radial polarizations, which enables rapid high-performance entanglement measurement. An intensified single-photon counting camera (SPCC) captures a single image with multiple polarizations imposed by a radial wave plate, which converts a linear polarization of single photons to radial polarizations. The coincidence photon image is rapidly taken with the SPCC in the integrate-on-chip mode, which is triggered by the idler photons set at a specific polarization angle. Bell's inequality is calculated directly from four coincidence images that show polarization correlation. Our technique not only visualizes the entangled polarization state but also enables fast full Bell-type evaluation of photonic polarization entanglement. We envision that our approach may be instrumental for developing advanced polarization-entangled photon sources and polarization-entangled quantum systems, which in turn would advance fundamental research involving dynamic photon-matter interactions.

TI Multilinear monogamy relations for multiqubit states
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB The monogamy of entanglement means that entanglement cannot be freely shared. In 2014, Oliveira et al. [T. R. de Oliveira, M. F. Cornelio, and F. F. Fanchini, Phys. Rev. A 87. 034303 (2014)] proposed a monogamy relation in the linear version and considered it in terms of entanglement of formation. Here we generalize the above version and consider a multilinear monogamy relation for a multiqubit system in terms of entanglement of formation and concurrence. Based on the above results, we present an entanglement criterion for genuine entangled states; also we consider the absolutely maximally entangled states and present what an absolutely maximally entangled state is for a three-qubit system. Last, we apply our results to a three-qubit pure state in terms of quantum discord.

TI Quantum key distribution overcoming practical correlated intensity
   fluctuations
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Intensity correlations between neighbouring pulses open a prevalent yet often overlooked security loophole in decoy-state quantum key distribution (QKD). As a solution, we present and experimentally demonstrate an intensity-correlation-tolerant QKD protocol that mitigates the negative effect that this phenomenon has on the secret key rate according to existing security analyses. Compared to previous approaches, our method significantly enhances the robustness against correlations, notably improving both the maximum transmission distances and the achievable secret key rates across different scenarios. By relaxing constraints on correlation parameters, our protocol enables practical devices to counter intensity correlations. We experimentally demonstrate this first practical solution that directly overcomes this security vulnerability, establish the feasibility and efficacy of our proposal, taking a major step towards loophole-free and high-performance QKD.

TI Relativistically invariant encoding of quantum information revisited
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB In this work, we provide a detailed analysis of the issue of encoding of quantum information which is invariant with respect to arbitrary Lorentz transformations. We significantly extend already known results and provide compliments where necessary. In particular, we introduce novel schemes for invariant encoding which utilize so-called pair-wise helicity-a physical parameter characterizing pairs of electric-magnetic charges. We also introduce new schemes for ordinary massive and massless particles based on states with fixed total momentum, in contrast to all protocols already proposed, which assumed equal momenta of all the particles involved in the encoding scheme. Moreover, we provide a systematic discussion of already existing protocols and show directly that they are invariant with respect to Lorentz transformations drawn according to any distribution, a fact which was not manifestly shown in previous works.

TI Vectorization of the density matrix and quantum simulation of the von
   Neumann equation of time-dependent Hamiltonians
SO PHYSICA SCRIPTA
AB Based oh the properties of Lie algebras, in this work we develop a general framework to linearize the von Neumann equation rendering it in a suitable form for quantum simulations. Departing from the conventional method of expanding the density matrix in the Liouville space formed by matrices unit we express the von Neumann equation in terms of Pauli strings. This provides several advantages related to the quantum tomography of the density matrix and the formulation of the unitary gates that generate the time evolution. The use of Pauli strings facilitates the quantum tomography of the density matrix whose elements are purely real. As for any other basis of Hermitian matrices, this eliminates the need to calculate the phase of the complex entries of the density matrix. This approach also enables to express the evolution operator as a sequence of commuting Hamiltonian gates of Pauli strings that can readily be synthetized using Clifford gates. Additionally, the fact that these gates commute with each other along with the unique properties of the algebra formed by Pauli strings allows to avoid the use of Trotterization hence considerably reducing the circuit depth. The algorithm is demonstrated for three Hamiltonians using the IBM noisy quantum circuit simulator.

TI Preparing ground and excited states using adiabatic CoVaR
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB CoVariance Root finding with classical shadows (CoVaR) was recently introduced as a new paradigm for training variational quantum circuits. Common approaches, such as variants of the variational quantum eigensolver, aim to optimise a non-linear classical cost function and thus suffer from, e.g. poor local minima, high shot requirements and barren plateaus. In contrast, CoVaR fully exploits powerful classical shadows and finds joint roots of a very large number of covariances using only a logarithmic number of shots and linearly scaling classical computing resources. As a result, CoVaR has been demonstrated to be particularly robust against local traps, however, its main limitation has been that it requires a sufficiently good initial state. We address this limitation by introducing an adiabatic morphing of the target Hamiltonian and demonstrate in a broad range of application examples that CoVaR can successfully prepare eigenstates of the target Hamiltonian when no initial warm start is known. CoVaR succeeds even when Hamiltonian energy gaps are very small-this is in stark contrast to adiabatic evolution and phase estimation algorithms where circuit depths scale inversely with the Hamiltonian energy gaps. On the other hand, when the energy gaps are relatively small then adiabatic CoVaR may converge to higher excited states as opposed to a targeted specific low-lying state. Nevertheless, we exploit this feature of adiabatic CoVaR and demonstrate that it can be used to map out the low lying spectrum of a Hamiltonian which can be useful in practical applications, such as estimating thermal properties or in high-energy physics.

TI Advanced Control Architectures for Quantum Satellite Temporal-Networking
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB The use of quantum satellites can be significant paving the way for novel telecommunications network paradigms, making it possible to connect remote regions. Given the rapid development of quantum communication technologies, many studies are focusing on quantum satellites interconnections via Free Space Optic (FSO), especially considering that the adoption of wired alternatives did not achieve significant results, mainly in terms of covering long distances. In this context, the global interconnection of Quantum Computers (QCs) through the so-called Quantum Internet (QI) compels for new communications and computing architectures such as Quantum Cloud (QCloud). To this purpose, the deployment of Satellite Quantum Networks (SQNs) could make easily available innovative services spanning from security to advanced computing, especially by using Software-Defined Networking (SDN) technology, which is considered a significant enabler for the management of SQNs. Moreover, considering the rapid variability of the topology in terms of nodes and links features, the paper proposes a specific Temporal Networks (TNs) optimization strategy embedded in an SDN Controller ecosystem, dynamically optimizing the path durations to achieve the highest entanglement rate, while limiting the disconnections. Performance evaluation in a worst case scenario shows that the proposed framework is able to support distributed applications by exploiting all the connection opportunities.

TI Security in Post-Quantum Era: A Comprehensive Survey on Lattice-Based
   Algorithms
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Lattice-based post-quantum cryptography (PQC) has attracted significant attention as a promising solution to the security challenges posed by quantum computing. Unlike traditional cryptographic algorithms, lattice-based schemes are expected to remain secure even in the presence of quantum attacks, making them essential for securing future data. Despite their strong theoretical foundations, lattice-based schemes face several practical challenges, particularly in optimizing performance and scalability for real-world applications. This survey provides a novel taxonomy that categorizes lattice-based PQC designs, with an emphasis on computational paradigms and security considerations. We systematically evaluate lattice-based PQC implementations across both software platforms, including central processing units and graphics processing units, as well as hardware platforms like field-programmable gate arrays and application-specific integrated circuits, highlighting their strengths and limitations. In addition, we explore the practical applications of lattice-based cryptography in fields such as secure communication, critical infrastructure, privacy-preserving data analytics, artificial intelligence, and trust and authentication systems. By offering a comprehensive overview of the current state of lattice-based PQC, this survey aims to provide valuable insights into the ongoing advancements and future research directions in the field as we transition to a post-quantum era.

TI Toward a Holistic Understanding of the Formation and Growth of
   Atmospheric Molecular Clusters: A Quantum Machine Learning Perspective
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY A
AB The formation of atmospheric molecular clusters is an important stage in forming new particles in the atmosphere. Despite being a highly focused research area, the exact chemical species involved in the initial steps in new particle formation remain elusive. In this Perspective the main challenges and recent progression in the field are outlined with a special emphasis on the chemical complexity of the puzzle and prospect of modeling larger clusters. In general, there is a high demand for accurate and more complete quantum chemical data sets that can be applied in cluster distribution dynamics models and coupled to atmospheric chemical transport models. A view on how the community could reach this goal by applying data-driven machine learning approaches for more efficient exploration of cluster configurations is presented. A path toward larger clusters and direct molecular dynamics simulations of cluster formation and growth using machine learning models is discussed.

TI Low-Frequency Quantum Sensing
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB Exquisite sensitivities are a prominent advantage of quantum sensors. Ramsey sequences allow precise measurement of direct current fields, while Hahn-echo-like sequences measure alternating current fields. However, the latter are restrained for use with high-frequency fields (above approximately 1 kHz) due to finite coherence times, leaving less-sensitive noncoherent methods for the low-frequency range. In this paper, we propose to bridge the gap with a fitting-based algorithm with a frequency-independent sensitivity to coherently measure low-frequency fields. As the algorithm benefits from coherence-based measurements, its demonstration with a single nitrogen-vacancy center gives a sensitivity of 9.4 nT Hz(-0.5) for frequencies below about 0.6 kHz down to near-constant fields. To inspect the potential in various scenarios, we apply the algorithm at a background field of tens of nTs, and we measure low-frequency signals via synchronization.

TI Wiring surface loss of a superconducting transmon qubit
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Quantum processors using superconducting qubits suffer from dielectric loss leading to noise and dissipation. Qubits are usually designed as large capacitor pads connected to a non-linear Josephson junction (or SQUID) by a superconducting thin metal wiring. Here, we report on finite-element simulation and experimental results confirming that more than 50% of surface loss in transmon qubits can originate from Josephson junctions wiring and can limit qubit relaxation time. We experimentally extracted dielectric loss tangents of qubit elements and showed that dominant surface loss of wiring can occur for real qubits designs. Finally, we experimentally demonstrate up to 20% improvement in qubit quality factor by wiring design optimization.

TI Bosonic entanglement and quantum sensing from energy transfer in
   two-tone Floquet systems
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Quantum-enhanced sensors, which surpass the standard quantum limit (SQL) and approach the fundamental precision limits dictated by quantum mechanics, are finding applications across a wide range of scientific fields. This quantum advantage becomes particularly significant when a large number of particles are included in the sensing circuit. Achieving such enhancement requires introducing and preserving entanglement among many particles, posing significant experimental challenges. In this work, we integrate concepts from Floquet theory and quantum information to design an entangler capable of generating the desired entanglement between two paths of a quantum interferometer. We demonstrate that our path-entangled states enable sensing beyond the SQL, reaching the fundamental Heisenberg limit (HL) of quantum mechanics. Moreover, we show that a decoding parity measurement maintains the HL when specific conditions from Floquet theory are satisfied-particularly those related to the periodic driving parameters that preserve entanglement during evolution. We address the effects of a priori phase uncertainty, imperfect transmission, and other types of noises, showing that our method remains robust under realistic conditions. Finally, we propose a superconducting-circuit implementation of our sensor in the microwave regime, highlighting its potential for practical applications in high-precision measurements.

TI Experimental hierarchy of the nonclassicality of single-qubit states via
   potentials for entanglement, steering, and Bell nonlocality
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Entanglement potentials are a promising way to quantify the nonclassicality of single -mode states. They are defined by the amount of entanglement (expressed by, e.g., the Wootters concurrence) obtained after mixing the examined single -mode state with a purely classical state; such as the vacuum or a coherent state. We generalize the idea of entanglement potentials to other quantum correlations: the EPR steering and Bell nonlocality, thus enabling us to study mutual hierarchies of these nonclassicality potentials. Instead of the usual vacuum and one -photon superposition states, we experimentally test this concept using specially tailored polarization -encoded single -photon states. One polarization encodes a given nonclassical singlemode state, while the other serves as the vacuum place -holder. This technique proves to be experimentally more convenient in comparison to the vacuum and a one -photon superposition as it does not require the vacuum detection.

TI IC-QKD: An Information-Centric Quantum Key Distribution Network
SO IEEE COMMUNICATIONS MAGAZINE
AB Current and next-generation networks are threatened by emerging attacks from quantum computers. To protect these services against quantum threat, quantum key distribution (QKD) using optical networks is being investigated and tested as a safe countermeasure to provide information-theoretic security. Although recent studies confirm the feasibility of QKD over optical networks, two main technical challenges, among others, remain unaddressed: the limited rate of generating keys requires efficient key distribution to secure the numerous applications, and as key requests from applications can be characterized by different importance, QKD networks need a key distribution platform that accounts for such diversity. To address these challenges, we propose to incorporate the paradigm of Information-Centric Networking (ICN) within the QKD process, and we describe a novel information-centric quantum key distribution (IC-QKD) network for efficient and differentiated key distribution. We first design a semantic-based key distribution scheme, which leverages ICN to incorporate the knowledge of application importance in QKD and to enhance the resource efficiency of QKD by decoupling the sender from its receiver. We then propose an in-network key-caching scheme, which is especially advantageous for multi-cast applications, as keys can be cached and reused for multiple users of a multicast group to accelerate key distribution. Finally, we design a semantic-based application analysis for semantic-based key caching and distribution, which serves various applications with different priorities. Simulation results show that the proposed QKD network can reach up to about 16 percent increase in the capability of serving key requests with respect to the existing QKD network.

TI Demand Response in Building Microgrids with Variational Quantum Circuit
   Enabled Hybrid Control Strategy

CT 12th IFAC Symposium on Control of Power and Energy Systems (CPES)
CY JUL 10-12, 2024
CL Rabat, MOROCCO
AB Participation in demand response programs encourages grid-interactive buildings to reduce energy consumption and promote sustainability by curbing load demand. Quantum computing has the potential to improve demand response, addressing the limitations of traditional techniques. We propose a hybrid control strategy, utilizing variational quantum circuits (VQC) and classical computing, to enhance demand response. The VQC-based technique combines quantum circuits trained through reinforcement learning with classical optimization solvers to optimize energy management in building microgrids. Computational experiments demonstrate that the hybrid strategy outperforms traditional techniques, reducing energy consumption and carbon emissions while maintaining scalability for larger building microgrids. By leveraging the strengths of both quantum and classical computing, the hybrid VQC-based strategy offers a promising approach to improving demand response and promoting energy efficiency in buildings, ultimately contributing to global sustainability efforts.

TI Information flow and error scaling for fully quantum control
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB The optimally designed control of quantum systems is playing an increasingly important role to engineer novel and more efficient quantum technologies. Here, in the scenario represented by controlling an arbitrary quantum system via the interaction with an another optimally initialized auxiliary quantum system, we show that the quantum channel capacity sets the scaling behavior of the optimal control error. Specifically, by fitting the model to numerical data, we verify that the minimum control error is ensured by maximizing the quantum capacity of the channel mapping the initial control state into the target state of the controlled system, i.e., optimizing the quantum information flow from the controller to the system to be controlled. Analytical results, supported by numerical evidences, are provided when the systems and the controller are either qubits or single Bosonic modes.

TI Characterizing nonlocality of pure symmetric three-qubit states
SO QUANTUM INFORMATION PROCESSING
AB We explore nonlocality of three-qubit pure symmetric states shared between Alice, Bob and Charlie using the Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (CHSH) inequality. We make use of the elegant parametrization in the canonical form of these states, proposed by Meill and Meyer (Phys Rev A 96:062310, 2017) based on Majorana geometric representation. The reduced two-qubit states, extracted from an arbitrary pure entangled symmetric three-qubit state, do not violate the CHSH inequality, and hence, they are CHSH-local. However, when Alice and Bob perform a CHSH test, after conditioning over measurement results of Charlie, nonlocality of the state is revealed. We have also shown that two different families of three-qubit pure symmetric states, consisting of two and three distinct spinors (qubits), respectively, can be distinguished based on the strength of violation in the conditional CHSH nonlocality test. Furthermore, we identify six of the 46 classes of tight Bell inequalities in the three-party, two-setting, two-outcome, i.e., (3,2,2) scenario (Lopez-Rosa et al. in Phys Rev A 94:062121, 2016). Among the two inequivalent families of three-qubit pure symmetric states, only the states belonging to three distinct spinor class show maximum violations of these six tight Bell inequalities.

AB Quantum computing has demonstrated potential for solving complex optimization problems; however, its application to spatial regionalization remains underexplored. Spatial contiguity, a fundamental constraint requiring spatial entities to form connected components, significantly increases the complexity of regionalization problems, which are typically challenging for quantum modeling. This paper proposes novel quantum formulations based on a flow model that enforces spatial contiguity constraints. Our scale-aware approach employs a Discrete Quadratic Model (DQM), solvable directly on quantum annealing hardware for small-scale datasets. In addition, it designs a hybrid quantum-classical approach to manage larger-scale problems within existing hardware limitations. This work establishes a foundational framework for integrating quantum methods into practical spatial optimization tasks.

TI Deep learning enhanced individual nuclear-spin detection
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB The detection of nuclear spins using individual electron spins has enabled diverse opportunities in quantum sensing and quantum information processing. Proof-of-principle experiments have demonstrated atomic-scale imaging of nuclear-spin samples and controlled multi-qubit registers. However, to image more complex samples and to realize larger-scale quantum processors, computerized methods that efficiently and automatically characterize spin systems are required. Here, we realize a deep learning model for automatic identification of nuclear spins using the electron spin of single nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond as a sensor. Based on neural network algorithms, we develop noise recovery procedures and training sequences for highly non-linear spectra. We apply these methods to experimentally demonstrate the fast identification of 31 nuclear spins around a single NV center and accurately determine the hyperfine parameters. Our methods can be extended to larger spin systems and are applicable to a wide range of electron-nuclear interaction strengths. These results pave the way towards efficient imaging of complex spin samples and automatic characterization of large spin-qubit registers.

TI Benchmarking Quantum Generative Learning: A Study on Scalability and
   Noise Resilience using QUARK
SO KUNSTLICHE INTELLIGENZ
AB Quantum computing promises a disruptive impact on machine learning algorithms, taking advantage of the exponentially large Hilbert space available. However, it is not clear how to scale quantum machine learning (QML) to industrial-level applications. This paper investigates the scalability and noise resilience of quantum generative learning applications. We consider the training performance in the presence of statistical noise due to finite-shot noise statistics and quantum noise due to decoherence to analyze the scalability of QML methods. We employ rigorous benchmarking techniques to track progress and identify challenges in scaling QML algorithms, and show how characterization of QML systems can be accelerated, simplified, and made reproducible when the QUARK framework is used. We show that QGANs are not as affected by the curse of dimensionality as QCBMs and to which extent QCBMs are resilient to noise.

TI DFT and hybrid classical-quantum machine learning integration for
   photocatalyst discovery and hydrogen production
SO REVIEWS IN CHEMICAL ENGINEERING
AB Photocatalytic hydrogen production is a key pathway toward sustainable energy, driven by semiconductors that utilize sunlight for water splitting. This review highlights recent advances in material design, theoretical modeling, and data-driven discovery. Focus is given to visible-light-active semiconductors with optimal band gaps (1.8-2.4 eV), such as BiVO4, g-C3N4, and CdS, which enable efficient redox reactions. Hybrid architectures, including Pt-loaded TiO2 and CdS/ZnS core-shell systems, demonstrate hydrogen evolution rates exceeding 10(5) mol m(-2) s(-1). Upconversion nanomaterials based on rare-earth-doped fluorides extend light harvesting into the NIR, enhancing quantum yields when combined with quantum dots. Engineered heterojunctions and carbon-based 2D interfaces improve charge separation and suppress recombination. Thermodynamic parameters such as low overpotentials (<0.3 V) and high absorption coefficients (>10(5) cm(-1)) correlate with high catalytic efficiency. Time-dependent simulations and density functional theory (DFT) offer insights into structure-property relationships. Additionally, machine learning models expedite discovery by navigating complex compositional and structural spaces. While integrating theoretical, experimental, and AI-driven approaches, this review presents a framework for the rational design of scalable photocatalysts that meet future energy demands.

TI Impossibility of bosonic autonomous entanglement engines in the
   weak-coupling limit
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Entanglement is a fundamental feature of quantum physics and a key resource for quantum communication, computing, and sensing. Entangled states are fragile and maintaining coherence is a central challenge in quantum information processing. Nevertheless, entanglement can be generated and stabilized through dissipative processes. In fact, entanglement has been shown to exist in the steady state of certain interacting quantum systems subject solely to incoherent coupling to thermal baths. This has been demonstrated in a range of bi- and multipartite settings using systems of finite dimension. Here we focus on the steady state of infinite-dimensional bosonic systems. Specifically, we consider any set of bosonic modes undergoing excitation-number-preserving interactions of arbitrary strength and divided between an arbitrary number of parties that each couple weakly to thermal baths at different temperatures. We show that a unique steady state is always separable.

TI Accelerating ALTEQ With HardwareSoftware Co-Design on FPGA
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB The emergence of quantum computing poses a significant threat to the security of modern public-key cryptography, spurring a global effort to standardize Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC). However, optimization research has predominantly focused on software implementations and lattice-based algorithms, leaving a notable gap in the hardware acceleration of non-lattice-based schemes, particularly on platforms such as FPGAs. This paper aims to bridge this gap by proposing the first HW/SW co-design to accelerate ALTEQ, a non-lattice-based digital signature algorithm submitted to the NIST PQC additional signature competition. Our approach maximizes performance by strategically offloading ALTEQ's most computationally intensive operations-the hash function and modular arithmetic-to dedicated hardware accelerators. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to investigate a hardware acceleration architecture for ALTEQ or similar schemes. The proposed design achieves performance improvements of up to approximately 88% for Keygen, 91% for Sign, and 92% for Verify. This demonstrates that algorithms not selected for standardization can still achieve substantial performance gains through hardware optimization, suggesting the potential for re-evaluating such schemes for specific application environments and encouraging further research into hardware implementations of a broader range of PQC algorithms.

TI Performance comparison of optimization methods on variational quantum
   algorithms
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) offer a promising path toward using near-term quantum hardware for applications in academic and industrial research. These algorithms aim to find approximate solutions to quantum problems by optimizing a parametrized quantum circuit using a classical optimization algorithm. A successful VQA requires fast and reliable classical optimization algorithms. Understanding and optimizing how off-the-shelf optimization methods perform in this context is important for the future of the field. In this work, we study the performance of four commonly used gradient-free optimization methods [sequential least-squares quadratic programming, constrained optimization by linear approximations, the covariance matrix adaptation evolutionary strategy (CMA-ES), and the simultaneous perturbation stochastic approximation (SPSA)] to find ground-state energies of a range of small chemistry and material science problems. We test a telescoping sampling scheme (where the accuracy of the cost-function estimate provided to the optimizer is increased as the optimization converges) for all methods, demonstrating mixed results across our range of optimizers and problems chosen. We further hyperparameter tune two of the four optimizers (CMA-ES and SPSA) across a large range of models and demonstrate that with appropriate hyperparameter tuning, CMA-ES is competitive with and sometimes outperforms SPSA (which is not observed in the absence of hyperparameter tuning). Finally, we investigate the ability of an optimizer to beat the "sampling-noise floor" given by the sampling noise of each cost-function estimate provided to the optimizer. Our results demonstrate the necessity for tailoring and hyperparameter tuning known optimization techniques for inherently noisy variational quantum algorithms and that the variational landscape that one finds in a VQA is highly problem and system dependent. This provides guidance for future implementations of these algorithms in experiments.

TI Witnessing quantum correlations in two coupled quantum dots under
   intrinsic decoherence
SO ALEXANDRIA ENGINEERING JOURNAL
AB The influences of intrinsic decoherence, tunnelling rates, and Coulomb coupling interaction on the behaviour of negativity, quantum coherence and the measurement-induced disturbance of two coupled quantum dot molecules are discussed. The aforementioned is implemented by obtaining the exact solution of the Milburn equation, where the initial setting state is prepared in an entangled Werner state. Various phenomena are illustrated for three physical measures, namely entanglement, coherence, and quantum correlations. It showed that the intrinsic decoherence strength plays a destructive role for the maximum bounds of all these physical quantities, in which they are decayed to a non-zero fixed point. Altering the tunnelling rates strength increases/ decreases the maximum and minimum bounds of the three physical measurements, whereby increasing the tunnelling rate lessens the entanglement and denigrates the maximum and minimum values of coherence and quantumness. Otherwise, the Coulomb coupling enhances the stability of all physical quantities.(c) 2023 Production and hosting by Elsevier B.V. on behalf of Faculty of Engineering, Alexandria University.

TI Low-complexity adaptive reconciliation protocol for continuous-variable
   quantum key distribution
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB In continuous-variable quantum key distribution systems, reconciliation is a crucial step that significantly affects the secret key rate (SKR). The rateless protocol based on Raptor codes can achieve high reconciliation efficiency at low signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs). However, the high complexity of low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes used for the precoding in Raptor codes limits the speed of reconciliation. In this paper, we propose an adaptive reconciliation protocol by modifying Raptor codes. The length of random binary sequences is increased because we remove the LDPC precoding that adds redundancy. The modified Raptor codes reduce the complexity of encoding with better performance. The proposed protocol gives a reconciliation efficiency higher than 98.1% in the SNR below -20 dB and maintains a certain SKR in long-distance transmission.

TI Quantum state reconstruction in a noisy environment via deep learning
SO QUANTUM MACHINE INTELLIGENCE
AB Quantum noise is currently limiting efficient quantum information processing and computation, impacting on the fidelity and reliability of quantum states. In this work, we consider the tasks of reconstructing and classifying quantum states corrupted by the action of an unknown noisy channel using classical feed-forward neural networks. By framing reconstruction as a regression problem, we show how such an approach can be used to recover with fidelities exceeding 99% the noiseless density matrices of quantum states of up to three qubits undergoing noisy evolution, and we test its performance with both single-qubit (bit-flip, phase-flip, depolarizing, and amplitude damping) and two-qubit quantum channels (correlated amplitude damping). Furthermore, a critical aspect of our investigation involves also a comprehensive comparison between mean squared error and infidelity as loss functions. Our findings reveal that these two metrics yield comparable results in the context of state reconstruction. Moreover, we also consider the task of distinguishing between different quantum noisy channels, and show how a neural network-based classifier is able to solve such a classification problem with perfect accuracy.

TI Efficient Hamiltonian simulation for solving option price dynamics
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Pricing financial derivatives, in particular European-style options at different time-maturities and strikes, means a relevant problem in finance. The dynamics describing the price of vanilla options when constant volatilities and interest rates are assumed is governed by the Black-Scholes model, a linear parabolic partial differential equation with terminal value given by the payoff of the option contract and no additional boundary conditions. Here, we present a digital quantum algorithm to solve the Black-Scholes equation on a quantum computer by mapping it to the Schrodinger equation. The non-Hermitian nature of the resulting Hamiltonian is solved by embedding its propagator into an enlarged Hilbert space by using only one additional ancillary qubit. Moreover, due to the choice of periodic boundary conditions, given by the definition of the discretized momentum operator, we duplicate the initial condition, which substantially improves the stability and performance of the protocol. The algorithm shows a feasible approach for using efficient Hamiltonian simulation techniques as quantum signal processing to solve the price dynamics of financial derivatives on a digital quantum computer. Our approach differs from those based on Monte Carlo integration, exclusively focused on sampling the solution assuming the dynamics is known. We report expected accuracy levels comparable to classical numerical algorithms by using nine qubits to simulate its dynamics on a fault-tolerant quantum computer, and an expected success probability of the post-selection procedure due to the embedding protocol above 60%.

TI Linear Optical Logical Bell State Measurements with Optimal
   Loss-Tolerance Threshold
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB (Received February 2023; May 2023; accepted September 2023; published 2023) Quantum threshold theorems impose hard limits on the hardware capabilities to process quantum information. We derive tight and fundamental upper bounds to loss-tolerance thresholds in different linear-optical quantum information processing settings through an adversarial framework, taking into account the intrinsically probabilistic nature of linear optical Bell measurements. For logical Bell state measurements-ubiquitous operations in photonic quantum information-we demonstrate analytically that linear optics can achieve the fundamental loss threshold imposed by the no-cloning theorem even though, fol-lowing the work of Lee et al. [Phys. Rev. A 100, 052303 (2019)] the constraint was widely assumed to be stricter. We spotlight the assumptions of the latter publication and find their bound holds for a logical Bell measurement built from adaptive physical linear-optical Bell measurements. We also give an explicit even stricter bound for nonadaptive Bell measurements.

TI A Quantum Computing-Based Accelerated Model for Image Classification
   Using a Parallel Pipeline Encoded Inception Module
SO MATHEMATICS
AB Image classification is typically a research area that trains an algorithm for accurately identifying subjects in images that have never been seen before. Training a model to recognize images within a dataset is significant as image classification generally has several applications in medicine, face detection, image reconstruction, etc. In spite of such applications, the main difficulty in this area involves the computation in the classification process, which is vast, leading to slow speed of classification. Moreover, as conventional image classification approaches have fallen short in terms of attaining high accuracy, an optimal model is needed. To resolve this, quantum computing has been developed. Due to their parallel computing ability, quantum-based algorithms could accomplish the classification of vast amounts of image data. This has theoretically confirmed the feasibility and advantages of incorporating a quantum computing-based system with traditional image classification methodologies. Considering this, the present study quantizes the layers of the proposed parallel encoded Inception module to improvise the network performance. This study exposes the flexibility of DL (deep learning)-based quantum state computational methodologies for missing computations by creating a pipeline for denoising, state estimation, and imputation. Furthermore, controlled parameterized rotations are regarded for entanglement, a vital component in quantum perceptron structure. The proposed approach not only possesses the unique features of quantum mechanics, but it also maintains the weight sharing of the kernel. Finally, the MNIST (Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology) and Fashion MNIST image classification outcomes are attained by measuring the quantum state. Overall performance is assessed to prove its effectiveness in image classification.

TI A 9.2-GHz clock transition in a Lu(II) molecular spin qubit arising from
   a 3,467-MHz hyperfine interaction
SO NATURE CHEMISTRY
AB Spins in molecules are particularly attractive targets for next-generation quantum technologies, enabling chemically programmable qubits and potential for scale-up via self-assembly. Here we report the observation of one of the largest hyperfine interactions for a molecular system, A(iso) = 3,467 +/- 50 MHz, as well as a very large associated clock transition. This is achieved through chemical control of the degree of s-orbital mixing into the spin-bearing d orbital associated with a series of spin-1/2 La(II) and Lu(II) complexes. Increased s-orbital character reduces spin-orbit coupling and enhances the electron-nuclear Fermi contact interaction. Both outcomes are advantageous for quantum applications. The former reduces spin-lattice relaxation, and the latter maximizes the hyperfine interaction, which, in turn, generates a 9-GHz clock transition, leading to an increase in phase memory time from 1.0 +/- 0.4 to 12 +/- 1 mu s for one of the Lu(II) complexes. These findings suggest strategies for the development of molecular quantum technologies, akin to trapped ion systems.

TI Quantum federated learning: a comprehensive literature review of
   foundations, challenges, and future directions
SO QUANTUM MACHINE INTELLIGENCE
AB Federated learning (FL) is a recent technique that emerged to handle the vast amount of training data needed in machine learning algorithms while fulfilling data owners' privacy challenges in such scenarios. Simultaneously, the field of quantum computing (QC), using quantum properties such as entanglement and superposition to perform computation, has experienced exponential growth, theoretically proving to be more efficient in specific machine learning tasks and creating the discipline known as quantum machine learning (QML). Thus, an emerging body of knowledge has started studying the combination of these two research agendas, giving rise to the field of quantum federated learning (QFL). In this review, we systematically classify the existing literature through a novel taxonomy, identify current trends and challenges, and highlight research gaps and future directions to support the continued development of this emerging field.

TI Micius quantum experiments in space
SO REVIEWS OF MODERN PHYSICS
AB Quantum theory has been successfully validated in numerous laboratory experiments. But would such a theory, which effectively describes the behavior of microscopic physical systems and its predicted phenomena such as quantum entanglement, still be applicable on large length scales? From a practical perspective, how can quantum key distribution (where the security of establishing secret keys between distant parties is ensured by the laws of quantum mechanics) be made technologically useful on a global scale? Owing to photon loss in optical fibers and terrestrial free space, the achievable distance using direct transmission of single photons has been limited to a few hundred kilometers. A promising route to testing quantum physics over long distances and in the relativistic regimes, and thus realizing flexible global-scale quantum networks, is via the use of satellites and space-based technologies, where a significant advantage is that the photon loss and turbulence predominantly occurs in the lower similar to 10 km of the atmosphere, and most of the photons' transmission path in space is virtually in vacuum, with almost zero absorption and decoherence. Progress in free-space quantum experiments, with a focus on the fast-developing Micius satellite-based quantum communications, is reviewed. The perspective of space-ground integrated quantum networks and fundamental quantum optics experiments in space conceivable with satellites are discussed.

TI Topological Eigenvalue Braiding and Quantum State Transfer Near a
   Third-Order Exceptional Point
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Non-Hermitian systems exhibit a variety of unique features rooted in the presence of exceptional points (EPs). The distinct topological structure in the proximity of an EP gives rise to counterintuitive behaviors absent in Hermitian systems, which emerge after encircling the EP either quasistatically or dynamically. However, experimental exploration of EP encirclement in quantum systems, particularly those involving high-order EPs, remains challenging due to the difficulty of coherently controlling more degrees of freedom. In this work, we experimentally investigate the eigenvalue braiding and state transfer arising from the encirclement of EP in a three-dimensional non-Hermitian quantum system using superconducting circuits. We characterize the second- and third-order EPs through the coalescence of eigenvalues. Then we reveal the topological structure near the EP3 by quasistatically encircling it along various paths with three independent parameters, which yields the eigenvalue braiding described by the braid group B3. Additionally, we observe chiral state transfer between three eigenstates under a fast driving scheme when no EPs are enclosed, while time-symmetric behavior occurs when at least one EP is encircled. Our findings offer insights into understanding non-Hermitian topological structures and the manipulation of quantum states through dynamic operations.

TI Deterministic Ansätze for the measurement-based variational quantum
   eigensolver
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB Measurement-based quantum computing (MBQC) is a promising approach to reducing circuit depth in noisy intermediate-scale quantum algorithms such as the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE). Unlike gate-based computing, MBQC employs local measurements on a preprepared resource state, offering a trade-off between circuit depth and qubit count. Ensuring determinism is crucial to MBQC, particularly in the VQE context, as a lack of flow in measurement patterns leads to evaluating the cost function at irrelevant locations. This study introduces MBVQE-ans & auml;tze that respect determinism and resemble the widely used problem-agnostic hardware-efficient VQE ansatz. We evaluate our approach using ideal simulations on the Schwinger Hamiltonian and XY-model and perform experiments on IBM hardware with an adaptive measurement capability. In our use case, we find that ensuring determinism works better via postselection than by adaptive measurements at the expense of increased sampling cost. Additionally, we propose an efficient MBQC-inspired method to prepare the resource state, specifically the cluster state, on hardware with heavy-hex connectivity, requiring a single measurement round, and implement this scheme on quantum computers with 27 and 127 qubits. We observe notable improvements for larger cluster states, although direct gate-based implementation achieves higher fidelity for smaller instances.

   pure-state set
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS A-MATHEMATICAL AND THEORETICAL
AB The preparation of quantum states lies at the foundation in the quantum information processing. The convex mixing of some existing quantum states is one of the effective candidate. In this paper, we mainly study how a target quantum state can be optimally prepared by not more than three given pure states. The analytic optimal distance based on the fidelity is found. We also show that the preparation with more than four states can be essentially converted to the case with not more than four states, which can be similarly solved as the case with three states. The validity is illustrated by the comparison of our analytical and numerical results.

TI A fluorescent-protein spin qubit
SO NATURE
AB Quantum bits (qubits) are two-level quantum systems that support initialization, readout and coherent control1. Optically addressable spin qubits form the foundation of an emerging generation of nanoscale sensors2, 3, 4, 5, 6-7. The engineering of these qubits has mainly focused on solid-state systems. However, fluorescent proteins, rather than exogenous fluorescent probes, have become the gold standard for in vivo microscopy because of their genetic encodability8,9. Although fluorescent proteins possess a metastable triplet state10, they have not been investigated as qubits. Here we realize an optically addressable spin qubit in enhanced yellow fluorescent protein. A near-infrared laser pulse enables triggered readout of the triplet state with up to 20% spin contrast. Using coherent microwave control of the enhanced-yellow-fluorescent-protein spin at liquid-nitrogen temperatures, we measure a (16 +/- 2) mu s coherence time under Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill decoupling. We express the qubit in mammalian cells, maintaining contrast and coherent control despite the complex intracellular environment. Finally, we demonstrate optically detected magnetic resonance in bacterial cells at room temperature with contrast up to 8%. Our results introduce fluorescent proteins as a powerful qubit platform that paves the way for applications in the life sciences, such as nanoscale field sensing and spin-based imaging modalities.

TI Parallel Quantum-Enhanced Sensing
SO ACS PHOTONICS
AB Quantum metrology takes advantage of quantum correlations to enhance the sensitivity of sensors and measurement techniques beyond their fundamental classical limit, given by the shot-noise limit. The use of both temporal and spatial correlations present in quantum states of light can extend quantum-enhanced sensing to a parallel configuration that can simultaneously probe an array of sensors or independently measure multiple parameters. To this end, we use multispatial-mode bright twin beams of light, which are characterized by independent quantum-correlated spatial subregions in addition to quantum temporal correlations, to probe a four-sensor quadrant plasmonic array. We show that it is possible to independently and simultaneously measure local changes in refractive index for all four sensors with a quantum enhancement in sensitivity in the range of 22% to 24% over the corresponding classical configuration. These results provide a first step toward highly parallel spatially resolved quantum-enhanced sensing techniques and pave the way toward more complex quantum sensing and quantum imaging platforms.

TI Speeding up qubit control with bipolar single-flux-quantum pulse
   sequences
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB The development of quantum computers based on superconductors requires the improvement of the qubit state control approach aimed at the increase of the hardware energy efficiency. A promising solution to this problem is the use of superconducting digital circuits operating with single-flux-quantum (SFQ) pulses, moving the qubit control system into the cold chamber. However, the qubit gate time under SFQ control is still longer than under conventional microwave driving. Here we introduce the bipolar SFQ pulse control based on ternary pulse sequences. We also develop a robust optimization algorithm for finding a sequence structure that minimizes the leakage of the transmon qubit state from the computational subspace. We show that the appropriate sequence can be found for arbitrary system parameters from the practical range. The proposed bipolar SFQ control reduces a single qubit gate time by halve compared to nowadays unipolar SFQ technique, while maintaining the gate fidelity over 99.99%.

TI A high-fidelity quantum matter-link between ion-trap microchip modules
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB System scalability is fundamental for large-scale quantum computers (QCs) and is being pursued over a variety of hardware platforms. For QCs based on trapped ions, architectures such as the quantum charge-coupled device (QCCD) are used to scale the number of qubits on a single device. However, the number of ions that can be hosted on a single quantum computing module is limited by the size of the chip being used. Therefore, a modular approach is of critical importance and requires quantum connections between individual modules. Here, we present the demonstration of a quantum matter-link in which ion qubits are transferred between adjacent QC modules. Ion transport between adjacent modules is realised at a rate of 2424 s(-1) and with an infidelity associated with ion loss during transport below 7 x 10(-8). Furthermore, we show that the link does not measurably impact the phase coherence of the qubit. The quantum matter-link constitutes a practical mechanism for the interconnection of QCCD devices. Our work will facilitate the implementation of modular QCs capable of fault-tolerant utility-scale quantum computation.
   A possible route to scalability of trapped-ion-based quantum computing platforms is to connect multiple modules where ions can be shuttled across different registers. Here, the authors demonstrate fast and low-loss transfer of trapped ions between two microchip modules.

AB We determine the optimal measurement that maximizes the average information gain about the state of a qubit system. The qubit is prepared in one of two known states with known prior probabilities. To treat the problem analytically we employ the formalism developed for the maximum confidence quantum state discrimination strategy and obtain the POVM which optimizes the information gain for the entire parameter space of the system. We show that the optimal measurement coincides exactly with the minimum-error quantum measurement only for two pure states, or when the two states have the same Bloch radius or they are on the same diagonal of the Bloch disk.

TI Parameter estimation from quantum-jump data using neural networks
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB We present an inference method utilizing artificial neural networks for parameter estimation of a quantum probe monitored through a single continuous measurement. Unlike existing approaches focusing on the diffusive signals generated by continuous weak measurements, our method harnesses quantum correlations in discrete photon-counting data characterized by quantum jumps. We benchmark the precision of this method against Bayesian inference, which is optimal in the sense of information retrieval. By using numerical experiments on a two-level quantum system, we demonstrate that our approach can achieve a similar optimal performance as Bayesian inference, while drastically reducing computational costs. Additionally, the method exhibits robustness against the presence of imperfections in both measurement and training data. This approach offers a promising and computationally efficient tool for quantum parameter estimation with photon-counting data, relevant for applications such as quantum sensing or quantum imaging, as well as robust calibration tasks in laboratory-based settings.

TI Current biased gradiometric flux qubit in a circuit-QED architecture
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB We propose a scheme for controlling the gradiometric flux qubit (GFQ) by applying an ac bias current in a circuit-QED architecture. The GFQ is insensitive to the magnetic flux fluctuations, which at the same time makes it challenging to manipulate the qubit states by an external magnetic field. In this study, we demonstrate that an ac bias current applied to the alpha-junction of the GFQ can control the qubit states. Further, the present scheme is robust against the charge fluctuations as well as the magnetic flux fluctuations, promising a long coherence time for quantum gate operations. We introduce a circuit-QED architecture to perform the single and two-qubit operations with a sufficiently strong coupling strength.

SO JOURNAL OF THE OPTICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA B-OPTICAL PHYSICS
AB We investigate the generation of entanglement in a cavity magnomechanical system, which consists of magnons and cavity microwave photons and phonons; the magnon-photon and magnon-phonon couplings are achieved by the magnetic dipole interaction and the magnetostrictive interaction, respectively. By introducing magnon squeezing induced by magnon self-Kerr nonlinearity, the magnon-photon, magnon-phonon, and photon-phonon entanglements are enhanced compared with the case without inserting magnon squeezing. We find that an optimal parameter of the squeezing exists, which yields the maximum entanglement. This study provides a new idea for exploring the properties of quantum entanglement in cavity magnomechanical systems, and may have some potential applications in quantum state engineering.

TI Construction strategy and performance simulation of quantum satellite
   wide area network based on cobweb structure
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB Quantum satellite communication is a research hotspot and frontier in the field of communication. It has the advantages of ideal information security and wide coverage, which is of great significance in constructing a global quantum satellite wide area network. However, problems such as network reliability, security and routing relay still need to be improved when transmitting information over long distances. In this paper, the spider web is used as a unique natural communication topology to transform the natural spider web into an artificial spider web topology. The quantum information transmission adopts N-order quantum teleportation routing scheme, and the transmission delay is basically unchanged. On this basis, the spider web topology quantum wide area network transmission model is constructed. The bit error rate, throughput rate and security key generation rate of the network model are simulated and analyzed. Taking 9-node ring network and 9-node cobweb for example, the quantitative analysis and qualitative analysis are both conducted in this paper. The results show that the cobweb topology has higher reliability. When the average power spectral density of the noise is given and there is no relay, the bit error rate increases with the transmission distance increasing, so the introduction of relay should be considered. When the transmission distance and noise power spectral density are constant, the bit error rate decreases with the number of relay nodes increasing, so the appropriate routing process should be selected in the spider web topology. With the increase of the probability of transmitting entangled photon pairs, the throughput rate gradually increases. With the increase of transmission delay in the network, the throughput rate Q gradually decreases. However, the transmission delay is basically unchanged in this routing scheme, and the transmission delay of cobweb structure is very small. Therefore, the throughput rate of the topology quantum WAN of cobweb network based on N-order quantum teleportation proposed in this paper will not significantly decrease. When the transmission distance of quantum information increases, the network key generation rate decreases gradually. With the increase of the number of network relay nodes, the key generation rate increases gradually. Thus, it can be seen that using cobweb topology and N-order quantum teleportation routing scheme to construct a quantum satellite WAN has good advantages.

TI Quantum Computing Approach to Realistic ESG-Friendly Stock Portfolios
SO RISKS
AB Finding an optimal balance between risk and returns in investment portfolios is a central challenge in quantitative finance, often addressed through Markowitz portfolio theory (MPT). While traditional portfolio optimization is carried out in a continuous fashion, as if stocks could be bought in fractional increments, practical implementations often resort to approximations, as fractional stocks are typically not tradeable. While these approximations are effective for large investment budgets, they deteriorate as budgets decrease. To alleviate this issue, a discrete Markowitz portfolio theory (DMPT) with finite budgets and integer stock weights can be formulated, but results in a non-polynomial (NP)-hard problem. Recent progress in quantum processing units (QPUs), including quantum annealers, makes solving DMPT problems feasible. Our study explores portfolio optimization on quantum annealers, establishing a mapping between continuous and discrete Markowitz portfolio theories. We find that correctly normalized discrete portfolios converge to continuous solutions as budgets increase. Our DMPT implementation provides efficient frontier solutions, outperforming traditional rounding methods, even for moderate budgets. Responding to the demand for environmentally and socially responsible investments, we enhance our discrete portfolio optimization with ESG (environmental, social, governance) ratings for EURO STOXX 50 index stocks. We introduce a utility function incorporating ESG ratings to balance risk, return and ESG friendliness, and discuss implications for ESG-aware investors.

TI Stacking the odds: full-stack quantum system design space exploration
SO EPJ QUANTUM TECHNOLOGY
AB Design space exploration (DSE) plays an important role in optimising quantum circuit execution by systematically evaluating different configurations of compilation strategies and hardware settings. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive investigation into the impact of various layout methods, qubit routing techniques, and optimisation levels, as well as device-specific properties such as different variants and strengths of noise and imperfections, the topological structure of qubits, connectivity densities, and back-end sizes. By spanning through these dimensions, we aim to understand the interplay between compilation choices and hardware characteristics. A key question driving our exploration is whether the optimal selection of device parameters, mapping techniques, comprising of initial layout strategies and routing heuristics can mitigate device induced errors beyond standard error mitigation approaches. Our results show that carefully selecting software strategies (e.g., mapping and routing algorithms) and tailoring hardware characteristics (such as minimising noise and leveraging topology and connectivity density) significantly improve the fidelity of circuit execution outcomes, and thus the expected correctness or success probability of the computational result. We provide estimates based on key metrics such as circuit depth, gate count and expected fidelity. Our results highlight the importance of hardware-software co-design, particularly as quantum systems scale to larger dimensions, and along the way towards fully error corrected quantum systems: Our study is based on computationally noisy simulations, but considers various implementations of quantum error correction (QEC) using the same approach as for other algorithms. The observed sensitivity of circuit fidelity to noise and connectivity suggests that co-design principles will be equally critical when integrating QEC in future systems. Our exploration provides practical guidelines for co-optimising physical mapping, qubit routing, and hardware configurations in realistic quantum computing scenarios.

TI Quantum Many-Body Systems in Thermal Equilibrium
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB The thermal or equilibrium ensemble is one of the most ubiquitous states of matter. For models comprised of many locally interacting quantum particles, it describes a wide range of physical situations, relevant to condensed-matter physics, high-energy physics, quantum chemistry and quantum computing, among others. We give a pedagogical overview of some of the most important universal features about the physics and complexity of these states, which have the fact that interactions in the Hamiltonian are short ranged at its core. We focus on mathematically rigorous statements, many of them inspired by ideas and tools from quantum information theory. These include bounds on their correlations, the form of the subsystems, various statistical properties, and the performance of classical and quantum algorithms. We also include a summary of a few of the most important technical tools, as well as some self-contained proofs.

TI Improved Correlation Power Analysis Attack on the Latest Cortex M4 Kyber
   Implementation
SO CRYPTOGRAPHY
AB CRYSTALS-Kyber has been standardized as a general public-key post-quantum algorithm under the name of ML-KEM after NIST released its first three final post-quantum standards in August 2024. The resilience of post-quantum cryptography to side-channel attacks has been an important research endeavor, and there have been many attacks designed, including basic Correlation Power Analysis. This paper adapts existing Correlation Power Analysis attacks to the most recent ARM Cortex M4 optimized implementation that uses Plantard arithmetic. It also demonstrates an improved version of a CPA that results in a 50% speedup compared to the original attack. Data are gathered and the mathematical model is tested using a ChipWhisperer-Lite board.

TI Compression of metrological quantum information in the presence of noise
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB In quantum metrology, information about unknown parameters a = (theta(1), ... , theta(M)) is accessed by measuring probe states rho a. In experimental settings where copies of rho(theta) can be produced rapidly (e.g., in optics), the information-extraction bottleneck can stem from high postprocessing costs or detector saturation. In these regimes, it is desirable to compress the information encoded in rho((R) n)(theta) into m < n copies of a postselected state: rho(ps (R) m)(theta). Remarkably, recent works have shown that, in the absence of noise, compression can be lossless, for m/n arbitrarily small. Here, we fully characterize the family of filters that enable lossless compression. Further, we study the effect of noise on quantum-metrological information amplification. Motivated by experiments, we consider a popular family of filters, which we show is optimal for qubit probes. Further, we show that, for the optimal filter in this family, compression is still lossless if noise acts after the filter. However, in the presence of depolarizing noise before filtering, compression is lossy. In both cases, information extraction can be implemented significantly better than simply discarding a constant fraction of the states, even in the presence of strong noise.

TI Quantum data learning for quantum simulations in high-energy physics
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Quantum machine learning with parametrised quantum circuits has attracted significant attention over the past years as an early application for the era of noisy quantum processors. However, the possibility of achieving concrete advantages over classical counterparts in practical learning tasks is yet to be demonstrated. A promising avenue to explore potential advantages is the learning of data generated by quantum mechanical systems and presented in an inherently quantum mechanical form. In this article, we explore the applicability of quantum data learning to practical problems in high-energy physics, aiming to identify domain specific use-cases where quantum models can be employed. We consider quantum states governed by one-dimensional lattice gauge theories and a phenomenological quantum field theory in particle physics, generated by digital quantum simulations or variational methods to approximate target states. We make use of an ansatz based on quantum convolutional neural networks and numerically show that it is capable of recognizing quantum phases of ground states in the Schwinger model, (de)confinement phases from time-evolved states in the Z2 gauge theory, and that it can extract fermion flavor/coupling constants in a quantum simulation of parton shower. The observation of nontrivial learning properties demonstrated in these benchmarks will motivate further exploration of the quantum data learning architecture in high-energy physics.

TI Quantum Information in Relativity: The Challenge of QFT Measurements
SO ENTROPY
AB Proposed quantum experiments in deep space will be able to explore quantum information issues in regimes where relativistic effects are important. In this essay, we argue that a proper extension of quantum information theory into the relativistic domain requires the expression of all informational notions in terms of quantum field theoretic (QFT) concepts. This task requires a working and practicable theory of QFT measurements. We present the foundational problems in constructing such a theory, especially in relation to longstanding causality and locality issues in the foundations of QFT. Finally, we present the ongoing Quantum Temporal Probabilities program for constructing a measurement theory that (i) works, in principle, for any QFT, (ii) allows for a first- principles investigation of all relevant issues of causality and locality, and (iii) it can be directly applied to experiments of current interest.

TI Gibbs state sampling via cluster expansions
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Gibbs states (i.e., thermal states) can be used for several applications such as quantum simulation, quantum machine learning, quantum optimization, and the study of open quantum systems. Moreover, semi-definite programming, combinatorial optimization problems, and training quantum Boltzmann machines can all be addressed by sampling from well-prepared Gibbs states. With that, however, comes the fact that preparing and sampling from Gibbs states on a quantum computer are notoriously difficult tasks. Such tasks can require large overhead in resources and/or calibration even in the simplest of cases, as well as the fact that the implementation might be limited to only a specific set of systems. We propose a method based on sampling from a quasi-distribution consisting of tensor products of mixed states on local clusters, i.e., expanding the full Gibbs state into a sum of products of local "Gibbs-cumulant" type states easier to implement and sample from on quantum hardware. We begin with presenting results for 4-spin linear chains with XY spin interactions, for which we obtain the ZZ dynamical spin-spin correlation functions and dynamical structure factor. We also present the results of measuring the specific heat of the 8-spin chain Gibbs state rho 8.

TI Why quantum correlations are shocking
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB A simple minimalist argument is given for why some correlations between quantum systems boggle our classical intuition. The argument relies on two elementary physical assumptions, and recovers the standard experimentally testable Bell inequality in a form that applies equally well to correlations between six-sided dice and between photon polarizations. The first assumption, that measurement selection in a first laboratory leaves the measurement statistics in a remote laboratory invariant (no signaling), has been empirically verified, and is shown to be equivalent to the existence of a corresponding joint probability distribution for quantities measured in the first laboratory. The observed violation of the Bell inequality is then equivalent to the failure of a second assumption, that measurement selection in the remote laboratory leaves such a joint distribution invariant. Indeed, the degree of violation lower-bounds the variation of the joint distribution. It directly follows there are just three possible physical mechanisms underlying such violations-action at a distance (superluminality), unavoidable common factors linking measurement choice and distant properties (conspiracy), and intrinsically incompatible physical quantities (complementarity). The argument extends to all Bell inequalities, and is briefly compared with other derivations.

TI Markovian noise modelling and parameter extraction framework for quantum
   devices
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB In recent years, Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ) computers have been widely used as a test bed for quantum dynamics. This work provides a new hardware-agnostic framework for modelling the Markovian noise and dynamics of quantum systems in benchmark procedures used to evaluate device performance. As an accessible example, the application and performance of this framework is demonstrated on IBM Quantum computers. This framework serves to extract multiple calibration parameters simultaneously through a simplified process which is more reliable than previously studied calibration experiments and tomographic procedures. Additionally, this method allows for real-time calibration of several hardware parameters of a quantum computer within a comprehensive procedure, providing quantitative insight into the performance of each device to be accounted for in future quantum circuits. The framework proposed here has the additional benefit of highlighting the consistency among qubit pairs when extracting parameters, which leads to a less computationally expensive calibration process than evaluating the entire device at once.

SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB The secure transfer of information is critical to the ever-increasing demands of the digital world. Continuous-variable quantum key distribution (CV-QKD) is a promising technology that can provide high secret key rates over metropolitan areas, using conventional telecom components. In this study, we demonstrate the utilization of CV-QKD over a 15 km multi-core fiber (MCF), in which we take advantage of one core to remotely frequency lock Bob's local oscillator with Alice's transmitter. We also demonstrate the capacity of the MCF to boost the secret key rate by parallelizing CV-QKD across multiple cores. Our results indicate that MCFs are promising for the metropolitan deployment of QKD systems.

TI Quantifying Quantumness of Channels Without Entanglement
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Quantum channels breaking entanglement, incompatibility, or nonlocality are defined as such because they are not useful for entanglement-based, one-sided device-independent, or device-independent quantum-information processing, respectively. Here, we show that such breaking channels are related to complementary tests of macrorealism, i.e., temporal separability, channel unsteerability, temporal unsteerability, and the temporal Bell inequality. To demonstrate this we first define a steerability-breaking channel, which is conceptually similar to entanglement and nonlocality-breaking channels and prove that it is identical to an incompatibility-breaking channel. A hierarchy of quantum nonbreaking channels is derived, akin to the existing hierarchy relations for temporal and spatial quantum correlations. We then introduce the concept of channels that break temporal correlations, explain how they are related to the standard breaking channels, and prove the following results. (1) A robustness-based measure for non-entanglement-breaking channels can be probed by temporal nonseparability. (2) A non-steerability-breaking channel can be quantified by channel steering. (3) Temporal steerability and nonmacrorealism can be used for, respectively, distinguishing unital steerability-breaking channels and nonlocality-breaking channels for a maximally entangled state. Finally, a two-dimensional depolarizing channel is experimentally implemented as a proof-of-principle example to demonstrate the hierarchy relation of nonbreaking channels using temporal quantum correlations.

TI Genuine High-Dimensional Quantum Steering
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB High-dimensional quantum entanglement can give rise to stronger forms of nonlocal correlations compared to qubit systems, offering significant advantages for quantum information processing. Certifying these stronger correlations, however, remains an important challenge, in particular in an experimental setting. Here we theoretically formalize and experimentally demonstrate a notion of genuine high-dimensional quantum steering. We show that high-dimensional entanglement, as quantified by the Schmidt number, can lead to a stronger form of steering, provably impossible to obtain via entanglement in lower dimensions. Exploiting the connection between steering and incompatibility of quantum measurements, we derive simple two-setting steering inequalities, the violation of which guarantees the presence of genuine high-dimensional steering, and hence certifies a lower bound on the Schmidt number in a one-sided device-independent setting. We report the experimental violation of these inequalities using macropixel photon-pair entanglement certifying genuine high-dimensional steering. In particular, using an entangled state in dimension d = 31, our data certifies a minimum Schmidt number of n = 15.

TI Towards security recommendations for public-key infrastructures for
   production environments in the post-quantum era
SO EPJ QUANTUM TECHNOLOGY
AB Quantum computing technologies pose a significant threat to the currently employed public-key cryptography protocols. In this paper, we discuss the impact of the quantum threat on public key infrastructures (PKIs), which are used as a part of security systems for protecting production environments. We analyze security issues of existing models with a focus on requirements for a fast transition to post-quantum solutions. Although our primary focus is on the attacks with quantum computing, we also discuss some security issues that are not directly related to the used cryptographic algorithms but are essential for the overall security of the PKI. We attempt to provide a set of security recommendations regarding the PKI from the viewpoints of attacks with quantum computers.

TI Topologically protected entanglement switching around exceptional points
SO LIGHT-SCIENCE & APPLICATIONS
AB The robust operation of quantum entanglement states is crucial for applications in quantum information, computing, and communications1-3. However, it has always been a great challenge to complete such a task because of decoherence and disorder. Here, we propose theoretically and demonstrate experimentally an effective scheme to realize robust operation of quantum entanglement states by designing quadruple degeneracy exceptional points. By encircling the exceptional points on two overlapping Riemann energy surfaces, we have realized a chiral switch for entangled states with high fidelity. Owing to the topological protection conferred by the Riemann surface structure, this switching of chirality exhibits strong robustness against perturbations in the encircling path. Furthermore, we have experimentally validated such a scheme on a quantum walk platform. Our work opens up a new way for the application of non-Hermitian physics in the field of quantum information.
   A topologically protected chiral switch for entangled states with high fidelity is realized by encircling the exceptional points on two overlapping Riemann energy surfaces.

TI Qubit decoherence under two-axis coupling to low-frequency noises
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB Many solid-state qubit systems are afflicted by low-frequency noise mechanisms that operate along two perpendicular axes of the Bloch sphere. Depending on the qubit control fields, either noise can be longitudinal or transverse to the quantization axis of the qubit, thus affecting its dynamics in distinct ways, generally contributing to decoherence that goes beyond pure dephasing. Here, we present a theory that provides a unified platform to study dynamics of a qubit subjected to two perpendicular low-frequency noises (assumed to be Gaussian and uncorrelated) under dynamical decoupling pulse sequences. The theory is demonstrated by the commonly encountered case of power law noise spectra, where approximate analytical results can be obtained.

This paper describes a rewriting system for resistor circuits over any positive division rig using general star to mesh transformations. We show how these transformations can be organized into a confluent and terminating rewriting system on the category of resistor circuits. Furthermore, based on the recently established connections between quantum and electrical circuits, this paper pushes forward the quest for approachable normal forms for stabilizer quantum circuits.

TI Quantum Simulations of Fermionic Hamiltonians with Efficient Encoding
   and Ansatz Schemes
SO JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL THEORY AND COMPUTATION
AB We propose a computational protocol for quantum simulations of fermionic Hamiltonians on a quantum computer, enabling calculations on spin defect systems which were previously not feasible using conventional encodings and a unitary coupled-cluster ansatz of variational quantum eigensolvers. We combine a qubit-efficient encoding scheme mapping Slater determinants onto qubits with a modified qubitcoupled cluster ansatz and noise-mitigation techniques. Our strategy leads to a substantial improvement in the scaling of circuit gate counts and in the number of required qubits, and to a decrease in the number of required variational parameters, thus increasing the resilience to noise. We present results for spin defects of interest for quantum technologies, going beyond minimum models for the negatively charged nitrogen vacancy center in diamonds and the double vacancy in 4H silicon carbide (4H-SiC) and tackling a defect as complex as negatively charged silicon vacancy in 4H-SiC for the first time.

TI An Improved Quantum Algorithm for Ridge Regression
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON KNOWLEDGE AND DATA ENGINEERING
AB Ridge regression (RR) is an important machine learning technique which introduces a regularization hyperparameter a to ordinary multiple linear regression for analyzing data suffering from multicollinearity. In this paper, we present a quantum algorithm for RR, where the technique of parallel Hamiltonian simulation to simulate a number of Hermitian matrices in parallel is proposed and used to develop a quantum version of K-fold cross-validation approach, which can efficiently estimate the predictive performance of RR. Our algorithm consists of two phases: (1) using quantum K-fold cross-validation to efficiently determine a good a with which RR can achieve good predictive performance, and then (2) generating a quantum state encoding the optimal fitting parameters of RR with such a, which can be further utilized to predict new data. Since indefinite dense Hamiltonian simulation has been adopted as a key subroutine, our algorithm can efficiently handle non-sparse data matrices. It is shown that our algorithm can achieve exponential speedup over the classical counterpart for (low-rank) data matrices with low condition numbers. But when the condition numbers of data matrices are large to be amenable to full or approximately full ranks of data matrices, only polynomial speedup can be achieved.

TI Cross-platform comparison of arbitrary quantum states
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB As we approach the era of quantum advantage, when quantum computers (QCs) can outperform any classical computer on particular tasks, there remains the difficult challenge of how to validate their performance. While algorithmic success can be easily verified in some instances such as number factoring or oracular algorithms, these approaches only provide pass/fail information of executing specific tasks for a single QC. On the other hand, a comparison between different QCs preparing nominally the same arbitrary circuit provides an insight for generic validation: a quantum computation is only as valid as the agreement between the results produced on different QCs. Such an approach is also at the heart of evaluating metrological standards such as disparate atomic clocks. In this paper, we report a cross-platform QC comparison using randomized and correlated measurements that results in a wealth of information on the QC systems. We execute several quantum circuits on widely different physical QC platforms and analyze the cross-platform state fidelities.
   Efficient protocols for comparing quantum states generated on different quantum computing platforms are becoming increasingly important. Zhu et al. demonstrate cross-platform verification using randomized measurements that allow for scaling to larger systems as compared to full quantum state tomography.

TI Quantum Bayesian Inference with Renormalization for Gravitational Waves
SO ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL LETTERS
AB Advancements in gravitational-wave (GW) interferometers, particularly the next generation, are poised to enable the detections of orders of magnitude more GWs from compact binary coalescences. While the surge in detections will profoundly advance GW astronomy and multimessenger astrophysics, it also poses significant computational challenges in parameter estimation. In this work, we introduce a hybrid quantum algorithm qBIRD, which performs quantum Bayesian inference with renormalization and downsampling to infer GW parameters. We validate the algorithm using both simulated and observed GWs from binary black hole mergers on quantum simulators, demonstrating that its accuracy is comparable to classical Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods. Currently, our analyses focus on a subset of parameters, including chirp mass and mass ratio, due to the limitations from classical hardware in simulating quantum algorithms. However, qBIRD can accommodate a broader parameter space when the constraints are eliminated with a small-scale quantum computer of sufficient logical qubits.

TI A Novel Two- and Three-Player Scheme for Quantum Direct Communication
SO SYMMETRY-BASEL
AB This paper introduces two information-theoretically quantum secure direct communication protocols that accomplish information exchange between Alice and Bob in the first case, and among Alice, Bob, and Charlie in the second case. Both protocols use a novel method, different from existing similar protocols, to embed the secret information in the entangled compound system. This new way of encoding the secret information is one of the main novelties of this paper, and a distinguishing feature compared to previous works in this field. A second critical advantage of our method is its scalability and extensibility because it can be seamlessly generalized to a setting involving three, or more, players, as demonstrated by the second protocol. This trait is extremely beneficial in many real-life situations, where many spatially separated players posses only part the secret information that must be transmitted to Alice, so that she may obtain the complete secret. Using the three-player protocol, this task can be achieved in one go, without the need to apply a typical QSDC protocol twice, where Alice first receives Bob's and then Charlie's information. The proposed protocol does not require pre-shared keys or quantum signatures, making it less complicated and more straightforward. Finally, in anticipation of the coming era of distributed quantum computing, our protocols offer the important practical advantage of straightforward implementation on contemporary quantum computers, as they only require standard CNOT and Hadamard gates.

TI Quantum Annealing Methods and Experimental Evaluation to the
   Phase-Unwrapping Problem in Synthetic Aperture Radar Imaging
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM ENGINEERING
AB The focus of this work is to explore the use of quantum annealing solvers for the problem of phase unwrapping of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images. Although solutions to this problem exist based on network programming, these techniques do not scale well to larger sized images. Our approach involves formulating the problem as a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) problem, which can be solved on a quantum annealer. Given that present embodiments of quantum annealers remain limited in the number of qubits they possess, we decompose the problem into a set of subproblems that can be solved individually. These individual solutions are close to optimal up to an integer constant, with one constant per subimage. In a second phase, these integer constants are determined as a solution to yet another QUBO problem. This basic idea is extended to several passes, where each pass results in an image which is subsequently decomposed to yet another set of subproblems until the resulting image can be accommodated by the annealer at hand. Additionally, we explore improvements to the method by decomposing the original image into overlapping subimages and ignoring the results on the overlapped (marginal) pixels. We test our approach with a variety of software-based QUBO solvers and on a variety of images, both synthetic and real. Additionally, we experiment using D-wave systems' quantum annealer, the D-wave 2000Q_6 and developed an embedding method which, for our problem, yielded improved results. Our method resulted in high quality solutions, comparable to state-of-the-art phase-unwrapping solvers.

TI Quantum Spin Hall States in 2D Monolayer WTe2/MoTe2 Lateral
   Heterojunctions for Topological Quantum Computation
SO ACS APPLIED NANO MATERIALS
AB The quantum spin Hall (QSH) states in two-dimensional topological insulators (2DTIs) are expected to be applied to future topological quantum computation. We investigate the two-dimensional (2D) lateral heterojunctions of the monolayer 1T '-WTe2 as a 2DTI and the monolayer 2H-MoTe2 as a topologically trivial insulator using density functional theory. This 2D material is expected to have QSH states at each periodically arranged junction as well as properties distinct from the individual properties of each constituent material. At heterojunctions perpendicular to the dimer chains of W atoms in 1T '-WTe2 (in the y direction), two pairs of helical (QSH) states, one at each junction, connect the valence and conduction bands. The strain induced by the large lattice mismatch of the two materials in the y direction widens the bandgap of the 1T '-WTe2 monolayer as a QSH insulator. In the case of the heterojunctions in the x direction, the difference in atomic structure between the two junctions due to low symmetry creates an energy difference between two helical states and a potential gradient in the wide-bandgap 2H-MoTe2 region, resulting in various junction-localized bands. The widening bandgap of the heterojunctions in the y direction is essential for electronic applications of the QSH states, suggesting that this 2D material, namely, 2D WTe2/MoTe2 heterojunctions, can be a promising candidate for integrating Majorana qubits for future topological quantum computation.

TI Faster Quantum Chemistry Simulations on a Quantum Computer with Improved
   Tensor Factorization and Active Volume Compilation
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Electronic structure calculations of molecular systems are among the most promising applications for fault-tolerant quantum computing (FTQC) in quantum chemistry and drug design. However, while recent algorithmic advancements such as qubitization and tensor hypercontraction (THC) have significantly reduced the complexity of such calculations, they do not yet achieve computational runtimes short enough to be practical for industrially relevant use cases. In this work, we combine several advances to electronic structure calculation for molecular systems, resulting in a 2-orders-of-magnitude speedup of estimated runtimes over prior-art algorithms run on comparable quantum devices. One of these advances is a novel framework for block-invariant symmetry-shifted tensor hypercontraction, with which we achieve the tightest Hamiltonian factorizations reported to date. We compile our algorithm for an active volume (AV) architecture, a technical layout that has recently been proposed for fusion-based photonic quantum hardware. AV compilation contributes towards a lower runtime of our computation by eliminating overheads stemming from connectivity issues in the underlying surface code. We present a detailed benchmark of our approach, focusing primarily on the computationally challenging benchmark molecule P450. Leveraging a number of hardware trade-offs in interleaving-based photonic FTQC, we estimate runtimes for the electronic structure calculation of P450 as a function of the device footprint.

TI Comparing Classical and Quantum Generative Learning Models for
   High-Fidelity Image Synthesis
SO TECHNOLOGIES
AB The field of computer vision has long grappled with the challenging task of image synthesis, which entails the creation of novel high-fidelity images. This task is underscored by the Generative Learning Trilemma, which posits that it is not possible for any image synthesis model to simultaneously excel at high-quality sampling, achieve mode convergence with diverse sample representation, and perform rapid sampling. In this paper, we explore the potential of Quantum Boltzmann Machines (QBMs) for image synthesis, leveraging the D-Wave 2000Q quantum annealer. We undertake a comprehensive performance assessment of QBMs in comparison to established generative models in the field: Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs), Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), and Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs). Our evaluation is grounded in widely recognized scoring metrics, including the Frechet Inception Distance (FID), Kernel Inception Distance (KID), and Inception Scores. The results of our study indicate that QBMs do not significantly outperform the conventional models in terms of the three evaluative criteria. Moreover, QBMs have not demonstrated the capability to overcome the challenges outlined in the Trilemma of Generative Learning. Through our investigation, we contribute to the understanding of quantum computing's role in generative learning and identify critical areas for future research to enhance the capabilities of image synthesis models.

TI Entanglement generation between different center-of-mass motions in
   double levitated micromagnet system
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB We theoretically propose a scheme to realize quantum entanglement between two center-of-mass motion (CM) as the external degrees of freedom of two separated levitated yttrium iron garnet spheres. The microwave cavity field is introduced to bridge the interaction between the two separated micromagnet spheres. The optimal condition for getting entanglement between the two CM modes with and without effective cavity-magnon interaction cases are investigated. It is found that the entanglement between two CM modes could be obtained by choosing the appropriate magnon detunings for each case. The effect of the coupling strength and the thermal occupation on the entanglement are also discussed. To realize the entanglement between to CM modes, it is necessary to balance the related parametric interaction and beam splitter interaction. The results show that the CM-CM entanglement is robust against the thermal noise. This scheme would be valuable for quantum network generation and quantum information processing.

TI Rehabilitation Technologies by Integrating Exoskeletons, Aquatic
   Therapy, and Quantum Computing for Enhanced Patient Outcomes
SO SENSORS
AB Recent advancements in patient rehabilitation integrate both traditional and modern techniques to enhance treatment efficacy and accessibility. Hydrotherapy, leveraging water's physical properties, is crucial for reducing joint stress, alleviating pain, and improving circulation. The rehabilitation of upper limbs benefits from technologies like virtual reality and robotics which, when combined with hydrotherapy, can accelerate recovery. Exoskeletons, which support and enhance movement, have shown promise for patients with neurological conditions or injuries. This study focused on implementing and comparing proportional-integral-derivative (PID) and fuzzy logic controllers (FLCs) in a lower limb exoskeleton. Initial PID control tests revealed instability, leading to a switch to a PI controller for better stability and the development of a fuzzy control system. A hybrid strategy was then applied, using FLC for smooth initial movements and PID for precise tracking, with optimized weighting to improve performance. The combination of PID and fuzzy controllers, with tailored weighting (70% for moderate angles and 100% for extensive movements), enhanced the exoskeleton's stability and precision. This study also explored quantum computing techniques, such as the quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) and the quantum Fourier transform (QFT), to optimize controller tuning and improve real-time control, highlighting the potential of these advanced tools in refining rehabilitation devices.

SO EPJ QUANTUM TECHNOLOGY
AB Quantum key distribution (QKD) can provide information-theoretically secure keys for two parties of legitimate communication, and information reconciliation, as an indispensable component of QKD systems, can correct errors present in raw keys based on error-correcting codes. In this paper, we first describe the basic knowledge of information reconciliation and its impact on continuous variable QKD. Then we introduce the information schemes and the corresponding error correction codes employed. Next, we introduce the rate-compatible codes, the hardware acceleration of the reconciliation algorithm, the research progress of information reconciliation, and its application in continuous variable QKD. Finally, we discuss the future challenges and conclude.

TI Violation of No-Signaling on a Public Quantum Computer
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB No-signaling is a consequence of the no-communication theorem that states that bipartite systems cannot transfer information unless a communication channel exists. It is also a by-product of the assumptions of Bell theorem about quantum nonlocality. No-signaling is tested in bipartite systems of qubits from IBM Quantum devices in extremely large statistics, resulting in significant violations. Although the time and space scales of IBM Quantum cannot in principle rule out subluminal communications, there is no obvious physical mechanism leading to signaling. Such signaling is not universal in the relativistic but in a contextual sense. It assumes only lack of interaction between remote parts of the device. The violation is at similar level as observed in the Bell tests. It is therefore mandatory to check possible technical imperfections that may cause the violation and to repeat the loophole-free Bell test at much larger statistics, in order to rule out signaling definitively at strict space-like conditions.

TI Efficient Simulation of Loop Quantum Gravity: A Scalable Linear-Optical
   Approach
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB The problem of simulating complex quantum processes on classical computers gave rise to the field of quantum simulations. Quantum simulators solve problems, such as boson sampling, where classical counterparts fail. In another field of physics, the unification of general relativity and quantum theory is one of the greatest challenges of our time. One leading approach is loop quantum gravity (LQG). Here, we connect these two fields and design a linear-optical simulator such that the evolution of the optical quantum gates simulates the spin-foam amplitudes of LQG. It has been shown that computing transition amplitudes in simple quantum field theories falls into the bounded-error quantum polynomial time class, which strongly suggests that computing transition amplitudes of LQG are classically intractable. Therefore, these amplitudes are efficiently computable with universal quantum computers, which are, alas, possibly decades away. We propose here an alternative special-purpose linear-optical quantum computer that can be implemented using current technologies. This machine is capable of efficiently computing these quantities. This work opens a new way to relate quantum gravity to quantum information and will expand our understanding of the theory.

TI Quantum-Inspired Genetic Algorithm for Resource-Constrained
   Project-Scheduling
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB The Resource-Constrained Project-Scheduling Problem (RCPSP) is an NP-hard problem which can be found in many research domains. The optimal solution of the RCPSP problems requires a balance between exploration/exploitation and diversification/intensification. With this in mind, quantum-inspired evolutionary algorithms' ability to improve the population and quality of solutions, this work investigates the performance of a quantum-inspired genetic algorithm (QIGA), which has been adapted to work with RCPSPs. The proposed QIGA possesses the same structure as classical genetic algorithms, but the initial and updated populations are implemented using quantum gates and quantum superposition, bearing in mind the adaptation of such operators to fit with discrete problems. This work aims to solve RCPSPs using the QIGA to investigate the influence of the various quantum parameters in the proposed algorithm, such as the quantum population size, different options for the quantum gates and re-combination to use in the QIGA. The well-known PSPLIB benchmark instances of J30, J60 and J120 activities are used to test the effectiveness and performance of the proposed QIGA. It is apparent from the results that quantum mutation, quantum crossover and representation of quantum superposition using quantum gates enhances population diversity. The QIGA is also found to outperform many other evolutionary algorithms.

TI Quantum Computing and Machine Learning for Cybersecurity: Distributed
   Denial of Service (DDoS) Attack Detection on Smart Micro-Grid
SO ENERGIES
AB Machine learning (ML) is efficiently disrupting and modernizing cities in terms of service quality for mobility, security, robotics, healthcare, electricity, finance, etc. Despite their undeniable success, ML algorithms need crucial computational efforts with high-speed computing hardware to deal with model complexity and commitments to obtain efficient, reliable, and resilient solutions. Quantum computing (QC) is presented as a strong candidate to help MLs reach their best performance especially for cybersecurity issues and digital defense. This paper presents quantum support vector machine (QSVM) model to detect distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks on smart micro-grid (SMG). An evaluation of our approach against a real dataset of DDoS attack instances shows the effectiveness of our proposed model. Finally, conclusions and some open issues and challenges of the fitting of ML with QC are presented.

TI Three-photon polarization entanglement of green light
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB Recently, great progress has been made in the entanglement of multiple photons at various wavelengths and with different degrees of freedom for optical quantum information applied in diverse scenarios. However, multiphoton entanglement in the transmission window of green light under water has not yet been reported. Here, by combining femtosecond-laser-based multiphoton entanglement and entanglement-maintaining frequency up-conversion techniques, we successfully generate a green two- photon polarization-entangled Bell state and a green three-photon Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger state, whose state fidelities are 0.893 +/- 0.002 and 0.595 +/- 0.023, respectively. Our result provides a scalable method to prepare green multiphoton entanglement, which may have wide applications in underwater quantum information.

TI Confinement and entanglement dynamics on a digital quantum computer
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Confinement describes the phenomenon when the attraction between two particles grows with their distance, most prominently found in quantum chromodynamics (QCD) between quarks. In condensed matter physics, confinement can appear in quantum spin chains, for example, in the one dimensional transverse field Ising model (TFIM) with an additional longitudinal field, famously observed in the quantum material cobalt niobate or in optical lattices. Here, we establish that state-of-the-art quantum computers have reached capabilities to simulate confinement physics in spin chains. We report quantitative confinement signatures of the TFIM on an IBM quantum computer observed via two distinct velocities for information propagation from domain walls and their mesonic bound states. We also find the confinement induced slow down of entanglement spreading by implementing randomized measurement protocols for the second order Renyi entanglement entropy. Our results are a crucial step for probing non-perturbative interacting quantum phenomena on digital quantum computers beyond the capabilities of classical hardware.

TI Progress and Challenges in Optomechanical Quantum Transducers (Invited)
SO ACTA OPTICA SINICA
AB Significance Solid-state qubits, such as superconducting and semiconductor devices, predominantly operate in the microwave (GHz) frequency band, where quantum signals experience severe attenuation at room temperature. This limits the feasibility of long-distance quantum state transmission and has become a central bottleneck in scaling up distributed quantum computing and quantum networks. A promising approach to overcoming this challenge is the use of quantum transducers that coherently convert quantum signals between microwave and optical frequency domains-especially in the telecommunication band. Optical photons, with their low transmission loss and long coherence times, are ideal carriers for long-range quantum communication. Microwave-to-optical transduction can bridge the gap between cryogenic quantum processors and optical quantum networks, enabling modular architectures and integration of heterogeneous quantum systems.
   Among various physical implementations-including electro-optic, magneto-optic, and atomic systems- optomechanical quantum transducers have gained significant attention. These devices exploit mechanical resonators as intermediaries to couple microwave and optical modes, benefiting from broad wavelength compatibility, CMOS process compatibility, and scalability for chip integration. This review systematically examines the principles, performance metrics, and state-of-the-art implementations of optomechanical quantum transducers, emphasizing their role in coherent, low-noise, and efficient microwave-to-optical conversion.
   Progress Significant advances have been made in recent years toward realizing efficient and low-noise optomechanical quantum transduction. The field has systematically developed along four representative device architectures.
   1) Thin-film optomechanical transducers. Inspired by Fabry-Perot cavities, these systems use ultrathin membranes (e.g., SiN) as mechanical resonators positioned between fixed mirrors. They achieve the highest internal efficiencies (similar to 99 %) and record bidirectional conversion efficiencies up to 47 %. However, they suffer from narrow bandwidths (kHz scale) and heating challenges under strong optical pumping in cryogenic environments, which complicate cooling and integration.
   2) Optomechanical crystals (OMCs). Photonic - phononic crystal structures confine both optical and acoustic modes within engineered defect regions, enabling GHz mechanical frequencies and strong optomechanical coupling. Piezoelectric OMCs (e.g., AlN, LiNbO3, GaAs, GaP) facilitate efficient microwave-to-acoustic conversion, while silicon provides low-loss photonics. Recent advances include sub-photon added noise, conversion efficiencies up to 35 %, and even microwave-to-optical entanglement generation. Challenges remain in reducing interface losses in heterogeneous integration and improving simultaneous optical and microwave cooperativities.
   3) Bulk acoustic resonator (BAR) systems. BARs support high-frequency (8-13 GHz) acoustic modes with low thermal occupation, coupled to optical cavities via Brillouin scattering and to microwaves via piezoelectricity. Their modular nature allows independent optimization of acoustic, optical, and microwave subsystems. Recent work demonstrates MHz-scale bandwidths, low added noise, and nonclassical photon-pair generation, but large-scale integration remains a hurdle.
   4) Microdisk resonators. Utilizing whispering gallery modes (WGMs), microdisks offer strong field localization and compatibility with high mechanical frequencies. They have demonstrated efficient piezoelectric coupling to microwaves and moderate optical-to-mechanical coupling, enabling GHz-frequency operation. Current limitations include relatively low single-photon coupling compared to OMCs, but their geometry facilitates integration and nonlinear interactions.
   A comparative analysis shows that while thin-film systems excel in conversion efficiency, OMCs achieve high coupling rates with potential for integration, BARs offer modular optimization and high mechanical frequencies, and microdisks combine compactness with strong piezoelectric coupling. Recent material innovations-such as integrating low-loss photonic materials (Si3N4, GaP) with strong piezoelectrics (AlN, GaAs, LiNbO3) -promise simultaneous enhancement of optical and electrical couplings. Emerging directions include topological phononic crystals and 2D materials (e.g., graphene, hBN) for tunable, robust, and high-frequency transduction.
   Conclusions and Prospects Looking forward, several key challenges define the roadmap for optomechanical quantum transducers.
   1) Cooperativity optimization. Achieving simultaneous high optical-mechanical and microwave-mechanical cooperativity requires careful frequency matching, mode-overlap engineering, and dissipation control.
   2) Low-noise broadband operation. Balancing bandwidth expansion (10-100 MHz) with sub-photon noise performance demands advances in thermal management, pump noise suppression, and cavity impedance matching.
   3) System-level integration. Efficient transduction requires co-design of optical filters, impedance-matched piezoelectric interfaces, and optimized microwave circuits to minimize loss and maximize fidelity.
   4) Scalable fabrication. Moving from proof-of-principle devices to scalable, wafer-level integration will be essential for deployment in quantum repeater networks and distributed quantum processors.
   By bridging microwave and optical quantum platforms, optomechanical transducers are poised to play a pivotal role in the quantum internet, enabling coherent interconnection of superconducting processors, spin qubits, atomic systems, and photonic channels. The field's rapid progress in performance, integration, and noise reduction suggests that practical, deployable microwave-to-optical interfaces may emerge in the near future, unlocking new architectures for secure communication, distributed computation, and hybrid quantum sensing.

TI Natural heavy-hole flopping mode qubit in germanium
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Flopping mode qubits in double quantum dots (DQDs) allow for coherent spin-photon hybridization and fast qubit gates when coupled to either an alternating external or a quantized cavity electric field. To achieve this, however, electronic systems rely on synthetic spin-orbit interaction (SOI) by means of a magnetic field gradient as a coupling mechanism. Here we theoretically show that this challenging experimental setup can be avoided in heavy-hole (HH) systems in germanium (Ge) by utilizing the sizable cubic Rashba SOI. We argue that the resulting natural flopping mode qubit possesses highly tunable spin coupling strengths that allow for qubit gate times in the nanosecond range when the system is designed to function in an optimal operation mode which we quantify.

TI Synthetiq: Fast and Versatile Quantum Circuit Synthesis
SO PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACM ON PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES-PACMPL
AB To implement quantum algorithms on quantum computers it is crucial to decompose their operators into the limited gate set supported by those computers. Unfortunately, existing works automating this essential task are generally slow and only applicable to narrow use cases. We present Synthetiq, a method to synthesize quantum circuits implementing a given specification over arbitrary finite gate sets, which is faster and more versatile than existing works. Synthetiq utilizes Simulated Annealing instantiated with a novel, domain-specific energy function that allows developers to leverage partial specifications for better efficiency. Synthetiq further couples this synthesis method with a custom simplification pass, to ensure efficiency of the found circuits. We experimentally demonstrate that Synthetiq can generate better implementations than were previously known for multiple relevant quantum operators including RCCCX, CCT, CCiSWAP, C root SWAP, and C root iSWAP. Our extensive evaluation also demonstrates Synthetiq frequently outperforms a wide variety of more specialized tools in their own domains, including (i) the well-studied task of synthesizing fully specified operators in the Clifford+T gate set, (ii) epsilon-approximate synthesis of multi-qubit operators in the same gate set, and (iii) synthesis tasks with custom gate sets. On all those tasks, Synthetiq is typically one to two orders of magnitude faster than previous state-of-the-art and can tackle problems that were previously out of the reach of any synthesis tool.

TI Relational bulk reconstruction from modular flow
SO JOURNAL OF HIGH ENERGY PHYSICS
AB The entanglement wedge reconstruction paradigm in AdS/CFT states that for a bulk qudit within the entanglement wedge of a boundary subregion (A) over bar, operators acting on the bulk qudit can be reconstructed as CFT operators on (A) over bar. This naturally fits within the framework of quantum error correction, with the CFT states containing the bulk qudit forming a code protected against the erasure of the boundary subregion A. In this paper, we set up and study a framework for relational bulk reconstruction in holography: given two code subspaces both protected against erasure of the boundary region A, the goal is to relate the operator reconstructions between the two spaces. To accomplish this, we assume that the two code subspaces are smoothly connected by a one-parameter family of codes all protected against the erasure of A, and that the maximally-entangled states on these codes are all full-rank. We argue that such code subspaces can naturally be constructed in holography in a "measurement-based" setting. In this setting, we derive a flow equation for the operator reconstruction of a fixed code subspace operator using modular theory which can, in principle, be integrated to relate the reconstructed operators all along the flow. We observe a striking resemblance between our formulas for relational bulk reconstruction and the infinite-time limit of Connes cocycle flow, and take some steps towards making this connection more rigorous. We also provide alternative derivations of our reconstruction formulas in terms of a canonical reconstruction map we call the modular reflection operator.

TI A new quantum key distribution resource allocation and routing
   optimization scheme
SO CHINESE PHYSICS B
AB Quantum key distribution (QKD) is a technology that can resist the threat of quantum computers to existing conventional cryptographic protocols. However, due to the stringent requirements of the quantum key generation environment, the generated quantum keys are considered valuable, and the slow key generation rate conflicts with the high-speed data transmission in traditional optical networks. In this paper, for the QKD network with a trusted relay, which is mainly based on point-to-point quantum keys and has complex changes in network resources, we aim to allocate resources reasonably for data packet distribution. Firstly, we formulate a linear programming constraint model for the key resource allocation (KRA) problem based on the time-slot scheduling. Secondly, we propose a new scheduling scheme based on the graded key security requirements (GKSR) and a new micro-log key storage algorithm for effective storage and management of key resources. Finally, we propose a key resource consumption (KRC) routing optimization algorithm to properly allocate time slots, routes, and key resources. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme significantly improves the key distribution success rate and key resource utilization rate, among others.

TI Gatemon Qubit on a Germanium Quantum-Well Heterostructure
SO NANO LETTERS
AB Gatemons are superconducting qubits resembling transmons, with a gate-tunable semiconducting weak link as the Josephson element. Here, we report a gatemon device featuring an aluminum microwave circuit on a Ge/SiGe heterostructure embedding a Ge quantum well. Owing to the superconducting proximity effect, the high-mobility two-dimensional hole gas confined in this well provides a gate-tunable superconducting weak link between two Al contacts. We perform Rabi oscillation and Ramsey interference measurements, demonstrate the gate-voltage dependence of the qubit frequency, and measure the qubit anharmonicity. We find relaxation times T 1 up to 119 ns, and Ramsey coherence times T 2 * up to 70 ns, and a qubit frequency gate-tunable over 3.5 GHz. The reported proof-of-concept reproduces the results of a very recent work [] using similar Ge/SiGe heterostructures, thereby validating a novel platform for the development of gatemons and parity-protected cos(2 phi) qubits.

TI Security framework for quantum key distribution with imperfect sources
SO OPTICA QUANTUM
AB Imperfect bit-and-basis encoders compromise the security of quantum key distribution (QKD) systems via modulation flaws, side channels, and inter-pulse correlations, which invalidate standard security proofs. Existing results addressing such imperfections suffer from critical limitations: they either consider only specific flaws, offer an unreasonably poor performance, or require the protocol to be run very slowly. Here, we present a finite-key security proof approach against coherent attacks that incorporates general bit-and-basis encoding imperfections (including modulation flaws, side channels, and inter-pulse correlations) while achieving significantly better performances than previous approaches and requiring only partial characterization.

TI Intrinsic Mixed-State Topological Order
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Decoherence is a major obstacle to the preparation of topological order in noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices. Here, we show that decoherence can also give rise to new types of topological order. Specifically, we construct concrete examples by proliferating fermionic anyons in the toric code via local quantum channels. The resulting mixed states retain long-range entanglement, which manifests in the nonzero topological entanglement negativity, though the topological quantum memory is destroyed by decoherence. By comparison with the gapless spin liquid in pure states, we show that the identified states represent a novel intrinsic mixed-state topological order, which has no counterpart in pure states. Through the lens of quantum anomalies of 1-form symmetries, we then provide general constructions of intrinsic mixed-state topological order and reveal the existence of nonbosonic deconfined anyons as another key feature of these novel phases. The extended meaning and characterization of deconfined excitations and their statistics in mixed states are clarified. Moreover, when these deconfined anyons have nontrivial braiding statistics, we prove that the mixed states cannot be prepared via finite-depth local quantum channels from any bipartite separable states. We further demonstrate our construction using the decohered Kitaev honeycomb model and the decohered double-semion model. In the latter case, a surprising scenario arises where decoherence gives rise to additional types of deconfined anyons.

TI Photophysics of a single quantum emitter based on vanadium
   phthalocyanine molecules
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Single quantum emitters play a fundamental role in the development of quantum technologies such as quantum repeaters, and quantum information processing. Isolating individual molecules with stable optical emission is an essential step for these applications, especially for those molecules that present large coherence times at room temperature. Among them, vanadium-oxide phthalocyanine (VOPc) molecules stand out as promising candidates due to the large coherence times of their ground state electronic spin, which are on the order of microseconds when measured in the ensemble. However, the optical properties of such VOPc molecules at the single emitter level have not yet been reported. Here we show that single VOPc molecules with stable optical properties at room temperature can be isolated. We find that the optical response of the molecule under laser illumination of different polarizations agrees well with a system having pyramidal C4vsymmetry. 4 v symmetry. Furthermore, we provide theoretical calculations that support our experimental findings and provide insight into the role of phonons and the internal electronic structure of the molecule. These results demonstrate that this single paramagnetic molecule can function as a single quantum emitter while displaying optical stability under ambient conditions to have their intrinsic properties investigated.

TI Preparing a Fast Pauli Decomposition for Variational Quantum Solving
   Linear Equations
SO ANNALEN DER PHYSIK
AB Solving linear equations is a basic and significant mathematical task, and it can be executed by variational quantum algorithm (VQA) with quantum advantages by leveraging near-term quantum device and classical optimizer. In the above algorithm, the coefficient matrix should be decomposed first but slowly with the traditional method, for realizing an effective quantum circuit. In this paper, a general framework for preparing a fast Pauli decomposition for solving arbitrary linear equations using VQA is proposed. This method has a simpler form and reduces the complexity of matrix decomposition compared with the traditional one. Moreover, the concrete tables of two and three qubits cases are given for looking up quickly and the instances of Toeplitz matrix, Yule-Walker, and arbitrary equations are demonstrated. Finally, numerical simulations are given to verify this method. This work provides a more convenient and faster preparatory phase for solving linear equations using VQA.
   The general formula of the matrix Pauli decomposition coefficient and the auxiliary decomposition table are given. Through the pre-obtained decomposition table, fast Pauli decomposition for variational quantum algorithms is allowed. For special matrices, such as Hermitian matrices and Toeplitz matrices, their structural properties are proved.image

TI Code-based Sequential Aggregate Signature Scheme
SO CMC-COMPUTERS MATERIALS & CONTINUA
AB This paper proposes the first code-based quantum immune sequential aggregate signature (SAS) scheme and proves the security of the proposed scheme in the random oracle model. Aggregate signature (AS) schemes and sequential aggregate signature schemes allow a group of potential signers to sign different messages respectively, and all the signatures of those users on those messages can be aggregated into a single signature such that the size of the aggregate signature is much smaller than the total size of all individual signatures. Because of the aggregation of many signatures into a single short signature, AS and SAS schemes can reduce bandwidth and save storage; moreover, when a SAS is verified, not only the valid but also the order in which each signer signed can be verified. AS and SAS schemes can be applied to traffic control, banking transaction and military applications. Most of the existing AS and SAS schemes are based either on pairing or Rivest-Shamir-Adleman (RSA), and hence, can be broken by Shor's quantum algorithm for Integer Factoring Problem (IFP) and Discrete Logarithm Problem (DLP). There are no quantum algorithms to solve syndrome decoding problems. Hence, code-based cryptography is seen as one of the promising candidates for post-quantum cryptography. This paper shows how to construct quantum immune sequential aggregate signatures based on coding theory. Specifically, we construct our scheme with the first code based signature scheme proposed by Courtois, Finiasz and Sendrier (CFS). Compared to the CFS signature scheme without aggregation, the proposed sequential aggregate signature scheme can save about 90% storage when the number of signers is asymptotically large.

TI Spatial electron-photon entanglement
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Free electron beams and their quantum coupling with photons are attracting a rising interest due to the basic questions they address and the innovative technology these particles are involved in, such as microscopy, spectroscopy, and quantum computation. This work proposes spatially encoded coupling, where a dual-rail-like electron (e-) state is entangled to a dual-rail photonic qubit. Thus, it complements the leading current concept of the coupling, which links photonic Fock states with the e- energy. Importantly, we show that a spatial electron-photon pair can reach maximal entanglement and propose mutually unbiased bases for verifying the entanglement in a realistic experimental apparatus. Although the energy-level coupling of an e- beam with photonic excitations is well understood, we show that a na & iuml;ve approach for extending such interaction from a single to a double path results in a retrocausal paradox. In the future, the atomic scale precision of electron microscopes can harness such position-encoded free-e- entangled qubits for novel quantum sensing and quantum transduction.

TI Quantum resonant dimensionality reduction
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Quantum computing is a promising candidate for accelerating machine learning tasks. Limited by the control accuracy of current quantum hardware, reducing the consumption of quantum resources is the key to achieving quantum advantage. Here, we propose a quantum resonant dimensionality reduction (QRDR) algorithm based on the quantum resonant transition to reduce the dimension of input data and accelerate the quantum machine learning algorithms. After QRDR, the dimension of input data N can be reduced into the desired scale R, and the effective information of the original data will be preserved correspondingly, which will reduce the computational complexity of subsequent quantum machine learning algorithms or quantum storage. QRDR operates with polylogarithmic time complexity and reduces the error dependency from the order of 1/E3 to the order of 1/E, compared to existing algorithms. Meanwhile, by avoiding quantum phase estimation, the consumed qubits in QRDR is independent on error E. Therefore, compared with existing algorithms, our algorithm has achieved the optimal performance in terms of time complexity and space complexity. We demonstrate the performance of our algorithm combining with two types of quantum classifiers, quantum support vector machines and quantum convolutional neural networks, for classifying underwater detection targets and quantum many-body phase, respectively. The simulation results indicate that reduced data extremely improved the processing efficiency following the application of QRDR. As quantum machine learning continues to advance, our algorithm has the potential to be utilized in a variety of computing fields.

TI Detecting topological edge states with the dynamics of a qubit
SO PHYSICS LETTERS A
AB We consider the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) chain, which has 0, 1, or 2 topological edge states depending on the ratio of the hopping parameters and the parity of the chain length. We couple a qubit to one edge of the SSH chain and a semi-infinite undimerized chain to the other, and evaluate the dynamics of the qubit. By evaluating the decoherence rate of the qubit we can probe the edge states of the SSH chain. The rate shows strong even-odd oscillations as a function of site number, reflecting the presence or absence of edge states. Hence, the qubit acts as an efficient detector of the topological edge states of the SSH model. This can be generalized to other topological systems. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Framework for understanding quantum computing use cases from a
   multidisciplinary perspective and future research directions
SO FUTURES
AB Recently, there has been increasing awareness of the tremendous opportunities inherent in quantum computing (QC). Specifically, the speed and efficiency of QC will significantly impact the Internet of Things, cryptography, finance, and marketing. Accordingly, there has been increased QC research funding from national and regional governments and private firms. However, critical concerns regarding legal, political, and business-related policies germane to QC adoption exist. A few relevant studies are currently available, and those few focus heavily on the technical side of QC. Thus, this study offers a multidisciplinary review of QC, drawing on the expertize of scholars from a wide range of disciplines whose insights coalesce into a framework that simplifies the understanding of QC. This study offers a timely contribution to both practi-tioners and academia, as it explores use cases in business, addresses fundamental legal and po-litical issues undermining QC's adoption, identify possible areas of market disruption, and highlights several research gaps critical to advancing knowledge within the field, including definition of 52 Research Questions that are critical for forecasting, planning, and strategically positioning QC for accelerated diffusion.

TI Stabilizer Codes Over Fields of Even Order
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION THEORY
AB We prove that the natural isomorphism F-2(h)congruent to F-2(h) induces a bijection between stabilizer codes on n quqits with local dimension q=2(h) and binary stabilizer codes on hn qubits. This allows us to describe these codes geometrically: a stabilizer code over a field of even order corresponds to a so-called quantum set of symplectic polar spaces. Moreover, equivalent stabilizer codes have a similar geometry, which can be used to prove the uniqueness of a [[4,0,3]](4) stabilizer code and the nonexistence of both a [[7,1,4]](4) and an [[8,0,5]](4) stabilizer code.

TI Reverse Quantum Annealing Assisted by Forward Annealing
SO QUANTUM REPORTS
AB Quantum annealers conventionally use forward annealing to generate heuristic solutions. Reverse annealing can potentially generate better solutions but necessitates an appropriate initial state. Ways to find such states are generally unknown or highly problem dependent, offer limited success, and severely restrict the scope of reverse annealing. We use a general method that improves the overall solution quality and quantity by feeding reverse annealing with low-quality solutions obtained from forward annealing. An experimental demonstration of solving the graph coloring problem using the D-Wave quantum annealers shows that our method is able to convert invalid solutions obtained from forward annealing to at least one valid solution obtained after assisted reverse annealing for 57% of 459 random Erdos-R & eacute;nyi graphs. Our method significantly outperforms random initial states, obtains more unique solutions on average, and widens the applicability of reverse annealing. Although the average number of valid solutions obtained drops exponentially with the problem size, a scaling analysis for the graph coloring problem shows that our method effectively extends the computational reach of conventional forward annealing using reverse annealing.

TI Quantum-Enhanced Dual-Backbone Architecture for Accurate
   Gastrointestinal Disease Detection Using Endoscopic Imaging
SO BIOMEDINFORMATICS
AB Background: Quantum machine learning (QML) holds significant promise for advancing medical image classification. However, its practical application to large-scale, high-resolution datasets is constrained by the limited number of qubits and the inherent noise in current quantum hardware. Methods: In this study, we propose the Fused Quantum Dual-Backbone Network (FQDN), a novel hybrid architecture that integrates classical convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with quantum circuits. This design is optimized for the noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ), enabling efficient computation despite hardware limitations. We evaluate FQDN on the task of gastrointestinal (GI) disease classification using wireless capsule endoscopy (WCE) images. Results: The proposed model achieves a substantial reduction in parameter complexity, with a 29.04% decrease in total parameters and a 94.44% reduction in trainable parameters, while outperforming its classical counterpart. FQDN achieves an accuracy of 95.80% on the validation set and 95.42% on the test set. Conclusions: These results demonstrate the potential of QML to enhance diagnostic accuracy in medical imaging.

AB Artificial spin ices are frustrated spin systems that can be engineered, in which fine tuning of geometry and topology has allowed the design and characterization of exotic emergent phenomena at the constituent level. Here, we report a realization of spin ice in a lattice of superconducting qubits. Unlike conventional artificial spin ice, our system is disordered by both quantum and thermal fluctuations. The ground state is classically described by the ice rule, and we achieved control over a fragile degeneracy point, leading to a Coulomb phase. The ability to pin individual spins allows us to demonstrate Gauss's law for emergent effective monopoles in two dimensions. The demonstrated qubit control lays the groundwork for potential future study of topologically protected artificial quantum spin liquids.

Various classifications are described, the criteria are analyzed, and the optimal protocol is selected. The analysis is focused around device-dependent schemes with a theoretical emphasis, and therefore, a detailed analysis of device-independent CV-QKD and side-channel attacks is out of the scope of the work. However, the latter, one way or another, is taken into account when describing possible classifications. The choice of the optimal protocol was carried out, first of all, from the potential possibility of integration into existing network telecommunication infrastructures. Predominantly, the general classification is carried out in such a way that it is possible to draw up a specific protocol, depending on the task of implementation.

SGs can adjust distribution strategies based on consumers' real-time electricity demands, which requires continuous transmission of consumer electricity data within the grid. If the privacy and security of these data cannot be ensured, consumers' habits will be exposed, and unnecessary waste may occur. In this article, we propose a key distribution process based on QKD, enabling entities within the SG to encrypt and authenticate each other's data, ensuring the security and privacy of communication channels and transmitted data.

TI Statistical Methods for Quantum State Verification and Fidelity
   Estimation
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB The efficient and reliable certification of quantum states is essential for various quantum information processing tasks as well as for the general progress on the implementation of quantum technologies. In the last few years several methods have been introduced which use advanced statistical methods to certify quantum states in a resource-efficient manner. In this article, a review of the recent progress in this field is presented. How the verification and fidelity estimation of a quantum state can be discussed in the language of hypothesis testing is explained first. Then, various strategies for the verification of entangled states with local measurements or measurements assisted by local operations and classical communication are explained in detail. Finally, several extensions of the problem, such as the certification of quantum channels and the verification of entanglement are discussed.

TI Cryogenic Resonant Amplifier for Electron-on-Helium Image Charge Readout
SO JOURNAL OF LOW TEMPERATURE PHYSICS
AB An electron-on-helium qubit is a promising physical platform for quantum information technologies. Among all the "blueprints" for the qubit realization, a hybrid Rydberg-spin qubit seems to be a promising one towards quantum computing using electron spins. The main technological challenge on the way to such qubits is a detection of fA range image current induced by Rydberg transition of a single electron. To address this problem we aim to use a tank LC-circuit in conjunction with a high impedance and low power dissipation cryogenic amplifier. Here, we report our progress towards realization of a resonant image current detector with a home-made cryogenic amplifier based on FHX13LG HEMT. We present a detailed characterization of the transistor at room and cryogenic temperatures, as well as details of the amplifier design and performance. At the power dissipation level of amplifier well below 100 similar to mu W the measured voltage and current noise level is 0.6 similar to nV/root Hz--- and below 1.5 similar to fA/root Hz, respectively. Based on the actual image current measurements of the Rydberg transition in a many-electron system on liquid helium, we estimate SNR=8 with the measurement bandwidth 1 Hz for the detection of a single-electron transition, providing the noise level at the output is solely determined by the noise of the amplifier.

TI Design of freeform beam shaping micro-optics for single photon sources
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Efficient coupling of single photons into single-mode fibers (SMFs) is critical for scaling many quantum technology applications, including quantum key distribution and quantum repeater networks. In such systems, single photons must be extracted from solid-state emitters and transmitted via SMFs while minimizing loss and decoherence. However, the far-field radiation patterns emitted by bare single-photon sources (SPSs), such as molecular or semiconductor-based emitters, do not inherently match the spatial and angular properties of SMF-supported modes, limiting achievable coupling efficiencies. Common strategies to overcome this mismatch include the use of evanescent coupling, semiconductor-based cavities, and grating structures, where coupling is mediated through near-field interactions between the emitter and the surrounding nanostructures. In this work, we explore an alternative approach based on far-field shaping using continuous freeform micro-optical surfaces. The adopted design workflow combines near-field modeling of SPS emission via finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) simulations with far-field shaping techniques traditionally used in non-imaging illumination optics. Our results demonstrate that non-imaging design methods, which are commonly associated with LED-based illumination problems, can be effectively repur posed for designing coupling micro-optical interfaces to point-like single photon source emitters.

TI Zero-Power Calibration of Photonic Circuits at Cryogenic Temperatures
SO ACS PHOTONICS
AB The continual success of superconducting photon-detection technologies in quantum photonics asserts cryogenic-compatible systems as a cornerstone of full quantum photonic integration. Here, we present a way to reversibly fine-tune the optical properties of individual waveguide structures through local changes to their geometry using solidified xenon. Essentially, we remove the need for additional on-chip calibration elements, effectively zeroing the power consumption tied to reconfigurable elements, with virtually no detriment to photonic device performance. We enable passive circuit tuning in pressure-controlled environments, locally manipulating the cladding thickness over portions of optical waveguides. We realize this in a cryogenic environment, through controlled deposition of xenon gas and precise tuning of its thickness using sublimation, triggered by on-chip resistive heaters. Jr-Phase shifts occur over a calculated length of just L-pi = 12.3 +/- 0.3 mu m. This work paves the way toward the integration of compact, reconfigurable photonic circuits alongside superconducting detectors, devices, or otherwise.

TI Robust quantum entanglement and teleportation in the tetrapartite
   spin-1/2 square clusters: Theoretical study on the effect of a cyclic
   four-spin exchange
SO JOURNAL OF MAGNETISM AND MAGNETIC MATERIALS
AB The whole entanglement measure so-called geometric 4 average of tangles and bipartite entanglement of the antiferromagnetic spin-1/2 XXX Heisenberg model on a tetranuclear square cluster with cyclic four-spin interaction are rigorously examined by the help of thermal negativities. The model comprises two nearest neighbor exchange couplings J1 and J(2) such that J(1) , J(2). When the cyclic four-spin exchange is zero, the maximum value of whole entanglement 4 is achieved at low enough temperatures and relatively high magnetic fields (B asymptotic to J(1)). Also, maximum bipartite entanglement between pair spins with exchange coupling J(1) is achievable at high temperature and high magnetic field. This quantity remains alive for sufficiently high temperature and high magnetic field values comparable with the relevant exchange coupling J(1). A nonzero value of the cyclic four-spin exchange notably enhances the degree of the whole entanglement, while it weakens the bipartite entanglement degree. We demonstrate that the whole entanglement reaches an unconventional minimum at a special parameter region of cyclic four-spin exchange almost ten order of magnitude smaller than J1, where the system is in a quantum antiferromagnetic state. The real complex [Cu4L4(H2O)(4)](ClO4)(4) as a strong antiferromagnetic tetranuclear square compound provides us an experimental representative to estimate the strength of the whole and bipartite entanglements at high enough temperature. It is demonstrated that the entanglement negativities of this complex are yet depend on the considered cyclic four-spin interaction even though its magnitude is significantly smaller than J(1). We realize that the possibility of quantum teleportation through a couple of discrete CuII4 complexes would solely happen for the magnetic fields lower than a critical value. It is also demonstrated that enhancing the cyclic four-spin exchange results in diminishing the average fidelity. Moreover, we conclude that the quantum Fisher information investigated for the pair of spins with exchange interaction J(1) reaches its minimum close to the critical magnetic field at which a ground-state phase transition occurs from highly entangled state to separable one.

TI A Brain Tumor Image Segmentation Method Based on Quantum Entanglement
   and Wormhole Behaved Particle Swarm Optimization
SO FRONTIERS IN MEDICINE
AB Purpose: Although classical techniques for image segmentation may work well for some images, they may perform poorly or not work at all for others. It often depends on the properties of the particular image segmentation task under study. The reliable segmentation of brain tumors in medical images represents a particularly challenging and essential task. For example, some brain tumors may exhibit complex so-called "bottle-neck " shapes which are essentially circles with long indistinct tapering tails, known as a "dual tail. " Such challenging conditions may not be readily segmented, particularly in the extended tail region or around the so-called "bottle-neck " area. In those cases, existing image segmentation techniques often fail to work well. Methods: Existing research on image segmentation using wormhole and entangle theory is first analyzed. Next, a random positioning search method that uses a quantum-behaved particle swarm optimization (QPSO) approach is improved by using a hyperbolic wormhole path measure for seeding and linking particles. Finally, our novel quantum and wormhole-behaved particle swarm optimization (QWPSO) is proposed. Results: Experimental results show that our QWPSO algorithm can better cluster complex "dual tail " regions into groupings with greater adaptability than conventional QPSO. Experimental work also improves operational efficiency and segmentation accuracy compared with current competing reference methods. Conclusion: Our QWPSO method appears extremely promising for isolating smeared/indistinct regions of complex shape typical of medical image segmentation tasks. The technique is especially advantageous for segmentation in the so-called "bottle-neck " and "dual tail "-shaped regions appearing in brain tumor images.

TI Tunable Tansparency in Qubit-Embedded Coupled-Cavities With Photothermal
   Effect
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF QUANTUM CHEMISTRY
AB The properties of the output probe field in a qubit-embedded system containing two coupled cavities are investigated theoretically. A strong pump field and a weak probe field drive the left cavity. The right cavity couples the mechanical oscillator through the photothermal effect. Simultaneously, a qubit couples the right cavity and the mechanical oscillator through Jaynes-Cummings coupling. Coupled-resonator induced transparency (CRIT) is realized in the bare coupled cavities firstly. When considering the photothermal effect, photothermally induced transparency (PTIT) can also be achieved. Further, when a qubit is inserted, the qubit-assisted induced transparency (QIT) is demonstrated. Tunable optical response, along with slow-fast light at different frequencies, is shown by adjusting the system coupling strengths and frequency detunings. Especially, we demonstrate the group delay in the PTIT can also be manipulated by the photon tunneling between the double cavities.

TI Selective-area-epitaxied PbTe-superconductor hybrid nanowires: A new
   candidate system to realize topological quantum computing
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB Semiconductor -superconductor hybrid nanowire is one of the major platforms for realizing Majorana zero modes (MZMs) and topological quantum computing (TQC), and the III -V InAs and InSb-based nanowires are the most-studied materials in this approach. Despite years of efforts to improve and optimize materials, too many defects and impurities in the nanowire samples remain the central problem hindering the research progress in this direction. In recent years, a new candidate Majorana nanowire system-IV-VI semiconductor PbTe-superconductor hybrid nanowire-has attracted much attention and witnessed rapid research progress. The unique advantages of PbTe-based nanowires, such as the large dielectric constant and the presence of a lattice -matched substrate, give them great potential in solving the bottleneck problem of sample defects and impurities, making them an ideal platform for studying MZMs and TQC. In this paper, we briefly introduce the recent research progress of selective area growth and transport characterization of in -plane PbTe nanowires and PbTe-superconductor hybrid nanowires. We also discuss the advantages and problems of the new candidate Majorana nanowire system as well as the prospect of realizing TQC based on it.

TI Introducing a Research Programme for Quantum Humanities: Theoretical
   Implications
SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF RISK REGULATION
AB Quantum computing is a form of computing based on the principles of quantum mechanics. Quantum computing promises to revolutionise society through technological solutions to previously unsolvable problems or by enhancing the capacities of current computational technologies. Additionally, quantum computing has the potential to revolutionise the humanities and social sciences. We denote the study of these changes as "quantum humanities", whose study focuses on the potential of quantum computing. This paper proposes a research programme for quantum humanities, which includes the application of quantum algorithms to humanities research, reflection on the methods and techniques of quantum computing and evaluation of its potential societal implications. Moreover, we argue that, foundationally, quantum mechanics has serious implications for the ways in which data and information are used to produce seemingly objective technologies. Thus, quantum computing is a nexus for the study of knowledge itself. This research programme aims to define the field of quantum humanities and to establish it as a meaningful part of the humanities and social sciences.

TI Monolithic 850 nm VCSEL array for quantum key distribution applications
   via the polarization-based BB84 and decoy-state protocol
SO OPTICS LETTERS
AB Quantum cryptography based on the application of single photons offers a secure communication based on the laws of physics. However, given the sophisticated and challenging implementation of true-single photon sources, the majority of implementations takes advantage of the decoy state protocol, which uses weak coherent pulses instead. For polarization-based protocols, a typical sender configuration includes one or multiple laser sources with external optical elements to realize four different polarization states and two intensity levels (signal and decoy). In this regard, the application of eight independent lasers with fixed polarization makes an external state preparation unnecessary and allows for a higher signal rate, while requiring otherwise identical optical properties of all laser devices such as wavelength and linewidth. Here, we demonstrate a solution on the basis of a compact, monolithic VCSEL array operating at room temperature. The array consists of eight VCSELs with integrated subwavelength gratings for polarization control. Orthogonal polarization suppression ratios (OPSRs) of up to 19.7 dB (19.1 dB) are reached for the rectilinear (diagonal) basis. By careful adjustment of the individual VCSEL's operating point, a wavelength matching of all VCSELs is achieved at an emission wavelength of 851.2nm.

TI Information encoding in the spatial correlations of entangled twin beams
SO SCIENCE ADVANCES
AB The ability to use the temporal and spatial degrees of freedom of quantum states of light to encode and transmit information is crucial for a robust and efficient quantum network. In particular, the potential offered by the large dimensionality of the spatial degree of freedom remains unfulfilled, as the necessary level of control required to encode information remains elusive. We encode information in the distribution of the spatial correlations of entangled twin beams by taking advantage of their dependence on the angular spectrum of the pump needed for four-wave mixing. We show that the encoded information can only be extracted through joint spatial measurements of the twin beams and not through individual beam measurements and that the temporal quantum correlations are not modified. The ability to engineer the spatial properties of twin beams will enable high-capacity quantum networks and quantum-enhanced spatially resolved sensing and imaging.

TI Quantum Electrodynamics Coherence and Hormesis: Foundations of Quantum
   Biology
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR SCIENCES
AB Background: "Quantum biology" (QB) is a promising theoretical approach addressing questions about how living systems are able to unfold dynamics that cannot be solved on a chemical basis or seem to violate some fundamental laws (e.g., thermodynamic yield, morphogenesis, adaptation, autopoiesis, memory, teleology, biosemiotics). Current "quantum" approaches in biology are still very basic and "corpuscular", as these rely on a semi-classical and approximated view. We review important considerations of theory and experiments of the recent past in the field of condensed matter, water, physics of living systems, and biochemistry to join them by creating a consistent picture applicable for life sciences. Within quantum field theory (QFT), the field (also in the matter field) has the primacy whereby the particle, or "quantum", is a derivative of it. The phase of the oscillation and not the number of quanta is the most important observable of the system. Thermodynamics of open systems, symmetry breaking, fractals, and quantum electrodynamics (QED) provide a consistent picture of condensed matter, liquid water, and living matter. Coherence, resonance-driven biochemistry, and ion cyclotron resonance (Liboff-Zhadin effect) emerge as crucial hormetic phenomena. We offer a paradigmatic approach when dealing with living systems in order to enrich and ultimately better understand the implications of current research activities in the field of life sciences.

TI Formal Verification of Quantum Programs: Theory, Tools, and Challenges
SO ACM TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM COMPUTING
AB Over the past 27 years, quantum computing has seen a huge rise in interest from both academia and industry. At the current rate, quantum computers are growing in size rapidly backed up by the increase of research in the field. Significant efforts are being made to improve the reliability of quantum hardware and to develop suitable software to program quantum computers.
   In contrast, the verification of quantum programs has received relatively less attention. Verifying programs is especially important in the quantum setting due to how difficult it is to program complex algorithms correctly on resource-constrained and error-prone quantum hardware. Research into creating verification frameworks for quantum programs has seen recent development, with a variety of tools implemented using a collection of theoretical ideas.
   This survey aims to be a short introduction into the area of formal verification of quantum programs, bringing together theory and tools developed to date. Further, this survey examines some of the challenges that the field may face in the future, namely the development of complex quantum algorithms.

TI Incentive Mechanism for the Development of Rural New Energy Industry:
   New Energy Enterprise-Village Collective Linkages considering the
   Quantum Entanglement and Benefit Relationship
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENERGY RESEARCH
AB As an important foundation of and driving force for rural revitalisation, green and low-carbon energy development is an intrinsic requirement for meeting the people's needs. Rural energy utilization efficiency is low, and there is an urgent need to develop and use renewable green energy. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to explore and clarify the entanglement mechanism between new energy enterprises (NEEs) and village collectives (VCs) considering the mutually beneficial evolutionary stability strategy of the main participants in the rural new energy industry (RNEI) regarding the quantum entanglement state. The quantum evolutionary game model for NEEs and VCs was constructed, and a set of quantum strategies of both parties was introduced. This not only expands the strategy set of the classical game model but also considers the characteristics of quantum entanglement in the implementation of the quantum game. This study also analysed the evolution path and stability strategy of participants in the process of RNEI's development. The results of this study are presented as follows: (i) after considering the entanglement of states, it is easier to adopt the complete quantum strategy to realize the complete incentive situation that "income increases with the increase of one's own efforts," which is conducive to the development of the RNEI. (ii) Observable and quantifiable performance indicators are of greatest importance. Both parties involved in the development of the RNEI should make relevant information open and transparent to promote the smooth implementation of the RNEI development process. (iii) The signing of the "entanglement contract" requires a scientific, complete, specific, and quantifiable performance evaluation system to be established by a professional and independent third-party organization. The study not only makes a certain theoretical contribution to clarifying the mechanism of entanglement between NEEs and village collectives but also provides a theoretical basis for scientific and effective cooperation between NEEs and village collectives.

TI Generation of multiwavelength quantum correlated photon for distribution
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB With the rapid development of quantum information technology, fully connected multi-user quantum entanglement distribution networks have received increasing attention. Among these, multi-wavelength quantum light sources are key devices for establishing connections between multiple users. Despite recent impressive advances, there are still challenges in increasing the wavelength number of photon pairs due to limitations in the design and fabrication of nonlinear optical devices. The potentials of silicon nitride (Si3N4) microring resonators (MRRs), as scalable platforms for multi-wavelength quantum light sources, are explored in this work. The key design parameters of the Si3N4 MRRs, including waveguide dimension, resonator dispersion, and coupling condition, are comprehensively analyzed to optimize photon-pair generation. Based on these parameters, a Si3N4 MRR with a free spectral range of 20 GHz and an average quality factor of 1.6 million is designed and fabricated. This small free spectral range can generate more channels of correlated photon pairs by using the same wavelength resources. The high-quality resonator contributes to the enhancement of the rate of generating high photon pairs , which are critical for quantum entanglement distribution. With a continuous-wave pump laser, correlated photon pairs across a wide spectral range are generated through the spontaneous four-wave mixing (SFWM). The coincidence-to-accidental ratio (CAR) measurements verify the strong quantum correlation between photon pairs, highlighting the reliability of the system for entanglement distribution. Furthermore, the generation and output characteristics of quantum-correlated photon pairs are experimentally investigated with a tunable bandpass filter. The results demonstrate that 71 wavelength-correlated photon pairs within a 25.6 nm spectral range are successively generated as shown in the Fig. A. Our results pave the way for developing the multi-wavelength quantum light sources with Si3N4 platform, thereby advancing the multi-user quantum networks.

TI Phase gradient protection of stored spatially multimode perfect optical
   vortex beams in a diffused rubidium vapor
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB We experimentally investigate the optical storage of perfect optical vortex (POV) and spatially multimode perfect optical vortex (MPOV) beams via electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) in a hot vapor cell. In particular, we study the role that phase gradients and phase singularities play in reducing the blurring of the retrieved images due to atomic diffusion. Three kinds of manifestations are enumerated to demonstrate such effect. Firstly, the suppression of the ring width broadening is more prominent for POVs with larger orbital angular momentum (OAM). Secondly, the retrieved double-ring MPOV beams' profiles present regular dark singularity distributions that are related to their vortex charge difference. Thirdly, the storage fidelities of the triple-ring MPOVs are substantially improved by designing line phase singularities between multi-ring MPOVs with the same OAM number but pi offset phases between adjacent rings. Our experimental demonstration of MPOV storage opens new opportunities for increasing data capacity in quantum memories by spatial multiplexing, as well as the generation and manipulation of complex optical vortex arrays.

TI Iterative quantum optimization of spin glass problems with rapidly
   oscillating transverse fields
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB In this work, we introduce a new iterative quantum algorithm, called Iterative Symphonic Tunneling for Satisfiability problems (IST-SAT), which solves quantum spin glass optimization problems using high-frequency oscillating transverse fields. IST-SAT operates as a sequence of iterations, in which bitstrings returned from one iteration are used to set spin-dependent phases in oscillating transverse fields in the next iteration. Over several iterations, the novel mechanism of the algorithm steers the system toward the problem ground state. We benchmark IST-SAT on sets of hard MAX-3-XORSAT problem instances with exact state vector simulation, and report polynomial speedups over Trotterized adiabatic quantum computation and the best known semi-greedy classical algorithm. When IST-SAT is seeded with a sufficiently good initial approximation, the algorithm converges to exact solution(s) in a polynomial number of iterations. Our numerical results identify a critical Hamming radius, or quality of initial approximation, where the time-to-solution crosses from exponential to polynomial scaling in problem size. This work proposes IST-SAT a new quantum algorithm, which improves upon solutions obtained from initial classical or quantum optimization algorithms. The steering mechanism we introduce through IST-SAT presents a new path toward achieving quantum advantage in optimization.

TI Post-selection in noisy Gaussian boson sampling: part is better than
   whole
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Gaussian boson sampling (GBS) is originally proposed to show quantum advantage with quantum linear optical elements. Recently, several experimental breakthroughs based on GBS pointing to quantum computing supremacy have been presented. However, due to technical limitations, the outcomes of GBS devices are influenced severely by photon loss. Here, we present a practical method to reduce the negative effect caused by photon loss. We first show with explicit formulas that a GBS process can be mapped to another GBS processes. Based on this result, we propose a post-selection method which discards low-quality data according to our criterion to improve the performance of the final computational results, say part is better than whole. As an example, we show that the post-selection method can turn a GBS experiment that would otherwise fail in a 'non-classicality test' into one that can pass that test. Besides improving the robustness of computation results of current GBS devices, this post-selection method may also benefit the further development of GBS-based quantum algorithms.

TI Numerical and quantum simulation of a quantum disentangled liquid
SO PHYSICA A-STATISTICAL MECHANICS AND ITS APPLICATIONS
AB The illustrative wave function for a quantum disentangled liquid (QDL) composed of light and heavy particles is examined within numerical simulations. Initial measurement on light particles gives rise to the volume law of the entanglement entropy of the heavy particles subsystem. The entropy reaches its maximum value as the ratio of the system to subsystem size increases. The standard deviation of entanglement entropy from its thermodynamic limit due to the initial configuration of the light particles is diminished within ensemble averaging. We have introduced a quantum circuit to simulate the underlying QDL state. The results of the quantum simulation are in agreement with the numerical simulations which confirms that the introduced circuit realizes a QDL state. (c) 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Encapsulation Enhances the Quantum Coherence of a Solid-State Molecular
   Spin Qubit
SO ANGEWANDTE CHEMIE-INTERNATIONAL EDITION
AB Spins within molecules benefit from the atomistic control of synthetic chemistry for the realization of qubits. One advantage is that the quantum superpositions of the spin states encoding the qubit can be coherently manipulated using electromagnetic radiation. The main challenge is the fragility of these superpositions when qubits are to partake of solid-state devices. We address this issue with a supramolecular approach for protecting molecular spin qubits against decoherence. The molecular qubit [Cr(ox)(3)](3-) has been encapsulated inside the diamagnetic triple-stranded helicate [Zn2L3](4+) (L is a bis-pyrazolylpyridine ligand). The quantum coherence of the protected qubit is then analyzed with pulsed EPR spectroscopy and compared with the unprotected qubit, both in solution and in the solid state. Crucially, the spin-spin relaxation in the solid state has been examined within diamagnetic crystal lattices of the isostructural ([Al(ox)(3)]@[Zn2L3])+ or [Al(ox)(3)](3-) assemblies, respectively, doped with the Cr3+ qubit in two different (<10%) concentrations. The study unveils a surprising increase of the phase memory time of the qubit upon encapsulation only in the solid. Spin-lattice relaxation times also exhibit a significant enhancement, as established from inversion recovery pulse sequences and from slow relaxation of the magnetization of the protected qubit, not featured by the free qubit.

TI Optimizing biomedical waste generation modeling using quantum machine
   learning and economic development indicators
SO BIOMASS & BIOENERGY
AB Reliable biomedical waste (BMW) prediction is essential for designing efficient waste management systems that protect sustainable cities from health risks. Machine learning (ML) modeling provides efficient and accurate systems, which aid in maximizing management operations. This study analyzes three standalone ML models, namely support vector regression (SVR), narrow neural networks (N-NN), and optimized SVR with quantum behavior particle swarm (QPSO-SVR) for predicting BMW generation rates. The study aimed to assess the data reliability and applicability of ML models for supporting data-driven strategies in waste management planning and public health policy. Feature engineering was used to determine the input variables, and model performance was evaluated using statistical indices aided by 2D visualizations. The prediction outcome indicated that N-NN achieved the highest predictive accuracy (95 %), outperforming SVR and QPSO-SVR (both 91 %). The testing phase further revealed an increased performance with SVR recording the lowest mean squared error (MSE = 0.0108(kg/day)), followed by QPSO-SVR (MSE = 0.0111(kg/day)), indicating strong generalization. Data reliability was verified using Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF), Phillips-Perron (PP), and Jarque-Bera (JB) tests. ADF and PP tests confirmed stationarity, and JB confirmed partial normality. The results demonstrate the ability of ML models to enhance forecasting accuracy. This will support informed decision-making in sustainable waste management and public health protection. Future work could focus on developing hybrid models with advanced data integration to utilize complementary strengths and improve the accuracy and robustness of real-time predictions.

TI Room temperature coherent control of spin defects in hexagonal boron
   nitride
SO SCIENCE ADVANCES
AB Optically active spin defects are promising candidates for solid-state quantum information and sensing applications. To use these defects in quantum applications coherent manipulation of their spin state is required. Here, we realize coherent control of ensembles of boron vacancy centers in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN). Specifically, by applying pulsed spin resonance protocols, we measure a spin-lattice relaxation time of 18 microseconds and a spin coherence time of 2 microseconds at room temperature. The spin-lattice relaxation time increases by three orders of magnitude at cryogenic temperature. By applying a method to decouple the spin state from its inhomogeneous nuclear environment the optically detected magnetic resonance linewidth is substantially reduced to several tens of kilohertz. Our results are important for the employment of van der Waals materials for quantum technologies, specifically in the context of high resolution quantum sensing of two-dimensional heterostructures, nanoscale devices, and emerging atomically thin magnets.

TI Quantum-Resistant Blockchain Protocols for Secure Transactions
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB The advent of quantum computing threatens the cryptographic security of traditional blockchain systems, potentially rendering current encryption techniques obsolete. This paper explores quantum-resistant blockchain protocols that leverage post-quantum cryptographic algorithms to ensure secure transactions. We analyze various quantum-safe cryptographic methods, such as lattice-based, hash-based, and multivariate polynomial cryptography, evaluating their feasibility for blockchain applications. Through comparative analysis, we discuss their computational efficiency and security guarantees. Our findings suggest that integrating quantum-resistant cryptographic techniques into blockchain frameworks is essential for future-proofing decentralized systems. This paper explores the integration of quantum-resistant cryptographic algorithms within blockchain technology. The proposed approach utilizes CRYSTALS-Dilithium for digital signatures, ensuring secure transaction verification in a post-quantum era. While Kyber is a robust key exchange mechanism, it is not suitable for signing transactions. The implementation is tested on standard hardware, demonstrating feasibility without requiring specialized quantum computing infrastructure.

TI Quantum information masking in non-Hermitian systems and robustness

AB By studying quantum information masking (QIM) in non-Hermitian quantum systems, we show that mutually orthogonal quantum states can be deterministically masked, while an arbitrary set of quantum states cannot be masked in non-Hermitian quantum systems. We further demonstrate that a set of linearly independent states which are mutually eta-orthogonal can be deterministically masked by a pseudo-unitary operator. Moreover, we study robustness of QIM against noisy environments. The robustness of deterministic and probabilistic QIM under different quantum noise channels is analyzed in detail. Accordingly, we propose and discuss the r-uniform probabilistic QIM in multipartite systems.

TI Unbalanced penalization: a new approach to encode inequality constraints
   of combinatorial problems for quantum optimization algorithms
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Solving combinatorial optimization problems of the kind that can be codified by quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) is a promising application of quantum computation. Some problems of this class suitable for practical applications such as the traveling salesman problem (TSP), the bin packing problem (BPP), or the knapsack problem (KP) have inequality constraints that require a particular cost function encoding. The common approach is the use of slack variables to represent the inequality constraints in the cost function. However, the use of slack variables considerably increases the number of qubits and operations required to solve these problems using quantum devices. In this work, we present an alternative method that does not require extra slack variables and consists of using an unbalanced penalization function to represent the inequality constraints in the QUBO. This function is characterized by larger penalization when the inequality constraint is not achieved than when it is. We evaluate our approach on the TSP, BPP, and KP, successfully encoding the optimal solution of the original optimization problem near the ground state cost Hamiltonian. Additionally, we employ D-Wave Advantage and D-Wave hybrid solvers to solve the BPP, surpassing the performance of the slack variables approach by achieving solutions for up to 29 items, whereas the slack variables approach only handles up to 11 items. This new approach can be used to solve combinatorial problems with inequality constraints with a reduced number of resources compared to the slack variables approach using quantum annealing or variational quantum algorithms.

By engineering the light shift in a one-dimensional optical lattice, we perform high-resolution spectroscopy and observe the characteristic absorption patterns for a magnetic quadrupole transition. We measure an absolute transition frequency of 446, 647, 242, 704(2) kHz in Sr-88 and an Sr-88-Sr-87 isotope shift of +62.91(4) MHz. In a proof-of-principle experiment, we use this transition to demonstrate local addressing in an optical lattice with 532 nm spacing with a Rayleigh-criterion resolution of 494(45) nm. Our results pave the way for applications of the magnetic quadrupole transition as an optical qubit and for single-site addressing in optical lattices.

TI Improving the Variational Quantum Eigensolver Using Variational
   Adiabatic Quantum Computing
SO ACM TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM COMPUTING
AB The variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) is a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm for finding the minimum eigenvalue of a Hamiltonian that involves the optimization of a parameterized quantum circuit. Since the resulting optimization problem is in general nonconvex, the method can converge to suboptimal parameter values that do not yield the minimum eigenvalue. In this work, we address this shortcoming by adopting the concept of variational adiabatic quantum computing (VAQC) as a procedure to improve VQE. In VAQC, the ground state of a continuously parameterized Hamiltonian is approximated via a parameterized quantum circuit. We discuss some basic theory of VAQC to motivate the development of a hybrid quantum-classical homotopy continuation method. The proposed method has parallels with a predictor-corrector method for numerical integration of differential equations. While there are theoretical limitations to the procedure, we see in practice that VAQC can successfully find good initial circuit parameters to initialize VQE. We demonstrate this with two examples from quantum chemistry. Through these examples, we provide empirical evidence that VAQC, combined with other techniques (an adaptive termination criteria for the classical optimizer and a variance-based resampling method for the expectation evaluation), can provide more accurate solutions than "plain" VQE, for the same amount of effort.

TI Room-Temperature Quantitative Quantum Sensing of Lithium Ions with a
   Radical-Embedded Metal-Organic Framework
SO JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY
AB Recent advancements in quantum sensing have sparked transformative detection technologies with high sensitivity, precision, and spatial resolution. Owing to their atomic-level tunabi l i t y , molecular qubits and ensembles thereof are promising candidates for sensing chemical analytes. Here, we show quantum sensing of lithium ions in solution at room temperature with an ensemble of organic radicals integrated in a microporous metal- organic framework (MOF). The organic radicals exhibit electron spin coherence and microwave addressabi l i t y at room temperature, thus behaving as qubits. The high surface area of the MOF promotes accessibility of the guest analytes to the organic qubits, enabling unambiguous identification of lithium ions and quantitative measurement of their concentration through relaxo-metric and hyperfine spectroscopic methods based on electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy. The sensing principle presented in this work is applicable to other metal ions with nonzero nuclear spin.

TI Complete Information Balance in Quantum Measurement
SO QUANTUM
AB Quantum measurement is a basic tool to manifest intrinsic quantum effects from fundamental tests to quantum information applications. While a measurement is typically performed to gain information on a quantum state, its role in quantum technology is indeed manifold. For instance, quantum measurement is a crucial process element in measurement-based quantum computation. It is also used to detect and correct errors thereby protecting quantum information in error-correcting frameworks. It is therefore important to fully characterize the roles of quantum measurement encompassing information gain, state disturbance and reversibility, together with their fundamental relations. Numerous efforts have been made to obtain the trade-off between information gain and state disturbance, which becomes a practical basis for secure information processing. However, a complete information balance is necessary to include the reversibility of quantum measurement, which constitutes an integral part of practical quantum information processing. We here establish all pairs of trade-off relations involving information gain, disturbance, and reversibility, and crucially the one among all of them together. By doing so, we show that the reversibility plays a vital role in completing the information balance. Remarkably, our result can be interpreted as an information-conservation law of quantum measurement in a nontrivial form. We completely identify the conditions for optimal measurements that satisfy the conservation for each tradeoff relation with their potential applications. Our work can provide a useful guideline for designing a quantum measurement in accordance with the aims of quantum information processors.

We present our causal model that serves as the source coding side of this correlation and introduce a novel concept of resource rate. We argue that, beyond classical secrecy, additional resources exist that are useful for the security of distributed computing problems, which can be captured by the resource rate. Furthermore, we establish a relationship between resource rate and an extension of Shannon's logarithmic information measure, namely, total correlation.

TI Revisiting maximal average fidelity of teleportation
SO PHYSICA A-STATISTICAL MECHANICS AND ITS APPLICATIONS
AB We obtain the maximal average fidelity corresponding to the standard quantum tele-portation protocol for an arbitrary isotropic distribution of input states and an arbitrary resource state. We extend this result to a family of von Neumann measurements, which includes the projections onto the computational and Bell basis, considering a Bell-diagonal resource state.
   We focus on three specific isotropic distributions of input states: (1) completely mixed input states, (2) states with a certain (fixed) degree of purity, and (3) quasi-pure input states. We show that the standard quantum teleportation protocol can teleport arbitrary mixed states with higher average fidelity than its classical counterpart even when the resource of the protocol is a non-entangled state, specifically, a separable Werner state. Moreover, we find that the maximum average fidelity obtained with classical-quantum states used as a resource in a standard teleportation protocol also exceeds the classical fidelity. To establish the role played by the presence or absence of quantum correlations in the resource state and their relation with the correlations present in the von Neumann measurement performed by Alice, we analyze in detail the case of Bell diagonal resource states employing a family of monoparametric basis for which both the Bell and the computational (non-correlated) basis are included. Only in the case where the basis on which Alice measures is completely uncorrelated (computational basis) the maximum average fidelity does not exceed the classical fidelity for any resource state. In all other cases, the maximum average fidelity exceeds the classical one for a certain range of parameters describing the resource state, evidencing the importance of the correlations present in the measurements.

TI Single-qubit probes for temperature estimation in the presence of
   collective baths
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We study the performance of single-qubit probes for temperature estimation in the presence of collective baths. We consider a system of two qubits, each locally dissipating into its own bath while being coupled to a common bath. In this setup, we investigate different scenarios for temperature estimation of both the common and local baths. First, we explore how the precision of a single-qubit probe for estimating the common bath temperature can be enhanced by collective effects arising from the shared bath itself, particularly when the second qubit is in resonance with the probe. Interestingly, we find that the presence of local baths on each qubit can either jeopardize or, if these baths are sufficiently cold, enhance this precision. Next, we demonstrate a remote temperature sensing scheme in which one qubit acts as a probe to estimate the temperature of a local bath affecting the other qubit, by leveraging their indirect interaction through the common bath. This approach enables remote temperature sensing without directly coupling the probe to the target qubit or its local environment, thereby minimizing potential disturbances and practical challenges. Notably, we show that the collective Lamb shift, induced by the common bath, plays a crucial role in enabling remote temperature sensing by generating qubit-qubit correlations, even in the case of noninteracting qubits.

AB We investigate the runtime of quantum kernel estimation in the view of quantum kernel concentration effect. The study is performed for projected quantum kernel family evaluated on hyperspectral remote sensing data. The effect of exponential value concentration leads to the indistinguishability of the kernel matrix entries as the size of the quantum device grows. In order to prevent that, kernel values have to be estimated with a better precision. Increasing precision inevitably connects to an increasing number of circuit runs, which influences the runtime of quantum algorithm. This, in turn, frequently obstructs a possible advantage for quantum machine learning methods. We find that, against popular opinions, the effect of exponential value concentration does not rule out the utility of quantum kernel methods and the severity of the issue depends highly on the data used.

TI Quantum Oblivious Transfer: A Short Review
SO ENTROPY
AB Quantum cryptography is the field of cryptography that explores the quantum properties of matter. Generally, it aims to develop primitives beyond the reach of classical cryptography and to improve existing classical implementations. Although much of the work in this field covers quantum key distribution (QKD), there have been some crucial steps towards the understanding and development of quantum oblivious transfer (QOT). One can show the similarity between the application structure of both QKD and QOT primitives. Just as QKD protocols allow quantum-safe communication, QOT protocols allow quantum-safe computation. However, the conditions under which QOT is fully quantum-safe have been subject to intense scrutiny and study. In this review article, we survey the work developed around the concept of oblivious transfer within theoretical quantum cryptography. We focus on some proposed protocols and their security requirements. We review the impossibility results that daunt this primitive and discuss several quantum security models under which it is possible to prove QOT security.

We explore the speed and fidelity trade-off for gate times 4.4 <= t(g) <= 35 mu s, and benchmark a minimum error per Clifford gate of 1.5(4) x 10(-7). Calibration errors are suppressed to < 10(-8), leaving qubit decoherence (T-2 approximate to 70 s), leakage, and measurement as the dominant error contributions. The ion is held above a microfabricated surface-electrode trap that incorporates a chipintegrated microwave resonator for electronic qubit control; the trap is operated at room temperature without magnetic shielding.

TI Impact analysis of core layout and crosstalk on the coexistence of
   quantum key distribution and classical communications in heterogeneous
   multicore fiber
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Heterogeneous multicore fibers (Hetero-MCFs) offer relatively lower inter-core crosstalk (XT) and improved bend resistance, making them feasible for the coexistence of quantum key distribution (QKD) and classical communications. However, detailed analyses of their impact on QKD performance remain limited. This study comprehensively investigates the significant effects of core layouts and XT on QKD performance in Hetero-MCFs under varying QKD service demands in theory. When allocating classical and quantum cores based on the maximum XT levels, hexagonal Hetero-MCFs perform the worst under low QKD service demand (LD), but comparably and superior to circular layouts under high QKD service demand (HD). The challenge of determining optimal parameters for the central core in hexagonal Hetero-MCFs critically influences overall QKD performance in both HD and LD scenarios. To address this, we propose a novel trench-assisted Hetero-MCF structure featuring an interleaved hexagonal core layout. This structure achieves at least 29-fold improvement in transmission distance for LD and 32-fold for HD scenarios compared to the benchmark, by utilizing two types of heterogeneous cores and providing greater flexibility. Our results also show that deploying homogeneous cores as quantum channels in Hetero-MCFs enhances QKD performance. Even with strict fabrication tolerances, the proposed structure maintains stable QKD performance with a maximum fluctuation of only 12%. These innovations provide valuable insights for analyzing the performance of Hetero-MCFs under varying QKD demands and further developing their co-fiber transmission applications.

TI Quantum information criteria for model selection in quantum state
   estimation
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS A-MATHEMATICAL AND THEORETICAL
AB Quantum state estimation (or state tomography) is an indispensable task in quantum information processing. Because full state tomography that determines all elements of the density matrix is computationally demanding, one usually takes the strategy of assuming a certain model of quantum states and identifying the model parameters. However, it is difficult to make a valid assumption given little prior knowledge on a quantum state of interest, and thus we need a reasonable model selection method for quantum state estimation. Actually, in the classical statistical estimation theory, several types of information criteria have been established and widely used in practice for appropriately choosing a classical statistical model. In this study, we propose quantum information criteria for evaluating the quality of the estimated quantum state in terms of the quantum relative entropy, which is a natural quantum analogue of the classical information criterion defined in terms of Kullback-Leibler divergence. In particular, we derive two quantum information criteria depending on the type of an estimator for the quantum relative entropy; one uses the log-likelihood and the other uses the classical shadow. The general role of information criteria is to predict the performance of an estimated model for unseen data, although it is a function of only sampled data; this generalization capability of the proposed quantum information criteria is evaluated in numerical simulations.

TI Geometric picture for SLOCC classification of pure permutation symmetric
   three-qubit states
SO QUANTUM INFORMATION PROCESSING
AB The quantum steering ellipsoid inscribed inside the Bloch sphere offers an elegant geometric visualization of two-qubit states shared between Alice and Bob. The set of Bloch vectors of Bob's qubit, steered by Alice via all possible local measurements on her qubit, constitutes the steering ellipsoid. The steering ellipsoids are shown to be effective in capturing quantum correlation properties, such as monogamy, exhibited by entangled multiqubit systems. We focus here on the canonical ellipsoids of two-qubit states realized by incorporating optimal local filtering operations by Alice and Bob on their respective qubits. Based on these canonical forms, we show that the reduced two-qubit states drawn from pure entangled three-qubit permutation symmetric states, which are inequivalent under stochastic local operations and classical communication (SLOCC), carry distinct geometric signatures. We provide detailed analysis of the SLOCC canonical forms and the associated steering ellipsoids of the reduced two-qubit states extracted from entangled three-qubit pure symmetric states: We arrive at (i) a prolate spheroid centered at the origin of the Bloch sphere-with longest semiaxis along the z-direction (symmetry axis of the spheroid) equal to 1-in the case of pure symmetric three-qubit states constructed by permutation of 3 distinct spinors and (ii) an oblate spheroid centered at (0, 0, 1/2) inside the Bloch sphere, with fixed semiaxes lengths (1/root 2, 1/root 2, 1/2), when the three-qubit pure state is constructed via symmetrization of 2 distinct spinors. We also explore volume monogamy relations formulated in terms of the volumes of the steering ellipsoids of the SLOCC inequivalent pure entangled three-qubit symmetric states.

Such a trend has inevitably affected the research funding market; thus, large state initiatives are taken that are directly expected to drive the formulation of novel research concepts and the development of quantum device prototypes from sensors and circuitry to quantum memory and repeaters. A fundamental operation behind all these applications is the effective steering of electrons, constituting matter waves, along specific directions and with certain magnitudes, due to development of various reflective and refractive orders. The objective of this study is to optimize the simplest structure that supports such anomalous diffraction, namely a quantum metasurface comprising cylindrical rods embedded in suitable crystalline matter. Several highly-performing designs from these minimal setups are proven to work exceptionally as multiport components, employable to a variety of quantum engineering implementations.

SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Conventional lattice formulations of theta vacua in the 1 + 1-dimensional O(3) nonlinear sigma model suffer from a sign problem. Here, we construct the first sign-problem-free regularization for arbitrary theta. Using efficient lattice Monte Carlo algorithms, we demonstrate how a Hamiltonian model of spin -1/2 degrees of freedom on a two-dimensional spatial lattice reproduces both the infrared sector for arbitrary theta, as well as the ultraviolet physics of asymptotic freedom. Furthermore, as a model of qubits on a two-dimensional square lattice with only nearest-neighbor interactions, it is naturally suited for studying the physics of theta vacua and asymptotic freedom on near-term quantum devices. Our construction generalizes to theta vacua in all CP(N - 1) models, solving a long-standing sign problem.

TI Efficient silicon-erbium photonic hybrids with flexible spatial control
   of light via bound states in the continuum
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB The hybrid of silicon and erbium-doped crystals provides a promising photonic platform for the advancement of quantum technologies, combining scalability, telecom compatibility, and complex quantum functionalities. However, the inherent high refractive index of silicon leads to optical field confinement within the silicon, limiting the number of optically active erbium ions and the achievable light absorption, which are essential for various quantum applications. To fully utilize the potential of erbium-doped crystals, we implemented bound states in the continuum within the hybrid silicon structures, which achieve substantial optical energy confinement within the lower-index crystal. Our structure, which is applicable to both transverse magnetic and transverse electric polarization modes, effectively increases the number of optically active erbium ions and demonstrates simultaneous minimal radiative losses and enhanced erbium absorption. Moreover, the core design principle is extensible to other low-refractive-index materials. (c) 2025 Optica Publishing Group under the terms of the Optica Open Access Publishing Agreement

TI Quantum storage in quantum ferromagnets
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB We must protect inherently fragile quantum data to unlock the potential of quantum technologies. A pertinent concern in schemes for quantum storage is their potential for near-term implementation. Since Heisenberg ferromagnets are readily available, we investigate their potential for robust quantum storage. We propose to use permutation-invariant quantum codes to store quantum data in Heisenberg ferromagnets, because the ground space of any Heisenberg ferromagnet must be symmetric under any permutation of the underlying qubits. By exploiting an area law on the expected energy of Pauli errors, we show that increasing the effective dimension of Heisenberg ferromagnets can improve the storage lifetime. When the effective dimension of Heisenberg ferromagnets is maximal, we also obtain an upper bound for the storage error. This result relies on perturbation theory, where we use Davis' divided difference representation for Frechet derivatives along with the recursive structure of these divided differences. Our numerical bounds allow us to better understand how quantum memory lifetimes can be enhanced in Heisenberg ferromagnets.

TI Compact source for quadripartite deterministically entangled optical
   fields
SO FUNDAMENTAL RESEARCH
AB Since entangled multiple optical fields were identified as the building blocks of quantum networks, the quadripartite entangled optical fields have been produced by using four degenerate optical parametric amplifiers or two nondegenerate optical parametric amplifiers (NOPAs). However, realizing an efficient and compact source for multiple quantum users has remained an outstanding challenge, hindering their practical applications. Here, we proposed a compact and feasible scheme to deterministically entangle four spatially separated optical fields, employing only a single NOPA. Accordingly, two-sided output NOPA-based optical fields were coupled on a beam splitter network to form the quadripartite entangled state, causing the deterministic generation of both the Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) and the linear cluster states in this compact entanglement source. We also obtained the optimal experimental parameters based on the simulation results, thereby providing a direct reference for experimental implementation. Our findings propose that the resultant GHZ and linear cluster states can be potentially applied in quantum-enhanced information science, specifically in quantum secret sharing, controlled quantum teleportation networks, and quantum-entangled atomic ensemble networks.

TI Blatter-Radical-Grafted Mesoporous Silica as Prospective Nanoplatform
   for Spin Manipulation at Ambient Conditions
SO ANGEWANDTE CHEMIE-INTERNATIONAL EDITION
AB Quantum computing and quantum information processing (QC/QIP) crucially depend on the availability of suitable quantum bits (qubits) and methods of their manipulation. Most qubit candidates known to date are not applicable at ambient conditions. Herein, we propose radical-grafted mesoporous silica as a versatile and prospective nanoplatform for spin-based QC/QIP. Extremely stable Blatter-type organic radicals are used, whose electron spin decoherence time is profoundly long even at room temperature (up to T-m approximate to 2.3 mu s), thus allowing efficient spin manipulation by microwave pulses. The mesoporous structure of such composites is nuclear-spin free and provides additional opportunities of embedding guest molecules into the channels. Robustness and tunability of these materials promotes them as highly promising nanoplatforms for future QC/QIP developments.

TI Non-stabilizerness and entanglement from cat-state injection
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB Recently, cat states have been used to heuristically improve the runtime of a classical simulator of quantum circuits based on the diagrammatic ZX-calculus. Here we investigate the use of cat-state injection within the quantum circuit model. We explore a family of cat states, catm* , and describe circuit gadgets using them to concurrently inject non-stabilizerness (also known as magic) and entanglement into any quantum circuit. We provide numerical evidence that cat-state injection does not lead to speed-up in classical simulation. On the other hand, we show that our gadgets can be used to widen the scope of compelling applications of cat states. Specifically, we show how to leverage them to achieve savings in the number of injected qubits, and also to induce scrambling dynamics in otherwise non-entangling Clifford circuits in a controlled manner.

TI Robust Interior Point Method for Quantum Key Distribution Rate
   Computation
SO QUANTUM
AB Security proof methods for quantum key distribution, QKD, that are based on the numerical key rate calculation problem, are powerful in principle. However, the practicality of the methods are limited by computational resources and the efficiency and accuracy of the underlying algorithms for convex optimization. We derive a stable reformulation of the convex nonlinear semidefinite programming, SDP, model for the key rate calculation problems. We use this to develop an efficient, accurate algorithm. The stable reformulation is based on novel forms of facial reduction, FR, for both the linear constraints and nonlinear quantum relative entropy objective function. This allows for a Gauss-Newton type interior-point approach that avoids the need for perturbations to obtain strict feasibility, a technique currently used in the literature. The result is high accuracy solutions with theoretically proven lower bounds for the original QKD from the FR stable reformulation. This provides novel contributions for FR for general SDP.
   We report on empirical results that dramatically improve on speed and accuracy, as well as solving previously intractable problems.

TI DEQSVC: Dimensionality Reduction and Encoding Technique for Quantum
   Support Vector Classifier Approach to Detect DDoS Attacks
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks pose a significant threat to the security of networking systems, as they can cause widespread disruption and even bring down entire distributed systems platforms. In this paper, we propose an approach called the DEQSVC that leverages quantum machine learning techniques to detect DDoS attacks with high accuracy. The DEQSVC integrates the most efficient dimensionality reduction techniques, a robust feature map method, and an efficient kernel estimation technique to improve data encoding, learning process, and detection accuracy. To evaluate the performance of the proposed DEQSVC, we conducted simulations using the Qiskit platform and executed the approach on an IBM quantum computer. Our results demonstrate that the DEQSVC outperforms several benchmark algorithms commonly used in intrusion detection systems. Specifically, the DEQSVC achieves a detection accuracy of 99.49, indicating its effectiveness as a highly accurate and efficient method for detecting DDoS attacks.

TI Blueprint of a Scalable Spin Qubit Shuttle Device for Coherent Mid-Range
   Qubit Transfer in Disordered Si/SiGe/SiO2
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Silicon spin qubits stand out due to their very long coherence times, compatibility with industrial fabrication, and prospect to integrate classical control electronics. To achieve a truly scalable architecture, a coherent mid-range link that moves the electrons between qubit registers has been suggested to solve the signal fan-out problem. Here, we present a blueprint of such a link of 10 mu m length, called a spin qubit shuttle, which is based on connecting an array of gates into a small number of sets. To control these sets, only a few voltage control lines are needed and the number of these sets and thus the number of required control signals is independent of the length of this link. We discuss two different operation modes for the spin qubit shuttle: a qubit conveyor, i.e., a potential minimum that smoothly moves laterally, and a bucket brigade, in which the electron is transported through a series of tunnel-coupled quantum dots by adiabatic passage. We find the former approach more promising considering a realistic Si/SiGe device, including potential disorder from the charged defects at the Si/SiO2 layer, as well as typical charge noise. Focusing on the qubit transfer fidelity in the conveyor shuttling mode, we discuss in detail motional narrowing, the interplay between orbital and valley excitation and relaxation in the presence of g factors that depend on orbital and valley state of the electron, and effects from spin hotspots. We find that a transfer fidelity of 99.9% is feasible in Si/SiGe at a speed of approximately 10 m/s, if the average valley splitting and its inhomogeneity stay within realistic bounds. Operation at low global magnetic field approximately equal to 20 mT and material engineering towards high valley splitting is favorable for reaching high fidelities of transfer.

TI Group twirling and noise tailoring for multiqubit controlled phase gates
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Group twirling is crucial in quantum information processing, particularly in randomized benchmarking and randomized compiling. While protocols based on Pauli twirling have been effectively crafted to transform arbitrary noise channels into Pauli channels for Clifford gates-thereby facilitating efficient benchmarking and mitigating worst-case errors-the lack of practical twirling groups for multiqubit non-Clifford gates remains a challenge. To address this gap, we study the issue of finding twirling groups for generic quantum gates, focusing on a widely used circuit structure in randomized benchmarking or randomized compiling. Specifically, for multiqubit controlled phase gates, which are essential in quantum algorithms and directly implementable in practice, we determine optimal twirling groups within the realm of classically replaceable unitary operations. Contrasting with the local Pauli twirling group for Clifford gates, the optimal groups for such gates contain nonlocal operations, highlighting the overhead of tailoring noise in global non-Clifford contexts. We design new benchmarking procedures for multiqubit controlled phase gates based on the optimal twirling groups. Our simulation results show that our scheme can improve the precision and accuracy of benchmarking in small-scale systems.

TI Degeneracy engineering for classical and quantum annealing: A case study
   of sparse linear regression in collider physics
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
AB Classical and quantum annealing are computing paradigms that have been proposed to solve a wide range of optimization problems. In this paper, we aim to enhance the performance of annealing algorithms by introducing the technique of degeneracy engineering, through which the relative degeneracy of the ground state is increased by modifying a subset of terms in the objective Hamiltonian. We illustrate this novel approach by applying it to the example of l(0)-norm regularization for sparse linear regression, which is, in general, an NP-hard optimization problem. Specifically, we show how to cast l(0)-norm regularization as a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) problem, suitable for implementation on annealing platforms. As a case study, we apply this QUBO formulation to energy flow polynomials in high-energy collider physics, finding that degeneracy engineering substantially improves the annealing performance. Our results motivate the application of degeneracy engineering to a variety of regularized optimization problems.

These pulses are based on the phase modulation of the control field. We provide an experimental proof-of-concept of these operations by using a transmon qubit, demonstrating resilience against deviations in the drive amplitude of more than approximate to 20%, and/or detuning from the qubit transition frequency in the order of 10 MHz. This modulation scheme is straightforward to implement in practice and can be deployed to any other qubit-based experimental platform.

TI Nano-photoluminescence of natural anyon molecules and topological
   quantum computation
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB The proposal of fault-tolerant quantum computations, which promise to dramatically improve the operation of quantum computers and to accelerate the development of the compact hardware for them, is based on topological quantum field theories, which rely on the existence in Nature of physical systems described by a Lagrangian containing a non-Abelian (NA) topological term. These are solid-state systems having two-dimensional electrons, which are coupled to magnetic-flux-quanta vortexes, forming complex particles, known as anyons. Topological quantum computing (TQC) operations thus represent a physical realization of the mathematical operations involving NA representations of a braid group B-n, generated by a set of n localized anyons, which can be braided and fused using a "tweezer" and controlled by a detector. For most of the potential TQC material systems known so far, which are 2D-electron-gas semiconductor structure at high magnetic field and a variety of hybrid superconductor/topological-material heterostructures, the realization of anyon localization versus tweezing and detecting meets serious obstacles, chief among which are the necessity of using current control, i.e., mobile particles, of the TQC operations and high density electron puddles (containing thousands of electrons) to generate a single vortex. Here we demonstrate a novel system, in which these obstacles can be overcome, and in which vortexes are generated by a single electron. This is a similar to 150 nm size many electron InP/GaInP2 self-organized quantum dot, in which molecules, consisting of a few localized anyons, are naturally formed and exist at zero external magnetic field. We used high-spatial-resolution scanning magneto-photoluminescence spectroscopy measurements of a set of the dots having five and six electrons, together with many-body quantum mechanical calculations to demonstrate spontaneous formation of the anyon magneto-electron particles (e(nu)) having fractional charge nu = n/k, where n = 1-4 and k = 3-15 are the number of electrons and vortexes, respectively, arranged in molecular structures having a built-in (internal) magnetic field of 6-12 T. Using direct imaging of the molecular configurations we observed fusion and braiding of e(nu)-anyons under photo-excitation and revealed the possibility of using charge sensing for their control. Our investigations show that InP/GaInP2 anyon-molecule QDs, which have intrinsic transformations of localized e(nu)-anyons compatible with TQC operations and capable of being probed by charge sensing, are very promising for the realization of TQC.

TI Deep Learning-Based Defect Identification for Quantum Key Distribution
   Devices
SO IEEE PHOTONICS JOURNAL
AB Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) technology, with its theoretically unconditional security, has demonstrated significant application value in secure communications system. However, under complex operating conditions characterized by strong electromagnetic interference and temperature/humidity changes in practical applications, QKD terminal devices are susceptible to defects such as quantum state preparation errors and decreased detector efficiency. These defects may cause key rate degradation, seriously threatening communication security. Therefore, accurate identification of QKD device defects is crucial. To address this issue, this paper proposes a deep learning (DL)-based defect identification framework for monitoring of QKD equipment operational status. The results demonstrate that the proposed deep learning algorithm exhibits remarkable advantages in complex system environments, achieving a defect identification accuracy of 99.7% . This work not only validates the effectiveness of deep learning algorithms in QKD device defect identification but also establishes a technical foundation for ensuring the stable operation of quantum-secured communication networks.

TI Operando quantum sensing captures the nanoscale electrochemical
   evolution in batteries
SO DEVICE
AB Obtaining the electrode particle level information is an essential prerequisite for diagnosing battery failures and assessing their state of health (SOH). However, detecting the electrochemical evolution of particles at the nanoscale is not yet possible due to the lack of real-time and non-destructive detection methods with sufficient spatial resolution and sensitivity. Here, we propose an operando quantum sensing approach in which diamond nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers are embedded directly into the internal electrodes to detect the electrochemical evolution at the particle level. The proof of the concept is experimentally demonstrated on an Fe3O4 electrode, where the nanoscale electrochemical evolution is detected by monitoring the magnetic stray field from nearby electrode particles. Multithreading monitoring achieves a spatially resolved measurement of the internal magnetic field, revealing the heterogeneous reaction kinetics among the individual particles. Our work provides a brand-new route for high-resolution, sensitive, and multi-thread monitoring of nanoscale electrochemical evolution in batteries.

Combined with dynamic control over the sign and strength of individual interaction elements, the Rydberg noisy-dressing (RnD) scheme provides a valuable interaction toolbox for quantum technology. As an example, RnD's applications in making stable gigantic three-dimensional soliton molecules and in the formation of quasiperiodic droplet crystals are discussed.

TI Single shot latched readout of a quantum dot qubit using barrier gate
   pulsing
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Qubit latching techniques require precise tuning of multiple tunnel rates, which can be challenging when a qubit is coupled to a single reservoir. Here, we present such a method for single-shot measurement, in which the barrier gate is pulsed to dynamically control qubit-to-reservoir tunnel rates. We use it to reduce the qubit reset time in measurements of coherent Larmor oscillations of a Si/SiGe quantum dot hybrid qubit. The method is also readily applicable to other types of spin-based qubits.

TI Approximate encoding of quantum states using shallow circuits
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Quantum algorithms and simulations often require the preparation of complex states through sequences of 2-qubit gates. For a generic quantum state, the number of required gates grows exponentially with the number of qubits, becoming unfeasible on near-term quantum devices. Here, we aim at creating an approximate encoding of the target state using a limited number of gates. As a first step, we consider a quantum state that is efficiently represented classically, such as a one-dimensional matrix product state. Using tensor network techniques, we develop and implement an efficient optimization algorithm that approaches the optimal implementation, requiring a polynomial number of iterations. We, next, consider the implementation of the proposed optimization algorithm directly on a quantum computer and overcome inherent barren plateaus by employing a local cost function. Our work offers a universal method to prepare target states using local gates and represents a significant improvement over known strategies.

TI Quantum sensing of microRNAs with nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond
SO COMMUNICATIONS CHEMISTRY
AB Label-free detection of nucleic acids such as microRNAs holds great potential for early diagnostics of various types of cancers. Measuring intrinsic biomolecular charge using methods based on field effect has been a promising way to accomplish label-free detection. However, the charges of biomolecules are screened by counter ions in solutions over a short distance (Debye length), thereby limiting the sensitivity of these methods. Here, we measure the intrinsic magnetic noise of paramagnetic counter ions, such as Mn2+, interacting with microRNAs using nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond. All-atom molecular dynamics simulations show that microRNA interacts with the diamond surface resulting in excess accumulation of Mn ions and stronger magnetic noise. We confirm this prediction by observing an increase in spin relaxation contrast of the NV centers, indicating higher Mn2+ local concentration. This opens new possibilities for next-generation quantum sensing of charged biomolecules, overcoming limitations due to the Debye screening.

TI Strategies for achieving high key rates in satellite-based QKD
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Quantum key distribution (QKD) is a pioneering quantum technology on the brink of widespread deployment. Nevertheless, the distribution of secret keys beyond a few 100 km at practical rates remains a major challenge. One approach to circumvent lossy terrestrial transmission of entangled photon pairs is the deployment of optical satellite links. Optimizing these non-static quantum links to yield the highest possible key rate is essential for their successful operation. We therefore developed a high-brightness polarization-entangled photon pair source and a receiver module with a fast steering mirror capable of satellite tracking. We employed this state-of-the-art hardware to distribute photons over a terrestrial free-space link with a distance of 143 km, and extracted secure key rates up to 300 bits per second. Contrary to fiber-based links, the channel loss in satellite downlinks is time-varying and the link time is limited to a few minutes. We therefore propose a model-based optimization of link parameters based on current channel and receiver conditions. This model and our field test will prove helpful in the design and operation of future satellite missions and advance the distribution of secret keys at high rates on a global scale.

TI Experimental underwater quantum key distribution
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB In recent years, the feasibility of quantum key distribution (QKD) in a water channel has been verified by theory and experiment. Here, we present an experimental investigation of QKD and decoy-state QKD based on the BB84 protocol. The experiment was carried out in a 10 m water tank. The attenuation coefficient of tap water is 0.08/m, which is close to Jerlov Type II seawater. We measured the probability-of-detection matrix of polarization states, and the average fidelity of the four polarization states is up to 98.39%. For the 10 m underwater QKD experiment, 20 MHz optical pulses are generated by modulating the laser diode (LD) and attenuated to an average of 0.1 photons per pulse. The security key rate can reach 563.41 kbits/s and the quantum bit error rate (QBER) is 0.36%. Two decoy states (one of which is the vacuum state) was used in the 10 m underwater decoy-state QKD experiment, and the average QBER of signal state is 0.95%, the security key rate reaches 711.29 kbits/s. According to the parameters of the decoy-state experiment, the maximum secure transmission distance of the underwater decoy-state QKD is predicted to be 19.2 m, while it can be increased to 237.1 m in Jerlov Type I seawater with a lower dark count single photon detector (SPD).

TI Enhancing Spin Coherence in Optically Addressable Molecular Qubits
   through Host-Matrix Control
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW X
AB Optically addressable spins are a promising platform for quantum information science due to their combination of a long-lived qubit with a spin-optical interface for external qubit control and readout. The ability to chemically synthesize such systems-to generate optically addressable molecular spins-offers a modular qubit architecture which can be transported across different environments and atomistically tailored for targeted applications through bottom-up design and synthesis. Here, we demonstrate how the spin coherence in such optically addressable molecular qubits can be controlled through engineering their host environment. By inserting chromium (IV)-based molecular qubits into a nonisostructural host matrix, we generate noise-insensitive clock transitions, through a transverse zero-field splitting, that are not present when using an isostructural host. This host-matrix engineering leads to spin-coherence times of more than 10 mu s for optically addressable molecular spin qubits in a nuclear and electron-spin-rich environment. We model the dependence of spin coherence on transverse zero-field splitting from first principles and experimentally verify the theoretical predictions with four distinct molecular systems. Finally, we explore how to further enhance optical-spin interfaces in molecular qubits by investigating the key parameters of optical linewidth and spin-lattice relaxation time. Our results demonstrate the ability to test qubit structurefunction relationships through a tunable molecular platform and highlight opportunities for using molecular qubits for nanoscale quantum sensing in noisy environments.

TI Operando Decoding Ion-Conductive Switch in Stimuli-Responsive Hydrogel
   by Nanodiamond-Based Quantum Sensing
SO ADVANCED SCIENCE
AB Thermal-responsive hydrogels are developed as ion-conductive switchs for energy storage devices, however, the molecule mechanism of switch on/off remains unclear. Here, poly(N-isopropylacrylamide-co-acrylamide) hydrogel is synthesized as a model material and nanodiamond (ND) based quantum sensing for phase change study is developed. First, micro-scale phase separation with cross-linked mesh structure after sol-gel transition is visualized in situ and water molecules are trapped by polymer chains and on a chemically "frozen" state. Then, the nano-scale inhomogeneous distributions of viscosity, thermal conductivity and ionic mobility in hydrogel at high temperature are observed by measuring the rotation, translation and zero-field splitting of NDs. Besides, the ionic mobility of hydrogel is found to be dependent not only on temperature but also on polymer concentration. These observations suggested that the physical "wall" induced by inhomogeneous phase separation at microscopic scale blocked the ion conduction pathways, providing a potential intrinsic explanation for ion migration shut-down of ionic hydrogels at high temperature.
   The study develops nanodiamond (ND) based quantum sensing for operando decoding phase behavior at microscopic scale in stimuli-responsive hydrogel. The rotation, translation and zero-field splitting of NDs at different phases reveal the spatial distribution of viscoelastic and thermodynamic properties within 3D polymer networks, disclosing the inhomogeneous phase transition at nano-scale and accounting for the ion migration shut-down at high temperatures. image

TI Airborne Quantum Key Distribution Performance Analysis under Supersonic
   Boundary Layer
SO ENTROPY
AB Airborne quantum key distribution (QKD) that can synergize with terrestrial networks and quantum satellite nodes is expected to provide flexible and relay links for the large-scale integrated communication network. However, the photon transmission rate would be randomly reduced, owing to the random distributed boundary layer that surrounding to the surface of the aircraft when the flight speed larger than Mach 0.3. Here, we investigate the airborne QKD performance with the BL effects. Furthermore, we take experimental data of supersonic BL into the model and compare the airborne QKD performance under different conditions. Simulation results show that, owing to the complex small-scale turbulence structures in the supersonic boundary layer, the deflection angle and correspondingly drifted offset of the beam varied obviously and randomly, and the distribution probability of photons are redistributed. And the subsonic and supersonic boundary layer would decrease similar to 35.8% and similar to 62.5% of the secure key rate respectively. Our work provides a theoretical guidance towards a possible realization of high-speed airborne QKD.

TI QUANTUM STATES ASSOCIATED TO MIXED GRAPHS AND THEIR ALGEBRAIC
   CHARACTERIZATION
SO ADVANCES IN MATHEMATICS OF COMMUNICATIONS
AB Graph states are present in quantum information and found applications ranging from quantum network protocols (like secret sharing) to measurement based quantum computing. In this paper, we extend the notion of graph states, which can be regarded as pure quantum graph states, or as homogeneous quadratic Boolean functions associated to simple undirected graphs, to quantum states based on mixed graphs (graphs which allow both directed and undirected edges), obtaining mixed quantum states, which are defined by matrices associated to the measurement of homogeneous quadratic Boolean functions in some (ancillary) variables. In our main result, we describe the extended graph state as the sum of terms of a commutative subgroup of the stabilizer group of the corresponding mixed graph with the edges' directions reversed.

TI Quantum optimization of maximum independent set using Rydberg atom
   arrays
SO SCIENCE
AB Realizing quantum speedup for practically relevant, computationally hard problems is a central challenge in quantum information science. Using Rydberg atom arrays with up to 289 qubits in two spatial dimensions, we experimentally investigate quantum algorithms for solving the maximum independent set problem. We use a hardware-efficient encoding associated with Rydberg blockade, realize closed-loop optimization to test several variational algorithms, and subsequently apply them to systematically explore a class of graphs with programmable connectivity. We find that the problem hardness is controlled by the solution degeneracy and number of local minima, and we experimentally benchmark the quantum algorithm's performance against classical simulated annealing. On the hardest graphs, we observe a superlinear quantum speedup in finding exact solutions in the deep circuit regime and analyze its origins.

TI High-Resolution Nanoscale AC Quantum Sensing in CMOS Compatible SiC
SO NANO LETTERS
AB High-resolution nanoscale nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) allows measurement of chemical structure at the single-molecule level for determining molecular dynamics. Until now, nitrogen vacancy centers in diamond have been the only platform to demonstrate single-defect NMR sensing at sub-Hz spectral resolution. Using a single silicon vacancy defect prepared under CMOS-compatible conditions in commercial 4H-silicon carbide at room temperature, we use the Synchronized Readout technique to measure a test signal. We achieve a spectral resolution of 0.33 Hz, necessary for understanding molecular structure, and estimate a magnetic sensitivity of 358 mu T/ H z for our system. We also explore the necessary improvements for achieving single-proton spin sensitivity. Combining these results with future integrated photonics shows a promising path toward scalable nanoscale sensing for low-cost NMR spectrometers based on an industry-mature silicon carbide material.

TI Security of quantum-key-distribution protocol by using the
   post-selection technique
SO PHYSICS OPEN
AB The post-selection technique was proposed by Christandl, Koeuronig, and Renner [Phys. Rev. Lett. 102, 020504 (2009)] to simplify the security of quantum-key-distribution schemes. This work applies this technique to derive the security bounds for the six-state Scarani-Acin-Rigbordy-Gisin 2004 quantum key distribution protocol. This protocol can extract secure keys from a source emitting multi-photons due to its robustness from photon number splitting attacks, making it a good candidate for practical implementations. We also compare the security bounds for this protocol under collective attacks to the security bounds obtained after applying the post-selection tech-nique when using finite resources. Our results demonstrate that the bounds for optimal attack are close to the bound for collective attack for many signals. Notably, the six-state SARG04 protocol proves to be more robust to the PNS attacks when compared to the original four-state SARG04 protocol. This demonstrates the power of the post-selection technique in deriving the security bounds for the six-state protocol when finite resources are used.

TI Side-channel security of practical quantum key distribution
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB We present general security proof for quantum key distribution (QKD) with imperfect states in whole space including both the operational space and the other space (side-channel space). We show that in a protocol where Alice (Bob) uses two states, the secure key rate for a real protocol using imperfect (mixed) states is the same as that of a perfect protocol if the real protocol can be mapped from the perfect protocol. The calculation of the secure key rate for imperfect sources is reduced to the lower bound of projection probability to vacuum for each state. This paves the operable way to side-channel-secure QKD under more realistic conditions, including imperfections of whole-space states, mixed states, and finite data size. Taking the sending-or-not-sending encoding as an example in calculation, we obtain good key rates and long secure distance for QKD that is both measurement-device-independent and secure with imperfect whole-space source states.

TI Experimental Quantum Key Distribution Secure Against Malicious Devices
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB The fabrication of quantum key distribution (QKD) systems typically involves several parties, thus providing Eve with multiple opportunities to meddle with the devices. As a consequence, conventional hardware and/or software hacking attacks pose natural threats to the security of practical QKD. Fortunately, if the number of corrupted devices is limited, the security can be restored by using redundant apparatuses. Here, we report on the demonstration of a secure QKD setup with optical devices and classical postprocessing units possibly controlled by an eavesdropper. We implement a 1.25 GHz chip-based measurement-device-independent QKD system secure against malicious devices on both the measurement and the users' sides. The secret key rate reaches 137 bps over a 24 dB channel loss. Our setup, benefiting from a high clock rate, miniaturized transmitters, and a cost-effective structure, provides a promising solution for widespread applications requiring uncompromising communication security.

TI High mobility SiMOSFETs fabricated in a full 300 mm CMOS process
SO MATERIALS FOR QUANTUM TECHNOLOGY
AB The quality of the semiconductor-barrier interface plays a pivotal role in the demonstration of high quality reproducible quantum dots for quantum information processing. In this work, we have measured SiMOSFET Hall bars on undoped Si substrates in order to investigate the device quality. For devices fabricated in a full complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) process and of very thin oxide below a thickness of 10 nm, we report a record mobility of 17.5 x 103 cm2 V-1 s-1 indicating a high quality interface, suitable for future qubit applications. We also study the influence of gate materials on the mobilities and discuss the underlying mechanisms, giving insight into further material optimization for large scale quantum processors.

TI Graph decomposition techniques for solving combinatorial optimization
   problems with variational quantum algorithms
SO QUANTUM INFORMATION PROCESSING
AB The quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) has the potential to approximately solve complex combinatorial optimization problems in polynomial time. However, current noisy quantum devices cannot solve large problems due to hardware constraints. In this work, we develop an algorithm that decomposes the QAOA input problem graph into a smaller problem and solves MaxCut using QAOA on the reduced graph. The algorithm requires a subroutine that can be classical or quantum-in this work, we implement the algorithm twice on each graph. One implementation uses the classical solver Gurobi in the subroutine and the other uses QAOA. We solve these reduced problems with QAOA. On average, the reduced problems require only approximately 1/10 of the number of vertices than the original MaxCut instances. Furthermore, the average approximation ratio of the original MaxCut problems is 0.75, while the approximation ratios of the decomposed graphs are on average of 0.96 for both Gurobi and QAOA. With this decomposition, we are able to measure optimal solutions for ten 100-vertex graphs by running single-layer QAOA circuits on the Quantinuum trapped-ion quantum computer H1-1, sampling each circuit only 500 times. This approach is best suited for sparse, particularly k-regular graphs, as k-regular graphs on n vertices can be decomposed into a graph with at most nkk+1\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$\frac{nk}{k+1}$$\end{document} vertices in polynomial time. Further reductions can be obtained with a potential trade-off in computational time. While this paper applies the decomposition method to the MaxCut problem, it can be applied to more general classes of combinatorial optimization problems.

TI Improving success probability in Lechner-Hauke-Zoller parity embedding
   by computing with quantum walks
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Lechner-Hauke-Zoller (LHZ) parity embedding is one of the front-running methods for implementing difficult-to-engineer long-range interactions in quantum optimization problems. Continuous-time quantum walks are a leading approach for solving quantum optimization problems. Because they populate excited states, quantum walks can avoid the exponential gap-closing problems seen in other continuous-time techniques such as quantum annealing and adiabatic quantum computation. An important question, therefore, is how continuous-time quantum walks perform in combination with the LHZ parity embedding. By numerically simulating continuous-time quantum walks on four-, five-, and six-logical-qubit Sherrington-Kirkpatrick Ising spin glass instances embedded onto the LHZ parity embedding, we are able to verify the continued efficacy of heuristics used to estimate the optimal hopping rate and the numerical agreement with the theory behind the location of the lower bound of the LHZ parity constraint strength. In addition, by comparing several different LHZ-based decoding methods, we identified postreadout error correction techniques which improve the success probability of the quantum walk.

TI Hybrid quantum and in-memory computing for accelerating solving Simon's
   problem
SO APL MACHINE LEARNING
AB Quantum computing and in-memory computing (IMC) are two emerging paradigms that hold promise for achieving breakthroughs in computing performance. Their combination for efficient algorithmic acceleration has been underexplored but holds significant potential. In this work, we present a novel hybrid quantum and IMC approach for accelerating solving the well-known Simon's problem. While quantum algorithms can exponentially reduce the complexity of Simon's problem, the overall computational complexity remains O(n(3)), which is imposed by the process of solving a system of linear equations in modulo 2 arithmetic (Mod-2 LEs). We have developed a logic IMC approach for solving Mod-2 LEs, where the core lies in the two-step XOR operation by the concept of a stateful neural network and the row SWAP operation based on a COPY gate design in the same framework. Thanks to the high parallelism of logic IMC with a resistive memory array, the complexity of this approach is reduced to O(n(2)). This hybrid computing approach is validated by performing a co-simulation of the quantum algorithm in a quantum information science kit and IMC with a simulation program with integrated circuit emphasis using an idealized resistive random-access memory behavioral model. This work represents the first attempt at integrating various emerging computing paradigms to achieve unprecedented computing speedups. (c) 2025 Author(s).

TI Measurement of Quasiparticle Diffusion in a Superconducting Transmon

SO APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
AB Quasiparticles, especially the ones near the Josephson junctions in the superconducting qubits, are known as an important source of decoherence. By injecting quasiparticles into a quantum chip, we characterized the diffusion feature by measuring the energy relaxation time and the residual excited-state population of a transmon qubit. From the extracted transition rates, we phenomenologically modeled the quasiparticle diffusion in a superconducting circuit that contained "hot" nonequilibrium quasiparticles in addition to low-energy ones.

TI Shannon-limit approached information reconciliation for quantum key
   distribution
SO QUANTUM INFORMATION PROCESSING
AB Information reconciliation (IR) corrects the errors in sifted keys and ensures the correctness of quantum key distribution (QKD) systems. Polar codes-based IR schemes can achieve high reconciliation efficiency; however, the incidental high frame error rate decreases the secure key rate of QKD systems. In this article, we propose a Shannon-limit approached (SLA) IR scheme, which mainly contains two phases: the forward reconciliation phase and the acknowledgment reconciliation phase. In the forward reconciliation phase, the sifted key is divided into sub-blocks and performed with the improved block checked successive cancellation list decoder of polar codes. Afterward, only the failure corrected sub-blocks perform the additional acknowledgment reconciliation phase, which decreases the frame error rate of the SLA IR scheme. The experimental results show that the overall failure probability of SLA IR scheme is decreased to 10-8 and the efficiency is improved to 1.091 with the IR block length of 128 Mb. Furthermore, the efficiency of the proposed SLA IR scheme is 1.055, approached to Shannon limit, when the quantum bit error rate is 0.02 and the input scale of 1 Gb, which is hundred times larger than the state-of-the-art implemented polar codes-based IR schemes.

TI Credit Risk Analysis Using Quantum Computers
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON COMPUTERS
AB We present and analyze a quantum algorithm to estimate credit risk more efficiently than Monte Carlo simulations can do on classical computers. More precisely, we estimate the economic capital requirement, i.e. the difference between the Value at Risk and the expected value of a given loss distribution. The economic capital requirement is an important risk metric because it summarizes the amount of capital required to remain solvent at a given confidence level. We implement this problem for a realistic loss distribution and analyze its scaling to a realistic problem size. In particular, we provide estimates of the total number of required qubits, the expected circuit depth, and how this translates into an expected runtime under reasonable assumptions on future fault-tolerant quantum hardware.

TI Agnostic Process Tomography
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Characterizing a quantum system by learning its state or evolution is a fundamental problem in quantum physics and learning theory with a myriad of applications. Recently, as a new approach to this problem, the task of agnostic state tomography was defined, in which one aims to approximate an arbitrary quantum state by a simpler one in a given class. Generalizing this notion to quantum processes, we initiate the study of agnostic process tomography: given query access to an unknown quantum channel t and a known concept class C of channels, output a quantum channel that approximates t as well as any channel in the concept class C, up to some error. In this work, we propose several natural applications for this new task in quantum machine learning, quantum metrology, classical simulation, and error mitigation. In addition, we give efficient agnostic process tomography algorithms for a wide variety of concept classes, including Pauli strings, Pauli channels, quantum junta channels, low-degree channels, and a class of channels produced by QAC0 circuits. The main technical tool we use is Pauli spectrum analysis of operators and superoperators. We also prove that, using ancilla qubits, any agnostic state tomography algorithm can be extended to one solving agnostic process tomography for a compatible concept class of unitaries, immediately giving us efficient agnostic learning algorithms for Clifford circuits, Clifford circuits with few T gates, and circuits consisting of a tensor product of single-qubit gates. Together, our results provide insight into the conditions and new algorithms necessary to extend the learnability of a concept class from the standard tomographic setting to the agnostic one.

TI Cryogenic Measurement of CMOS Devices for Quantum Technologies
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INSTRUMENTATION AND MEASUREMENT
AB In this article we present the experimental characterization of active components of a standard 65 nm CMOS technology for a temperature range from 313 to 5 K, analyzing the variation of the main parameters over temperature and voltage, recovering their main parameters (threshold voltage V-th, transconductance G(m) and channel conductance G(DS)). The measurement has been carried out wire-bonding the bare dies with the devices to a dedicated printed circuit board (PCB) that has been placed inside a dilution refrigerator. The I-D-V-DS curves for both NMOS and PMOS transistors shows an increase of I-D in the cryogenic regime that is more relevant for high values of V-GS because for lower values it is partially compensated by the variation of V-th. Also, a kink is observed in these curves for high V-DS values, caused by the bulk current generated by impact ionization at the drain combined with the increased resistivity of the frozen-out substrate. The transconductance G(m) reaches non-zero values for higher V-GS as T decreases and then peaks to higher values in the cryogenic regime. In turn, G(DS) increases for increasing T, following the behavior observed for I-D. Both results are in accordance with other thermal characterizations carried out on CMOS transistors in different technologies.

TI Robust Noise Suppression and Quantum Sensing by Continuous Phased
   Dynamical Decoupling
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB We propose and demonstrate experimentally continuous phased dynamical decoupling (CPDD), where we apply a continuous field with discrete phase changes for quantum sensing and robust compensation of environmental and amplitude noise. CPDD does not use short pulses, making it particularly suitable for experiments with limited driving power or nuclear magnetic resonance at high magnetic fields. It requires control of the timing of the phase changes, offering much greater precision than the Rabi frequency control needed in standard continuous sensing schemes. We successfully apply our method to nanoscale nuclear magnetic resonance and combine it with quantum heterodyne detection, achieving microhertz uncertainty in the estimated signal frequency for a 120 s measurement. Our Letter expands significantly the applicability of dynamical decoupling and opens the door for a wide range of experiments, e.g., in nitrogen-vacancy centers, trapped ions, or trapped atoms.

TI Algebraic structure of path-independent quantum control

AB Path-independent (PI) quantum control has recently been proposed to integrate quantum error correction and quantum control [W.-L. Ma, M. Zhang, Y. Wong, K. Noh, S. Rosenblum, P. Reinhold, R. J. Schoelkopf, and L. Jiang, Phys. Rev. Lett. 125, 110503 (2020)], achieving fault-tolerant quantum gates against ancilla errors. Here we reveal the underlying algebraic structure of PI quantum control. The PI Hamiltonians and propagators turn out to lie in an algebra isomorphic to the ordinary matrix algebra, which we call the PI matrix algebra. The PI matrix algebra, defined on the Hilbert space of a composite system (including an ancilla system and a central system), is isomorphic to the matrix algebra defined on the Hilbert space of the ancilla system. By extending the PI matrix algebra to the Hilbert-Schmidt space of the composite system, we provide an exact and unifying condition for PI quantum control against ancilla noise.

TI Security of quantum key distribution with intensity correlations
SO QUANTUM
AB The decoy-state method in quantum key distribution (QKD) is a popular technique to approximately achieve the performance of ideal single-photon sources by means of simpler and practical laser sources. In high-speed decoystate QKD systems, however, intensity correlations between succeeding pulses leak information about the users' intensity settings, thus invalidating a key assumption of this approach. Here, we solve this pressing problem by developing a general technique to incorporate arbitrary intensity correlations to the security analysis of decoy-state QKD. This technique only requires to experimentally quantify two main parameters: the correlation range and the maximum relative deviation between the selected and the actually emitted intensities. As a side contribution, we provide a non-standard derivation of the asymptotic secret key rate formula from the non-asymptotic one, in so revealing a necessary condition for the significance of the former.

TI Red teaming quantum-resistant cryptographic standards: a penetration
   testing framework integrating AI and quantum security
SO JOURNAL OF DEFENSE MODELING AND SIMULATION-APPLICATIONS METHODOLOGY
   TECHNOLOGY-JDMS
AB Quantum computing and artificial intelligence (AI) are transforming the cybersecurity landscape, dictating a reassessment of cryptographic resilience in the face of emerging threats. This study presents a structured approach to evaluating vulnerabilities within quantum cryptographic protocols, focusing on the BB84 quantum key distribution method and National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) approved quantum-resistant algorithms. NIST is recognized globally as the leading institution in this domain, and the algorithms are selected through a decade-long process. By integrating AI-driven red teaming, automated penetration testing, and real-time anomaly detection, the research develops a robust framework for assessing and mitigating security risks in quantum networks. The findings demonstrate that AI can be effectively used to simulate adversarial attacks, probe weaknesses in cryptographic implementations, and refine security mechanisms through iterative feedback. The use of automated exploit simulations and protocol fuzzing provides a scalable means of identifying latent vulnerabilities, while adversarial machine learning techniques highlight novel attack surfaces within AI-enhanced cryptographic processes. This study offers a comprehensive methodology for strengthening quantum security and provides a foundation for integrating AI-driven cybersecurity practices into the evolving quantum landscape.

TI Tripartite Uncertainty, Quantum, and Classical Correlations Dynamics
   under Unruh Effect
SO ANNALEN DER PHYSIK
AB How the dynamics of classical and quantum correlations due to the Unruh effect are reflected in the properties of tripartite entropic uncertainty is investigated. It is found that, despite the quantum correlations disappearing at the limit of infinite acceleration, the uncertainty about the measurement outcome is at its minimum. This is due to the three-qubit system still containing classic correlations at that stage of acceleration. Additionally, the decrease in the entropic uncertainty when the measured qubit interacts strongly with the scalar field can be attributed to the increase in classical correlations. Furthermore, it is found that the entropic uncertainty is fully anti-correlated to classical correlations, and minimal uncertainty can be obtained even in the absence of quantum correlations. A tremendously tight constraint that effectively defined the properties of tripartite entropic uncertainty based on the difference between the total correlation and the Holevo quantities is achieved.

TI Physical entanglement between localized orbitals
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB The goal of the present work is to guide the development of quantum technologies in the context of fermionic systems. For this, we first elucidate the process of entanglement swapping in electron systems such as atoms, molecules or solid bodies. This demonstrates the significance of the number-parity superselection rule and highlights the relevance of localized few-orbital subsystems for quantum information processing tasks. Then, we explore and quantify the entanglement between localized orbitals in two systems, a tight-binding model of non-interacting electrons and the hydrogen ring. For this, we apply the first closed formula of a faithful entanglement measure, derived in (arXiv:2207.03377) as an extension of the von Neumann entropy to genuinely correlated many-orbital systems. For both systems, long-distance entanglement is found at low and high densities eta, whereas for medium densities, eta approximate to 12 , practically only neighboring orbitals are entangled. The Coulomb interaction does not change the entanglement pattern qualitatively except for low and high densities where the entanglement increases as function of the distance between both orbitals.

TI Detecting correlated errors in twin-field quantum key distribution
SO JOURNAL OF THE OPTICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA B-OPTICAL PHYSICS
AB We experimentally demonstrate that we can detect correlated errors in a twin-field quantum key distribution (TFQKD) system by using a technique that is related to self-consistent tomography. We implement a TFQKD system based on a fiber-Sagnac loop, in which Alice and Bob encode information in the phase of weak coherent states that propagate in opposite directions around the loop. These states interfere as they exit the loop and are detected by a third party, Charlie, who reports the results of their measurements to Alice and Bob. We find that it is possible for Alice and Bob to detect correlated state-preparation and measurement errors while trusting only their own individual states, and without trusting Charlie's measurements.(c) 2023 Optica Publishing Group

TI Dual-channel quantum meta-hologram for display
SO ADVANCED PHOTONICS NEXUS
AB Quantum technologies rely on creating and manipulating entangled sources, which are essential for quantum information, communication, and imaging. By integrating quantum technologies and all-dielectric metasurfaces, the performance of miniature display devices can be enhanced to a higher level. Miniature display technology, such as virtual reality display, has achieved original commercial success, and was initially applied to immersive games and interactive scenes. While the consumer market has quickly adopted this technology, several areas remain for improvement, including concerns around bulkiness, dual-channel display, and noise reduction. Here, we experimentally realize a quantum meta-hologram concept demonstration of a miniature display. We fabricate an ultracompact meta-hologram based on 1 mu m thick titanium dioxide (TiO2). The meta-hologram can be remotely switched with heralding technique and is robust against noise with the quantum entangled source. The platform can alter the miniature display channel by manipulating heralding photons' polarization, removing speckles and multiple reflective light noise, improving imaging contrast, and potentially decreasing device weight. Imaging contrast increases from 0.36 dB under speckle noise influences to 6.8 dB in quantum correlation imaging. This approach has the potential to miniaturize quantum displays and quantum communication devices.

TI Controls of a superconducting quantum parametron under a strong pump
   field
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Pumped at approximately twice the natural frequency, a Josephson parametric oscillator called parametron or Kerr parametric oscillator shows self-oscillation. Quantum annealing and universal quantum computation using self-oscillating parametrons as qubits were proposed. However, controls of parametrons under the pump field are degraded by unwanted rapidly oscillating terms in the Hamiltonian, which we call non-resonant rapidly oscillating terms (NROTs) coming from the violation of the rotating wave approximation. Therefore, the pump field can be an intrinsic origin of the imperfection of controls of parametrons. Here, we theoretically study the influence of the NROTs on the accuracy of controls of a parametron: a cat-state creation and a single-qubit gate. It is shown that there is a trade-off relationship between the suppression of the nonadiabatic transitions and the validity of the rotating wave approximation in a conventional approach. We also show that the tailored time dependence of the detuning of the pump field can suppress both of the nonadiabatic transitions and the disturbance of the state of the parametron due to the NROTs.

TI Periodically poled thin-film lithium niobate ring Mach Zehnder coupling
   interferometer as an efficient quantum light source
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Single photons and squeezed light are the two primary workhorses for quantum computation and quantum communication. Generating high-efficiency single photons with high purity and heralding efficiency is the prerequisite for photonic quantum computers. At the same time, generating high-efficiency scalable squeezed light is the prerequisite for continuous variable quantum computing along with sensing applications. Here, we propose a symmetric ring-Mach-Zehnder interferometer (RMZI), which includes a periodically poled lithium niobate (PPLN) waveguide as an efficient source of squeezed light and a single-photon source. We numerically show that our proposed design can generate tunable squeezed light with a squeezing level higher than-12 dB with sub-milli-watt (mW) pump power. The proposed device can also generate single photons with purity as high as 99 (95) % with heralding efficiency 94 (99) % using only 20 ps long pulses. Our proposed design is fully compatible with current fabrication technology. (c) 2025 Optica Publishing Group under the terms of the Optica Open Access Publishing Agreement

TI Quantum interferences and gates with emitter-based coherent photon
   sources
SO OPTICA QUANTUM
AB Quantum emitters such as quantum dots, defects in diamond or in silicon have emerged as efficient single-photon sources that are progressively exploited in quantum technologies. In 2019, it was shown that the emitted single-photon states often include coherence with the vacuum component. Here we investigate how such photon-number coherence alters quantum interference experiments that are routinely implemented both for characterizing or exploiting the generated photons. We show that it strongly modifies intensity correlation measurements in a Hong-Ou-Mandel experiment and leads to errors in indistinguishability estimations. It also results in additional entanglement when performing partial measurements. We illustrate the impact on quantum protocols by evidencing modifications in heralding efficiency and fidelity of two-qubit gates.

The entanglement of free electrons with light is key to developing free-electron quantum optics and its potential applications such as quantum sensing, novel photonic and electron state generation, and entanglement between free electrons.

TI Real-time two-axis control of a spin qubit
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Optimal control of qubits requires the ability to adapt continuously to their ever-changing environment. We demonstrate a real-time control protocol for a two-electron singlet-triplet qubit with two fluctuating Hamiltonian parameters. Our approach leverages single-shot readout classification and dynamic waveform generation, allowing full Hamiltonian estimation to dynamically stabilize and optimize the qubit performance. Powered by a field-programmable gate array (FPGA), the quantum control electronics estimates the Overhauser field gradient between the two electrons in real time, enabling controlled Overhauser-driven spin rotations and thus bypassing the need for micromagnets or nuclear polarization protocols. It also estimates the exchange interaction between the two electrons and adjusts their detuning, resulting in extended coherence of Hadamard rotations when correcting for fluctuations of both qubit axes. Our study highlights the role of feedback in enhancing the performance and stability of quantum devices affected by quasistatic noise.
   Real-time adaptive control of a qubit has been demonstrated but limited to single-axis Hamiltonian estimation. Here the authors implement two-axis control of a singlet-triplet spin qubit with two fluctuating Hamiltonian parameters, resulting in improved quality of coherent oscillations.

SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL FOR PHILOSOPHY OF SCIENCE
AB We discuss the challenges that the standard (Humean and non-Humean) accounts of laws face within the framework of quantum gravity where space and time may not be fundamental. This paper identifies core (meta)physical features that cut across a number of quantum gravity approaches and formalisms and that provide seeds for articulating updated conceptions that could account for QG laws not involving any spatio-temporal notions. To this aim, we will in particular highlight the constitutive roles of quantum entanglement, quantum transition amplitudes and quantum causal histories. These features also stress the fruitful overlap between quantum gravity and quantum information theory.

TI Localization, fractality, and ergodicity in a monitored qubit
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB We study the statistical properties of a single two-level system (qubit) subject to repetitive ancilla-based measurements. This setup is a fundamental minimal model for exploring the intricate interplay between the unitary dynamics of the system and the nonunitary stochasticity introduced by quantum measurements, which is central to the phenomenon of measurement-induced phase transitions. We demonstrate that this "toy model" harbors remarkably rich dynamics, manifesting in the distribution function of the qubit's quantum states in the long-time limit. We uncover a compelling analogy with the phenomenon of Anderson localization, albeit governed by distinct underlying mechanisms. Specifically, the state distribution function of the monitored qubit, parameterized by a single angle on the Bloch sphere, exhibits diverse types of behavior familiar from the theory of Anderson transitions, spanning from complete localization to almost uniform delocalization, with fractality occurring between the two limits. By combining analytical solutions for various special cases with two complementary numerical approaches, we achieve a comprehensive understanding of the structure delineating the "phase diagram" of the model. We categorize and quantify the emergent regimes and identify two distinct phases of the monitored qubit: ergodic and nonergodic. Furthermore, we identify a genuinely localized phase within the nonergodic phase, where the state distribution functions consist of delta peaks, as opposed to the delocalized phase characterized by extended distributions. Identification of these phases and demonstration of transitions between them in a monitored qubit are our main findings.

TI The Multiple-Access Channel With Entangled Transmitters
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION THEORY
AB Communication over a classical multiple-access channel (MAC) with entanglement resources is considered, whereby two transmitters share entanglement resources a priori before communication begins. Leditzky et al. (2020) presented an example of a classical MAC, defined in terms of a pseudo telepathy game, such that the sum rate with entangled transmitters is strictly higher than the best achievable sum rate without such resources. Here, we establish inner and outer bounds on the capacity region for the general MAC with entangled transmitters, and show that the previous result can be obtained as a special case. It has long been known that the capacity region of the classical MAC under a message-average error criterion can be strictly larger than with a maximal error criterion (Dueck, 1978). We observe that given entanglement resources, the regions coincide. Furthermore, we address the combined setting of entanglement resources and conferencing, where the transmitters can also communicate with each other over rate-limited links. Using superdense coding, entanglement can double the conferencing rate.

AB Digital quantum simulation uses the capabilities of quantum computers to determine the dynamics of quantum systems, which are beyond the computability of modern classical computers. A notoriously challenging task in this field is the description of non-equilibrium dynamics in quantum many-body systems. Here, we use the IBM quantum computers to simulate the non-equilibrium dynamics of few spin and fermionic systems. Our results reveal that with a combination of error mitigation, noise extrapolation and optimized initial state preparation, one can tackle the most important drawbacks of modern quantum devices. The systems we simulate demonstrate the potential for large-scale quantum simulations of light-matter interactions in the near future.

TI Photonic processor benchmarking for variational quantum process
   tomography
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB We present a quantum-analogous experimental demonstration of variational quantum process tomography using an optical processor. This approach leverages classical one-hot encoding and unitary decomposition to perform the variational quantum algorithm on a photonic platform. We create the first benchmark for variational quantum process tomography evaluating the performance of the quantum-analogous experiment on the optical processor against several publicly accessible quantum computing platforms, including IBM's 127-qubit Sherbrooke processor, QuTech's five-qubit Tuna-5 processor, and Quandela's 12-mode Ascella quantum optical processor. We evaluate each method using process fidelity, cost function convergence, and processing time per iteration for variational quantum circuit depths of d = 3 and d = 6. Our results indicate that the optical processors outperform their superconducting counterparts in terms of fidelity and convergence behavior reaching fidelities of 0.8 after nine iterations, particularly at higher depths, where the noise of decoherence and dephasing affect the superconducting processors significantly. We further investigate the influence of any additional quantum optical effects in our platform relative to the classical one-hot encoding. From the process fidelity results it shows that the (classical) thermal noise in the phase-shifters dominates over other optical imperfections, such as mode mismatch and dark counts from single-photon sources. The benchmarking framework and experimental results demonstrate that photonic processors are strong contenders for near-term quantum algorithm deployment, particularly in hybrid variational contexts. This analysis is valuable not only for state and process tomography but also for a wide range of applications involving variational quantum circuit based algorithms.

TI Preserving entanglement in a solid-spin system using quantum
   autoencoders
SO APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS
AB Entanglement, as a key resource for modern quantum technologies, is extremely fragile due to the decoherence. Here, we show that a quantum autoencoder, which is trained to compress a particular set of quantum entangled states into a subspace that is robust to decoherence, can be employed to preserve entanglement. The training process is based on a hybrid quantum-classical approach to improve the efficiency in building the autoencoder and reduce the experimental errors during the optimization. Using nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond, we demonstrate that the entangled states between the electron and nuclear spins can be encoded into the nucleus subspace, which has much longer coherence time. As a result, lifetime of the Bell states in this solid-spin system is extended from 2.22 +/- 0.43 mu s to 3.03 +/- 0.56 ms, yielding a three orders of magnitude improvement. The quantum autoencoder approach is universal, paving the way of utilizing long lifetime nuclear spins as immediate-access quantum memories in quantum information tasks.

TI Asymmetric quantum steering in cascaded nonlinear process

AB Asymmetric quantum steering can achieve one-way control, which is different from multipartite quantum steering and can accomplish some work that quantum entanglement cannot complete. The cascaded nonlinear process of spontaneous parametric down-conversion cascaded with double sum-frequency generations can be realized in one optical superlattice by quasi-phase-matching technique. Here the asymmetric quantum steering is investigated in this cascaded nonlinear process and the asymmetry of quantum steering is confirmed in a wide range of the parameters both below and without the oscillation threshold, respectively. The generation of asymmetric quantum steering in present scheme has potential applications in quantum key distribution and continuous variable teleportation.

TI Unambiguous arbitrary high-dimensional Bell states analyzer via
   indefinite causal order
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB High-dimensional quantum systems greatly outperform their two-dimensional counterparts in channel capacity, quantum complexity and efficiency, quantum communication security, etc. Bell-state analyzer (BSA) is a crucial prerequisite for a number of quantum communication protocols. We propose an approach for completely and deterministically distinguishing a set of arbitrary d-dimensional ( d >= 3) Bell states via indefinite causal order (ICO). In previous schemes, bit and phase information are discriminated in succession. Exploiting the gravitational ICO as the sole resource, we propose some high-dimensional BSA schemes. Independent of the dimensions, a set of generalized Bell states are completely and deterministically discriminated by adjusting the form of the embedded local single-qudit gates within ICO switch and measuring each qudit in the {|0 >,|1 >,& ctdot;,|d-1 >} basis. Notably, in our high-dimensional BSA process, the indefinite causal structure is not consumed. Hence a completely nondestructive high-dimensional BSA can be achieved by iterating the indefinite causal structure process for two rounds.

TI Quantum Image Encryption Using a Self-Adaptive Hash Function-Controlled
   Chaotic Map (SAHF-CCM)
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Recently, quantum image encryption algorithms are attracting more and more attention, due to the upcoming quantum threat problem to the current cryptographic encryption algorithms with the rapid progress toward the quantum computer production. The aim of this paper is to introduce a self-adaptive encryption scheme to protect quantum image efficiently with minimal storage requirements. The methodology is to use two rounds of encryption with two different pseudorandom number sequences which are obtained from a new designed pseudorandom number generator (PRNG). This PRNG consists of two parts. The first part is based on iterating a recently proposed chaotic-based parallel keyed hash function which is used as a controller for a second part. The second part is a multiplication of Tent and Chebyshev chaotic maps (TCM). This combination of hash function and chaotic maps provides high randomness and a dramatical increase in the control parameters and initial values number which achieves extremely large key space and so makes the scheme stronger against brute force attacks. The seed or initial value of PRNG depends on the input image itself which makes the scheme self-adaptive and so it is stronger against chosen plaintext attacks and known-plaintext attacks. In the first round of encryption, the value of each pixel qubits of the input image is changed to a new value by XORing it with the corresponding qubits of the first pseudorandom sequence using CNOT and Toffoli quantum gates then shifting to the next qubit with the Swap quantum gate. In this round, the pixel value is changed. In the second round, diffusion of the changed pixel value is extended to each pixel in the input image using the second pseudorandom sequence and Toffoli quantum gates. The time complexity of the proposed scheme is less than many recently published quantum image encryption schemes. The scheme security analysis is discussed, and the experimental results proved that the scheme is robust, secure and efficient.

TI Quantum metrology with a continuous-variable system
SO REPORTS ON PROGRESS IN PHYSICS
AB As one of the main pillars of quantum technologies, quantum metrology aims to improve measurement precision using techniques from quantum information. The two main strategies to achieve this are the preparation of nonclassical states and the design of optimized measurement observables. We discuss precision limits and optimal strategies in quantum metrology and sensing with a single mode of quantum continuous variables. We focus on the practically most relevant cases of estimating displacements and rotations and provide the sensitivities of the most important classes of states that includes Gaussian states and superpositions of Fock states or coherent states. Fundamental precision limits that are obtained from the quantum Fisher information are compared to the precision of a simple moment-based estimation strategy based on the data obtained from possibly sub-optimal measurement observables, including homodyne, photon number, parity and higher moments. Finally, we summarize some of the main experimental achievements and present emerging platforms for continuous-variable sensing. These results are of particular interest for experiments with quantum light, trapped ions, mechanical oscillators, and microwave resonators.

TI Quantum radial basis function method for the Poisson equation
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS A-MATHEMATICAL AND THEORETICAL
AB The radial basis function (RBF) method is widely used for the numerical solution of the Poisson problem in high dimension, where the approximate solution can be found by solving a large system of linear equations. We demonstrate that the RBF method can be accelerated on a quantum computer by using an efficient quantum algorithm for linear equations. We compare the theoretical performance of our quantum algorithm with that of a standard classical algorithm, and find that the quantum algorithm can achieve a polynomial speedup.

TI Quantum information in holographic duality
SO REPORTS ON PROGRESS IN PHYSICS
AB We give a pedagogical review of how concepts from quantum information theory build up the gravitational side of the anti-de Sitter/conformal field theory correspondence. The review is self-contained in that it only presupposes knowledge of quantum mechanics and general relativity; other tools-including holographic duality itself-are introduced in the text. We have aimed to give researchers interested in entering this field a working knowledge sufficient for initiating original projects. The review begins with the laws of black hole thermodynamics, which form the basis of this subject, then introduces the Ryu-Takayanagi proposal, the Jafferis-Lewkowycz-Maldacena-Suh (JLMS) relation, and subregion duality. We discuss tensor networks as a visualization tool and analyze various network architectures in detail. Next, several modern concepts and techniques are discussed: Renyi entropies and the replica trick, differential entropy and kinematic space, modular Berry phases, modular minimal entropy, entanglement wedge cross-sections, bit threads, and others. We discuss the extent to which bulk geometries are fixed by boundary entanglement entropies, and analyze the relations such as the monogamy of mutual information, which boundary entanglement entropies must obey if a state has a semiclassical bulk dual. We close with a discussion of black holes, including holographic complexity, firewalls and the black hole information paradox, islands, and replica wormholes.

TI An Extended Epistemic Framework Beyond Probability for Quantum
   Information Processing with Applications in Security, Artificial
   Intelligence, and Financial Computing
SO ENTROPY
AB In this work, we propose a novel quantum-informed epistemic framework that extends the classical notion of probability by integrating plausibility, credibility, and possibility as distinct yet complementary measures of uncertainty. This enriched quadruple (P, Pl, Cr, Ps) enables a deeper characterization of quantum systems and decision-making processes under partial, noisy, or ambiguous information. Our formalism generalizes the Born rule within a multi-valued logic structure, linking Positive Operator-Valued Measures (POVMs) with data-driven plausibility estimators, agent-based credibility priors, and fuzzy-theoretic possibility functions. We develop a hybrid classical-quantum inference engine that computes a vectorial aggregation of the quadruples, enhancing robustness and semantic expressivity in contexts where classical probability fails to capture non-Kolmogorovian phenomena such as entanglement, contextuality, or decoherence. The approach is validated through three real-world application domains-quantum cybersecurity, quantum AI, and financial computing-where the proposed model outperforms standard probabilistic reasoning in terms of accuracy, resilience to noise, interpretability, and decision stability. Comparative analysis against QBism, Dempster-Shafer, and fuzzy quantum logic further demonstrates the uniqueness of architecture in both operational semantics and practical outcomes. This contribution lays the groundwork for a new theory of epistemic quantum computing capable of modelling and acting under uncertainty beyond traditional paradigms.

TI Policy Gradient Approach to Compilation of Variational Quantum Circuits
SO QUANTUM
AB We propose a method for finding approximate compilations of quantum unitary transformations, based on techniques from policy gradient reinforcement learning. The choice of a stochastic policy allows us to rephrase the optimization problem in terms of probability distributions, rather than variational gates. In this framework, the optimal configuration is found by optimizing over distribution parameters, rather than over free angles. We show numerically that this approach can be more competitive than gradient-free methods, for a comparable amount of resources, both for noiseless and noisy circuits. Another interesting feature of this approach to variational compilation is that it does not need a separate register and long-range interactions to estimate the end-point fidelity, which is an improvement over methods which rely on the Hilbert-Schmidt test. We expect these techniques to be relevant for training variational circuits in other contexts.

TI Two-qubit-Heisenberg local quantum Fisher information dynamics induced
   by intrinsic decoherence model
SO RESULTS IN PHYSICS
AB This study explores the dynamics of the formation of quantum correlations, namely: local quantum Fisher information and concurrence in a two-spin Heisenberg XXX system. The x-direction of Kaplan-Shekhtman- Entin-Wohlman-Aharony (KSEA) and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) interactions as well as the intrinsic deco-herence are considered. We show that the interactions are responsible of transforming separable states to correlated states. We point out that by strengthening the two-spin antiferromagnetic interaction coupling, it is possible to increase the capacity to develop semi-regularly maximal two-spin correlations. By increasing the DM and KSEA x-components, the two-spin XXX-Heisenberg exalts maximal local Fisher information and concurrence correlations with large amplitudes and high frequencies. As the intrinsic decoherence increases, the amplitudes and frequencies of the correlations decrease, which also causes the phenomena of sudden death- birth and sudden changes of the correlations. The two-spin correlation produced by the unitary x-component interactions can be shielded from the intrinsic decoherence by increasing the two-spin antiferromagnetic interaction coupling.

TI Large set microstructure reconstruction mimicking quantum computing
   approach via deep learning
SO ACTA MATERIALIA
AB Microstructural characterization and reconstruction (MCR) is critical for unearthing processing-structure property (PSP) links in new materials discovery, design and development. However, the inherent generation of large sets of digital microstructures remains challenging due to the optimization requirements of conventional MCR platforms. In this study, we designed a new framework of MCR mimicking quantum computing (QC) approach to boost the speed of reconstructions. A 2D probabilistic map was utilized as input which contains multi point correlation functions of the microstructure. The designed framework generates 3D microstructures from the probabilistic map based on a set of parameters calibrated via a deep learning algorithm. Such a framework converts the optimization process of MCR into a parameter extraction process replicating Shor's algorithm. The improved efficiency allows material scientists to build sensible PSP links via simulation and data-mining techniques. This method also demonstrates a potential methodology to achieve quantum supremacy with the aid of deep learning using a classical computer. (c) 2022 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI Ultrabright and narrowband intra-fiber biphoton source at ultralow pump
   power
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Nonclassical photon sources of high brightness are key components of quantum communication technologies. We here demonstrate the generation of narrowband, nonclassical photon pairs by employing spontaneous four-wave mixing in an optically-dense ensemble of cold atoms within a hollow-core fiber. The brightness of our source approaches the limit of achievable generated spectral brightness at which successive photon pairs start to overlap in time. For a generated spectral brightness per pump power of up to 2 x 10(9) pairs/(s MHz mW) we observe nonclassical correlations at pump powers below 100 nW and a narrow bandwidth of 2 pi x 6.5 MHz. In this regime we demonstrate that our source can be used as a heralded single-photon source. By further increasing the brightness we enter the regime where successive photon pairs start to overlap in time and the cross-correlation approaches a limit corresponding to thermal statistics. Our approach of combining the advantages of atomic ensembles and waveguide environments is an important step toward photonic quantum networks of ensemble-based elements.

TI Quantum Error Mitigation in Optimized Circuits for Particle-Density
   Correlations in Real-Time Dynamics of the Schwinger Model
SO ENTROPY
AB Quantum computing gives direct access to the study of the real-time dynamics of quantum many-body systems. In principle, it is possible to directly calculate non-equal-time correlation functions, from which one can detect interesting phenomena, such as the presence of quantum scars or dynamical quantum phase transitions. In practice, these calculations are strongly affected by noise, due to the complexity of the required quantum circuits. As a testbed for the evaluation of the real-time evolution of observables and correlations, the dynamics of the Zn Schwinger model in a one-dimensional lattice is considered. To control the computational cost, we adopt a quantum-classical strategy that reduces the dimensionality of the system by restricting the dynamics to the Dirac vacuum sector and optimizes the embedding into a qubit model by minimizing the number of three-qubit gates. The time evolution of particle-density operators in a non-equilibrium quench protocol is both simulated in a bare noisy condition and implemented on a physical IBM quantum device. In either case, the convergence towards a maximally mixed state is targeted by means of different error mitigation techniques. The evaluation of the particle-density correlation shows a well-performing post-processing error mitigation for properly chosen coupling regimes.

   systems
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Digital quantum simulation is a promising application of quantum computers where quantum dynamics is simulated by using quantum gate operations. Many techniques for decomposing a time-evolution operator of quantum dynamics into simulatable quantum gate operations have been proposed, whereas these methods cause some errors. To evaluate these errors, we derive a lower bound for overlap between true dynamics and digital simulated dynamics at the final time. Our result enables us to guarantee how obtained digital simulated dynamics is close to unknown true dynamics. We also extend our formalism to error evaluation of digital quantum simulation on noisy quantum computers.

TI Coherent optical control of a superconducting microwave cavity via
   electro-optical dynamical back-action
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Electro-optical interfaces are promising for quantum networks of superconducting circuits. Here the authors demonstrate a coherent optical control of a superconducting microwave resonator in the unity cooperativity regime of cavity electro-optics.
   Recent quantum technologies have established precise quantum control of various microscopic systems using electromagnetic waves. Interfaces based on cryogenic cavity electro-optic systems are particularly promising, due to the direct interaction between microwave and optical fields in the quantum regime. Quantum optical control of superconducting microwave circuits has been precluded so far due to the weak electro-optical coupling as well as quasi-particles induced by the pump laser. Here we report the coherent control of a superconducting microwave cavity using laser pulses in a multimode electro-optical device at millikelvin temperature with near-unity cooperativity. Both the stationary and instantaneous responses of the microwave and optical modes comply with the coherent electro-optical interaction, and reveal only minuscule amount of excess back-action with an unanticipated time delay. Our demonstration enables wide ranges of applications beyond quantum transductions, from squeezing and quantum non-demolition measurements of microwave fields, to entanglement generation and hybrid quantum networks.

TI Multidimensional reconciliation scheme using deep learning in
   continuous-variable quantum key distribution
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB Information reconciliation is a significant stage in continuous-variable quantum key distribution (CV-QKD) systems as it directly affects the performance of the CV-QKD systems including secret key rate and secure transmission distance. This paper proposes a multidimensional reconciliation scheme using deep learning in CV-QKD systems. Firstly, different neural networks are constructed to obtain the norm information. Secondly, a multidimensional reconciliation scheme with deep learning assisted norm information is proposed which no longer needs to transmit the norm information through the authenticated classical public channel. Finally, simulation results and performance analysis show that, compared with the traditional multidimensional reconciliation scheme, the multidimensional reconciliation scheme with deep learning assisted norm information can decrease the communication traffic to a certain extent.

We apply our theory to find simple expressions for four important quantities in quantum information theory: the von Neumann entropy, the quantum relative entropy, the quantum Chernoff bound, and the quantum fidelity. Our results, which we elegantly represent using Fr ' echet derivatives, require only knowledge of the eigenspectrum of the unperturbed state and the density matrix elements of the perturbation, bypassing eigenanalysis of the full perturbed state. These results were recently used to derive the fundamental quantum limits of identifying diffraction-limited objects in passive incoherent imaging [1] and in an approach to quantify the covert communications capacity of a bosonic channel [2]. We discuss other avenues where our results could be applied.

TI On the Need for Large Quantum Depth
SO JOURNAL OF THE ACM
AB Near-term quantum computers are likely to have small depths due to short coherence time and noisy gates. A natural approach to leverage these quantum computers is interleaving them with classical computers. Understanding the capabilities and limits of this hybrid approach is an essential topic in quantum computation. Most notably, the quantum Fourier transform can be implemented by a hybrid of logarithmic-depth quantum circuits and a classical polynomial-time algorithm. Therefore, it seems possible that quantum polylogarithmic depth is as powerful as quantum polynomial depth in the presence of classical computation. Indeed, Jozsa conjectured that "Any quantum polynomial-time algorithm can be implemented with only O(log n) quantum depth interspersed with polynomial-time classical computations." This can be formalized as asserting the equivalence of BQP and "BQNC(BPP)." However, Aaronson conjectured that "there exists an oracle separation between BQP and BPPBQNC." BQNC(BPP) and BPPBQNC are two natural and seemingly incomparable ways of hybrid classical-quantum computation.
   In this work, we manage to prove Aaronson's conjecture and in the meantime prove that Jozsa's conjecture, relative to an oracle, is false. In fact, we prove a stronger statement that for any depth parameter d, there exists an oracle that separates quantum depth d and 2d+ 1 in the presence of classical computation. Thus, our results show that relative to oracles, doubling the quantum circuit depth does make the hybrid model more powerful, and this cannot be traded by classical computation.

TI Quantum sensing to monitor changes in free radical generation by
   intracellular vesicles of polarized macrophages
SO ACTA BIOMATERIALIA
AB Macrophages are immune cells crucial in clearing our tissues from bacteria, viruses, dying cells, cell debris and other waste products. They also regulate inflammation by differentiating from non-activated (M0) cells into macrophages that initiate inflammation (pro-inflammatory macrophages, M1), or resolve inflammation (antiinflammatory macrophages, M2). One of their key functions is to ingest pathogens within vesicles where they are degraded. The production of free radical (FR) plays an important role in this degradation process but also in macrophage differentiation and signaling. Here we used diamond-based quantum sensing to track free radical changes in vesicles with nanoscale resolution. We further followed the oxidative stress status, through free radical measurement during the macrophage activation process. We found that the three macrophage subtypes differed significantly in free radical generation in their vesicles. Additionally, we showed that the FR generation evolves over time in the different subtypes. We observed a 50 % increase in radical production in M0 after 24 h compared to the T1 values measured after 4 h of cell culture, a decrease in M1 and constant radical levels in M2 macrophages. Statement of significance: Here we use quantum sensing for the first time to investigate the role that free radicals play in immune cells when they differentiate to fulfill their functions in the immune system. We were able to measure free radical generation specifically in vesicles while the macrophages differentiated.

TI Frequency drift corrected ultra-stable laser through phase-coherent
   fiber producing a quantum channel
SO COMMUNICATIONS PHYSICS
AB Phase coherent fibers (PCF) are essential to distribute nearly monochromatic photons, ultra-stable in their frequency and phases, which have demanding requirements for state-of-the-art networked experiments, quantum as well as very high-speed communications. We report the development of a system that produces PCF links, also actively corrects the unavoidable slow frequency drift of the source laser. The PCF follows white phase noise limited sigma o x tau-1 stability behavior having sigma o values 1.9(2) x 10-16 and 2.6(1) x 10-16 for a 3.3 km field-deployed and 71 km spool fibers, respectively, with up to 47.5 dB suppression of the phase noise compared to a normal fiber. Additionally, the system is featured to correct the source laser's 33.8 mHz/s frequency drift to as low as similar or equal to 0.05 mHz/s. Therefore, this all-in-one solution producing a quantum link can potentially enhance the effectiveness of the twin field quantum key distribution (TF-QKD) by nearly a 73-fold reduction of the QBER that arises from using unstabilized fiber links, as well as relaxes the laser frequency drift correction constraints by severalfold.

TI Optimized Polarization Encoder with High Extinction Ratio for Quantum
   Key Distribution System
SO ELECTRONICS
AB Polarization encoding is a promising approach for practical quantum key distribution (QKD) systems due to its simple encoding and decoding methodology. In this study, we propose a self-compensating polarization encoder (SCPE) based on a phase modulator, which can be composed of commercial off-the-shelf (COT) devices. We conducted a proof-of-concept experiment to test the SCPE, which demonstrated an in-system quantum bit error rate (QBER) of 0.53% and long-term running stability without any active adjustments. Additionally, we conducted experiments with transmission over commercial fiber spools of lengths up to 100 km and obtained a secure finite key rate of 3 kbps. Our polarization encoder is a promising solution for various polarization encoding protocols, including BB84, MDI, and RFI.

TI Loss-tolerant measurement device independent quantum key distribution
   with reference frame misalignment
SO CHINESE OPTICS LETTERS
AB Reference frame independent and measurement device independent quantum key distribution (RFI-MDI-QKD) has the advantages of being immune to detector side loopholes and misalignment of the reference frame. However, several former related research works are based on the unrealistic assumption of perfect source preparation. In this paper, we merge a loss-tolerant method into RFI-MDI-QKD to consider source flaws into key rate estimation and compare it with quantum coin method. Based on a reliable experimental scheme, the joint influence of both source flaws and reference frame misalignment is discussed with consideration of the finite-key effect. The results show that the loss-tolerant RFI-MDI-QKD protocol can reach longer key rate performance while considering the existence of source flaws in a real-world implementation.

TI Computer-aided drug discovery: From traditional simulation methods to
   language models and quantum computing
SO CELL REPORTS PHYSICAL SCIENCE
AB Drug discovery is a central topic at the intersection of structural biology, biochemistry, and medicine, involving significant challenges like high cost (usually more than billions of dollars), low success rates (typically <10%), and extremely long cycles (often over a decade). Computer-aided drug discovery (CADD) shows huge advantages in addressing these challenges and accelerating the process, making it an indispensable tool in the pharmaceutical industry and scientific research. Here, we review the latest proceedings in this active field and explore the transformative opportunities presented by machine learning, language models, and quantum computing in CADD. The recent development of AlphaFold 2 and 3, state-of-the-art machine learning models, marks a significant advancement in CADD. AlphaFold 3 excels in accurately predicting protein structures, identifying potential docking sites, and facilitating high-throughput docking screenings, thereby streamlining the entire drug discovery process. This model represents a substantial improvement over its predecessors, offering higher accuracy and reliability in structural predictions. Beyond AlphaFold, various machine learning techniques are revolutionizing different stages of drug discovery, from virtual screening to predictive modeling of drug-target interactions. Language models, such as the GPT models, offer promising applications in automating literature reviews, generating research hypotheses, and aiding in interpreting complex biological data. Additionally, quantum computing holds the potential to solve intricate molecular simulations and optimization problems that are currently intractable for classical computers, although its practical implementation remains in the early stages.

TI Perspective: magnetic quantum sensors for biomedical applications
SO NANOTECHNOLOGY
AB With advancements in thin-film deposition, nanofabrication, and material characterization techniques, quantum devices leveraging nanoscale quantum phenomena have emerged across various fields, including quantum computing, sensing, communication, and metrology. Among these, quantum sensing harnesses the unique properties of quantum systems to achieve highly sensitive and precise measurements of physical quantities such as magnetic and electric fields, temperature, pressure, and even biological events. In this perspective, we highlight some popular magnetic quantum sensors used for magnetic sensing and imaging, and emerging spintronic quantum sensors that exploit the quantum mechanical properties of electron spin for similar applications. Most of the techniques discussed remain in lab-based stages, with limited preliminary data reported. However, the authors believe that, with continued progress in spintronics, these nano- and micro-scale spintronic devices-offering superior and unique magnetic quantum properties-could open new horizons in biomedical applications, including single-cell and single-molecule detection, large-scale protein profiling, sub-micrometer resolution medical imaging, and beyond.

TI Quantifying the effects of noise in a quantum convolutional neural
   network
SO SCIPOST PHYSICS CORE
AB This study quantifies the effects of quantum noise on the performance of a quantum convolutional neural network (QCNN), building on parallels with classical convolutional neural networks (CNNs), where added Gaussian noise can improve training speed, accuracy, and generalizability. While such benefits are established for classical CNNs, the influence of noise on quantum counterparts remains insufficiently characterized. We specifically examine three types of quantum noise: decoherence, Gaussian noise arising from imperfect quantum gates and experimental error, and systematic noise introduced during input state preparation. Our analysis provides a detailed assessment of how these distinct noise sources affect QCNN operation and outlines considerations for mitigating their impact. Though a QCNN is used as an example in this work, the methods used here can be applied to other quantum machine learning models as well.

TI Exact entanglement cost of quantum states and channels under
   positive-partial-transpose-preserving operations
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB This paper establishes single-letter formulas for the exact entanglement cost of simulating quantum channels under free quantum operations that completely preserve positivity of the partial transpose (PPT). First, we introduce the kappa-entanglement measure for point-to-point quantum channels, based on the idea of the kappa entanglement of bipartite states, and we establish several fundamental properties for it, including amortization collapse, monotonicity under PPT superchannels, additivity, normalization, faithfulness, and nonconvexity. Second, we introduce and solve the exact entanglement cost for simulating quantum channels in both the parallel and sequential settings, along with the assistance of free PPT-preserving operations. In particular, we establish that the entanglement cost in both cases is given by the same single-letter formula, the kappa-entanglement measure of a quantum channel. We further show that this cost is equal to the largest kappa entanglement that can be shared or generated by the sender and receiver of the channel. This formula is calculable by a semidefinite program, thus allowing for an efficiently computable solution for general quantum channels. Noting that the sequential regime is more powerful than the parallel regime, another notable implication of our result is that both regimes have the same power for exact quantum channel simulation, when PPT superchannels are free. For several basic Gaussian quantum channels, we show that the exact entanglement cost is given by the Holevo-Werner formula [Holevo and Werner, Phys. Rev. A 63, 032312 (2001)], giving an operational meaning of the Holevo-Werner quantity for these channels.

TI Free-Space Continuous-Variable Quantum Key Distribution with Imperfect
   Detector against Uniform Fast-Fading Channels
SO SYMMETRY-BASEL
AB Free-space continuous-variable quantum key distribution based on atmospheric laser communications is expected to play an important role in the global continuous-variable quantum key distribution network. The practical homodyne detector model is applied in free-space continuous-variable quantum key distribution which models the imperfect characteristics including the detection efficiency and the electronic noise. In the conventional model, we must calibrate them simultaneously. In the modified model, only one of the imperfections needs to be calibrated to simplify the calibration process of the practical experiments, also known as one-time calibration. The feasibility of the modified detector model against the fast-fading channel is proved. The results of the symmetry operations are considered when presenting detailed security analysis. Some remarkable features of the uniform fast-fading channel were found from the simulation results. The performances of the conventional model and the modified model are similar but the modified model has the advantage of achieving one-time calibration.

TI In Vivo Nanodiamond Quantum Sensing of Free Radicals in
   Caenorhabditis elegans Models
SO ADVANCED SCIENCE
AB Free radicals are believed to play a secondary role in the cell death cascade associated with various diseases. In Huntington's disease (HD), the aggregation of polyglutamine (PolyQ) not only contributes to the disease but also elevates free radical levels. However, measuring free radicals is difficult due to their short lifespan and limited diffusion range. Here, a quantum sensing technique (T1 relaxometry) is used that involves fluorescent nanodiamonds (FND). Nitrogen vacancy (NV) centers within these nanodiamonds change their optical properties in response to magnetic noise, which allows detecting the unpaired electron from free radicals. This method is used to monitor the production of free radicals inside Caenorhabditis elegans models of Huntington's disease in vivo and in real-time. To investigate if radical generation occurs near polyglutamine expansions, a strain expressing Q40 yellow fluorescent protein (Q40::YFP, polyglutamine expansion overexpressed in the muscle) is used. By applying T1 relaxometry on FNDs in the body wall muscle, it is found that the production of free radicals significantly increase when PolyQ is expressed there (compared to the FNDs in intestine). The technique demonstrates the submicrometer localization of free radical information in living animals and direct measurement of their level, which may reveal the relation between oxidative stress and Huntington's disease.

AB A quantum circuit is often executed on the initial state where each qubit is in the zero state. Therefore, we propose to perform a symbolic execution of the circuit. Our approach simulates groups of entangled qubits exactly up to a given complexity. Here, the complexity corresponds to the number of basis states expressing the quantum state of one entanglement group. By doing that, the groups need neither be determined upfront nor be bound by the number of involved qubits. Still, we ensure that the simulation runs in polynomial time - opposed to exponential time as required for the simulation of the entire circuit. The information made available at gates is exploited to remove superfluous controls and gates. We implemented our approach in the tool quantum constant propagation (QCP) and evaluated it on the circuits in the benchmark suite MQTBench. By applying our tool, only the work that cannot be carried out efficiently on a classical computer is left for the quantum computer, hence exploiting the strengths of both worlds.

TI Mitigation of nitrogen vacancy photoluminescence quenching from material
   integration for quantum sensing
SO MATERIALS FOR QUANTUM TECHNOLOGY
AB The nitrogen-vacancy (NV) color center in diamond has demonstrated great promise in a wide range of quantum sensing. Recently, there have been a series of proposals and experiments using NV centers to detect spin noise of quantum materials near the diamond surface. This is a rich complex area of study with novel nano-magnetism and electronic behavior, that the NV center would be ideal for sensing. However, due to the electronic properties of the NV itself and its host material, getting high quality NV centers within nanometers of such systems is challenging. Band bending caused by space charges formed at the metal-semiconductor interface force the NV center into its insensitive charge states. Here, we investigate optimizing this interface by depositing thin metal films and thin insulating layers on a series of NV ensembles at different depths to characterize the impact of metal films on different ensemble depths. We find an improvement of coherence and dephasing times we attribute to ionization of other paramagnetic defects. The insulating layer of alumina between the metal and diamond provide improved photoluminescence and higher sensitivity in all modes of sensing as compared to direct contact with the metal, providing as much as a factor of 2 increase in sensitivity, decrease of integration time by a factor of 4, for NV T-1 relaxometry measurements.

TI Toward radiative-limited coherence of erbium dopants in a nanophotonic
   resonator
SO APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS
AB Atomic-like emitters in the solid state serve as important resources in the advancement of future quantum networks. In particular, intra-4f optical transitions of rare earth ions exhibit excellent coherence properties thanks to the shielding effect of outer electrons. Still, the presence of various dephasing channels in solid state hosts introduces additional decoherence beyond the radiative decay, causing the coherence time of most rare earth doped materials to be over an order of magnitude lower than the radiative limit. Such obstacle prevents the emission of indistinguishable photons from rare earth ions, which is an essential requirement for various quantum applications. In this work, we perform optical coherence study on erbium ions doped in thin-film lithium niobate by patterning photonic crystal resonators with quality factor around 100 k and sub-lambda(3) mode volume. Leveraging the combination of long coherence and strong Purcell enhancement in the cavity, we show that the coherence time measured with photon echo approaches the radiative limit (80%), representing a 50-fold improvement compared to the waveguide case. Our results present promising prospects toward utilizing rare earth doped materials as quantum repeaters and sources of indistinguishable photons.

TI Many-Body Physics in the NISQ Era: Quantum Programming a Discrete Time
   Crystal
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Recent progress in the realm of noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices [J. Preskill, Quantum 2, 79 (2018)] represents an exciting opportunity for many-body physics by introducing new laboratory platforms with unprecedented control and measurement capabilities. We explore the implications of NISQ platforms for many-body physics in a practical sense: we ask which physical phenomena, in the domain of quantum statistical mechanics, they may realize more readily than traditional experimental platforms. While a universal quantum computer can simulate any system, the eponymous noise inherent to NISQ devices practically favors certain simulation tasks over others in the near term. As a particularly well-suited target, we identify discrete time crystals (DTCs), novel nonequilibrium states of matter that break time translation symmetry. These can only be realized in the intrinsically out-of-equilibrium setting of periodically driven quantum systems stabilized by disorder-induced many-body localization. While promising precursors of the DTC have been observed across a variety of experimental platforms-ranging from trapped ions to nitrogen-vacancy centers to NMR crystals-none have all the necessary ingredients for realizing a fully fledged incarnation of this phase, and for detecting its signature long-range spatiotemporal order. We show that a new generation of quantum simulators can be programmed to realize the DTC phase and to experimentally detect its dynamical properties, a task requiring extensive capabilities for programmability, initialization, and readout. Specifically, the architecture of Google's Sycamore processor is a remarkably close match for the task at hand. We also discuss the effects of environmental decoherence, and how they can be distinguished from 'internal' decoherence coming from closed-system thermalization dynamics. Already with existing technology and noise levels, we find that DTC spatiotemporal order would be observable over hundreds of periods, with parametric improvements to come as the hardware advances.

TI FPGA-Based Implementation of Multidimensional Reconciliation Encoding in
   Quantum Key Distribution
SO ENTROPY
AB We propose a multidimensional reconciliation encoding algorithm based on a field-programmable gate array (FPGA) with variable data throughput that enables quantum key distribution (QKD) systems to be adapted to different throughput requirements. Using the circulatory structure, data flow in the most complex pipeline operation in the same time interval, which enables the structural multiplexing of the algorithm. We handle the calculation and storage of eight-dimensional matrices cleverly to conserve resources and increase data processing speed. In order to obtain the syndrome more efficiently, we designed a simplified algorithm according to the characteristics of the FPGA and parity-check matrix, which omits the unnecessary operation of matrix multiplication. The simplified algorithm could adapt to different rates. We validated the feasibility and high speed of the algorithm by implementing the multidimensional reconciliation encoding algorithm on a Xilinx Virtex-7 FPGA. Our simulation results show that the maximum throughput could reach 4.88 M symbols/s.

We show that, for commuting Hamiltonians, the general problem of spectral manipulation via unitary control simplifies to a finite sequence of elementary switching operations. Furthermore, we demonstrate that any desired relative spacing of energy levels can be achieved, although this may come at the cost of a reduced spectral range. We also show that any modified spectrum can be expressed as a convex combination of the original eigenvalues, with the convex weights forming a bi-stochastic matrix. Through several single-parameter estimation examples, we demonstrate that our spectral engineering method substantially enhances estimation accuracy.

TI Some error analysis for the quantum phase estimation algorithms
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS A-MATHEMATICAL AND THEORETICAL
AB This paper is concerned with the phase estimation algorithm in quantum computing, especially the scenarios where (1) the input vector is not an eigenvector; (2) the unitary operator is approximated by Trotter or Taylor expansion methods; (3) random approximations are used for the unitary operator. We characterize the probability of computing the phase values in terms of the consistency error, including the residual error, Trotter splitting error, or statistical mean-square error. In the first two cases, we show that in order to obtain the phase value with error less or equal to 2(-n) and probability at least 1 - epsilon, the required number of qubits is t >= n + log (2 +delta(2)/2 epsilon Delta E-2). The parameter delta quantifies the error associated with the inexact eigenvector and/or the unitary operator, and Delta E characterizes the spectral gap, i.e., the separation from the rest of the phase values. This analysis generalizes the standard result (Cleve et al 1998 Phys. Rev X 11 011020; Nielsen and Chuang 2002 Quantum Computation and Quantum Information) by including these effects. More importantly, it shows that when delta < Delta E, the complexity remains the same. For the third case, we found a similar estimate, but the number of random steps has to be sufficiently large.

TI Hardware-efficient autonomous error correction with linear couplers in
   superconducting circuits
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Large-scale quantum computers will inevitably need quantum error correction (QEC) to protect information against decoherence. Given that the overhead of such error correction is often formidable, autonomous quantum error correction (AQEC) proposals offer a promising near-term alternative. AQEC schemes work by transforming error states into excitations that can be efficiently removed through engineered dissipation. The recently proposed AQEC scheme by Li et al., called the Star code, can autonomously correct or suppress all single qubit error channels using two transmons as encoders with a tunable coupler and two lossy resonators as a cooling source. The Star code requires only two-photon interactions and can be realized with linear coupling elements, avoiding experimentally challenging higher-order terms needed in many other AQEC proposals, but needs carefully selected parameters to achieve quadratic improvements in logical states' lifetimes. Here, we theoretically and numerically demonstrate the optimal parameter choices in the Star code. We further discuss adapting the Star code to other planar superconducting circuits, which offers a scalable alternative to single qubits for incorporation in larger quantum computers or error correction codes.

TI Quantum key distribution with unbounded pulse correlations
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Typical security proofs of quantum key distribution (QKD) require that the emitted signals are independent and identically distributed. In practice, however, this assumption is not met because intrinsic device flaws inevitably introduce correlations between the emitted signals. Although analyses addressing this issue have been recently proposed, they only consider a restrictive scenario in which the correlations have a finite and known maximum length that is much smaller than the total number of emitted signals. While it is expected that the magnitude of the correlations decreases as the pulse separation increases, the assumption that this magnitude is exactly zero after a certain point does not seem to have any physical justification. Concerningly, this means that the available analyses cannot guarantee the security of current QKD implementations. Here, we solve this pressing problem by developing a rigorous framework that, when combined with existing results, can guarantee security against pulse correlations of unbounded length. Our framework is rather general and could be applied to other situations for which the existing analyses consider a scenario that differs slightly from the actual one.

SO PHYSICS LETTERS A

The geometric measure of entanglement of a spin with other spins in the graph state is obtained analytically and quantified on IBM's quantum computer, IBM Q Valencia. The results of quantum calculations are in good agreement with the theoretical ones. We conclude that the geometric measure of entanglement of a spin with other spins in the graph state is related with degree of vertex representing the spin in the corresponding graph.

TI Quantum pattern recognition on real quantum processing units
SO QUANTUM MACHINE INTELLIGENCE
AB One of the most promising applications of quantum computing is the processing of graphical data like images. Here, we investigate the possibility of realizing a quantum pattern recognition protocol based on swap test, and use the IBMQ noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices to verify the idea. We find that with a two-qubit protocol, swap test can efficiently detect the similarity between two patterns with good fidelity, though for three or more qubits, the noise in the real devices becomes detrimental. To mitigate this noise effect, we resort to destructive swap test, which shows an improved performance for three-qubit states. Due to limited cloud access to larger IBMQ processors, we take a segment-wise approach to apply the destructive swap test on higher dimensional images. In this case, we define an average overlap measure which shows faithfulness to distinguish between two very different or very similar patterns when run on real IBMQ processors. As test images, we use binary images with simple patterns, grayscale MNIST numbers and fashion MNIST images, as well as binary images of human blood vessel obtained from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). We also present an experimental set up for applying destructive swap test using the nitrogen vacancy (NVs) center in diamond. Our experimental data show high fidelity for single qubit states. Lastly, we propose a protocol inspired from quantum associative memory, which works in an analogous way to supervised learning for performing quantum pattern recognition using destructive swap test.

TI Robust frame synchronization for free-space continuous-variable quantum
   key distribution
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Free-space continuous-variable quantum key distribution (CV-QKD) is an important technology that enables all-day quantum key distribution. Precise frame synchronization is a prerequisite for establishing a correlation between legitimate users of CV-QKD. In free-space CV-QKD, channel transmittance fluctuation caused by atmospheric turbulence increases the difficulty of synchronization. Also, as the channel transmittance is monitored in many reported experiments, the transmittance data also needs to be synchronized. We propose a novel method to solve the above problems by inserting two kinds of synchronization frames, i.e., data synchronization frames and transmittance synchronization frames. The performance of the proposed method is analyzed and Monte Carlo simulation is conducted to test its performance. The results demonstrate the feasibility and efficiency of this method. The proposed method paves the way for the realization of free-space CV-QKD. (C) 2021 Optical Society of America under the terms of the OSA Open Access Publishing Agreement

TI Deep-Neural-Network Discrimination of Multiplexed Superconducting-Qubit
   States
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB Demonstrating a quantum computational advantage will require high-fidelity control and readout of multiqubit systems. As system size increases, multiplexed qubit readout becomes a practical necessity to limit the growth of resource overhead. Many contemporary qubit-state discriminators presume single-qubit operating conditions or require considerable computational effort, limiting their potential extensibility. Here, we present multiqubit readout using neural networks as state discriminators. We compare our approach to contemporary methods employed on a quantum device with five superconducting qubits and frequency-multiplexed readout. We find that fully connected feedforward neural networks increase the qubit-state-assignment fidelity for our system. Relative to contemporary discriminators, the assignment error rate is reduced by up to 25% due to the compensation of system-dependent nonidealities such as readout crosstalk, which is reduced by up to one order of magnitude. Our work demonstrates a poten-tially extensible building block for high-fidelity readout relevant to both near-term devices and future

TI Complex-phase extensions of the Szegedy quantum walk on graphs
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB This work introduces a graph-phased Szegedy's quantum walk, which incorporates link phases and local arbitrary phase rotations (APR), unlocking new possibilities for quantum algorithm efficiency. We demonstrate how to adapt quantum circuits to these advancements, allowing phase patterns that ensure computational practicality. The graph-phased model broadens the known equivalence between coined quantum walks and Szegedy's model, accommodating a wider array of coin operators. Through illustrative examples, we reveal intriguing disparities between classical and quantum interpretations of walk dynamics. Remarkably, local APR phases emerge as powerful tools for marking graph nodes, optimizing quantum searches without altering graph structure. We further explore the surprising nuances between single and double operator approaches, highlighting a greater range of compatible coins with the latter. To facilitate these advancements, we present an improved classical simulation algorithm, which operates with superior efficiency. This study not only refines quantum walk methodologies but also paves the way for future explorations, including potential applications in quantum search and PageRank algorithms. Our findings illuminate the path towards more versatile and powerful quantum computing paradigms.

TI Variational approaches to constructing the many-body nuclear ground
   state for quantum computing
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW C
AB We explore the preparation of specific nuclear states on gate-based quantum hardware using variational algorithms. Large-scale classical diagonalizations of the nuclear shell model have reached sizes of 109???1010 basis states but are still severely limited by computational resources. Quantum computing can, in principle, solve such systems exactly with exponentially fewer resources than classical computing. Exact solutions for large systems require many qubits and large gate depth, but variational approaches can effectively limit the required gate depth. We use the unitary coupled cluster approach to construct approximations of the ground-state vectors, later to be used in dynamics calculations. The testing ground is the phenomenological shell model space, which allows us to mimic the complexity of the internucleon interactions. We find that often one needs to minimize over a large number of parameters, using a large number of entanglements that makes the application on existing hardware challenging. Prospects for rapid improvements with more capable hardware are, however, very encouraging.

Existing methodologies using phase estimation or variational algorithms have potential drawbacks such as deep circuits requiring substantial error correction or nontrivial high-dimensional classical optimization. Here, we introduce a quantum solver of contracted eigenvalue equations, the quantum analog of classical methods for the energies and reduced density matrices of ground and excited states. The solver does not require deep circuits or difficult classical optimization and achieves an exponential speed-up over its classical counterpart. We demonstrate the algorithm though computations on both a quantum simulator and two IBM quantum processing units.

TI Long-Term Stable Polarized Adiabatic Interfered Decoder for Differential
   Phase Shift Quantum Key
SO IEEE PHOTONICS JOURNAL
AB Under the quantum key distribution with differential phase-shift-keying protocol, the ultimate stability of the system is limited by the residual wavelength drift of the quantum-key carrier and the polarization/refractive-index/physical-length fluctuations induced by environmental thermal disturbance. To permanently overcome such a shortcoming, a 1-bit-delayed interferometric fiberized decoder with ultrastable visibility maintenance and long-term immunity to environmental perturbations is demonstrated by employing all polarization-maintaining-fiber to construct an asymmetric-arm Mach-Zehnder interferometer, and surrounding such a delay-line interferometric decoder with a thermal-isolated sponge and a styrofoam container. Receiving the DPS-QKD bit-stream with a high sifting key rate and low bit-error ratio is approached by maintaining the high interfered visibility and eliminating the wavelength drift with a highly adiabatic package. Such an ultrastable long-term 1-bit-delay interferometric decoder is particularly suitable for the persistent DPS-QKD operation towards future commercialization.

TI The impact of quantum correlations on parameter estimation in a spin
   reservoir
SO PHYSICA SCRIPTA
AB We study the impact of quantum correlations existing within the system-environment thermal equilibrium state while estimating the parameters of the spin reservoir. By employing various physical situations of interest, we present results for the reservoir temperature and its coupling strength with the central two-level system. The central system (probe) interacts with the bunch of randomly oriented spin systems and attains a thermal equilibrium state. We consider a projective measurement which prepares the probe's initial state, and then the global system (probe and reservoir) evolves unitarily. The reduced density operator encapsulates the information about the spin reservoir which can be extracted by doing measurements on the probe. The precision of such measurement is quantified by quantum Fisher information. We repeat this process if the probe-reservoir initial state is not correlated (product state). We compare the estimation results for both with and without the outturn of initial correlations. In the temperature estimation case, our results are promising as one can significantly improve the accuracy of the estimates by including the effect of initial correlations. A similar trend prevails in the case of coupling strength estimation especially at low temperatures.

TI Electrical load forecasting in power systems based on quantum computing
   using time series-based quantum artificial intelligence
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB A proper, reliable, and economic operation of a power system relies on a precise energy management strategy. For a reliable energy management strategy, information about the power system including power production and power consumption is required. However, consumer behaviour can be unpredictable, which can result to a high level of uncertainties for the load profile. So, this type of issue (existence of the uncertainty in power system) makes the energy management a complex task. The knowledge about the future state of the power system (e.g., the values of loads) can reduce the difficulty of this task, and it can lead to a more efficient energy management. This paper implements quantum computing-based artificial neural network to predict the future values of loads. For this purpose, this paper uses hybrid quantum/classical artificial neural network for a short-term forecasting of loads. The implemented quantum computing-based strategy is deployed using time series-based technique without using extra information (e.g., the weather condition, and behaviour of the consumer), and it only uses the current and historical values of the load to predict the future value of that. To examine the effectiveness of the hybrid quantum/classical artificial neural network, two different types of loads are selected from an experimental lab and the quantum-based approach is tested on those loads. The obtained results can proof the potential of quantum artificial intelligence to be used for forecasting-based challenges in smart grids.

TI High-frequency suppression of inductive coupling between flux qubit and
   transmission line resonator
SO PHYSICA SCRIPTA
AB We perform theoretical calculations to investigate the naturally occurring high-frequency cutoff in a circuit comprising a flux qubit coupled inductively to a transmission line resonator (TLR). Specifically, a decoupling occurs between the qubit and the high-frequency modes. The coupling strength between the qubit and resonator modes increases with mode frequency omega as omega at low frequencies and decreases as 1/omega at high frequencies. This result is similar to those of past studies that considered somewhat similar circuit designs. By avoiding the approximation of ignoring the qubit-TLR coupling in certain steps in the analysis, we obtain effects not captured in previous studies. In particular, we obtain a resonance effect that shifts the TLR mode frequencies close to qubit oscillation frequencies. We derive expressions for the TLR mode frequencies, qubit-TLR coupling strengths and qubit Lamb shift. We identify features in the spectrum of the system that can be used in future experiments to test and validate the theoretical model.

TI Optical Link Design for Quantum Key Distribution-Integrated Optical
   Access Networks
SO PHOTONICS
AB To achieve commercial scalability, fiber-based quantum key distribution (QKD) systems must be integrated into existing optical communication infrastructures, rather than deployed exclusively on dedicated dark fibers. Integrating QKD into optical access networks (OANs) would be particularly advantageous, as these networks provide direct connectivity to end users for whom security is critical. Such integration can address the inherent security vulnerabilities in current OANs, which are primarily based on time-division multiplexing passive optical networks (TDM-PONs). However, integrating QKD into PONs poses significant challenges due to Raman noise and other detrimental effects induced by PON signals, which intensify as the launched power of PONs increases to support higher transmission speeds. In this study, we review recent advancements in both QKD and access network technologies, evaluate the technical feasibility of QKD-OAN integration, and propose cost-effective strategies to facilitate the widespread deployment of QKD in future access networks.

TI Fourier series guided design of quantum convolutional neural networks
   for enhanced time series forecasting
SO PHYSICA SCRIPTA
AB In this work, we explore the application of 1D quantum convolutional layers for time series forecasting, framing the problem within the context of machine learning and quantum circuit expressivity. By encoding multiple time steps as features into a quantum circuit, the forecasting task becomes intrinsically multidimensional. We leverage the recent theoretical results that describe Variational Quantum Circuits (VQCs) as multidimensional Fourier series, to design a more expressive 1D quantum convolutional neural network in which an enhanced performance is obtained by reuploading the data. We aim to relate the number of accessible coefficients in each architecture design with the obtained metrics. Our analysis incorporates key machine learning concepts such as expressivity and the presence of barren plateaus, evaluating their impact on generalization and training efficiency. Notably, we show that even with a limited number of trainable parameters, quantum circuits can approximate high-degree Fourier functions, underscoring their expressive capacity and computational efficiency. Our results demonstrate that more expressive ansatz, characterized by richer Fourier spectra, consistently yield improved predictive performance as the number of qubits increases. This study bridges theoretical insights from quantum physics with practical advances in machine learning model design for time series forecasting.

TI Locating Two-Level Systems in a Superconducting Xmon Qubit
SO APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
AB One significant source of decoherence in superconducting circuits is known as two-level systems (TLSs), found in amorphous oxide layers. These circuits can, however, also be utilized as spectral and temporal TLS probes. Comprehensive investigations on the physics of TLSs are now possible thanks to recent advancements in superconducting qubits. Here, we simultaneously measure the tunable Xmon qubit decoherence time as well as the resonance frequency for more than 3 days to investigate stochastic fluctuations. Time-domain Allan deviation and frequency-domain power spectral density analysis indicate that two TLSs in near resonance with the qubit are responsible for the fluctuations. From the extracted oscillation in T1 decay, we locate the two TLSs near the junctions.

TI Generation of Truly Random Numbers on a Quantum Annealer
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB This study investigates how qubits of modern quantum annealers (QA) such as D-Wave can be applied for generating truly random numbers. We show how a QA can be initialised and how the annealing schedule can be set so that after the annealing, thousands of truly random binary numbers are measured in parallel. Those can then be converted to uniformly distributed natural or real numbers in desired ranges, either biased or unbiased. We discuss the observed qubits' properties and their influence on the random number generation and consider various physical factors that influence the performance of our generator, i.e., digital-to-analogue quantisation errors, flux errors, temperature errors and spin bath polarisation. The numbers generated by the proposed algorithm successfully pass various tests on randomness from the NIST test suite. Our source code and large sets of truly random numbers are publicly available on our project web page https://4dqv.mpi-inf.mpg.de/QRNG/.

TI Application of factorization machine with quantum annealing to
   hyperparameter optimization and metamodel-based optimization in granular
   flow simulations
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR NUMERICAL AND ANALYTICAL METHODS IN
   GEOMECHANICS
AB This study examined the applicability of factorization machines with quantum annealing (FMQA) to the field of landslide risk assessment for two specific black-box optimization problems, hyperparameter optimization (HPO) for metamodeling and metamodel-based simulation optimization (MBSO) targeting granular flow simulation using discrete element method (DEM). These two optimization problems are solved successively: HPO is first performed to determine the hyperparameters of the Gaussian process regression (GPR) metamodel, which is then used as a low-cost, fast approximate solver of granular flow simulations for MBSO. After conducting a series of granular flow simulations using DEM, a metamodel is created that outputs a risk index of interest, the run-out distance, from its input parameters by employing GPR with two hyperparameters, length-scale and signal variance. Subsequently, HPO is performed to obtain the optimal set of hyperparameters by applying FMQA and other optimization methods using another set of hyperparameters determined using the gradient-ascent method as the reference solution. Finally, using the metamodel created by each optimization method as an approximate solver for DEM simulations, MBSO is performed to find the optimal target output, the maximum run-out distance, in the space of physical input parameters for risk assessment. A comparison of the performance of FMQA with that of other methods shows that FMQA is competitive in terms of efficiency and stability with state-of-the-art algorithms such as Bayesian optimization.

TI Phase modulation by quantum gates of two microwave pulses in the
   framework of spin-boson model
SO JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS
AB As one of the most successful platforms of quantum control, trapped ions can be modulated by sequential microwave pulses to realize high-fidelity quantum logic gates, and dephasing noise may lead to invalidation of phase locking. In this work, we utilize the Dirac-Frenkel time-dependent variational approach with Davydov ansatz to simulate spin echo dynamics in the framework of spin-boson model. As the essential modulation parameters, pulse duration and waiting time have been comprehensively investigated to optimize the phase gates by two microwave pulses. We find that, as spin orientation undergoes periodic changes, the phase difference by acting one and two pulses exhibits spontaneous locking following time evolution, which indicates the robustness of the quantum phase gates. Spectrum of the environmental noise that is appropriate for the phase locking is also determined.

TI Exploring the effects of quantum decoherence on the excited-state
   dynamics of molecular systems
SO THEORETICAL CHEMISTRY ACCOUNTS
AB Fewest-switches surface hopping (FSSH) is employed in order to investigate the nonadiabatic excited-state dynamics of thiophene and related compounds and hence to establish a connection between the electronic system, the critical points in configuration space and the deactivation dynamics. The potential-energy surfaces of the studied molecules were calculated with complete active space self-consistent field and time-dependent density-functional theory. They are analyzed thoroughly to locate and optimize minimum-energy conical intersections, which are essential to the dynamics of the system. The influence of decoherence on the dynamics is examined by employing different decoherence schemes. We find that irrespective of the employed decoherence algorithm, the population dynamics of thiophene give results which are sound with the expectations grounded on the analysis of the potential-energy surface. A more detailed look at single trajectories as well as on the excited-state lifetimes, however, reveals a substantial dependence on how decoherence is accounted for. In order to connect these findings, we describe how ensemble averaging cures some of the overcoherence problems of uncorrected FSSH. Eventually, we identify carbon-sulfur bond cleavage as a common feature accompanying electronic transitions between different states in the simulations of all thiophene-related compounds studied in this work, which is of interest due to their relevance in organic photovoltaics.

AB Frequency entangled photon sources are in high demand in a variety of optical quantum technologies, including quantum key distribution, cluster state quantum computation and quantum metrology. In the recent decade, chip-scale entangled photon sources have been developed using silicon platforms, offering robustness, large scalability and CMOS technology compatibility. Here, we report the generation of frequency correlated photon pairs using a 150-GHz silicon nitride ring cavity. First, the device is characterized for studying the phase matching condition during spontaneous four-wave mixing. Next, we evaluate the joint spectrum intensity of the generated photons and confirm the photon pair generation in a total of 42 correlated frequency mode pairs, corresponding to a bandwidth of 51.25 nm. Finally, the experimental results are analyzed and the joint spectral intensity is quantified in terms of the phase matching condition.

AB Any technology offering zero power dissipation must be reversible. A reversible circuit can be envisaged as a cascade of reversible gates only, such as Toffoli gate, which has two components: k control bits and a target bit (k-CNOT), k >= 1. Analysing testability issues in a reversible circuit is an important phenomenon. A new online design-for-testability (DFT) technique for reversible circuits is proposed. The authors' method yields less overhead in terms of quantum cost as compared to the previous online approaches.

TI Unconventional quantum correlations of light emitted by a single atom in
   free space
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We present an approach to engineer the photon correlations emerging from the interference between an input field and the field scattered by a single atom in free space. Nominally, the inefficient atom-light coupling causes the quantum correlations to be dominated by the input field alone. To overcome this issue, we propose the use of separate pump and probe beams, where the former increases the atomic emission to be comparable to the probe. Examining the second-order correlation function g((2)) (tau) of the total field in the probe direction, we find that the addition of the pump formally plays the same role as increasing the coupling efficiency, even though the physical atom-light coupling efficiency remains unchanged. We show that one can tune the correlation function g((2)) (0) from zero (perfect antibunching) to infinite (extreme bunching) by a proper choice of pump amplitude. We further elucidate the origin of these correlations in terms of the transient atomic state following the detection of a photon, and show that these correlations can be observed under realistic conditions.

TI Entanglement and coherence dynamics in photonic quantum memristors
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Memristive systems exhibit dynamics that depend on their past states, making them useful as memory units. Recently, quantum memristor models have been proposed, and notably, a photonic quantum memristor (PQM) has been experimentally proven. In this work, we explore and characterize various quantum properties that emerge from this specific model of PQM. First, we find that a single PQM displays memristive dynamics on its quantum coherence. Second, we analytically show that a network made of two independent PQMs can manifest memory effects on the dynamics of both entanglement and coherence of correlated photons traveling through the network, regardless of their distance, in the hypothesis of negligible external disturbances. Additionally, we build and run a circuit-model of the PQM on a real qubit-based quantum computer (IBM-Q), showing that (1) this system can effectively be used for nonlinear quantum computing under specific conditions and (2) digital quantum simulations can reproduce the dynamics of a memristive quantum system in a non-Markovian regime.

TI Adapting coherent-state superpositions in noisy channels
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Quantum non-Gaussian states are crucial for the fundamental understanding of non-linear bosonic systems and simultaneously advanced applications in quantum technologies. In many bosonic experiments, the important non-Gaussian quantum feature is the negativity of the Wigner function, a cornerstone for quantum computation with bosons. Unfortunately, the negativities present in complex quantum states are extremely vulnerable to the effects of decoherence, such as energy loss, noise, and dephasing, caused by the coupling to the environment, which is an unavoidable part of any experimental implementation. An efficient way to mitigate its effects is by adapting quantum states into more resilient forms. We propose optimal protection of superpositions of coherent states against a sequence of asymmetric thermal lossy channels by suitable squeezing operations.

TI Quantum subroutine for variance estimation: algorithmic design and
   applications
SO QUANTUM MACHINE INTELLIGENCE
AB Quantum computing sets the foundation for new ways of designing algorithms, thanks to the peculiar properties inherited by quantum mechanics. The exploration of this new paradigm faces new challenges concerning which field quantum speedup can be achieved. Toward finding solutions, looking for the design of quantum subroutines that are more efficient than their classical counterpart poses solid pillars to new powerful quantum algorithms. Herewith, we delve into a grounding subroutine, the computation of the variance, whose usefulness spaces across different fields of application, particularly the artificial intelligence (AI) one. Indeed, the finding of the quantum counterpart of these building blocks impacts vertically those algorithms that leverage this metric. In this work, we propose QVAR, a quantum subroutine, to compute the variance that exhibits a logarithmic complexity both in the circuit depth and width, excluding the state preparation cost. With the vision of showing the use of QVAR as a subroutine for new quantum algorithms, we tackle two tasks from the AI domain: feature selection and outlier detection. In particular, we showcase two AI hybrid quantum algorithms that leverage QVAR: the hybrid quantum feature selection (HQFS) algorithm and the quantum outlier detection algorithm (QODA). In this manuscript, we describe the implementation of QVAR, HQFS, and QODA, providing their correctness and complexities and showing the effectiveness of these hybrid quantum algorithms with respect to their classical counterpart.

TI SPAHM(a,b): Encoding the Density Information from Guess
   Hamiltonian in Quantum Machine Learning Representations
SO JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL THEORY AND COMPUTATION
AB Recently, we introduced a class of molecular representations for kernel-based regression methods & horbar;the spectrum of approximated Hamiltonian matrices (SPA(H)M)& horbar;that takes advantage of lightweight one-electron Hamiltonians traditionally used as a self-consistent field initial guess. The original SPA(H)M variant is built from occupied-orbital energies (i.e., eigenvalues) and naturally contains all of the information about nuclear charges, atomic positions, and symmetry requirements. Its advantages were demonstrated on data sets featuring a wide variation of charge and spin, for which traditional structure-based representations commonly fail. SPA(H)M(a,b), as introduced here, expand the eigenvalue SPA(H)M into local and transferable representations. They rely upon one-electron density matrices to build fingerprints from atomic and bond density overlap contributions inspired from preceding state-of-the-art representations. The performance and efficiency of SPA(H)M(a,b) is assessed on the predictions for data sets of prototypical organic molecules (QM7) of different charges and azoheteroarene dyes in an excited state. Overall, both SPA(H)M(a) and SPA(H)M(b) outperform state-of-the-art representations on difficult prediction tasks such as the atomic properties of charged open-shell species and of pi-conjugated systems.

TI Key generation schemes for channel authentication in quantum key
   distribution protocol
SO IET QUANTUM COMMUNICATION
AB Quantum key distribution (QKD) systems enable secure key generation between two parties. Such systems require an authenticated classical channel for QKD protocols to work. Usually, the initial authentication key for this channel is pre-shared. In this work, methods that are used to renew the pre-shared keys ensuring a high level of security and performance for the subsequent quantum key generation are discussed. The model of QKD systems in terms of the lifecycle of the keys is formalised and a full set of parameters that can be used for key renewal functions is described. A detailed adversary model allows us to compare key renewal schemes by the probabilities of successful attacks and their consequences. As a result, it is shown that a hybrid key renewal scheme, which uses both the auxiliary pre-shared key and a part of the quantum sequence, has the higher security properties among considered schemes and is recommended to be used in QKD systems.

TI Implementation of Grover’s Iterator for Quantum Searching With an

AB Grover's algorithm harnesses the power of quantum computing to swiftly locate specific elements in an unstructured database, outperforming classical computers in tasks like database searching. This algorithm capitalizes on the unique ability of qubits to be in both 0 and 1 states simultaneously (superposition), allowing it to scan the entire search space at once. It then boosts the probability of the target element, making it more prominent. While the foundational concepts of Grover's algorithm are well-documented, practical implementation using quantum operators, especially for large search spaces, remains less explored beyond basic examples with a small number of qubits. Existing general synthesis techniques often involve numerous operators or are time-consuming. Our proposed methods specifically address the amplitude-amplification component of Grover's algorithm for any size of search space. These methods detail the required types and quantities of qubits and operators, emphasizing minimal usage and efficient assembly. Developed and evaluated in Python, our methods consistently identified target elements with over 95% accuracy and achieved configurations comparably compact as those in the existing literature but at a faster pace. We anticipate that these methods facilitate practical implementations of Grover's algorithm across various domains.

TI Generative and discriminative training of Boltzmann machine through
   quantum annealing
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB A hybrid quantum-classical method for learning Boltzmann machines (BM) for a generative and discriminative task is presented. BM are undirected graphs with a network of visible and hidden nodes where the former is used as the reading site. In contrast, the latter is used to manipulate visible states' probability. In Generative BM, the samples of visible data imitate the probability distribution of a given data set. In contrast, the visible sites of discriminative BM are treated as Input/Output (I/O) reading sites where the conditional probability of output state is optimized for a given set of input states. The cost function for learning BM is defined as a weighted sum of Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence and Negative conditional Log-likelihood (NCLL), adjusted using a hyper-parameter. Here, the KL Divergence is the cost for generative learning, and NCLL is the cost for discriminative learning. A Stochastic Newton-Raphson optimization scheme is presented. The gradients and the Hessians are approximated using direct samples of BM obtained through quantum annealing. Quantum annealers are hardware representing the physics of the Ising model that operates on low but finite temperatures. This temperature affects the probability distribution of the BM; however, its value is unknown. Previous efforts have focused on estimating this unknown temperature through regression of theoretical Boltzmann energies of sampled states with the probability of states sampled by the actual hardware. These approaches assume that the control parameter change does not affect the system temperature; however, this is usually untrue. Instead of using energies, the probability distribution of samples is employed to estimate the optimal parameter set, ensuring that the optimal set can be obtained from a single set of samples. The KL divergence and NCLL are optimized for the system temperature, and the result is used to rescale the control parameter set. The performance of this approach, as tested against the theoretically expected distributions, shows promising results for Boltzmann training on quantum annealers.

TI Predicting three-dimensional chaotic systems with four qubit quantum
   systems
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Reservoir computing (RC) is among the most promising approaches for AI-based prediction models of complex systems. It combines superior prediction performance with very low CPU-needs for training. Recent results demonstrated that quantum systems are also well-suited as reservoirs in RC. Due to the exponential growth of the Hilbert space dimension obtained by increasing the number of quantum elements small quantum systems are already sufficient for time series prediction. Here, we demonstrate that three-dimensional systems can already well be predicted by quantum reservoir computing with a quantum reservoir consisting of the minimal number of qubits necessary for this task, namely four. This is achieved by optimizing the encoding of the data, using spatial and temporal multiplexing and recently developed read-out-schemes that also involve higher exponents of the reservoir response. We outline, test and validate our approach using eight prototypical three-dimensional chaotic systems. Both, the short-term prediction and the reproduction of the long-term system behavior (the system's "climate") are feasible with the same setup of optimized hyperparameters. Our results may be a further step towards the realization of a dedicated small quantum computer for prediction tasks in the NISQ-era.

TI Quantumness of correlations in nanomaterials-experimental evidence and
   unconventional effects
SO AIMS MATERIALS SCIENCE
AB Quantum correlations phenomena, such as entanglement, quantum discord and quantum coherence, are ubiquitous effects caused by interactions between physical systems-such as electrons and ions in a piece of metal, or H atoms/molecules adsorbed in nanoporous materials. Here, we address time-asymmetric quantumness of correlations (QoC), with particular emphasis on their energetic consequences for dynamics and non-equilibrium thermodynamics in condensed matter and/or many-body systems. Some known theoretical models-for example, the quantum Zeno effect and GKSL-type Markovian equations-of-motion, all of them being time-asymmetric-are shortly considered, with emphasis on the general character of one of their common and most intriguing result. Namely, that in clear contradistinction to conventional expectations, degradation (or destruction, decoherence, consumption, smearing out, coarse-graining) of quantum correlations can be a source of work (instead of heat production). The experimental relevance of the theoretical considerations is shown with the aid of a recent scattering experiment exploring the impulsively driven (by neutron collisions) translational dynamics of H-2 molecules in carbon nanotubes and other nanostructured materials- a topic of immediate relevance for material sciences and related technologies.

TI Meta-optimization of resources on quantum computers
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB The current state of quantum computing is commonly described as the Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum era. Available computers contain a few dozens of qubits and can perform a few dozens of operations before the inevitable noise erases all information encoded in the calculation. Even if the technology advances fast within the next years, any use of quantum computers will be limited to short and simple tasks, serving as subroutines of more complex classical procedures. Even for these applications the resource efficiency, measured in the number of quantum computer runs, will be a key parameter. Here we suggest a general meta-optimization procedure for hybrid quantum-classical algorithms that allows finding the optimal approach with limited quantum resources. This method optimizes the usage of resources of an existing method by testing its capabilities and setting the optimal resource utilization. We demonstrate this procedure on a specific example of variational quantum algorithm used to find the ground state energy of a hydrogen molecule.

TI Magnetic imaging under high pressure with a spin-based quantum sensor

AB Pressure is a powerful tool for tuning the magnetic properties of van der Waals magnets owing to their weak interlayer bonding. However, local magnetometry measurements under high pressure still remain elusive for this important class of emerging materials. Here we demonstrate magnetic imaging of a van der Waals magnet under high pressure with sub-micron spatial resolution, using a two-dimensional (2D) quantum sensing platform based on boron-vacancy (VB-\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$${{{\rm{V}}}}_{{{\rm{B}}}}<^>{-}$$\end{document}) centers in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN).

Besides providing a new path for studying pressure-induced phase transitions in van der Waals magnets, this work also opens up interesting perspectives for exploring the physics of 2D superconductors under pressure via local measurements of the Meissner effect.

TI Implementation of Italian industry 4.0 quantum testbed in Turin
SO IET QUANTUM COMMUNICATION
AB The security of data communications is one of the crucial challenges that our society is facing today. Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) is one of the most prominent methods for guaranteeing ultimate security based on the laws of quantum physics. In this work, the results obtained during the Italian Industry 4.0 Quantum Testbed (II4QuTe) project are reported where the authors realised a QKD testbed securely connecting the Competence Industry Manufacturing 4.0 (CIM4.0) located in Torino and a TIM edge node located 10 km away from the testbed. The edge node accommodates the server providing computation capabilities for managing the real-time data generated by the machines within the CIM4.0 digital factory pilot line, thus gracefully integrating QKD with the MEC (Multi-access Edge Computing) paradigm. The experiment was conducted for more than 69 h, establishing an average key generation rate of 5.125 keys/s (AES-256 keys) and demonstrating the stability of the entire end-to-end encryption system.

TI Cryogenic III-V and Nb electronics integrated on silicon for large-scale

SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Quantum computers now encounter the significant challenge of scalability, similar to the issue that classical computing faced previously. Recent results in high-fidelity spin qubits manufactured with a Si CMOS technology, along with demonstrations that cryogenic CMOS-based control/readout electronics can be integrated into the same chip or die, opens up an opportunity to break out the challenges of qubit size, I/O, and integrability. However, the power consumption of cryogenic CMOS-based control/readout electronics cannot support thousands or millions of qubits. Here, we show that III-V two-dimensional electron gas and Nb superconductor-based cryogenic electronics can be integrated with Si and operate at extremely low power levels, enabling the control and readout for millions of qubits. Our devices offer a unity gain cutoff frequency of 601 GHz, a unity power gain cutoff frequency of 593 GHz, and a low noise indication factor IDgm-1\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$\left(\sqrt{{I}_{{{\rm{D}}}}}\, {g}_{{{{\rm{m}}}}}<^>{-1}\right)$$\end{document} of 0.21VmmS-1\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$0.21\sqrt{{{{\rm{Vmm}}}}}\scriptstyle\sqrt{{S}<^>{-1}}$$\end{document} at 4 K using more than 10 times less power consumption than CMOS.

TI Magnetic Dynamics and Elongated Coherence of a High-Spin Mn(II) Qubit
   Doped into a Metal-Organic Framework
SO CHEMISTRY-A EUROPEAN JOURNAL
AB Spin qubits are among the most promising candidates for quantum information processing and sensing technologies. Their potential to function even at elevated temperatures makes them particularly attractive for future devices. However, while extensive studies have been carried out on S = 1/2 systems, high-spin complexes remain much less explored as spin qubit platforms. In this study, we prepared a Zn(II)-based MOF, [CH6N3][Zn(HCOO)3], doped with trace amounts of Mn(II) ions (S = 5/2, 0.2, and 0.02 mol%). Magnetic measurements under static fields revealed slow relaxation phenomena dominated by direct and Raman-like processes. Importantly, Q-band pulsed ESR confirmed quantum coherence between M S = +/- 1/2 sublevels, achieving phase memory times (T 2) up to 5.4 mu s at 10 K, which is significantly longer than those reported in other Mn(II)-based systems. Rabi nutation experiments verified coherent spin control and multilevel transitions, while Wigner matrix analysis revealed reorientation of the nuclear quantization axis during spin flips. Notably, coherence persisted above 150 K, attributed to the stabilization provided in the MOF's hydrogen-bonded lattice. This work represents the first demonstration of high-spin Mn(II) qubits with measurable coherence at elevated temperatures, underscoring MOFs as versatile and tunable platforms for advancing quantum materials and molecular spin-based technologies.

TI Scalable estimation of pure multi-qubit states
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB We introduce an inductive n-qubit pure-state estimation method based on projective measurements on mn + 1 separable bases or m entangled bases plus the computational basis, with m >= 2. The method exhibits a favorable scaling in the number of qubits compared to other estimation schemes. The use of separable bases makes our estimation method particularly well suited for applications in noisy intermediate-scale quantum computers, where entangling gates are much less accurate than local gates. Our method is also capable of estimating the purity of mixed states generated by the action of white noise on pure states. Monte Carlo simulations show that the method achieves a high estimation fidelity. Besides, the fidelity can be improved by increasing m above 2. We experimentally demonstrate the method on the IBM's quantum processors by estimating up to 10-qubit separable and entangled states. In particular, a 4-qubit GHZ is estimated with experimental fidelity of 0.875.

TI Emergent quantum correlations and collective behavior in noninteracting
   quantum systems subject to stochastic resetting
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We investigate the dynamics of a noninteracting spin system, undergoing coherent Rabi oscillations, in the presence of stochastic resetting. We show that resetting generally induces long-range quantum and classical correlations both in the emergent dissipative dynamics and in the nonequilibrium stationary state. Moreover, for the case of conditional reset protocols-where the system is reinitialized to a state dependent on the outcome of a preceding measurement-we show that in the thermodynamic limit, the spin system can feature collective behavior which results in a phenomenology reminiscent of that occurring in nonequilibrium phase transitions. The discussed reset protocols can be implemented on quantum simulators and quantum devices that permit fast measurement and readout of macroscopic observables, such as the magnetization. Our approach does not require the control of coherent interactions and may therefore highlight a route towards a simple and robust creation of quantum correlations and collective nonequilibrium states, with potential applications in quantum enhanced metrology and sensing.

Furthermore, we adopt the proposed quantum SMC_OR protocol to solve an interesting but important privacy-preserving problem, i.e., finding the maximum value among many secrets.

TI Erecting time telescope for photonic quantum networks
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB A time lens allows one to stretch or compress optical waveforms in time, similar to the conventional lens in space. However, a single-time-lens imaging system always imparts a residual temporal chirp on the image, which may be detrimental for quantum networks, where the temporal image interacts with other fields. We show that a two-time-lens imaging system satisfying the telescopic condition, a time telescope, is necessary and sufficient for creating a chirpless image. We develop a general theory of a time telescope, find the conditions for loss minimization, and show how an erecting time telescope creating a real image of a temporal object can be constructed. We consider several applications of such a telescope to making indistinguishable the photons generated by spontaneous parametric downconversion or single emitters such as quantum dots.

TI Quantum algorithm for gravitational-wave matched filtering
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Quantum computational devices currently under development have the potential to accelerate data analysis techniques beyond the ability of any classical algorithm. We propose the application of a quantum algorithm for the detection of unknown signals in noisy data. We apply Grover's algorithm to matched filtering, a signal processing technique that compares data to a number of candidate signal templates. In comparison to the classical method, this provides a speedup proportional to the square root of the number of templates, which would make possible otherwise intractable searches. We demonstrate both a proof-of-principle quantum circuit implementation and a simulation of the algorithm's application to the detection of the gravitational wave signal GW150914. We discuss the time complexity and space requirements of our algorithm as well as its implications for the currently computationally limited searches for continuous gravitational waves.

TI Research on quantum correlations and Uhlmann phase in two-fermion mixed
   state system
SO PHYSICA SCRIPTA
AB Geometric phase, characterized by its unique properties has been an interesting subject since the discovery of Berry phase. A state inevitably becomes a mixed state in the environment. Uhlmann phase can be applied to mixed states and may be the generalization of Berry phase. In this paper, we use a pair of interacting spin-1/2 fermions, where one particle is influenced by an external magnetic field, while the other remains unaffected, to investigate quantum correlations and Uhlmann phase, we define g, p as the ratio of the particle coupling intensity to the magnetic field, and q as the depolarization parameter. Through calculation, we get the specific parameter range q of steering and Bell nonlocality under the depolarized noise channel, q is an element of 0 , 1 - 4 + g 2 4 + 2 g 2 (steering) and q is an element of 0 , 1 - 4 + g 2 4 + 3 g 2 (Bell nonlocality). Moreover, by using Uhlmann phase, we obtain a simple discrimination criterion of the steerability (Bell nonlocality) of the mixed system.

TI Classical half-adder using trapped-ion quantum bits: Toward
   energy-efficient computation
SO APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS
AB Reversible computation has been proposed as a future paradigm for energy efficient computation, but so far few implementations have been realized in practice. Quantum circuits, running on quantum computers, are one construct known to be reversible. In this work, we provide a proof-of-principle of classical logical gates running on quantum technologies. In particular, we propose and realize experimentally, Toffoli and Half-Adder circuits suitable for classical computation, using radio frequency-controlled 171Yb+ ions in a macroscopic linear Paul-trap as qubits. We analyze the energy required to operate the logic gates, both theoretically and experimentally, with a focus on the control energy. We identify bottlenecks and possible improvements in future platforms for energetically efficient computation, e.g., trap chips with integrated antennas and cavity qed. Our experimentally verified energetic model also fills a gap in the literature of the energetics of quantum information and outlines the path for its detailed study, as well as its potential applications to classical computing.

TI Excitation of 87Rb Rydberg atoms to nS and nD states (n≤
   68) via an optical nanofiber
SO OPTICA QUANTUM
AB Cold Rydberg atoms are a promising platform for quantum technologies, and combining them with optical waveguides has the potential to create robust quantum information devices. Here, we experimentally observe the excitation of cold rubidium atoms to a large range of Rydberg S and D states through interaction with the evanescent field of an optical nanofiber. We develop a theoretical model to account for experimental phenomena present such as the AC Stark shifts and the Casimir-Polder interaction. This work strengthens the knowledge of Rydberg atom interactions with optical nanofibers and is a critical step toward the implementation of all-fiber quantum networks and waveguide quantum electrodynamics (QED) systems using highly excited atoms.

TI Quantum Information Scrambling in Adiabatically Driven Critical Systems
SO ENTROPY
AB Quantum information scrambling refers to the spread of the initially stored information over many degrees of freedom of a quantum many-body system. Information scrambling is intimately linked to the thermalization of isolated quantum many-body systems, and has been typically studied in a sudden quench scenario. Here, we extend the notion of quantum information scrambling to critical quantum many-body systems undergoing an adiabatic evolution. In particular, we analyze how the symmetry-breaking information of an initial state is scrambled in adiabatically driven integrable systems, such as the Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick and quantum Rabi models. Following a time-dependent protocol that drives the system from symmetry-breaking to a normal phase, we show how the initial information is scrambled, even for perfect adiabatic evolutions, as indicated by the expectation value of a suitable observable. We detail the underlying mechanism for quantum information scrambling, its relation to ground- and excited-state quantum phase transitions, and quantify the degree of scrambling in terms of the number of eigenstates that participate in the encoding of the initial symmetry-breaking information. While the energy of the final state remains unaltered in an adiabatic protocol, the relative phases among eigenstates are scrambled, and so is the symmetry-breaking information. We show that a potential information retrieval, following a time-reversed protocol, is hindered by small perturbations, as indicated by a vanishingly small Loschmidt echo and out-of-time-ordered correlators. The reported phenomenon is amenable for its experimental verification, and may help in the understanding of information scrambling in critical quantum many-body systems.

TI Deterministic preparation of W states via spin-photon
   interactions
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Spin systems such as silicon and nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond, quantum dots, and quantum dot molecules coupled to optical cavities appear to be key elements for creating quantum networks by not only constituting the nodes of the network but also assisting the creation of photonic networks. Here we study the deterministic preparation of arbitrary-size W states with spin systems. We present an efficient operation on three qubits, with two being the logical qubits and one being the ancillary qubit, where no interaction between the logical qubits is required. The proposed operation can create a W-type Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) pair from two separable qubits and expand that EPR pair or an arbitrary-size W state by one, creating a W-like state Taking this operation as the fundamental building block, we show how to create a large-scale W state out of separable qubits or double the size of a W state. Based on this operation and focusing on nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond as an exemplary spin system, we propose a setup for preparing W states of circularly polarized photons, assisted by a single-spin qubit, where no photon-photon interactions are required. Next, we propose a setup for preparing W states of spin qubits of spatially separated systems, assisted by a single photon. We also analyze the effects of possible imperfections in implementing the gates on the fidelity of the generated W states. In our setups, neither postmeasurement nor postprocessing the states of spin or photonic qubit is required. Our setups can be implemented with current technology, and we anticipate that they will contribute to quantum science and technologies.

TI Quantum Information Entropies on Hyperbolic Single Potential Wells
SO ENTROPY
AB In this work, we study the quantum information entropies for two different types of hyperbolic single potential wells. We first study the behaviors of the moving particle subject to two different hyperbolic potential wells through focusing on their wave functions. The shapes of these hyperbolic potentials are similar, but we notice that their momentum entropy densities change along with the width of each potential and the magnitude of position entropy density decreases when the momentum entropy magnitude increases. On the other hand, we illustrate the behaviors of their position and momentum entropy densities. Finally, we show the variation of position and momentum entropies S-x and S-p with the change of the potential well depth u and verify that their sum still satisfies the BBM inequality relation.

TI Extension of Noether's theorem in PT-symmetry systems and its
   experimental demonstration in an optical setup
SO SCIENCE CHINA-PHYSICS MECHANICS & ASTRONOMY
AB Noether's theorem is one of the fundamental laws in physics, relating the symmetry of a physical system to its constant of motion and conservation law. On the other hand, there exist a variety of non-Hermitian parity-time (PT)-symmetric systems, which exhibit novel quantum properties and have attracted increasing interest. In this work, we extend Noether's theorem to a class of significant PT-symmetry systems for which the eigenvalues of the PT-symmetry Hamiltonian circumflex expressionccent HPTchange from purely real numbers to purely imaginary numbers, and introduce a generalized expectation value of an operator based on biorthogonal quantum mechanics. We find that the generalized expectation value of a time-independent operator is a constant of motion when the operator presents a standard symmetry in the PT-symmetry unbroken regime, or a chiral symmetry in the PT-symmetry broken regime. In addition, we experimentally investigate the extended Noether's theorem in PT-symmetry single-qubit and two-qubit systems using an optical setup. Our experiment demonstrates the existence of the constant of motion and reveals how this constant of motion can be used to judge whether the PT-symmetry of a system is broken. Furthermore, a novel phenomenon of masking quantum information is first observed in a PT-symmetry two-qubit system. This study not only contributes to full understanding of the relation between symmetry and conservation law in PT-symmetry physics, but also has potential applications in quantum information theory and quantum communication protocols.

TI APR-QKDN: A Quantum Key Distribution Network Routing Scheme Based on
   Application Priority Ranking
SO ENTROPY
AB As the foundation of quantum secure communication, the quantum key distribution (QKD) network is impossible to construct by using the operation mechanism of traditional networks. In the meantime, most of the existing QKD network routing schemes do not fit some specific quantum key practicality scenarios. Aiming at the special scenario of high concurrency and large differences in application requirements, we propose a new quantum key distribution network routing scheme based on application priority ranking (APR-QKDN). Firstly, the proposed APR-QKDN scheme comprehensively uses the application's priority, the total amount of key requirements, and the key update rate for prioritizing a large number of concurrent requests. The resource utilization and service efficiency of the network are improved by adjusting the processing order of requests. Secondly, the queuing strategy of the request comprehensively considers the current network resource situation. This means the same key request may adopt different evaluation strategies based on different network resource environments. Finally, the performance of the APR-QKDN routing scheme is compared with the existing schemes through simulation experiments. The results show that the success rate of application key requests of the APR-QKDN routing scheme is improved by at least 5% in the scenario of high concurrency.

TI Isospectral oscillators as a resource for quantum information processing
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB In this paper, we address quantum systems isospectral to the harmonic oscillator, as those found within the framework of supersymmetric quantum mechanics, as potential resources for continuous variable quantum information. These deformed oscillator potentials share the equally spaced energy levels of the shifted harmonic oscillator but differ significantly in that they are nonharmonic. Consequently, their ground states and thermal equilibrium states are no longer Gaussian and exhibit nonclassical properties. We quantify their non-Gaussianity and evaluate their nonclassicality using various measures, including quadrature squeezing, photon number squeezing, Wigner function negativity, and quadrature coherence scale. Additionally, we employ quantum estimation theory to identify optimal measurement strategies and establish ultimate precision bounds for inferring the deformation parameter. Our findings prove that quantum systems isospectral to the harmonic oscillator may represent promising platforms for quantum information with continuous variables. In turn, non-Gaussian and nonclassical stationary states may be obtained and these features persist at nonzero temperature.

AB Assembling increasingly larger-scale defect-free optical-tweezer-trapped atom arrays is essential for quantum computation and quantum simulations based on atoms. Here, we propose an AI-enabled, rapid, constant-time-overhead rearrangement protocol, and we experimentally assemble defect-free 2D and 3D atom arrays with up to 2024 atoms with a constant-time cost of 60 ms. The AI model calculates the holograms for real-time atom rearrangement. With precise controls over both position and phase, a highspeed spatial light modulator moves all the atoms simultaneously. This protocol can be readily used to generate defect-free arrays of tens of thousands of atoms with current technologies and become a useful toolbox for quantum error correction.

TI Device Independent Quantum Private Queries Based on Quantum Key
   Distribution
SO MATHEMATICS
AB Symmetric private information retrieval (SPIR) protocol is proposed for users to retrieve items from a database holder without revealing the retrieval address, and meanwhile the users cannot learn any additional entries of the database. Quantum key distribution (QKD)-based quantum private queries (QPQs) are the most practical protocols for the SPIR problem. However, most existing protocols assume ideal devices. To overcome this drawback, we propose a device independent QPQ protocol based on QKD with imperfect sources and detectors. By constructing the semi-definite programming optimization problem, we give the CHSH test threshold and prove the correctness of our protocol. We use the shift and permutation post-processing technique to further improve the security. We compare the performance of our protocol with a recent full device-independent QPQ. and discuss their relative advantages. The simulation results show that our protocol improves database security, user privacy and efficiency. The number of final key bits that Alice knows is close to 1, and Bob's guessing probability is below 0.15 in our protocol. Moreover, the proposed scheme can be used for any entanglement-based QPQ protocol to remove trust on the devices.

TI Bayesian homodyne and heterodyne tomography
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Continuous-variable (CV) photonic states are of increasing interest in quantum information science, bolstered by features such as deterministic resource state generation and error correction via bosonic codes. Data-efficient characterization methods will prove critical in the fine-tuning and maturation of such CV quantum technology. Although Bayesian inference offers appealing properties-including uncertainty quantification and optimality in mean-squared error-Bayesian methods have yet to be demonstrated for the tomography of arbitrary CV states. Here we introduce a complete Bayesian quantum state tomography workflow capable of inferring generic CV states measured by homodyne or heterodyne detection, with no assumption of Gaussianity. As examples, we demonstrate our approach on experimental coherent, thermal, and cat state data, obtaining excellent agreement between our Bayesian estimates and theoretical predictions. Our approach lays the groundwork for Bayesian estimation of highly complex CV quantum states in emerging quantum photonic platforms, such as quantum communications networks and sensors.

TI Quantum simulation of nonequilibrium dynamics and thermalization in the
   Schwinger model
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
AB We present simulations of nonequilibrium dynamics of quantum field theories on digital quantum computers. As a representative example, we consider the Schwinger model, a (1 thorn 1)-dimensional U(1) gauge theory, coupled through a Yukawa-type interaction to a thermal environment described by a scalar field theory. We use the Hamiltonian formulation of the Schwinger model discretized on a spatial lattice. With the thermal scalar fields traced out, the Schwinger model can be treated as an open quantum system and its real-time dynamics are governed by a Lindblad equation in the Markovian limit. The interaction with the environment ultimately drives the system to thermal equilibrium. In the quantum Brownian motion limit, the Lindblad equation is related to a field theoretical Caldeira-Leggett equation. By using the Stinespring dilation theorem with ancillary qubits, we perform studies of both the nonequilibrium dynamics and the preparation of a thermal state in the Schwinger model using IBM's simulator and quantum devices. The real-time dynamics of field theories as open quantum systems and the thermal state preparation studied here are relevant for a variety of applications in nuclear and particle physics, quantum information and cosmology.

TI Riemannian optimization of photonic quantum circuits in phase and Fock
   space
SO SCIPOST PHYSICS
AB We propose a framework to design and optimize generic photonic quantum circuits composed of Gaussian objects (pure and mixed Gaussian states, Gaussian unitaries, Gaussian channels, Gaussian measurements) as well as non-Gaussian effects such as photonnumber-resolving measurements. In this framework, we parametrize a phase space representation of Gaussian objects using elements of the symplectic group (or the unitary or orthogonal group in special cases), and then we transform it into the Fock representation using a single linear recurrence relation that computes the Fock amplitudes of any Gaussian object recursively. We also compute the gradient of the Fock amplitudes with respect to phase space parameters by differentiating through the recurrence relation. We can then use Riemannian optimization on the symplectic group to optimize M-mode Gaussian objects, avoiding the need to commit to particular realizations in terms of fundamental gates. This allows us to "mod out" all the different gate-level implementations of the same circuit, which now can be chosen after the optimization has completed. This can be especially useful when looking to answer general questions, such as bounding the value of a property over a class of states or transformations, or when one would like to worry about hardware constraints separately from the circuit optimization step. Finally, we make our framework extendable to non-Gaussian objects that can be written as linear combinations of Gaussian ones, by explicitly computing the change in global phase when states undergo Gaussian transformations. We implemented all of these methods in the freely available open-source library MrMustard [1], which we use in three examples to optimize the 216-mode interferometer in Borealis, and 2- and 3-modes circuits (with Fock measurements) to produce cat states and cubic phase states.

TI The Phase Noise Resistant Semi-Quantum Private Comparison Based on
   Non-Maximally Entangled W States
SO IET QUANTUM COMMUNICATION
AB Private comparison is an important research topic in the field of quantum communication security, with wide applications in scenarios such as e-commerce and anonymous voting. Currently, although several semi-quantum private comparison schemes based on Bell states and GHZ states have been proposed, studies utilising nonmaximally entangled W states remain relatively scarce. To address the impact of environmental noise, we employ logical nonmaximally entangled W states as the communication channel to effectively resist the interference caused by phase noise. Based on this approach, this paper proposes a semi-quantum private comparison method resistant to phase noise using nonmaximally entangled W states. Compared with existing protocols, the proposed method not only enhances the resistance to phase noise but also significantly extends the applicability of the communication channel. Extensive security evaluations demonstrate that the proposed scheme exhibits strong robustness against various external and internal attacks from third parties (TP). Furthermore, compared to traditional methods, our scheme achieves notable improvements in communication efficiency and application versatility, thereby enhancing its practicality and robustness in real-world applications.

TI Universal adversarial examples and perturbations for quantum classifiers
SO NATIONAL SCIENCE REVIEW
AB Quantum machine learning explores the interplay between machine learning and quantum physics, which may lead to unprecedented perspectives for both fields. In fact, recent works have shown strong evidence that quantum computers could outperform classical computers in solving certain notable machine learning tasks. Yet, quantum learning systems may also suffer from the vulnerability problem: adding a tiny carefully crafted perturbation to the legitimate input data would cause the systems to make incorrect predictions at a notably high confidence level. In this paper, we study the universality of adversarial examples and perturbations for quantum classifiers. Through concrete examples involving classifications of real-life images and quantum phases of matter, we show that there exist universal adversarial examples that can fool a set of different quantum classifiers. We prove that, for a set of k classifiers with each receiving input data of n qubits, an O(ln [k]/2(n)) increase of the perturbation strength is enough to ensure a moderate universal adversarial risk. In addition, for a given quantum classifier, we show that there exist universal adversarial perturbations, which can be added to different legitimate samples to make them adversarial examples for the classifier. Our results reveal the universality perspective of adversarial attacks for quantum machine learning systems, which would be crucial for practical applications of both near-term and future quantum technologies in solving machine learning problems.
   The existence of universal adversarial examples and perturbations for quantum classifiers has been demonstrated both analytically and numerically, revealing a crucial vulnerability aspect for quantum machine learning with near-term and future technologies.

We show explicitly how to encode gauge degrees of freedom into qubits using noncompact variables, and how to write down a simple truncated Hamiltonian in the coordinate basis. We show that SU(3) gauge group variables and quarks in the fundamental representation can be implemented straightforwardly on qubits, for arbitrary truncation of the gauge manifold.

TI Student review of innovations in quantum technologies. Part 5
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ELECTRONICS AND TELECOMMUNICATIONS
AB The aim of the paper is to show how graduated engineering students in classical ICT view practically the advent of the QIT. The students do their theses in El.Eng. and ICT and were asked how to implement now or in the future the QIT in their current or future work. Most of them have strictly defined research topics and in s ome cases t he r ealization stage is advanced. Thus, most of the potential QIT application areas are defined and quite narrow. In s uch a case, the issue t o be considered is the incorporation of QIT components and interfaces into the existing ICT infrastructure, software and hardware alike, and propose a solution as a reasonable functional hybrid system. The QIT components or circuits are not standalone in most cases, they should be somehow incorporated into existing environment, with a measurable added value. Not an easy task indeed. We have to excuse the students if the proposed solutions are not ripe enough. The exercise was proposed as an on-purpose publication workshop, related strictly to the fast and fascinating development of the QIT. The paper is a continuation of publishing exercises with previous groups of students participating in QIT lectures.

TI Comparative Analysis of a Quantum SVM With an Optimized Kernel Versus
   Classical SVMs
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a widely used algorithm for classification, valued for its flexibility with kernels that effectively handle non-linear problems and high-dimensional data. Businesses across industries face challenges in improving customer retention and reducing churn, making predictive models essential for identifying at-risk customers and enhancing revenue. This paper investigates an optimized quantum embedding kernel for SVM (Quantum SVM - QSVM) applied to a public bank customer dataset, featuring variables on customer relationships and churn indicators. While focused on the financial sector, the methodology is broadly applicable for reducing churn and boosting revenue across industries. QSVM performance is compared to SVMs with established kernels, including Radial Basis Function (RBF), linear, polynomial, and sigmoid. Experiments varied the number of variables from two to seven to evaluate their impact on model performance and kernel behavior. The experiments were conducted on quantum simulators, which faced scalability challenges addressed using reduced datasets. Even so, this study sheds light on the potential of QSVMs to effectively manage increasing numbers of variables in predictive models, offering valuable insights into their capability to handle complex, high-dimensional data and their applicability in real-world scenarios.

TI Reducing complexity of shadow process tomography with generalized
   measurements
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Quantum process tomography (QPT) is crucial for advancing quantum technologies, including quantum computers, quantum networks, and quantum sensors. Shadow process tomography (SPT) utilizes the Choi isomorphism to map QPT to shadow state tomography (SST), significantly reducing the sample complexity for extracting information from quantum processes. However, SPT relies on random unitary operators and complicates the determination of the optimal unitary operator that minimizes the shadow norm, which is the key factor influencing the sample complexity. In this work, we propose a generalized SPT framework that minimizes the shadow norm by replacing unitary operators with generalized measurements [positive operatorvalued measures (POVMs)]. This approach, termed shadow process tomography with POVMs (POVM-SPT), uses convex optimization to identify the optimal POVM for minimizing the shadow norm, thereby further reducing sample complexity. We demonstrate the identification of the optimal POVM through numerical simulations and provide the corresponding optimization algorithms. Our numerical experiments demonstrate that POVM-SPT achieves a substantial reduction in the shadow norm compared to conventional SPT, with an approximate sevenfold improvement for single-qubit input states and a remarkable 2180-fold enhancement for 64-qubit input states. These results reveal that POVM-SPT offers significant advantages in simplifying SPT tasks, particularly for large-scale quantum systems.

TI Parameterized Hamiltonian Learning With Quantum Circuit
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PATTERN ANALYSIS AND MACHINE INTELLIGENCE
AB Hamiltonian learning, as an important quantum machine learning technique, provides a significant approach for determining an accurate quantum system. This paper establishes parameterized Hamiltonian learning (PHL) and explores its application and implementation on quantum computers. A parameterized quantum circuit for Hamiltonian learning is first created by decomposing unitary operators to excite the system evolution. Then, a PHL algorithm is developed to prepare a specific Hamiltonian system by iteratively updating the gradient of the loss function about circuit parameters. Finally, the experiments are conducted on Origin Pilot, and it demonstrates that the PHL algorithm can deal with the image segmentation problem and provide a segmentation solution accurately. Compared with the classical Grabcut algorithm, the PHL algorithm eliminates the requirement of early manual intervention. It provides a new possibility for solving practical application problems with quantum devices, which also assists in solving increasingly complicated problems and supports a much wider range of application possibilities in the future.

TI A Resource-Adaptive Routing Scheme with Wavelength Conflicts in Quantum
   Key Distribution Optical Networks
SO ENTROPY
AB Quantum key distribution (QKD) has great potential in ensuring data security. Deploying QKD-related devices in existing optical fiber networks is a cost-effective way to practically implement QKD. However, QKD optical networks (QKDON) have a low quantum key generation rate and limited wavelength channels for data transmission. The simultaneous arrival of multiple QKD services may also lead to wavelength conflicts in QKDON. Therefore, we propose a resource-adaptive routing scheme (RAWC) with wavelength conflicts to achieve load balancing and efficient utilization of network resources. Focusing on the impact of link load and resource competition, this scheme dynamically adjusts the link weights and introduces the wavelength conflict degree. Simulation results indicate that the RAWC algorithm is an effective approach to solving the wavelength conflict problem. Compared with the benchmark algorithms, the RAWC algorithm can improve service request success rate (SR) by up to 30%.

TI Quantum frequency conversion and single-photon detection with lithium
   niobate nanophotonic chips
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB The lithium niobate on insulator (LNOI) platform has revolutionized lithium niobate materials, and a series of quantum photonic chips have exhibited unprecedented performances. Quantum frequency conversion (QFC) that enables quantum state preservation during frequency conversion is crucial in quantum technology. This work demonstrates a low-noise QFC process on the LNOI nanophotonic platform, connecting telecom and near-visible bands. An internal conversion efficiency of 73% and an on-chip noise count of 900 counts per second (cps) are achieved. Furthermore, the preservation of quantum statistical properties is verified, indicating the QFC chip's promise for extensive applications of LNOI integrated circuits in quantum information. Based on this chip, we constructed an upconversion single-photon detector with a detection efficiency of 8.7% and a noise of 300 cps, paving the way to integrated on-chip single-photon detection. The realization of a low-noise QFC device also provide a pathway for practical chip-scale QFC-based quantum systems in heterogeneous configurations.

TI Composable security for practical quantum key distribution with two way

SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB We present a theory for the composable security of sending-or-not-sending (SNS) protocol of twin field quantum key distribution (TF-QKD). We present methods to strictly calculate the finite-key effects in QKD with error rejection through two-way classical communication (TWCC) for SNS TF-QKD protocol. Unlike the normal QKD without TWCC, here the probability of tagging or untagging for each two-bit random group is not independent. We rigorously solve this problem by imagining a virtual set of bits where every bit is independent and identical. With explicit formulas, we show that simply applying Chernoff bound in the calculation gives correct key rate, but the failure probability changes a little bit. We calculate the key rate with strict bounds and security, and obtain key rates by far breaking the PLOB (Pirandola, Laurenza, Ottaviani, and Banchi) bound with composable security.

TI A comprehensive approach utilizing quantum machine learning in the study
   of corrosion inhibition on quinoxaline compounds
SO ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE CHEMISTRY
AB In this investigation, a quantitative structure-property relationship (QSPR) model coupled with a quantum neural network (QNN) was used to explore the corrosion inhibition efficiency (CIE) of quinoxaline compounds. Integrating quantum chemical properties (QCP) features reduced computational burden by strategically reducing the features from 11 to 4 while maintaining prediction accuracy. QNN models outperform traditional methods like artificial neural networks (ANN) and multilayer perceptron neural networks (MLPNN), with a coefficient of determination (R2) value of 0.987, coupled with diminished root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and mean absolute deviation (MAD) values of 0.97, 0.92, and 1.10, respectively. Predictions for six newly synthesized quinoxaline derivatives: quinoxaline-6-carboxylic acid (Q1), methyl quinoxaline-6-carboxylate (Q2), (2E,3E)-2,3-dihydrazono-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroquinoxaline (Q3), (2E,3E) 2,3-dihydrazono-6-methyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroquinoxaline (Q4), (E)-3-(4-methoxyethyl)-7-methylquinoxalin-2(1 H)-one (Q5), and 2-(4-methox-yphenyl)-7-methylthieno[3,2-b] quinoxaline (Q6), show remarkable CIE values of 95.12, 96.72, 91.02, 92.43, 89.58, and 93.63%, respectively. This breakthrough technique simplifies testing and production procedures for new anti-corrosion materials.

TI On-chip near 100 dB pump filtering using silicon ion implantation
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Integrated photonics is an exciting platform for quantum communication, computing, and sensing due to its inherent stability and scalability. However, full monolithic or hybrid photonic quantum technology demonstrations remain limited owing to performance and integration challenges. One of the main challenges is the filtering the high-power classical pump light from the generated photons in spontaneous parametric down-conversion sources. Here, we report what we believe to be a novel optical filtering technique based on silicon ion implantation in silicon nitride (SiN) waveguides. Our approach effectively introduces selective absorption of near-visible light, achieving nearly 100 dB suppression of the pump light at 775 nm. On the contrary, the insertion loss for light in the telecom C-band near 1550 nm is just around 4 dB with a scope of significant reduction. This result paves the way for practical and efficient integration of quantum sources, filters, and detectors on-chip, advancing the field toward scalable quantum photonic systems.

We demonstrate experimentally that our system is capable of reliably achieving theoretical security against collective attacks, even under very adverse random polarization drift scenarios, and is capable of functioning indefinitely without any user input. We show that, in a similar scenario, a standard CV-QKD system without polarization diversity cannot distribute keys securely. Our receiver architecture forgoes the need for any polarization matching calibrations or feedback loops and is usable in any locally generated local oscillator key distribution system. A theoretical study on the security impact of polarization drift is presented, based on which we show that, when using our polarization diverse receiver, it is possible to achieve the performance of a channel with zero polarization drift.

TI Synthesis of and compilation with time-optimal multi- qubit gates
SO QUANTUM
AB We develop a method to synthesize a class of entangling multi-qubit gates for a quan-tum computing platform with fixed Ising-type interaction with all-to-all connectivity. The only requirement on the flexibility of the interaction is that it can be switched on and off for individual qubits. Our method yields a time-optimal implementation of the multi-qubit gates. We numerically demonstrate that the total multi-qubit gate time scales approximately linear in the number of qubits. Using this gate synthesis as a subroutine, we provide compilation strategies for important use cases: (i) we show that any Clifford circuit on n qubits can be implemented using at most 2n multi-qubit gates without requiring ancilla qubits, (ii) we decompose the quantum Fourier transform in a similar fashion, (iii) we compile a simulation of molecular dynamics, and (iv) we pro -pose a method for the compilation of diagonal unitaries with time-optimal multi-qubit gates, as a step towards general unitaries. As motivation, we provide a detailed discus-sion on a microwave controlled ion trap architecture with magnetic gradient-induced coupling (MAGIC) for the generation of the Ising-type interactions.

AB The secret key rate is one of the main obstacles to the practical application of continuous-variable quantum key distribution (CVQKD). In this paper, we propose a multiplexing scheme to increase the secret key rate of the CVQKD system with orbital angular momentum (OAM). The propagation characteristics of a typical vortex beam, involving the Laguerre-Gaussian (LG) beam, are analyzed in an atmospheric channel for the Kolmogorov turbulence model. Discrete modulation is utilized to extend the maximal transmission distance. We show the effect of the transmittance of the beam over the turbulent channel on the secret key rate and the transmission distance. Numerical simulations indicate that the OAM multiplexing scheme can improve the performance of the CVQKD system and hence has potential use for practical high-rate quantum communications.

TI A Variational Ansatz for Taylorized Imaginary Time Evolution
SO ACS OMEGA
AB Being able to predict molecular properties and interactions is of utmost interest for academia as well as industry. But the vast complexity of strongly correlated molecular systems limits the performance of classical algorithms. In contrast, quantum computation has the potential to be a game changer in the field of molecular simulations. Despite the hope in quantum computation, the capabilities of current quantum computers are still insufficient for handling molecular systems of interest. In this paper, we propose a variational ansatz for today's noisy quantum computers to calculate the ground state with the help of imaginary time evolution. Although the imaginary time evolution operator is not unitary, it can be implemented on a quantum computer by a linear decomposition and subsequent Taylor series expansion. This has the advantage that only a set of shallow circuits needs to be computed on a quantum computer. The parallel nature of this algorithm can be exploited to speed-up simulations even further, if a privileged access to quantum computers is granted.

TI Quantum State Preparation for Quantum Key Distribution Using PLC Module
SO IEEE PHOTONICS JOURNAL
AB Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) is gaining significant interest due to its theoretical guarantee of unconditional security. Integrated optics offers distinct advantages compared to bulk optics, including high stability, flexibility, controllability, and robustness. We develop a planar lightwave circuit (PLC) silica asymmetric Mach-Zehnder interferometer (AMZI) module with temperature system at an accuracy of 0.1 degree celsius including an AMZI chip with a 400ps delay and a single-chip microcomputer. The silica AMZI module is used to encode at Alice, and the same low loss AMZI module is used to decode at Bob at a clock repetition rate of 156 MHz. Two intensity states Z -basis (|0, |1) and two phase states X-basis (|+, |-) are prepared at Alice and detected at Bob successfully. The extinction ratio of |0 and |1 between first-slot and third-slot are about 17 dB. And the interference visibility of |+, |- between interference max and min of second-slot are about 88%. The estimated secret key rate and the quantum bit error rate (QBER) using a simulation model for a transmission distance of 20 km is 16.3 kbps and 0.0384, respectively.

TI Quantum hypothesis testing with group structure
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB The problem of discriminating between many quantum channels with certainty is analyzed under the assumption of prior knowledge of algebraic relations among possible channels. It is shown, by explicit construction of a novel family of quantum algorithms, that when the set of possible channels faithfully represents a finite subgroup of SU(2) (e.g., C-n, D-2n, A(4), S-4, A(5)) the recently developed techniques of quantum signal processing can be modified to constitute subroutines for quantum hypothesis testing. These algorithms, for group quantum hypothesis testing, intuitively encode discrete properties of the channel set in SU(2) and improve query complexity at least quadratically in n, the size of the channel set and group, compared to naive repetition of binary hypothesis testing. Intriguingly, performance is completely defined by explicit group homomorphisms; these in turn inform simple constraints on polynomials embedded in unitary matrices. These constructions demonstrate a flexible technique for mapping questions in quantum inference to the well-understood subfields of functional approximation and discrete algebra. Extensions to larger groups and noisy settings are discussed, as well as paths by which improved protocols for quantum hypothesis testing against structured channel sets have application in the transmission of reference frames, proofs of security in quantum cryptography, and algorithms for property testing.

TI Classification of four-qubit entangled states via machine learning
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We apply the support vector machine (SVM) algorithm to derive a set of entanglement witnesses (EW) to identify entanglement patterns in families of four-qubit states. The effectiveness of SVM for practical EW implementations stems from the coarse-grained description of families of equivalent entangled quantum states. The equivalence criteria in our work is based on the stochastic local operations and classical communication classification and the description of the four-qubit entangled Werner states. We numerically verify that the SVM approach provides an effective tool to address the entanglement witness problem when the coarse-grained description of a given family state is available. We also discuss and demonstrate the efficiency of nonlinear kernel SVM methods as applied to four-qubit entangled state classification.

TI Coherent memory for microwave photons based on long-lived mechanical
   excitations
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Mechanical resonators, due to their capability to host ultralong-lived phonon modes, are particularly attractive for quantum state storage and as memory elements in conjunction with quantum computing and communication networks. Here we demonstrate absorptive-type coherent memory based on long-lived mechanical excitations. The itinerant coherent microwave field is captured, stored, and retrieved from a mechanical memory oscillator which is pre-cooled to the ground state. The phase space distribution allows us to distinguish between coherent and thermal components and study their evolution as a function of storage time. Our device exhibits attractive functions with an energy decay time of T-1 = 15.9 s, a thermal decoherence rate of & UGamma;(th) = 2.85 Hz, and acquires less than one quantum noise during the & tau;(coh) = 55.7 ms storage period. We demonstrate that both the amplitude and phase information of microwave coherent states can be recovered, indicating the coherence of our memory device. These results suggest that high-Q mechanical resonators and long coherence time phonons could be ideal candidates for the construction of long-lived and on-demand microwave quantum memories.

TI Autonomous recognition of erroneous raw key bit bias in quantum key
   distribution
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB As quantum key distribution technologies mature, it is pertinent to consider these systems in contexts beyond lab settings, and how these systems may have to operate autonomously. To begin, an abstract definition of a type of error that can occur with regard to the ratio of bit values in the raw key is presented, and how this has an impact on the security and key rate of QKD protocols. A mechanism by which errors of this type can be autonomously recognised is given, along with simulated results. A two part countermeasure that can be autonomously put in place to mitigate against errors of this type is also given. Finally some motivating examples where this type of error could appear in practice are presented to add context, and to illustrate the importance of this work to the development of quantum key distribution technologies.

TI Spin Emitters beyond the Point Dipole Approximation in Nanomagnonic
   Cavities
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY C
AB Control over transition rates between spin states of emitters is crucial in a wide variety of fields ranging from quantum information science to the nanochemistry of free radicals. We present an approach to drive both electric and magnetic dipole-forbidden transitions of a spin emitter by placing it in a nanomagnonic cavity, requiring a description of both the spin emitter beyond the point dipole approximation and the vacuum magnetic fields of the nanomagnonic cavity with a large spatial gradient over the volume of the spin emitter. We specifically study the silicon vacancy (SiV-) defect in diamond, whose Zeeman-split ground states comprise a logical qubit for solid-state quantum information processing, coupled to a magnetic nanoparticle serving as a model nanomagnonic cavity capable of concentrating microwave magnetic fields into deeply subwavelength volumes. Through first-principles modeling of the SiV- spin orbitals, we calculate the spin transition densities of magnetic dipole-allowed and -forbidden transitions and calculate their coupling rates to various multipolar modes of the nanomagnonic cavity. We envision using such a framework for manipulation of quantum spin states.

TI Exhaustive search for optimal molecular geometries using imaginary-time
   evolution on a quantum computer
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB This study proposes a nonvariational scheme for geometry optimization of molecules for the first-quantized eigensolver, which is a recently proposed framework for quantum chemistry using probabilistic imaginary-time evolution (PITE). In this scheme, the nuclei in a molecule are treated as classical point charges while the electrons are treated as quantum mechanical particles. The electronic states and candidate geometries are encoded as a superposition of many-qubit states, for which a histogram created from repeated measurements gives the global minimum of the energy surface. We demonstrate that the circuit depth per step scales as O(n(e)(2)poly(log n(e))) for the electron number ne, which can be reduced to O(n(e)poly(log n(e))) if extra O(n(e) log n(e))) qubits are available. Moreover, resource estimation implies that the total computational time of our scheme starting from a good initial guess may exhibit overall quantum advantage in molecule size and candidate number. The proposed scheme is corroborated using numerical simulations. Additionally, a scheme adapted to variational calculations is examined that prioritizes saving circuit depths for noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices. A classical system composed only of charged particles is considered as a special case of the scheme. The new efficient scheme will assist in achieving scalability in practical quantum chemistry on quantum computers.

TI Squeezed comb states
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Continuous-variable codes are an expedient solution for quantum information processing and quantum communication involving optical networks. Here we characterize the squeezed comb, a finite superposition of equidistant squeezed coherent states on a line, and its properties as a continuous-variable encoding choice for a logical qubit. The squeezed comb is a realistic approximation to the ideal code proposed by Gottesman et al. [D. Gottesman, A. Kitaev, and J. Preskill, Phys. Rev. A 64, 012310 (2001)], which is fully protected against errors caused by the paradigmatic types of quantum noise in continuous-variable systems: damping and diffusion. This is no longer the case for the code space of finite squeezed combs, and noise robustness depends crucially on the encoding parameters. We analyze finite squeezed comb states in phase space, highlighting their complicated interference features and characterizing their dynamics when exposed to amplitude damping and Gaussian diffusion noise processes. We find that squeezed comb states are more suitable and less error prone when exposed to damping, which speaks against standard error-correction strategies that employ linear amplification to convert damping into easier-to-describe isotropic diffusion noise.

TI Quantum-optimal-control-inspired ansatz for variational quantum
   algorithms
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB A central component of variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) is the state-preparation circuit, also known as ansatz or variational form. This circuit is most commonly designed such as to exploit symmetries of the problem Hamiltonian and, in this way, constrain the variational search to a subspace of interest. Here, we show that this approach is not always advantageous by introducing ansatzes that incorporate symmetry-breaking unitaries. This class of ansatzes, that we call quantum-optimal-Control-inspired ansates (QOCA), is inspired by the theory of quantum optimal control and leads to an improved convergence of VQAs for some important problems. Indeed, we benchmark QOCA against popular variational forms applied to the Fermi-Hubbard model at half-filling and show that our variational circuits can approximate the ground state of this model with high accuracy. We also show how QOCA can be used to find the ground state of the water molecule and compare the performance of our ansatz against other common choices used for chemistry problems. This work constitutes a first step towards the development of a more general class of symmetry-breaking ansatzes with applications to physics and chemistry problems.

TI Systematic improvements in transmon qubit coherence enabled by niobium
   surface encapsulation
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB We present a transmon qubit fabrication technique that yields systematic improvements in T 1 relaxation times. We encapsulate the surface of niobium and prevent the formation of its lossy surface oxide. By maintaining the same superconducting metal and only varying the surface, this comparative investigation examining different capping materials, such as tantalum, aluminum, titanium nitride, and gold, as well as substrates across different qubit foundries demonstrates the detrimental impact that niobium oxides have on coherence times of superconducting qubits, compared to native oxides of tantalum, aluminum or titanium nitride. Our surface-encapsulated niobium qubit devices exhibit T 1 relaxation times 2-5 times longer than baseline qubit devices with native niobium oxides. When capping niobium with tantalum, we obtain median qubit lifetimes above 300 mu s, with maximum values up to 600 mu s. Our comparative structural and chemical analysis provides insight into why amorphous niobium oxides may induce higher losses compared to other amorphous oxides.

TI Deterministic Integration of hBN Emitter in Silicon Nitride Photonic
   Waveguide
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB Hybrid integration provides an important avenue for incorporating atom-like solid-state single-photon emitters into photonic platforms that possess no optically-active transitions. Hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) is particularly interesting quantum emitter for hybrid integration, as it provides a route for room-temperature quantum photonic technologies, coupled with its robustness and straightforward activation. Despite the recent progress of integrating hBN emitters in photonic waveguides, a deterministic, site-controlled process remains elusive. Here, the integration of selected hBN emitter in silicon nitride waveguide is demonstrated. A small misalignment angle of 4 degrees is shown between the emission-dipole orientation and the waveguide propagation direction. The integrated emitter maintains high single-photon purity despite subsequent encapsulation and nanofabrication steps, delivering quantum light with zero delay second order correlation function g(2)(0)=0.1 +/- 0.05. The results provide an important step toward deterministic, large scale, quantum photonic circuits at room temperature using atom-like single-photon emitters.

TI Probabilistic genotype-phenotype maps reveal mutational robustness of
   RNA folding, spin glasses, and quantum circuits
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Recent studies of genotype-phenotype maps have reported universally enhanced phenotypic robustness to genotype mutations, a feature essential to evolution. Virtually all of these studies make a simplifying assumption that each genotype-represented as a sequence-maps deterministically to a single phenotype, such as a discrete structure. Here we introduce probabilistic genotype-phenotype (PrGP) maps, where each genotype maps to a vector of phenotype probabilities, as a more realistic and universal language for investigating robustness in a variety of physical, biological, and computational systems. We study three model systems to show that PrGP maps offer a generalized framework which can handle uncertainty emerging from various physical sources: (1) thermal fluctuation in RNA folding, (2) external field disorder in the spin-glass ground state search problem, and (3) superposition and entanglement in quantum circuits, which are realized experimentally on IBM quantum computers. In all three cases, we observe a biphasic robustness scaling which is enhanced relative to random expectation for more frequent phenotypes and approaches random expectation for less frequent phenotypes. We derive an analytical theory for the behavior of PrGP robustness, and we demonstrate that the theory is highly predictive of empirical robustness.

TI Quantum algorithm for solving the test-suite minimization problem
SO COGENT ENGINEERING
AB Test-suite minimization problem is an essential problem in software engineering as its application helps to improve the software quality. This paper proposes a quantum algorithm to solve the test-suite minimization problem with high probability in O(root 2(n)), where n is the number of test cases. It generates an incomplete superposition to find the best solution. It also handles the non-uniform amplitudes' distribution case for the system with multisolutions. The proposed algorithm uses amplitude amplification techniques to search for the minimum number of test cases required to test all the requirements. The proposed algorithm employs two quantum search algorithms, Younes et al. algorithm for quantum searching via entanglement and partial diffusion to prepare incomplete superpositions that represent different search spaces such that the number of test cases is incremented in each search space, and updated Arima's algorithm to handle the multisolutions case. The updated Arima's algorithm searches for a quantum state that satisfies an oracle that represent the instance of the test-suite minimization problem.

TI Dynamical implementation of canonical second quantization on a quantum
   computer
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
AB We develop theoretical methods for the implementation of creation and destruction operators in separate registers of a quantum computer, allowing for a transparent and dynamical creation and destruction of particle modes in second quantization in problems with variable particle number. We establish theorems for the commutation (anticommutation) relations on a finite memory bank and provide the needed symmetrizing and antisymmetrizing operators. Finally, we provide formulas in terms of these operators for unitary evolution under conventional two- and four-body Hamiltonian terms, as well as terms varying the particle number. In this formalism, the number of qubits needed to codify n particles with N p modes each is of order O(n log2 N p ) . Such scaling is more efficient than the Jordan-Wigner transformation which requires O(Np) qubits, whenever there are a modest number of particles with a large number of states available to each (and less advantageous for a large number of particles with few states available to each).

TI Quantum information entropy of a particle trapped by the
   Aharonov-Bohm-type effect
SO PHYSICA SCRIPTA
AB In this research article, we use the Shannon's formalism to investigate the quantum information entropy of a particle trapped by the Aharonov-Bohm-type field. For quantum information study, it is necessary to investigate the eigenstates of the quantum system, i.e. the wave functions and energies of the quantum states. We assumed that the particle is in principle, confined in a cylindrical box in the presence of Aharonov-Bohm-type effect due to dislocation defect. Analysis of the quantum information entropy, reveals that the dislocation influences the eigenstates and, consequently, the quantum information of the system.

TI Continuous-Variable Measurement-Device-Independent Quantum Key
   Distribution in the Terahertz Band
SO PHOTONICS
AB We have introduced, for the first time, a protocol for Continuous-Variable Measurement-Device-Independent Quantum Key Distribution (CV-MDI-QKD) in the terahertz (THz) frequency band. We have conducted a secret key rate analysis against collective attacks. The proposed THz CV-MDI-QKD is immune to all detector attacks, significantly enhancing the security assurance of practical THz CVQKD implementations. Furthermore, we investigated the impact of finite key length (the finite-size effect) and finite reconciliation efficiency on the performance of practical THz CV-MDI-QKD systems. Our findings reveal that by employing a large number of keys or signals and optimizing the modulation variance, the detrimental effects arising from the finite-size effect and suboptimal reconciliation efficiency can be notably mitigated. These insights play a crucial role in advancing the feasibility of THz CVQKD technology towards practical applications.

TI Quantum Biotechnology
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB Quantum technologies leverage the laws of quantum physics to achieve performance advantages in applications ranging from computing to communications and sensing. They have been proposed to have a range of applications in biological science. This includes better microscopes and biosensors, improved simulations of molecular processes, and new capabilities to control the behavior of biomolecules and chemical reactions. Quantum effects are also predicted, with much debate, to have functional benefits in biology, for instance, allowing more efficient energy transport and improving the rate of enzyme catalysis. Conversely, the robustness of biological systems to disorder from their environment has led to proposals to use them as components within quantum technologies, for instance as light sources for quantum communication systems. Together, this breadth of prospective applications at the interface of quantum and biological science suggests that quantum physics will play an important role in stimulating future biotechnological advances. This review aims to provide an overview of this emerging field of quantum biotechnology, introducing current capabilities, future prospects, and potential areas of impact. The review is written to be accessible to the non-expert and focuses on the four key areas of quantum-enabled sensing, quantum-enabled imaging, quantum biomolecular control, and quantum effects in biology.

TI Asymmetric Entanglement-Assisted Quantum MDS Codes Constructed from
   Constacyclic Codes
SO ENTROPY
AB Due to the asymmetry of quantum errors, phase-shift errors are more likely to occur than qubit-flip errors. Consequently, there is a need to develop asymmetric quantum error-correcting (QEC) codes that can safeguard quantum information transmitted through asymmetric channels. Currently, a significant body of literature has investigated the construction of asymmetric QEC codes. However, the asymmetry of most QEC codes identified in the literature is limited by the dual-containing condition within the Calderbank-Shor-Steane (CSS) framework. This limitation restricts the exploration of their full potential in terms of asymmetry. In order to enhance the asymmetry of asymmetric QEC codes, we utilize entanglement-assisted technology and exploit the algebraic structure of cyclotomic cosets of constacyclic codes to achieve this goal. In this paper, we generalize the decomposition method of the defining set for constacyclic codes and apply it to count the number of pre-shared entangled states in order to construct four new classes of asymmetric entanglement-assisted quantum maximal-distance separable (EAQMDS) codes that satisfy the asymmetric entanglement-assisted quantum Singleton bound. Compared with the codes existing in the literature, the lengths of the constructed EAQMDS codes and the number of pre-shared entangled states are more general, and the codes constructed in this paper have greater asymmetry.

TI Quantum-accelerated multilevel Monte Carlo methods for stochastic
   differential equations in mathematical finance
SO QUANTUM
AB Inspired by recent progress in quantum algorithms for ordinary and partial differential equations, we study quantum algorithms for stochastic differential equations (SDEs). Firstly we provide a quantum algorithm that gives a quadratic speed-up for multilevel Monte Carlo methods in a general setting. As applications, we apply it to compute expectation values determined by classical solutions of SDEs, with improved dependence on precision. We demonstrate the use of this algorithm in a variety of applications arising in mathematical finance, such as the Black-Scholes and Local Volatility models, and Greeks. We also provide a quantum algorithm based on sublinear binomial sampling for the binomial option pricing model with the same improvement.

TI Fault localization in a microfabricated surface ion trap using diamond
   nitrogen-vacancy center magnetometry
SO APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS
AB As quantum computing hardware becomes more complex with ongoing design innovations and growing capabilities, the quantum computing community needs increasingly powerful techniques for fabrication failure root-cause analysis. This is especially true for trapped-ion quantum computing. As trapped-ion quantum computing aims to scale to thousands of ions, the electrode numbers are growing to several hundred, with likely integrated photonic components also adding to the electrical and fabrication complexity, making faults even harder to locate. In this work, we used a high-resolution quantum magnetic imaging technique, based on nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond, to investigate short-circuit faults in an ion trap chip. We imaged currents from these short-circuit faults to ground and compared them to intentionally created faults, finding that the root cause of the faults was failures in the on-chip trench capacitors. This work, where we exploited the performance advantages of a quantum magnetic sensing technique to troubleshoot a piece of quantum computing hardware, is a unique example of the evolving synergy between emerging quantum technologies to achieve capabilities that were previously inaccessible.

TI Robust storage qubits in ultracold polar molecules
SO NATURE PHYSICS
AB Quantum states with long-lived coherence are essential for quantum computation, simulation and metrology. The nuclear spin states of ultracold molecules prepared in the singlet rovibrational ground state are an excellent candidate for encoding and storing quantum information. However, it is important to understand all sources of decoherence for these qubits, and then eliminate them, to reach the longest possible coherence times. Here we fully characterize the dominant mechanisms of decoherence for a storage qubit in an optically trapped ultracold gas of RbCs molecules using high-resolution Ramsey spectroscopy. Guided by a detailed understanding of the hyperfine structure of the molecule, we tune the magnetic field to where a pair of hyperfine states have the same magnetic moment. These states form a qubit, which is insensitive to variations in magnetic field. Our experiments reveal a subtle differential tensor light shift between the states, caused by weak mixing of rotational states. We demonstrate how this light shift can be eliminated by setting the angle between the linearly polarized trap light and the applied magnetic field to a magic angle of arccos(1/3)approximate to 55 degrees(.) This leads to a coherence time exceeding 5.6 s at the 95% confidence level.

TI From high-quality semiconductor/superconductor nanowires to Majorana
   zero mode
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB As the version of Majorana fermions in condensed matter physics, the research of Majorana zero modes is one of the most interesting topics in physics currently. Majorana zero modes obey the non-Abelian statistics and can be used for constructing the topologically protected qubits. This kind of qubit constructed from spatially separated Majorana zero modes is immune to local noise, and has a long decoherence time, which makes it show important application prospects in fault-tolerant quantum computation. The semiconductor/superconductor nanowires are one of the most ideal experimental platforms for studying Majorana zero modes and topological quantum computation. This work reviews the research progress of the epitaxial growth of high-quality semiconductor nanowires, the fabrication of semiconductor/superconductor heterostructure nanowires, and Majorana zero modes in semiconductor/superconductor nanowires. The application prospects of semiconductor/superconductor nanowires in quantum computation is also prospected finally.

TI High-rate quantum key distribution exceeding 110 Mb s-1
SO NATURE PHOTONICS
AB Quantum key distribution (QKD) can provide fundamentally proven secure communication. Towards application, the secret key rate (SKR) is a key figure of merit for any QKD system. The SKR has so far been limited to about a few megabits per second. Here we report a QKD system that is able to generate keys at a record high SKR of 115.8 Mb s(-1) over a 10 km standard optical fibre, and distribute keys over up to 328 km of ultralow-loss fibre. Such abilities are attributed to a multipixel superconducting nanowire single-photon detector with an ultrahigh counting rate, an integrated transmitter that can stably encode polarization states with low error, a fast post-processing algorithm for generating keys in real time and the high system clock rate operation. The results demonstrate the feasibility of practical high-rate QKD with photonic techniques, thus opening its possibility for widespread applications.
   A quantum key distribution with a key rate of 115.8 Mb s(-1) is demonstrated over 10 km standard optical fibre. To this end, a high-speed and stable system, an integrated transmitter for low error modulation and multipixel superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors are developed.

TI A Hybrid Metadetector for Measuring Bell States of Optical Angular
   Momentum Entanglement
SO SENSORS
AB High-dimensional entanglement of optical angular momentum has shown its enormous potential for increasing robustness and data capacity in quantum communication and information multiplexing, thus offering promising perspectives for quantum information science. To make better use of optical angular momentum entangled states, it is necessary to develop a reliable platform for measuring and analyzing them. Here, we propose a hybrid metadetector of monolayer transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) integrated with spin Hall nanoantenna arrays for identifying Bell states of optical angular momentum. The corresponding states are converted into path-entangled states of propagative polaritonic modes for detection. Several Bell states in different forms are shown to be identified effectively. TMDs have emerged as an attractive platform for the next generation of on-chip optoelectronic devices. Our work may open up a new horizon for devising integrated quantum circuits based on these two-dimensional van der Waals materials.

TI Quantum computing challenges in the software industry. A fuzzy AHP-based
   approach
SO INFORMATION AND SOFTWARE TECHNOLOGY
AB Context: The current technology revolution has posed unexpected challenges for the software industry. In recent years, the field of quantum computing (QC) technologies has continued to grow in influence and maturity, and it is now poised to revolutionise software engineering. However, the evaluation and prioritisation of QC challenges in the software industry remain unexplored, relatively under-identified and fragmented.
   Objective: The purpose of this study is to identify, examine and prioritise the most critical challenges in the software industry by implementing a fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (F-AHP).
   Method: First, to identify the key challenges, we conducted a systematic literature review by drawing data from the four relevant digital libraries and supplementing these efforts with a forward and backward snowballing search. Second, we followed the F-AHP approach to evaluate and rank the identified challenges, or barriers.
   Results: The results show that the key barriers to QC adoption are the lack of technical expertise, information accuracy and organisational interest in adopting the new process. Another critical barrier is the lack of standards of secure communication techniques for implementing QC.
   Conclusion: By applying F-AHP, we identified institutional barriers as the highest and organisational barriers as the second highest global weight ranked categories among the main QC challenges facing the software industry. We observed that the highest-ranked local barriers facing the software technology industry are the lack of resources for design and initiative while the lack of organisational interest in adopting the new process is the most significant organisational barrier. Our findings, which entail implications for both academicians and practitioners, reveal the emergent nature of QC research and the increasing need for interdisciplinary research to address the identified challenges.

TI Quantum-Trajectory-Inspired Lindbladian Simulation
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Simulating the dynamics of open quantum systems is a crucial task in quantum computing, offering wide-ranging applications but remaining computationally challenging. In this paper, we propose two quantum algorithms for simulating the dynamics of open quantum systems governed by Lindbladians. We introduce a new approximation channel for short-time evolution, inspired by the quantum trajectory method, which underpins the efficiency of our algorithms. The first algorithm achieves a gate complexity independent of the number of jump operators, m, marking a significant improvement in efficiency. The second algorithm achieves near-optimal dependence on the evolution time t and precision epsilon and introduces only an additional (O) over tilde (m) factor, which strictly improves upon state-of-the-art gate-based quantum algorithm that has an (O) over tilde (m(2)) factor. The improvement stems from the integration of the new approximation channel with a novel structured linear combination of unitaries method. In both our algorithms, the reduction of dependence on m significantly enhances the efficiency of simulating practical dissipative processes characterized by a large number of jump operators.

TI Statistical physics of network structure and information dynamics
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS-COMPLEXITY
AB In the last two decades, network science has proven to be an invaluable tool for the analysis of empirical systems across a wide spectrum of disciplines, with applications to data structures admitting a representation in terms of complex networks. On the one hand, especially in the last decade, an increasing number of applications based on geometric deep learning have been developed to exploit, at the same time, the rich information content of a complex network and the learning power of deep architectures, highlighting the potential of techniques at the edge between applied math and computer science. On the other hand, studies at the edge of network science and quantum physics are gaining increasing attention, e.g., because of the potential applications to quantum networks for communications, such as the quantum Internet. In this work, we briefly review a novel framework grounded on statistical physics and techniques inspired by quantum statistical mechanics which have been successfully used for the analysis of a variety of complex systems. The advantage of this framework is that it allows one to define a set of information-theoretic tools which find widely used counterparts in machine learning and quantum information science, while providing a grounded physical interpretation in terms of a statistical field theory of information dynamics. We discuss the most salient theoretical features of this framework and selected applications to protein-protein interaction networks, neuronal systems, social and transportation networks, as well as potential novel applications for quantum network science and machine learning.

TI Z2 lattice gauge theories and Kitaev's toric code: A scheme
   for analog quantum simulation
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB Kitaev's toric code is an exactly solvable model with Z(2)-topological order, which has potential applications in quantum computation and error correction. However, a direct experimental realization remains an open challenge. Here, we propose a building block for Z(2) lattice gauge theories coupled to dynamical matter and demonstrate how it allows for an implementation of the toric-code ground state and its topological excitations. This is achieved by introducing separate matter excitations on individual plaquettes, whose motion induce the required plaquette terms. The proposed building block is realized in the second-order coupling regime and is well suited for implementations with superconducting qubits. Furthermore, we propose a pathway to prepare topologically nontrivial initial states during which a large gap on the order of the underlying coupling strength is present. This is verified by both analytical arguments and numerical studies. Moreover, we outline experimental signatures of the ground-state wave function and introduce a minimal braiding protocol. Detecting a p-phase shift between Ramsey fringes in this protocol reveals the anyonic excitations of the toric-code Hamiltonian in a system with only three triangular plaquettes. Our work paves the way for realizing non-Abelian anyons in analog quantum simulators.

TI Silicon-based decoder for polarization-encoding quantum key distribution
SO CHIP
AB Silicon-based polarization-encoding quantum key distribution (QKD) has been extensively studied due to its advantageous characteristics of its low cost and robustness. However, given the difficulty of fabricating polarized independent components on the chip, previous studies have only adopted off-chip devices to demodulate the quantum states or perform polarization compensation. In the current work, a fully chip-based decoder for polarization-encoding QKD was proposed. The chip realized a polarization state analyzer and compensated for the BB84 protocol without the requirement of additional hardware, which was based on a polarization-to-path conversion method utilizing a polarization splitter-rotator. The chip was fabricated adopting a standard silicon photonics foundry, which was of a compact design and suitable for mass production. In the experimental stability test, an average quantum bit error rate of 0 . 59% was achieved through continuous operation for 10 h without any polarization feedback. Furthermore, the chip enabled the automatic compensation of the fiber polarization drift when utilizing the developed feedback algorithm, which was emulated by a random fiber polarization scrambler. Moreover, a finite-key secret rate of 240 bps over a fiber spool of 100 km was achieved in the case of the QKD demonstration. This study marks an important step toward the integrated, practical, and large-scale deployment of QKD systems.

TI Application of Quantum Recurrent Neural Network in Low-Resource Language
   Text Classification
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM ENGINEERING
AB Text sentiment analysis is an important task in natural language processing and has always been a hot research topic. However, in low-resource regions such as South Asia, where languages like Bengali are widely used, the research interest is relatively low compared to high-resource regions due to limited computational resources, flexible word order, and high inflectional nature of the language. With the development of quantum technology, quantum machine learning models leverage the superposition property of qubits to enhance model expressiveness and achieve faster computation compared to classical systems. To promote the development of quantum machine learning in low-resource language domains, we propose a quantum-classical hybrid architecture. This architecture utilizes a pretrained multilingual bidirectional encoder representations from transformer (BERT) model to obtain vector representations of words and combines the proposed batch upload quantum recurrent neural network (BUQRNN) and parameter nonshared batch upload quantum recurrent neural network (PN-BUQRNN) as feature extraction models for sentiment analysis in Bengali. Our numerical results demonstrate that the proposed BUQRNN structure achieves a maximum accuracy improvement of 0.993% in Bengali text classification tasks while reducing average model complexity by 12%. The PN-BUQRNN structure surpasses the BUQRNN structure once again and outperforms classical architectures in certain tasks.
