TI Modal Hybrid Analysis of a Spherical Resonator With a Ferrite Load
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB The modal analysis of structures containing ferrite materials is one of the greatest challenges of computational electrodynamics and goes beyond the scope of commercial software's capabilities. The reason for this is the strong dependence of the ferrite parameters on frequency. From a numerical point of view, the task boils down to a nonlinear eigenproblem (NLEVP), the solution of which is not trivial. In particular, if the problem involves more complex structures (modeled using discrete techniques), NLEVP contains matrices of enormous dimensions and its solution seems impossible. The method proposed in this paper is based on the projection of the NLEVP onto a smaller subspace obtained by hybridizing finite element method (FEM) and the mode matching (MM) technique. This approach reduces the size of the problem, which directly improves the efficiency of the algorithm, but also allows solving NLEVP using methods whose results can be verified with controlled accuracy (unlike previous attempts to use Beyn's method). The effectiveness of the proposed technique has been validated through numerical simulations and experimental results demonstrating a complex mode structure of a microwave spherical cavity strongly coupled to a yttrium iron garnet sphere. The results pave the way for rigorous electrodynamic modeling of spin-to-electromagnetic coupling with emerging applications in magnonic and quantum technologies. Finally, it is worth mentioning that NLEVPs are not exclusively used for electromagnetic problems and an effective algorithm for solving them could also find application in other fields of technology.

TI Magnetic field design in a cylindrical high-permeability shield: The
   combination of simple building blocks and a genetic algorithm
SO JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS
AB Magnetically sensitive experiments and newly developed quantum technologies with integrated high-permeability magnetic shields require increasing control of their magnetic field environment and reductions in size, weight, power, and cost. However, magnetic fields generated by active components are distorted by high-permeability magnetic shielding, particularly when they are close to the shield's surface. Here, we present an efficient design methodology for creating desired static magnetic field profiles by using discrete coils electromagnetically coupled to a cylindrical passive magnetic shield. We utilize a modified Green's function solution that accounts for the interior boundary conditions on a closed finite-length high-permeability cylindrical magnetic shield and determine simplified expressions when a cylindrical coil approaches the interior surface of the shield. We use an analytic formulation of simple discrete building blocks to provide a complete discrete coil basis to generate any physically attainable magnetic field inside the shield. We then use a genetic algorithm to find optimized discrete coil structures composed of this basis. We use our methodology to generate an improved linear axial gradient field, dB(z)/dz, and a transverse bias field, B-x. These optimized structures generate the desired fields with less than 1% error in volumes seven and three times greater in spatial extent than equivalent unoptimized standard configurations. This coil design method can be used to optimize activepassive magnetic field shaping systems that are compact and simple to manufacture, enabling accurate control of magnetic field changes in spatially confined experiments at low cost.

TI Quantum error mitigation by hidden inverses protocol in superconducting
   quantum devices
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB We present a method to improve the convergence of variational algorithms based on hidden inverses (HIs) to mitigate coherent errors. In the context of error mitigation, this means replacing the hardware implementation of certain Hermitian gates with their inverses. Doing so results in noise cancellation and a more resilient quantum circuit. This approach improves performance in a variety of two-qubit error models where the noise operator also inverts with the gate inversion. We apply the mitigation scheme on superconducting quantum processors running the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) algorithm to find the H2 ground-state energy. When implemented on superconducting hardware we find that the mitigation scheme effectively reduces the energy fluctuations in the parameter learning path in VQE, reducing the number of iterations for a converged value. We also provide a detailed numerical simulation of VQE performance under different noise models and explore how HIs and randomized compiling affect the underlying loss landscape of the learning problem. These simulations help explain our experimental hardware outcomes, helping to connect lower-level gate performance to application-specific behavior in contrast to metrics like fidelity which often do not provide an intuitive insight into observed high level performance.

TI Elaboration of the magnetically frustrated GeFe2O4 spinel thin films by
   pulsed laser deposition
SO MATERIALS CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
AB Magnetic frustration is a key research focus in condensed matter physics, where competing spin-spin interactions give rise to emergent phenomena that challenge conventional understanding and lead to topological effects with potential applications in quantum technologies. The direct spinel GeFe2O4 has recently garnered renewed interest for the plethora of magnetic behaviours it is able to demonstrate. Here, we report on the pioneering stabilization of GeFe2O4 thin films via pulsed laser deposition on MgO (001) substrates. The ablation procedure has been optimized to counterbalance the large volatility of the Ge species compared to the Fe ones, granting a fine control over the compositional homogeneity and stoichiometry of the films. Atomic force microscopy measurements rendered thin film surfaces with very low roughness values in the range of 0.2 nm, and X-ray diffraction data confirmed the epitaxial growth of the films and their high crystallinity with no detectable presence of spurious phases. SQUID magnetometry measurements revealed the expected antiferromagnetic behaviour, albeit with ordering temperatures higher than the expected bulk value. This discrepancy could be explained accounting for a small deviation from the direct spinel structure, as unveiled by resonant elastic X-ray scattering measurements, and from the resulting partial occupation of the tetrahedral sites by Fe atoms. Finally, varying the laser fluence we could tune the Fe/Ge ratio and provide a control over the ordering temperature from a modification of the spin-spin super-exchange network paths. Our results pave the way to further studies to explore emergent magnetic properties in GeFe2O4-based heterostructures.

TI Optimal filtering of polarisation-controlled Brillouin scattering in
   elliptical optophononic resonators

CY APR 07-12, 2024
CL Strasbourg, FRANCE
SP SPIE
AB Accessing acoustic phonons at high frequencies in nanostructures becomes more and more essential in nanoelectronics, nano- and opto-mechanics and quantum technologies, as phonons can strongly interact with electrons and photons at the nanoscale. In spontaneous Brillouin scattering processes, the scattered photons energy, direction and polarisation are constrained by selection rules for a given input state. These selection rules are usually considered as intrinsic material properties in crystalline solids and the polarisation of the scattered photons depends on the polarisation of the excitation. In this work, we use elliptical optophononic micropillar resonators to control these optical polarisation selection rules. The degeneracy of the optical cavity modes of circular micropillars is lifted due to the elliptical cross-section of the micropillars, leading to two cavity modes orthogonally polarised and split in energy. The optical field polarisation state will depend on both orthogonal cavity modes and their associated polarisation states. Therefore, an incident laser beam linearly polarised along the diagonal axis of the elliptical pillar undergoes a wavelength dependent polarisation rotation. By choosing the polarisation and wavelength of the incident laser, we demonstrate that the polarisation state of the incident and reflected laser and the Brillouin scattering signal are different. In this way, background-free spontaneous Brillouin scattering spectra can be efficiently measured in a cross-polarisation scheme down to 18 GHz. Here, we theoretically and experimentally explore the optimal conditions for the polarisation and wavelength of the incident laser, and the ellipticity of the micropillars, to improve the polarisation-based filtering applied to Brillouin spectroscopy.

TI Ultrafast Terahertz Superconductor Van der Waals Metamaterial Photonic
   Switch
SO ADVANCED PHOTONICS RESEARCH
AB The high-temperature layered superconductor (HTS) BSCCO is one of the key quantum material platforms in THz science and technology. Compact, stable, and reliable BSCCO THz photonic integrated circuit components can be developed to effectively and efficiently control and manipulate THz wave radiation, especially for future communication systems and network applications. Herein, the design, simulation, and modeling of ultrafast THz metamaterial photonic integrated circuits are reported on a few nanometer-thick HTS BSCCO van der Waals (vdWs), capable of the active modulation of phase with constant transmission coefficient over a narrow-frequency range. Meanwhile, the metamaterial circuit works as an amplitude modulator without significantly changing the phase in a different frequency band. Under the application of ultrashort optical pulses, the transient modulation dynamics of the THz metamaterial offer a fast-switching timescale of 50 ps. The dynamics of picosecond light-matter interaction, Cooper pairs breaking, photoinduced quasiparticles generation and recombination, phonon bottleneck effect, and emission and relaxation of bosons in BSCCO vdW metamaterial arrays are discussed for the potential application of multifunctional superconducting photonic integrated circuits in communication and quantum technologies.
   Ultrafast terahertz photonic integrated circuits are fundamental in emerging technologies. Researchers have proposed a novel tunable ultrafast terahertz photonic switch with a picosecond switching timescale, featuring split-ring resonator metamaterial arrays on layered high-temperature superconductor van der Waals.

TI Transmission electron microscopy analysis of atomic layer deposited
   NbTiN/NbN superconducting thin films
SO APL MATERIALS
AB Atomic-scale processing and precise control of superconducting thin films are essential for the advancement and large-scale implementation of superconducting quantum technologies. Consequently, detailed analysis of the structural features and elemental composition of such superconducting films is a key element in developing highly sensitive and efficient superconducting nanowire single photon detectors. In this work, we use advanced techniques in scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM), specifically 4-dimensional STEM (4DSTEM) and electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS), to analyze the structure and chemistry of two few-nanometer-thick films of NbN and NbTiN deposited by plasma-enhanced atomic layer deposition. Digital dark field imaging is used to image the crystalline core of the films, separate from the silicon substrate and protective platinum overlayer, and the data are used for quantitative measurement of lattice parameters. EELS mapping correlates the structural data with local chemistry and indicates the coexistence of superconducting NbC within the films. Crystalline rock-salt structured carbonitrides are found in both cases, and their lattice parameters can be accurately and reliably measured from hundreds of datapoints from different pixels in the scan area. These correlate well with the expected chemical composition. Both films feature a Si-N rich reaction layer, with Ti also present in NbTiN films. Interestingly, significant diffusion seems to occur in both films, differing from the atomic-layer sharpness sometimes presumed. Nevertheless, the presence of a continuous film with an appropriate structure and composition confirms that the process is suitable for superconducting applications, although further optimization could improve interface control and composition.

TI Multiphonon Fock state heralding with single-photon detection
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Recognized as a potential resource for quantum technologies and a possible test bed for fundamental physics, the control and preparation of nonclassical states of mechanical oscillators have been explored extensively. Within optomechanics, quantum state synthesis can be realized by entangling photonic and phononic degrees of freedom followed by optical detection. Single-photon detection enables one of the most powerful forms of such heralded quantum state preparation, permitting the creation of single-phonon states when applied to conventional cavity optomechanical systems. As the complexity of optomechanical systems increases, single-photon detection may provide heralded access to a larger class of exotic quantum states. Here, we examine the quantum dynamics of optomechanical systems that permit forward Brillouin scattering, where a single-phonon mode mediates transitions between a collection of equally spaced optical resonances. Solving both the Schrodinger equation and the Lindblad master equation for this system, we find that initial states comprised of single photons or weak laser pulses evolve into complex quantum states where the frequency of single-photon states and the phonon occupation number are entangled. Physically, these interactions permit a single photon to scatter to lower frequencies, where phonon excitation occurs for each scattering event. Combining this result with frequency filtering, we show how single-photon detection can herald selected multiphonon Fock states, even in the presence of optical losses. We also present an approach for quantum tomography of the heralded phonon states, which in the form of a state swap from the phononic to photonic domain enables on-demand generation of multiphoton Fock states.

TI Exploring Novel Optical Soliton Molecule for the Time Fractional
   Cubic-Quintic Nonlinear Pulse Propagation Model
SO FRACTAL AND FRACTIONAL
AB This study focuses on the analysis of soliton solutions within the framework of the time-fractional cubic-quintic nonlinear Schr & ouml;dinger equation (TFCQ-NLSE), a powerful model with broad applications in complex physical phenomena such as fiber optic communications, nonlinear optics, optical signal processing, and laser-tissue interactions in medical science. The nonlinear effects exhibited by the model-such as self-focusing, self-phase modulation, and wave mixing-are influenced by the combined impact of the cubic and quintic nonlinear terms. To explore the dynamics of this model, we apply a robust analytical technique known as the sub-ODE method, which reveals a diverse range of soliton structures and offers deep insight into laser pulse interactions. The investigation yields a rich set of explicit soliton solutions, including hyperbolic, rational, singular, bright, Jacobian elliptic, Weierstrass elliptic, and periodic solutions. These waveforms have significant real-world relevance: bright solitons are employed in fiber optic communications for distortion-free long-distance data transmission, while both bright and dark solitons are used in nonlinear optics to study light behavior in media with intensity-dependent refractive indices. Solitons also contribute to advancements in quantum technologies, precision measurement, and fiber laser systems, where hyperbolic and periodic solitons facilitate stable, high-intensity pulse generation. Additionally, in nonlinear acoustics, solitons describe wave propagation in media where amplitude influences wave speed. Overall, this work highlights the theoretical depth and practical utility of soliton dynamics in fractional nonlinear systems.

TI Spin photonics: from transverse spin to photonic skyrmions
SO NANOPHOTONICS
AB Spin angular momentum associated with circular polarization is a fundamental and important aspect of photons both in classical and quantum optics. The interaction of this optical spin with matter and structures results in many intriguing optical effects and state-of-the-art applications covered under the emerging subject of spin optics. Distinct from longitudinal optical spin along the mean wavevector, transverse spin, the corresponding vector of which is perpendicular to the mean wavevector, prevails and plays a significant role in confined electromagnetic waves such as focused beams, guided waves, and evanescent waves. In the optical near-field, these transverse spins are generated owing to the spatial variation of the kinetic momentum of confined electromagnetic waves, where the spin and orbital angular momenta are strongly coupled, leading to many interesting topological spin structures and properties. Several reviews on optical transverse spins have been published in recent years in which their concepts and the various configurations producing them were introduced systematically. Here, we introduce in this review the underlying physics and dynamics of transverse spin and the resultant topological structures and properties such as the photonic skyrmions and merons. We term this sub-area 'spin photonics', its scope being to cover the design and research of spin structures in strongly confined electromagnetic fields with unique properties and applications. The concepts and framework reviewed have importance in optics, topological photonics, metrology, and quantum technologies and may be used to extend spin-dynamics concepts to fluidic, acoustic, and gravitational waves.

TI Bounding the Systematic Error in Quantum Error Mitigation due to Model
   Violation
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Quantum error mitigation is a promising route to achieving quantum utility, and potentially quantum advantage in the near term. Many state-of-the-art error-mitigation schemes use knowledge of the errors in the quantum processor, which opens up the question of the extent to which inaccuracy in the error model impacts the performance of error mitigation. In this work, we develop a methodology to efficiently compute upper bounds on the impact of error-model inaccuracy in error mitigation. Our protocols require no additional experiments and instead rely on comparisons between the error model and the error-learning data from which the model is generated. We demonstrate the efficacy of our methodology by deploying it on an IBM Quantum superconducting qubit quantum processor, and through numerical simulation of standard error models. We show that our estimated upper bounds are typically close to the worst observed performance of error mitigation on random circuits. Our methodology can also be understood as an operationally meaningful metric to assess the quality of error models and we further extend our methodology to allow for comparison between error models. Finally, contrary to what one might expect, we show that observable error in noisy layered circuits of sufficient depth is not always maximized by a Clifford circuit, which may be of independent interest.

TI The Influence of Tanning Chemical Agents on DNA Degradation: A Robust
   Procedure for the Analysis of Tanned Animal Hide-A Pilot Study
SO LIFE-BASEL
AB Illegal wildlife trade is currently on the rise, and it is becoming one of the most lucrative crime sectors. The rarer the species, the higher the demand. Wildlife trade falls under international regulations, such as the CITES convention. Proving that this convention has been violated is a complex process and can be very difficult to do. DNA analysis methods remain (in many cases) the only way to determine whether a certain specimen originated from a protected animal species, a specific individual, or a species in which it is legal to trade. Tanned animal hides are a specific type of specimen. With this type of biological material, obtaining amplifiable DNA is often difficult. This pilot study aimed to map the effect of the chemicals used in the tanning process on the degradation of the DNA yielded from such samples. The DNA was quantified using two different approaches: qPCR and Qubit fluorometry. The degree of DNA fragmentation was assessed by determining the degradation index. The results indicate that reagents containing chromium have the greatest influence on DNA degradation. However, by using the presented protocol, enough amplifiable DNA can be obtained from hides treated with aluminum-based reagents.

TI Relative Entropy of Coherence Quantifies Performance in Bayesian
   Metrology
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB The ability of quantum states to be in superposition is one of the key features that sets them apart from the classical world. This "coherence" is rigorously quantified by resource theories, which aim to understand how such properties may be exploited in quantum technologies. There has been much research on what the resource theory of coherence can reveal about quantum metrology, almost all of which has been from the viewpoint of Fisher information. We prove, however, that the relative entropy of coherence, and its recent generalization to positive operator -valued measures (POVMs), naturally quantify the performance of Bayesian metrology. In particular, we show how a coherence measure can be applied to an ensemble of states. We then prove that during parameter estimation, the ensemble relative entropy of coherence (C) is equal to the difference between the optimal Holevo information (X), and the mutual information attained by a measurement (I). We call this relation the CXI equality. The ensemble coherence lets us visualize how much information is locked away in superposition and hence is inaccessible with a given measurement scheme and quantifies the advantage that would be gained by using a joint measurement on multiple states. Our results hold regardless of how the parameter is encoded in the state, encompassing unitary, dissipative, and discrete settings. We consider both projective measurements and general POVMs. This work suggests new directions for research in coherence, provides a novel operation interpretation for the relative entropy of coherence and its POVM generalization, and introduces a new tool to study the role of quantum features in metrology.

TI Absolute energy levels in nanodiamonds of different origins and surface
   chemistries
SO NANOSCALE ADVANCES
AB Nanodiamonds (NDs) are versatile, broadly available nanomaterials with a set of features highly attractive for applications from biology over energy harvesting to quantum technologies. Via synthesis and surface chemistry, NDs can be tuned from the sub-micron to the single-digit size, from conductive to insulating, from hydrophobic to hydrophilic, and from positively to negatively charged surface by simple annealing processes. Such ND diversity makes it difficult to understand and take advantage of their electronic properties. Here we present a systematic correlated study of structural and electronic properties of NDs with different origins and surface terminations. The absolute energy level diagrams are obtained by the combination of optical (UV-vis) and photoelectron (UPS) spectroscopies, Kelvin probe measurements, and energy-resolved electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (ER-EIS). The energy levels and density of states in the bandgap of NDs are correlated with the surface chemistry and structure characterized by FTIR and Raman spectroscopy. We show profound differences in energy band shifts (by up to 3 eV), Fermi level position (from p-type to n-type), electron affinity (from +0.5 eV to -2.2 eV), optical band gap (5.2 eV to 5.5 eV), band gap states (tail or mid-gap), and electrical conductivity depending on the high-pressure, high-temperature and detonation origin of NDs as well as on the effects of NDs' oxidation, hydrogenation, sp(2)/sp(3) carbon phases and surface adsorbates. These data are fundamental for understanding and designing NDs' optoelectrochemical functional mechanisms in diverse application areas.

TI Influence of Small Doses of Electromagnetic Oscillations on the Features
   of Coronavirus Reproduction
SO ACTA BALNEOLOGICA
AB Aim: To study the influence of small doses of electromagnetic oscillations on the molecular-biological state and features of coronavirus reproduction. Materials and
   Methods: The study was conducted at the Laboratory of Experimental Chemotherapy of viral infections of the State Institution "L.V. Gromashevsky Institute of Epidemiology and Infectious Diseases of the National Academy of Medical Sciences of Ukraine" and was based on the materials of the educational institution "Ukrainian Resource Center of Educational Innovations". During 90 days, with the use of hardware and software complex "Vim Vitae" (from Latin - life force), an experimental study on the registration and analysis of antiviral activity of small doses of electromagnetic oscillations on a biological object (coronavirus pathogens) was organized based on the author's methodology "Life without medicines".
   Results: A study of the antiviral effect of low doses of electromagnetic oscillations on an experimental model of coronavirus - virus of transmitted swine gastroenteritis - showed that small doses of electromagnetic oscillations inhibited coronavirus reproduction by 1.25-2.4 lg TCD50 (tissue cytopathogenic dose 50).
   Conclusions: We believe that in the near future, traditional diagnostic methods will be replaced by new, information-metric, widely available technologies based on smartphones and tablets, which allow not only very quickly and accurately to detect disease, but also learn a lot of other information important for effective therapy. In perspective, these technologies will become a convenient method for self-monitoring and remote interaction with the doctor, for maintaining own health and the health of loved ones.

TI Polarization-Dependent Plasmon-Induced Doping and Strain Effects in
   MoS2 Monolayers on Gold Nanostructures
SO ACS NANO
AB Monolayers of transition-metal dichalcogenides, such as MoS2, have attracted significant attention for their exceptional electronic and optical properties, positioning them as ideal candidates for advanced optoelectronic applications. Despite their strong excitonic effects, the atomic-scale thickness of these materials limits their light absorption efficiency, necessitating innovative strategies to enhance light-matter interactions. Plasmonic nanostructures offer a promising solution to overcome those challenges by amplifying the electromagnetic field and also introducing other mechanisms, such as hot electron injection. In this study, we investigate the vibrational and optical properties of MoS2 monolayer deposited on gold substrates and gratings, emphasizing the role of strain and plasmonic effects using conventional spectroscopic techniques. Our results reveal significant biaxial strain in the supported regions and a uniaxial strain gradient in the suspended ones, showing a strain-induced exciton and carrier funneling effect toward the center of the nanogaps. Moreover, we observed an additional polarization-dependent doping mechanism in the suspended regions. This effect was attributed to localized surface plasmons generated within the slits, as confirmed by numerical simulations, which may decay nonradiatively into hot electrons and be injected into the monolayer. Photoluminescence measurements further demonstrated a polarization-dependent trion-to-A exciton intensity ratio, supporting the hypothesis of additional plasmon-induced doping. These findings provide a comprehensive understanding of the strain-mediated funneling effects and plasmonic interactions in hybrid MoS2/Au nanostructures, offering valuable insights for developing high-efficiency photonic devices and quantum technologies, including polarization-sensitive detectors and excitonic circuits.

TI Time and the body: A new approach to disease
SO MEDICAL HYPOTHESES
AB A better understanding of the nature of reality could lead to a better understanding of disease. Typically, the body has been viewed through a materialist lens. Yet materialism has been challenged, with compelling evidence, from cognitive and neuroscientists, who describe the way the brain creates the images we perceive; and from physicists, who have been investigating alternate models of reality, such as a holographic universe, for over twenty-five years. If the universe functions like a quantum computer, there would be something more fundamental than matter: information. Space is not the appropriate medium when considering information. This model will look at the human body as it exists against a different "fabric": time. In an accelerating, expanding universe, time can be expressed in terms of density. Perhaps we should consider the background density when we make our observations. The human body continuously responds to its perception of time, which is processed through sensory inputs. Time can be conceptualized as a dynamic continuum, analogous to a cone, with a dense, constricted "pit" at one end and an expansive "mouth" at the other. Between these extremes is the present or baseline. Mathematically, the baseline can be derived from the values for pit and mouth; however, for this to be physiologically accurate, the scale of these temporal boundaries must be correctly understood. This hypothesis proposes that a misinterpretation of temporal scale and the subsequent maladaptive responses to these forces contribute to the pathophysiology of various disease states.

TI Explainable representation learning of small quantum states
SO MACHINE LEARNING-SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Unsupervised machine learning models build an internal representation of their training data without the need for explicit human guidance or feature engineering. This learned representation provides insights into which features of the data are relevant for the task at hand. In the context of quantum physics, training models to describe quantum states without human intervention offers a promising approach to gaining insight into how machines represent complex quantum states. The ability to interpret the learned representation may offer a new perspective on non-trivial features of quantum systems and their efficient representation. We train a generative model on two-qubit density matrices generated by a parameterized quantum circuit. In a series of computational experiments, we investigate the learned representation of the model and its internal understanding of the data. We observe that the model learns an interpretable representation which relates the quantum states to their underlying entanglement characteristics. In particular, our results demonstrate that the latent representation of the model is directly correlated with the entanglement measure concurrence. The insights from this study represent proof of concept toward interpretable machine learning of quantum states. Our approach offers insight into how machines learn to represent small-scale quantum systems autonomously.

TI Wigner-molecularization-enabled dynamic nuclear polarization
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Wigner molecules, or correlated localized electron states, has been reported in semiconductor quantum dots, but their interaction with environment has been less explored. Here the authors use the spin multiplet structure of a three-electron Wigner molecule to enhance and control dynamic nuclear polarization.
   Multielectron semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) provide a novel platform to study the Coulomb interaction-driven, spatially localized electron states of Wigner molecules (WMs). Although Wigner-molecularization has been confirmed by real-space imaging and coherent spectroscopy, the open system dynamics of the strongly correlated states with the environment are not yet well understood. Here, we demonstrate efficient control of spin transfer between an artificial three-electron WM and the nuclear environment in a GaAs double QD. A Landau-Zener sweep-based polarization sequence and low-lying anticrossings of spin multiplet states enabled by Wigner-molecularization are utilized. Combined with coherent control of spin states, we achieve control of magnitude, polarity, and site dependence of the nuclear field. We demonstrate that the same level of control cannot be achieved in the non-interacting regime. Thus, we confirm the spin structure of a WM, paving the way for active control of correlated electron states for application in mesoscopic environment engineering.

TI Decoherence and thermalization of Unruh-DeWitt detector in arbitrary
   dimensions
SO JOURNAL OF HIGH ENERGY PHYSICS
AB We study the decoherence and thermalization of an Unruh-DeWitt detector linearly coupled to the free massless scalar field in flat spacetime with arbitrary dimensions d >= 2. The initial state of the detector is chosen to be a pure state consisting of a linear superposition of ground and excited states, and we calculate the time evolution of reduced density matrix of the detector. Using perturbation method, we analytically derive the transition rate of the detector (the rate of change of the diagonal elements in the density matrix) and the decoherence rate (the rate of change of the off-diagonal elements in the density matrix). We find that the results are not the same in odd and even dimensional spacetimes, but the unitarity of the qubit is preserved in both cases. The real part of the decoherence rate is related to the transition rate, while the imaginary part may contain different forms of divergence terms in different dimensions due to the temporal order product operator and the singularities of the Wightman function for quantum field theory. We derive the recurrence formula to obtain the divergence terms in each dimension and analyze the renormalization problem.

TI Expressivity of quantum neural networks
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB In this work, we address the question whether a sufficiently deep quantum neural network can approximate a target function as accurate as possible. We start with typical physical situations that the target functions are physical observables, and then we extend our discussion to situations that the learning targets are not directly physical observables, but can be expressed as physical observables in an enlarged Hilbert space with multiple replicas, such as the Loschmidt echo and the Renyi entropy. The main finding is that an accurate approximation is possible only when all the input wave functions in the dataset do not span the entire Hilbert space that the quantum circuit acts on, and more precisely, the Hilbert space dimension of the former has to be less than half of the Hilbert space dimension of the latter. In some cases, this requirement can be satisfied automatically because of the intrinsic properties of the dataset, for instance, when the input wave function has to be symmetric between different replicas. And if this requirement cannot be satisfied by the dataset, we show that the expressivity capabilities can be restored by adding one ancillary qubit at which the wave function is always fixed at input. Our studies point toward establishing a quantum neural network analogy of the universal approximation theorem that lays the foundation for expressivity of classical neural networks.

TI Adaptive quantum state tomography with neural networks
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Current algorithms for quantum state tomography (QST) are costly both on the experimental front, requiring measurement of many copies of the state, and on the classical computational front, needing a long time to analyze the gathered data. Here, we introduce neural adaptive quantum state tomography (NAQT), a fast, flexible machine-learning-based algorithm for QST that adapts measurements and provides orders of magnitude faster processing while retaining state-of-the-art reconstruction accuracy. As in other adaptive QST schemes, measurement adaptation makes use of the information gathered from previous measured copies of the state to perform a targeted sensing of the next copy, maximizing the information gathered from that next copy. Our NAQT approach allows for a rapid and seamless integration of measurement adaptation and statistical inference, using a neural-network replacement of the standard Bayes' update, to obtain the best estimate of the state. Our algorithm, which falls into the machine learning subfield of "meta-learning" (in effect "learning to learn" about quantum states), does not require any ansatz about the form of the state to be estimated. Despite this generality, it can be retrained within hours on a single laptop for a two-qubit situation, which suggests a feasible time-cost when extended to larger systems and potential speed-ups if provided with additional structure, such as a state ansatz.

TI Efficient, high-fidelity single-photon switch based on waveguide-coupled
   cavities
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We demonstrate theoretically that waveguide-coupled cavities with embedded two-level emitters can act as a highly efficient, high-fidelity single-photon switch. The photon switch is an optical router triggered by a classical signal-the propagation direction of single input photons in the waveguide is controlled by changing the emitter-cavity coupling parameters in situ, for example, using applied fields. The switch reflects photons in the weak emitter-cavity coupling regime and transmits photons in the strong coupling regime. By calculating transmission and reflection spectra using the input-output formalism of quantum optics and the transfer matrix approach, we obtain the fidelity and efficiency of the switch with a single-photon input in both regimes. We find that a single waveguide-coupled cavity can route input photon wave packets with near-unity efficiency and fidelity if the wave packet width is smaller than the cavity mode linewidth. We also find that using multiple waveguide-coupled cavities increases the switching bandwidth, allowing wider wave packets to be routed with high efficiency and fidelity. For example, an array of three waveguide-coupled cavities can reflect an input Gaussian wave packet with a full width at half-maximum of 1 nm (corresponding to a few-picosecond pulse) with an efficiency Er = 96.4% and a fidelity Fr = 97.7%, or transmit the wave packet with an efficiency Et = 99.7% and a fidelity Ft = 99.8%. Such efficient, high-fidelity single-photon routing is essential for scalable photonic quantum technologies.

TI Strain Engineering of the Electronic States of Silicon-Based Quantum
   Emitters
SO ADVANCED OPTICAL MATERIALS
AB Light-emitting complex defects in silicon have been considered a potential platform for quantum technologies based on spin and photon degrees of freedom working at telecom wavelengths. Their integration in complex devices is still in its infancy and has been mostly focused on light extraction and guiding. Here the control of the electronic states of carbon-related impurities (G-centers) is addressed via strain engineering. By embedding them in patches of silicon on insulator and topping them with SiN, symmetry breaking along [001] and [110] directions is demonstrated, resulting in a controlled splitting of the zero phonon line (ZPL), as accounted for by the piezospectroscopic theoretical framework. The splitting can be as large as 18 meV, and it is finely tuned by selecting patch size or by moving in different positions on the patch. Some of the split, strained ZPLs are almost fully polarized, and their overall intensity is enhanced up to 7 times with respect to the flat areas, whereas their recombination dynamics is slightly affected accounting for the lack of Purcell effect. This technique can be extended to other impurities and Si-based devices such as suspended bridges, photonic crystal microcavities, Mie resonators, and integrated photonic circuits.
   Strained silicon-on-insulator patches are used to break the crystal symmetry lifting the degeneracy of the energy levels of embedded G-centers (carbon-related, light-emitting impurities). Splitting up to 18 meV in two and four peaks of the corresponding zero-phonon-line photoluminescence emission is observed depending on the direction of the applied strain.image

TI Characterization of Carbon Nanostructures by Photoelectron
   Spectroscopies
SO MATERIALS
AB Recently, the scientific community experienced two revolutionary events. The first was the synthesis of single-layer graphene, which boosted research in many different areas. The second was the advent of quantum technologies with the promise to become pervasive in several aspects of everyday life. In this respect, diamonds and nanodiamonds are among the most promising materials to develop quantum devices. Graphene and nanodiamonds can be coupled with other carbon nanostructures to enhance specific properties or be properly functionalized to tune their quantum response. This contribution briefly explores photoelectron spectroscopies and, in particular, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and then turns to the present applications of this technique for characterizing carbon nanomaterials. XPS is a qualitative and quantitative chemical analysis technique. It is surface-sensitive due to its limited sampling depth, which confines the analysis only to the outer few top-layers of the material surface. This enables researchers to understand the surface composition of the sample and how the chemistry influences its interaction with the environment. Although the chemical analysis remains the main information provided by XPS, modern instruments couple this information with spatial resolution and mapping or with the possibility to analyze the material in operando conditions at nearly atmospheric pressures. Examples of the application of photoelectron spectroscopies to the characterization of carbon nanostructures will be reviewed to present the potentialities of these techniques.

TI Parametric instability of ultracold Bose gases with long-range
   interaction and quantum fluctuations trapped in optical lattices
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We investigate the dynamical instabilities of a one-dimensional ultracold Bose-Bose mixture with long-range dipole-dipole interactions, trapped in deep optical lattices and subject to periodically varying contact interaction. The effect of beyond-mean-field corrections due to quantum fluctuations is considered. In the tight-binding regime, we employ Wannier functions to derive a discrete nonlinear Schr & ouml;dinger equation that captures the dynamics of the system. Using linear stability analysis coupled to multiple scale expansion, we systematically study the modulational and parametric instabilities of the system in the miscible regime, identifying the conditions under which these instabilities emerge. The corresponding instability domains are found and examined. The roles of long-range interactions and quantum fluctuations are highlighted, demonstrating their significant impact on the stability and dynamics of the lattice system. Our analytical predictions are validated through direct numerical simulations, which confirm the instability diagrams through the effective onset of instabilities and reveal the intricate interplay between interaction strength, quantum fluctuation, and the long-range nature of the dipole-dipole forces. This work provides insights into the control and manipulation of ultracold quantum gases in optical lattices, which have potential applications in quantum simulation and condensed-matter physics.

TI Aharonov-Bohm and Altshuler-Aronov-Spivak oscillations in the
   quasiballistic regime in phase-pure GaAs/InAs core/shell nanowires
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB The realization of various qubit systems based on high-quality hybrid superconducting quantum devices is often achieved using semiconductor nanowires. For such hybrid devices, a good coupling between the superconductor and the conducting states in the semiconductor wire is crucial. GaAs/InAs core/shell nanowires with an insulating core and a conductive InAs shell fulfill this requirement, since the electronic states are strongly confined near the surface. However, maintaining a good crystal quality in the conducting shell is a challenge for this type of nanowire. In this work, we present phase-pure zinc-blende GaAs/InAs core/shell nanowires and analyze their low-temperature magnetotransport properties. We observe pronounced magnetic flux quantum periodic oscillations, which can be attributed to a combination of Aharonov-Bohm and Altshuler-Aronov-Spivak oscillations. From the gate and temperature dependence of the conductance oscillations, as well as from supporting theoretical transport calculations, we conclude that the conducting states in the shell are in the quasiballistic transport regime, with few scattering centers, but nevertheless leading to an Altshuler-Aronov-Spivak correction that dominates at small magnetic field strengths. Our results demonstrate that phase-pure zinc-blende GaAs/InAs core/shell nanowires represent a very promising alternative semiconductor-nanowire-based platform for hybrid quantum devices.

TI from ultrahigh fluence ion implantation
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW MATERIALS
AB Isotopically enriched silicon (Si) can greatly enhance qubit coherence times by minimizing naturally occurring 29Si which has a nonzero nuclear spin. Ultrahigh fluence 28Si ion implantation of bulk natural Si substrates was recently demonstrated as an attractive technique to ultrahigh 28Si isotopic purity. In this work, we apply this 28Si enrichment process to produce 28Si and 28Si-on-insulator (SOI) samples. Experimentally, we produced a 28Si sample on natural Si substrate with 29Si depleted to 7 ppm (limited by measurement noise floor) that is at least 100 nm thick. This is achieved with an ion energy that results in a sputter yield of less than one and an ultrahigh ion fluence, as supported by our improved computational model that is based on fitting a large number of experiments. Further, our model predicts the 29Si and 30Si depletion in our sample to be less than 1 ppm. In the case of SOI, ion implantation conditions are found to be more stringent than those of bulk natural Si in terms of minimizing threading dislocations upon subsequent solid phase epitaxy annealing. Finally, we do not observe open volume defects in our 28SOI and 28Si samples after SPE annealing (620 degrees C, 10 min).

TI Tradeoff Constructions for Quantum Locally Testable Codes
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION THEORY
AB In this work, we continue the search for quantum locally testable codes (qLTCs) of new parameters by presenting three constructions that can make new qLTCs from old. The first analyses the soundness of a quantum code under Hastings' weight reduction construction for qLDPC codes to give a weight reduction procedure for qLTCs. Secondly, we describe a novel 'soundness amplification' procedure for qLTCs which can increase the soundness of any qLTC to a constant while preserving its distance and dimension, with an impact only felt on its locality. Finally, we apply the AEL distance amplification construction to the case of qLTCs for the first time which can turn a high-distance qLTC into one with linear distance, at the expense of other parameters. These constructions can be used on as-yet undiscovered qLTCs to obtain new parameters, but we also find a number of present applications to prove the existence of codes in previously unknown parameter regimes. In particular, applications of these operations to the hypersphere product code and the hemicubic code yield many previously unknown parameters. In addition, applications of all three results are described to an upcoming work.

TI Certified Randomness in Tight Space
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Reliable randomness is a core ingredient in algorithms and applications ranging from numerical simulations to statistical sampling and cryptography. The outcomes of measurements on entangled quantum states can violate Bell inequalities, thus guaranteeing their intrinsic randomness. This constitutes the basis for certified randomness generation. However, this certification requires spacelike separated devices, making it unfit for a compact apparatus. Here we provide a general method for certified randomness generation on a small-scale application-ready device and perform an integrated photonic demonstration combining a solid-state emitter and a glass chip. In contrast to most existing certification protocols, which in the absence of spacelike separation are vulnerable to loopholes inherent to realistic devices, the protocol we implement accounts for information leakage and is thus compatible with emerging compact scalable devices. We demonstrate a two-qubit photonic device that achieves the highest standard in randomness, yet is cut out for real-world applications. The full 94.5-h-long stabilized process harnesses a bright and stable single-photon quantum-dot-based source, feeding into a reconfigurable photonic chip, with stability in the milliradian range on the implemented phases and consistent indistinguishability of the entangled photons above 93%. Using the contextuality framework, we certify private randomness generation and achieve a rate compatible with randomness expansion secure against quantum adversaries.

TI Elongated quantum dot as a distributed charge sensor
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB Increasing the separation between semiconductor quantum dots offers scaling advantages by facilitating gate routing and the integration of sensors and charge reservoirs. Elongated quantum dots have been utilized for this purpose in GaAs heterostructures to extend the range of spin-spin interactions. Here, we study a MOS device where two quantum dot arrays are separated by an elongated quantum dot (340 nm long, 50 nm wide). We monitor charge transitions of the elongated quantum dot by measuring radiofrequency single-electron currents to a reservoir to which we connect a lumped-element resonator. We operate the dot as a single-electron box to achieve charge sensing of remote quantum dots in each array, separated by an edge-to-edge distance of 480 nm. Charge detection on both ends of the elongated dot at a coinciding setpoint demonstrates that the charge states are well distributed across its nominal length, supported by the simulated quantum mechanical electron density. Likewise, we show elongated-peripheral quantum dot tunnel couplings can exceed 20 GHz, above the electron temperature, fulfilling the requirement for mediated exchange. Our results illustrate how single-electron boxes can be realized with versatile footprints that may enable compact quantum processor layouts, offering distributed charge sensing in addition to the possibility of mediated coupling.

TI Evaluation of Cytologic Sample Preparations for Compatibility With
   Nucleic Acid Analysis
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF CLINICAL PATHOLOGY
AB Objectives: In this study, the influence of several key elements of the cytologic sample workflow on DNA and RNA content was evaluated.
   Methods: The A549 cell line, patient-derived organoids, and pleural effusions were used to investigate the effect of (1) several collection media and delayed time to processing; (2) cytology specimens; (3) cytologic staining; and (4) formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) cell block processing on nucleic acid quality and quantity as determined by fragment analyzer, Qubit analysis (Thermo Fisher Scientific), and quantitative polymerase chain reaction-based analysis on the Idylla platform (Biocartis).
   Results: Alcohol-based collection media (CytoRich Red [Thermo Fisher Scientific] and EtOH95%) displayed high DNA and RNA preservation capacity, while phosphate-buffered saline and, to a lesser extent, formalin were associated with high RNA quality. Cytospin and smear cytology specimens were subject to DNA and RNA loss. Cytologic staining had no further impact on sample quality, hence destaining is not necessary. Both H&E-stained and unstained FFPE sections are compatible with nucleic acid analysis, despite a strong decrease in DNA and RNA quality.
   Conclusions: Although several key elements of the cytologic sample workflow have an influence on DNA and RNA quality and quantity, the selection of these elements is also dependent on the downstream (ancillary) testing methods.

TI Transmission Spectroscopy of Molecular Spin Ensembles in the Dispersive
   Regime
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB The readout in the dispersive regime is originally developed-and it is now largely exploited-for non-demolitive measurement of super- and semiconducting qubits. More recently it has been successfully applied to probe collective spin excitations in ferro(i)magnetic bulk samples or collections of paramagnetic spin centers embedded into microwave cavities. The use of this readout technique within a semiclassical limit of excitation is only marginally investigated although it holds for a wide class of problems, including advanced magnetic resonance techniques. In this work, the coupling between a coplanar microwave resonator and diphenyl-nitroxide organic radical diluted in a fully deuterated benzophenone single crystal is investigated. Two-tone transmission spectroscopy experiments demonstrate the possibility to reconstruct the spectrum of the spin system with little loss of sensitivity with respect to the resonant regime. Likewise, pulse sequences of detuned microwave frequency allow the measurement of the spin-lattice relaxation time (T-1). The independent tunability of the probe and the drive power enables one to adjust the signal-to-noise ratio of the spectroscopy. These results suggest that electron spin dispersive spectroscopy can be used as a complementary tool of electron spin resonance to investigate the spin response.

TI Dynamical quantum phase transitions in a noisy lattice gauge theory
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB Lattice gauge theories form an intriguing class of theories highly relevant to both high-energy particle physics and low-energy condensed matter physics with the rapid development of engineered quantum devices providing new tools to study, e.g., dynamics of such theories. The massive Schwinger model is known to exhibit intricate properties of more complicated theories and has recently been shown to undergo dynamical quantum phase transitions out of equilibrium. With current technology, noise is inevitable and potentially fatal for a successful quantum simulation. This paper studies the dynamics subject to noise of a (1 + 1)D U(1) quantum link model following a quench of the sign of the mass term. We find that not only is the system capable of handling noise at rates realistic in NISQ-era devices, promising the possibility to study the target dynamics with current technology, but the effect of noise can be understood in terms of simple models. Specifically the gauge-breaking nature of bit flip channels results in exponential dampening of state amplitudes, and thus observables, which does not affect the structures of interest. This is especially important as it demonstrates that the gauge theory can be successfully studied with devices that only exhibit approximate gauge invariance.

TI Materials challenges for SrRuO3: From conventional to quantum
   electronics
SO APL MATERIALS
AB The need for faster and more miniaturized electronics is challenging scientists to develop novel forms of electronics based on quantum degrees of freedom different from electron charge. In this fast-developing field, often referred to as quantum electronics, the metal-oxide perovskite SrRuO3 can play an important role thanks to its diverse physical properties, which have been intensively investigated, mostly for conventional electronics. In addition to being chemically stable, easy to fabricate with high quality and to grow epitaxially onto many oxides-these are all desirable properties also for conventional electronics-SrRuO3 has interesting properties for quantum electronics like itinerant ferromagnetism and metallic behavior, strong correlation between magnetic anisotropy and spin-orbit coupling, strain-tunable magnetization, and anomalous Hall and Berry effects. In this Perspective, after describing the main phenomena emerging from the interplay between spin, orbital, lattice, and topological quantum degrees of freedom in SrRuO3, we discuss the challenges still open to achieve control over these phenomena. We then provide our perspectives on the most promising applications of SrRuO3 for devices for conventional and quantum electronics. We suggest new device configurations and discuss the materials challenges for their realization. For conventional electronics, we single out applications where SrRuO3 devices can bring competitive advantages over existing ones. For quantum electronics, we propose devices that can help gain a deeper understanding of quantum effects in SrRuO3 to exploit them for quantum technologies. We finally give an outlook about properties of SrRuO3 still waiting for discovery and applications that may stem from them. (c) 2022 Author(s).

TI CFLOBDDs: Context-Free-Language Ordered Binary Decision Diagrams
SO ACM TRANSACTIONS ON PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES AND SYSTEMS
AB This article presents a new compressed representation of Boolean functions, called CFLOBDDs (for ContextFree-Language Ordered Binary Decision Diagrams). They are essentially a plug-compatible alternative to BDDs (Binary Decision Diagrams), and hence are useful for representing certain classes of functions, matrices, graphs, relations, and so forth in a highly compressed fashion. CFLOBDDs share many of the good properties of BDDs, but-in the best case-the CFLOBDD for a Boolean function can be exponentially smaller than any BDD for that function. Compared with the size of the decision tree for a function, a CFLOBDD-again, in the best case-can give a double-exponential reduction in size. They have the potential to permit applications to (i) execute much faster and (ii) handle much larger problem instances than has been possible heretofore.
   We applied CFLOBDDs in quantum-circuit simulation and found that for several standard problems, the improvement in scalability, compared to BDDs, is quite dramatic. With a 15-minute timeout, the number of qubits that CFLOBDDs can handle are 65,536 for Greenberger-Horne-Zellinger, 524,288 for BernsteinVazirani, 4,194,304 for Deutsch-Jozsa, and 4,096 for Grover's algorithm, besting BDDs by factors of 128x, 1,024x, 8,192x, and 128x, respectively.

TI Ground-state phase diagram of quantum link electrodynamics in (2
SO SCIPOST PHYSICS
AB The exploration of phase diagrams of strongly interacting gauge theories coupled to matter in lower dimensions promises the identification of exotic phases and possible new universality classes, and it facilitates a better understanding of salient phenomena in Nature, such as confinement or high-temperature superconductivity. The emerging new techniques of quantum synthetic matter experiments as well as efficient classical computational methods with matrix product states have been extremely successful in one spatial dimension, and are now motivating such studies in two spatial dimensions. In this work, we consider a U (1) quantum link lattice gauge theory where the gauge fields, represented by spin-1/2 operators are coupled to a single flavor of staggered fermions. Using matrix product states on infinite cylinders with increasing diameter, we conjecture its phase diagram in (2 + 1)-d. This model allows us to smoothly tune between the U (1) quantum link and the quantum dimer models by adjusting the strength of the fermion mass term, enabling us to connect to the well-studied phases of those models. Our study reveals a rich phase diagram with exotic phases and interesting phase transitions to a potential liquid-like phase. It thus furthers the collection of gauge theory models that may guide future quantum-simulation experiments.

TI Electrodeposition mechanism of chromium nanoparticle coatings: Modeling
   and experimental validation
SO CHEMICAL ENGINEERING SCIENCE
AB In this paper the deposition and surface growth of chromium nanoparticles (CrNPs) coatings on a com-mercial steel substrate by electrodeposition at a constant current, is presented; both theoretically through a theoretical-computational model applying a modified Schrodinger equation, energy potentials and electrochemistry and phitosynthesis of Cr Nanoparticles . For the simulation process, the finite ele-ment method (FEM) was used considering the equation of electric potential and electroneutrality with and without the inclusion of a quantum leap. The theoretical results are in accordance with the experi-mental results, considering a three-level multifactorial experiment design with current, voltage and ion concentration as factors and the formation and growth of the coatings as a response function. The results obtained indicate the presence of electro-diffusion at the substrate-coating interface. The developed model has the predictive ability of 97 +/- 2 % for the electrochemical deposition of CrNPs on a steel substrate.(c) 2021 UPAEP University / TECNOLOGICO NACIONAL DE MEXICO, INSTITUTO TECNOLOGICO DE API-ZACO.

TI A Strontium Quantum-Gas Microscope
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB The development of quantum-gas microscopes has brought novel ways of probing quantum degenerate many-body systems at the single-atom level. Until now, most of these setups have focused on alkali atoms. Expanding quantum-gas microscopy to alkaline-earth elements will provide new tools, such as SU(N)symmetric fermionic isotopes or ultranarrow optical transitions, to the field of quantum simulation. Here we demonstrate the site-resolved imaging of a 84Sr bosonic quantum gas in a Hubbard-regime optical lattice. The quantum gas is confined by a two-dimensional in-plane lattice and a light-sheet potential, which operate at the strontium clock-magic wavelength of 813.4 nm. We realize fluorescence imaging using the broad 461-nm transition, which provides high spatial resolution. Simultaneously, we perform attractive Sisyphus cooling with the narrow 689-nm intercombination line. We reconstruct the atomic occupation from the fluorescence images, obtaining imaging fidelities above 94%. Finally, we realize a 84Sr superfluid in the Bose-Hubbard regime. We observe its interference pattern upon expansion, a probe of phase coherence, with single-atom resolution. Our strontium quantum-gas microscope provides a new platform to study dissipative Hubbard models, quantum optics in atomic arrays, and SU(N) fermions at the microscopic level.

TI Toward improved quantum simulations and sensing with trapped
   two-dimensional ion crystals via parametric amplification
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Improving coherence is a fundamental challenge in quantum simulation and sensing experiments with trapped ions. Here we discuss, experimentally demonstrate, and estimate the potential impacts of two different protocols that enhance, through motional parametric excitation, the coherent spin-motion coupling of ions obtained with a spin-dependent force. The experiments are performed on two-dimensional crystal arrays of approximately 100 9Be+ ions confined in a Penning trap. By modulating the trapping potential at close to twice the center-of-mass mode frequency, we squeeze the motional mode and enhance the spin-motion coupling while maintaining spin coherence. With a stroboscopic protocol, we measure 5.4 +/- 0.9 dB of motional squeezing below the ground-state motion, from which theory predicts a 10-dB enhancement in the sensitivity for measuring small displacements using a recently demonstrated protocol [K. A. Gilmore et al., Science 373, 673 (2021)]. With a continuous squeezing protocol, we measure and accurately calibrate the parametric coupling strength. Theory suggests this protocol can be used to improve quantum spin squeezing, limited in our system by off-resonant light scatter. We illustrate numerically the trade-offs between strong parametric amplification and motional dephasing in the form of center-of-mass frequency fluctuations for improving quantum spin squeezing in our setup.

TI Profiling of Dominant Bacteria in Traditional Buffalo Milk Cheese
   "Dangke" Based on 16S rRNA Sequencing
SO TROPICAL ANIMAL SCIENCE JOURNAL
AB Metagenomic approaches are highly valuable in food microbiology, particularly for the investigation of traditional fermented products such as dangke buffalo milk cheese from South Sulawesi, Indonesia. Buffalo milk, a primary raw material, contains diverse biochemical and bioactive components that are produced by microbial activity during fermentation. Unlike conventional culture-based techniques, metagenomics enables the comprehensive characterization of microbial communities directly from food matrices. This study aimed to identify the key microbial taxa that contribute to the dangke quality of fermentation and to understand the factors influencing it. Bacterial 16S rRNA genes were amplified using primers 27F and 1492R under optimized polymerase chain reaction conditions. DNA concentrations were measured with NanoDrop and Qubit instruments, and sequencing was conducted using Oxford Nanopore Technology with MinKNOW software (v23.04.5). Metagenomic analysis revealed Enterococcus faecium as the dominant lactic acid bacterium across all dangke samples (P1-P3), emphasizing its crucial role in fermentation and probiotic potential. These findings suggest that E. faecium can enhance the quality and functional properties of dangke. Moreover, metagenomic tools can support the development of standardized fermentation practices and microbial safety assessments for traditional dairy products.

TI Leapfrogging Sycamore: harnessing 1432 GPUs for 7x faster quantum random
   circuit sampling
SO NATIONAL SCIENCE REVIEW
AB Random quantum circuit sampling serves as a benchmark to demonstrate quantum computational advantage. Recent progress in classical algorithms, especially those based on tensor network methods, has significantly reduced the classical simulation time and challenged the claim of first-generation quantum advantage experiments. However, in terms of generating uncorrelated samples, time to solution and energy consumption, previous classical simulation experiments still underperform the Sycamore processor. Here we report an energy-efficient classical simulation algorithm, using 1432 GPUs to simulate quantum random circuit sampling that generates uncorrelated samples with a higher linear cross-entropy score and is 7$\times$ faster than the Sycamore 53-qubit experiment. We propose a post-processing algorithm to reduce the overall complexity, and integrate state-of-the-art high-performance general-purpose GPUs to achieve two orders of lower energy consumption compared to previous works. Our work provides the first unambiguous experimental evidence to refute Sycamore's claim of quantum advantage, and redefines the boundary of quantum computational advantage using random circuit sampling.
   This work presents an energy-efficient classical simulation algorithm using GPUs that outperforms Google's Sycamore processor in speed and energy consumption, challenging the claim of quantum computational advantage.

TI Characterization of NbTiN Films With Thicknesses Below 20 nm for Low
   Power Kinetic Inductance Amplifiers
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON APPLIED SUPERCONDUCTIVITY
AB A quantum-limited amplification chain is a fundamental advantage for any application that may benefit from the detection of very faint signals. Reading out arrays of superconducting detectors (TESs or MKIDs), resonant cavities, or qubits, calls for large bandwidth amplifiers in addition to having the lowest possible noise. At millikelvin temperatures, Kinetic Inductance Traveling-Wave Parametric Amplifiers (KI-TWPAs) working in 3-wave-mixing (3WM) and fabricated from a 20 nm thick NbTiN film have shown promising noise performances, as they can operate close to the quantum limit (Malnou et al., 2021). However, they still require fairly high pump power. Devices that would require lower pump power would be easier to implement in readout chains, could reach the quantum limit and they would be compatible with qubit readout. A possible solution for obtaining this optimal configuration is to use a thinner superconducting film. In this work we explore the properties of NbTiN films with a thickness less than 20 nm and we report the obtained experimental characterizations in terms of critical temperature, normal resistivity, and kinetic inductance. A new design for a 3WM KI-TWPA amplifier, based on these developed superconducting films, is introduced and discussed.

TI Hole spin manipulation in inhomogeneous and nonseparable electric fields
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB The usual models for electrical spin manipulation in semiconductor quantum dots assume that the confinement potential is separable in the three spatial dimensions and that the ac drive field is homogeneous. However, the electric field induced by the gates in quantum dot devices is not fully separable and displays significant inhomogeneities. Here we address the electrical manipulation of hole spins in semiconductor heterostructures subject to inhomogeneous vertical electric fields and/or in-plane ac electric fields. We consider Ge quantum dots electrically confined in a Ge/GeSi quantum well as an illustration. We show that the lack of separability between the vertical and in-plane motions gives rise to an additional spin-orbit coupling mechanism (beyond the usual linear and cubic in momentum Rashba terms) that modulates the principal axes of the hole gyromagnetic g matrix. This nonseparability mechanism can be of the same order of magnitude as Rashba-type interactions, and enables spin manipulation when the magnetic field is applied in the plane of the heterostructure even if the dot is symmetric (disk shaped). More generally, we show that Rabi oscillations in strongly patterned electric fields harness a variety of g-factor modulations. We discuss the implications for the design, modeling, and understanding of hole spin qubit devices.

TI How to Probe Hydrated Dielectrons Experimentally: Ab Initio
   Simulations of the Absorption Spectra of Aqueous Dielectrons, Electron
   Pairs, and Hydride
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY LETTERS
AB In the radiation chemistry of water, two hydrated electrons (e(hyd)(-)) can react to form H-2 and OH-. Experiments and simulations suggest that this reaction occurs through a mechanism involving colocalization of two e(hyd)(-)'s into the same solvent cavity, forming a hydrated dielectron ((e(hyd))(2-)(2)) intermediate, with aqueous hydride (H-) as a subintermediate. However, there has been no direct experimental observation of either (e(hyd))(2-)(2) or H-. Here, we present TD-DFT-based predictions for the absorption spectrum of open-shell-singlet and triplet e(hyd)(-) pairs, (e(hyd))(2-)(2), and H-. We find that relative to e(hyd)(-), triplet and open-shell singlet electron pairs show spectral shifts to the blue and red, respectively. Additionally, we find that ((e(hyd))(2-)(2) absorbs even further to the red, and that H- has a charge-transfer-to-solvent-like transition at wavelengths several eV to the blue, providing a direct experimental handle with which to probe these species. We propose a three-pulse transient absorption experiment that should allow detection of (e(hyd))(2-)(2) and H-.

TI Wave function and spatial structure of polarons in an antiferromagnetic
   bilayer
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB Adding a dopant to an antiferromagnetic spin background disturbs the magnetic order and leads to the formation of a quasiparticle coined the magnetic polaron, which plays a central role in understanding strongly correlated materials. Recently, remarkably detailed insights into the spatial properties of such polarons have been obtained using atoms in optical lattices. Motivated by this we develop a nonperturbative scheme for calculating the wave function of the magnetic polaron in a bilayer antiferromagnet using the self-consistent Born approximation. The scheme includes an infinite number of spin waves, which is crucial for an accurate description of the most interesting regime of strong correlations. Utilizing the developed wave function, we explore the spatial structure of the polaron dressing cloud consisting of magnetically frustrated spins surrounding the hole. Mimicking the nonmonotonic behavior of the antiferromagnetic order, we find that the dressing cloud first decreases and then increases in size with increasing interlayer hopping. The increase reflects the decrease in the magnetic order as a quantum phase transition to a disordered state is approached for large interlayer hopping. We, furthermore, find that the symmetry of the ground state dressing cloud changes as the interlayer coupling increases. Our results should be experimentally accessible using quantum simulation with optical lattices.

TI Emerging (2+1) D massive graviton in graphene-like systems
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB Unlike the fundamental forces of the Standard Model the quantum effects of gravity are still experimentally inaccessible. Rather surprisingly quantum aspects of gravity, such as massive gravitons, can emerge in experiments with fractional quantum Hall liquids. These liquids are analytically intractable and thus offer limited insight into the mechanism that gives rise to quantum gravity effects. To thoroughly understand this mechanism we employ a graphene-like system and we modify it appropriately in order to realise simple (2 + 1)-dimensional massive gravity model. More concretely, we employ (2 + 1)-dimensional Dirac fermions, emerging in the continuous limit of a fermionic honeycomb lattice, coupled to massive gravitons, simulated by bosonic modes positioned at the links of the lattice. The quantum character of gravity can be determined directly by measuring the correlations on the bosonic atoms or by the interactions they effectively induce on the fermions. The similarity of our approach to current optical lattice configurations suggests that quantum signatures of gravity can be simulated in the laboratory in the near future, thus providing a platform to address question on the unification theories, cosmology or the physics of black holes.

TI Emergent Fine Structure Constant of Quantum Spin Ice Is Large
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Condensed-matter systems provide alternative "vacua" exhibiting emergent low-energy properties drastically different from those of the standard model. A case in point is the emergent quantum electrodynamics (QED) in the fractionalized topological magnet known as quantum spin ice, whose magnetic monopoles set it apart from the familiar QED of the world we live in. Here, we show that the two greatly differ in their fine structure constant alpha, which parametrizes how strongly matter couples to light: alpha(QSI) is more than an order of magnitude greater than alpha(QED) approximate to 1/137. Furthermore, alpha(QSI), the emergent speed of light, and all other parameters of the emergent QED, are tunable by engineering the microscopic Hamiltonian. We find that alpha(QSI) can be tuned all the way from zero up to what is believed to be the strongest possible coupling beyond which QED confines. In view of the small size of its constrained Hilbert space, this marks out quantum spin ice as an ideal platform for studying exotic quantum field theories and a target for quantum simulation. The large alpha(QSI) implies that experiments probing candidate condensed-matter realizations of quantum spin ice should expect to observe phenomena arising due to strong interactions.

TI Work Fluctuations in Ergotropic Heat Engines
SO ENTROPY
AB We study the work fluctuations in ergotropic heat engines, namely two-stroke quantum Otto engines where the work stroke is designed to extract the ergotropy (the maximum amount of work by a cyclic unitary evolution) from a couple of quantum systems at canonical equilibrium at two different temperatures, whereas the heat stroke thermalizes back the systems to their respective reservoirs. We provide an exhaustive study for the case of two qutrits whose energy levels are equally spaced at two different frequencies by deriving the complete work statistics. By varying the values of temperatures and frequencies, only three kinds of optimal unitary strokes are found: the swap operator U1, an idle swap U2 (where one of the qutrits is regarded as an effective qubit), and a non-trivial permutation of energy eigenstates U3, which indeed corresponds to the composition of the two previous unitaries, namely U3=U2U1. While U1 and U2 are Hermitian (and hence involutions), U3 is not. This point has an impact on the thermodynamic uncertainty relations (TURs), which bound the signal-to-noise ratio of the extracted work in terms of the entropy production. In fact, we show that all TURs derived from a strong detailed fluctuation theorem are violated by the transformation U3.

TI Dark-bright excitons mixing in alloyed InGaAs self-assembled quantum
   dots
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB Quantum dots are arguably one of the best platforms for optically accessible spin-based qubits. The paramount demand of extended qubit storage time can be met by using a quantum-dot-confined dark exciton: a long-lived electron-hole pair with parallel spins. Despite its name, the dark exciton reveals weak luminescence that can be directly measured. The origins of this optical activity remain largely unexplored. In this work, using the atomistic tight-binding method combined with the configuration-interaction approach, we demonstrate that atomic-scale randomness strongly affects the oscillator strength of dark excitons confined in self-assembled cylindrical InGaAs quantum dots with no need for faceting or shape-elongation. We show that this process is mediated by two mechanisms: mixing dark and bright configurations by exchange interaction, and the equally important appearance of nonvanishing optical transition matrix elements that otherwise correspond to nominally forbidden transitions in a nonalloyed case. The alloy randomness has an essential impact on both bright and dark exciton states, including their energy, emission intensity, and polarization angle. We conclude that, due to the atomic-scale alloy randomness, finding dots with the desired dark exciton properties may require exploration of a large ensemble, similarly to how dots with low bright exciton splitting are selected for entanglement generation.

TI Operational Resource Theory of Imaginarity
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Wave-particle duality is one of the basic features of quantum mechanics, giving rise to the use of complex numbers in describing states of quantum systems and their dynamics and interaction. Since the inception of quantum theory, it has been debated whether complex numbers are essential or whether an alternative consistent formulation is possible using real numbers only. Here, we attack this long-standing problem theoretically and experimentally, using the powerful tools of quantum resource theories. We show that, under reasonable assumptions, quantum states are easier to create and manipulate if they only have real elements. This gives an operational meaning to the resource theory of imaginarity. We identify and answer several important questions, which include the state-conversion problem for all qubit states and all pure states of any dimension and the approximate imaginarity distillation for all quantum states. As an application, we show that imaginarity plays a crucial role in state discrimination, that is, there exist real quantum states that can be perfectly distinguished via local operations and classical communication but that cannot be distinguished with any nonzero probability if one of the parties has no access to imaginarity. We confirm this phenomenon experimentally with linear optics, discriminating different two-photon quantum states by local projective measurements. Our results prove that complex numbers are an indispensable part of quantum mechanics.

TI Transient vortex dynamics and evolution of Bose metal from a 2D
   superconductor on MoS2
SO 2D MATERIALS
AB The true character of physical phenomena is thought to be reinforced as the system becomes disorder-free. In contrast, the two-dimensional (2D) superconductor is predicted to turn fragile and resistive away from the limit I -> 0, B -> 0, in the pinning-free regime. It is intriguing to note that the very vortices responsible for achieving superconductivity by pairing, condensation, and, thereby reducing the classical dissipation, render the state resistive driven by quantum fluctuations in the T -> 0. While cleaner systems are being explored for technological improvements, the 2D superconductor turning resistive when influenced by weak electric and magnetic fields has profound consequences for quantum technologies. A metallic ground state in 2D is beyond the consensus of both Bosonic and Fermionic systems, and its origin and nature warrant a comprehensive theoretical understanding supplemented by in-depth experiments. A real-time observation of the influence of vortex dynamics on transport properties so far has been elusive. We explore the nature and fate of a low-viscous, clean, 2D superconducting state formed on an ionic-liquid gated few-layered MoS(2 )sample. The vortex-core being dissipative, the elastic depinning, intervortex interaction, and the subsequent dynamics of the vortex-lattice leave transient signatures in the transport characteristics. The temperature and magnetic field dependence of the transient nature and the noise characteristics of the magnetoresistance confirm that quantum fluctuations are solely responsible for the Bose metal state and the fragility of the superconducting state.

TI Boron and Nitrogen Isotope Effects on Hexagonal Boron Nitride Properties
SO ADVANCED MATERIALS
AB The unique physical, mechanical, chemical, optical, and electronic properties of hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) make it a promising 2D material for electronic, optoelectronic, nanophotonic, and quantum devices. Here, the changes in hBN's properties induced by isotopic purification in both boron and nitrogen are reported. Previous studies on isotopically pure hBN have focused on purifying the boron isotope concentration in hBN from its natural concentration (approximate to 20 at% B-10, 80 at% B-11) while using naturally abundant nitrogen (99.6 at% N-14, 0.4 at% N-15), that is, almost pure N-14. In this study, the class of isotopically purified hBN crystals to N-15 is extended. Crystals in the four configurations, namely h(10)B(14)N, h(11)B(14)N, h(10)B(15)N, and h(11)B(15)N, are grown by the metal flux method using boron and nitrogen single isotope (> 99%) enriched sources, with nickel plus chromium as the solvent. In-depth Raman and photoluminescence spectroscopies demonstrate the high quality of the monoisotopic hBN crystals with vibrational and optical properties of the N-15-purified crystals at the state-of-the-art of currently available N-14-purified hBN. The growth of high-quality h(10)B(14)N, h(11)B(14)N, h(10)B(15)N, and h(11)B(15)N opens exciting perspectives for thermal conductivity control in heat management, as well as for advanced functionalities in quantum technologies.

TI Quantum equilibrium propagation for efficient training of quantum
   systems based on Onsager reciprocity
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB The widespread adoption of machine learning and artificial intelligence in all branches of science and technology creates a need for energy-efficient, alternative hardware. While such neuromorphic systems have been demonstrated in a wide range of platforms, it remains an open challenge to find efficient and general physics-based training approaches. Equilibrium propagation (EP), the most widely studied approach, has been introduced for classical energy-based models relaxing to an equilibrium. Here, we show a direct connection between EP and Onsager reciprocity and exploit this to derive a quantum version of EP. For an arbitrary quantum system, this can now be used to extract training gradients with respect to all tuneable parameters via a single linear response experiment. We illustrate this new concept in examples in which the input or the task is of quantum-mechanical nature, e.g., the recognition of many-body ground states, phase discovery, sensing, and phase boundary exploration. Quantum EP may be used to solve challenges such as quantum phase discovery for Hamiltonians which are classically hard to simulate or even partially unknown. Our scheme is relevant for a variety of quantum simulation platforms such as ion chains, superconducting circuits, Rydberg atom tweezer arrays and ultracold atoms in optical lattices.

TI Calculating the Green's function of two-site fermionic Hubbard model in
   a photonic system
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB The Green's function has been an indispensable tool to study many-body systems that remain one of the biggest challenges in modern quantum physics for decades. The complicated calculation of the Green's function impedes the research of many-body systems. The appearance of the noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices and quantum-classical hybrid algorithm inspire a new method to calculate the Green's function. Here we design a programmable quantum circuit for photons with utilizing the polarization and the path degrees of freedom to construct a highly-precise variational quantum state of a photon, and first report the experimental realization for calculating the Green's function of the two-site fermionic Hubbard model, a prototypical model for strongly-correlated materials, in photonic systems. We run the variational quantum eigensolver to obtain the ground state and excited states of the model, and then evaluate the transition amplitudes among the eigenstates. The experimental results present the spectral function of the Green's function, which agrees well with exact results. Our demonstration provides the further possibility of the photonic system in quantum simulation and applications in solving complicated problems in many-body systems, biological science and so on.

TI Quantum-fluctuation-driven dynamics of droplet splashing, recoiling, and
   deposition in ultracold binary Bose gases
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Droplet impact on a surface is practically relevant to a variety of fields in nature and industry, while a complete control of its outcomes remains challenging due to various unmanageable factors. In this work, we propose the quantum simulation of droplet impact outcomes in the platform of ultracold atoms. Specifically, we study the quantum-fluctuation-driven dynamics (QFDD) of two-dimensional Bose-Bose mixtures from an initial Townes soliton towards the formation of a quantum droplet. By tuning the fluctuation energy of the initial Townes state through its size and number, the subsequent QFDD can produce various outcomes including splashing, recoiling, and deposition, similar to those in droplet impact dynamics. We have utilized the Weber number to identify the thresholds of splashing and recoiling, and further established a universal scaling law between the maximum spreading factor and the Weber number in the recoiling regime. In addition, we show that the residual QFDD in the deposition regime can be used to probe the collective breathing modes of a quantum droplet. Our results reveal a mechanism for the droplet impact outcomes, which can be directly tested in cold-atom experiments and can pave the way for exploring intriguing droplet dynamics in a clean and fully controlled quantum setting.

TI Superdiffusive to ballistic transport in nonintegrable Rydberg simulator
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB A common wisdom posits that transport of conserved quantities across clean nonintegrable quantum systems at high temperatures is diffusive when probed from the emergent hydrodynamic regime. We show that this empirical paradigm may alter if the strong interaction limit is taken. Using Krylov-typicality and purification matrix-product-state methods, we establish in short-to-intermediate time scales the following observations for the nonintegrable lattice model imitating the experimental Rydberg blockade simulator. Given the strict projection owing to the infinite density-density repulsion V, the Rydberg chain's energy transport in the presence of a transverse field g is tentatively superdiffusive at infinite temperature featured by an anomalous scaling exponent 34\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$\frac{3}{4}$$\end{document}, indicating the potential existence of a novel dynamical universality class. Imposing, in addition, a growing longitudinal field h causes a putative superdiffusion-to-ballistic transport transition at h approximate to g. Interestingly, all the above results persist for large but finite interactions and temperatures, provided that the strongly interacting condition g, h << kBT << V is fulfilled. Our predictions are testable by current Rydberg quantum simulation facilities.

TI Anisotropic inflation in dipolar Bose-Einstein condensates
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB Early during the era of cosmic inflation, rotational invariance may have been broken, only later emerging as a feature of low-energy physics. This motivates ongoing searches for residual signatures of anisotropic space-time, for example in the power spectrum of the cosmic microwave background. We propose that dipolar Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) furnish a laboratory quantum simulation platform for the anisotropy evolution of fluctuation spectra during inflation, exploiting the fact that the speed of dipolar condensate sound waves depends on direction. We construct the anisotropic analogue space-time metric governing sound, by linking the time-varying strength of dipolar and contact interactions in the BEC to the scale factors in different coordinate directions. Based on these, we calculate the dynamics of phonon power spectra during an inflation that renders the initially anisotropic Universe isotropic. We find that the expansion speed provides an experimental handle to control and study the degree of final residual anisotropy. Gravity analogues using dipolar condensates can thus provide tuneable experiments for a field of cosmology that was until now confined to a single experiment, our Universe.

TI Transient Dynamics and Homogenization in Incoherent Collision Models
SO ENTROPY
AB Collision models have attracted significant attention in recent years due to their versatility to simulate open quantum systems in different dynamical regimes. They have been used to study various interesting phenomena such as the dynamical emergence of non-Markovian memory effects and the spontaneous establishment of synchronization in open quantum systems. In such models, the repeated pairwise interactions between the system and the environment and also the possible coupling between different environmental units are typically modeled using the coherent partial SWAP (PSWAP) operation as it is known to be a universal homogenizer. In this study, we investigate the dynamical behavior of incoherent collision models, where the interactions between different units are modeled by the incoherent controlled SWAP (CSWAP) operation, which is also a universal homogenizer. Even though the asymptotic dynamics of the open system in cases of both coherent and incoherent swap interactions appear to be identical, its transient dynamics turns out to be significantly different. Here, we present a comparative analysis of the consequences of having coherent or incoherent couplings in collision models, namely, PSWAP or CSWAP interactions, respectively, for the emergence of memory effects for a single-qubit system and for the onset synchronization between a pair of qubits, both of which are strictly determined by the transient dynamics of the open system.

TI Floquet exceptional contours in Lindblad dynamics with time-periodic
   drive and dissipation
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB The dynamics of an isolated quantum system is coherent and unitary. Weak coupling to the environment leads to decoherence, which is traditionally modeled with a Lindblad equation for the system's density matrix. Starting from a pure state, such a system approaches a steady state (mixed or otherwise) in an underdamped or overdamped manner. This transition occurs at an eigenvalue degeneracy of a Lindblad superoperator, called an exceptional point (EP), where corresponding eigenvectors coalesce. Recent years have seen an explosion of interest in creating exceptional points in a truly quantum domain, driven by the enhanced sensitivity and topological features EPs have shown in their classical realizations. Here, we present Floquet analysis of a prototypical qubit whose drive or dissipator strengths are varied periodically. We consider models with a single dissipator that generate global loss (phase damping) or mode-selective loss (spontaneous emission). In all cases, we find that periodic modulations lead to EP lines at small dissipator strengths and a rich EP structure in the parameter space. Our analytical and numerical results show that extending Lindblad Liouvillians to the Floquet domain is a potentially preferred route to accessing exceptional points in the transient dynamics towards the Lindblad steady state.

TI Magnetic flux noise in superconducting qubits and the gap states
   continuum
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB In the present study we investigate the selected local aspects of the metal-induced gap states (MIGSs) at the disordered metal-insulator interface, that were previously proposed to produce magnetic moments responsible for the magnetic flux noise in some of the superconducting qubit modalities. Our analysis attempts to supplement the available studies and provide new theoretical contribution toward their validation. In particular, we explicitly discuss the behavior of the MIGSs in the momentum space as a function of the onsite energy deviation, that mimics random potential disorder at the interface in the local approximation. It is found, that when the difference between the characteristic electronic potentials in the insulator increases, the corresponding MIGSs become more localized. This effect is associated with the increasing degree of the potential disorder that was earlier observed to produce highly localized MIGSs in the superconducting qubits. At the same time, the presented findings show that the disorder-induced localization of the MIGSs can be related directly to the decay characteristics of these states as well as to the bulk electronic properties of the insulator. As a result, our study reinforces plausibility of the previous corresponding investigations on the origin of the flux noise, but also allows to draw future directions toward their better verification.

TI Aluminium-induced modulation of reaction kinetics and polytype formation
   in silicon carbide synthesized through high-energy ball milling
SO MATERIALIA
AB Silicon carbide (SiC) is a versatile material employed in a broad range of applications, including abrasives, power electronics, and emerging quantum technologies. It is widely recognized as a high-performance technical ceramic, owing to its good thermal conductivity, high hardness, and chemical stability. Cost-effective strategies for synthesizing SiC with application-specific properties are thus highly desired, stimulating the development of numerous approaches to produce high-quality products. Direct synthesis of SiC from elemental silicon and carbon offers precise control over crystal size and phase purity at temperatures lower than those required for the reaction between SiO2 and carbon. Nonetheless, further reductions in reaction temperature are desired to enhance both cost- and energy efficiency. This study explores the combined effects of high-energy ball milling, combustion synthesis, and aluminium addition on the formation of SiC. Both the precursors and the resultant products were comprehensively characterized to elucidate the influence of these processing methods. The results indicate that aluminium, in the studied 0-20 mol% concentration range, reduces the reaction time and increases the prevalence of hexagonal inclusions. In contrast, wet high-energy ball milling demonstrates only a marginal mechanical activation effect, which contradicts the previous results of dry milling. Furthermore, the over- saturation threshold (5 mol% Al in SiC) critically impacts both the synthesis process and the resulting material properties, thereby demonstrating the importance of composition control during synthesis.

TI Weak ergodicity breaking in the Schwinger model
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB As a paradigm of weak ergodicity breaking in disorder-free nonintegrable models, quantum many-body scars (QMBS) can offer deep insights into the thermalization dynamics of gauge theories. Having been first discovered in a spin -21 quantum link formulation of the Schwinger model, it is a fundamental question as to whether QMBS persist for S > 12 since such theories converge to the lattice Schwinger model in the large -S limit, which is the appropriate version of lattice QED in one spatial dimension. In this work, we address this question by exploring QMBS in spin -S U(1) quantum link models (QLMs) with staggered fermions. We find that QMBS persist at S > 12, with the resonant scarring regime, which occurs for a zero-mass quench, arising from simple high-energy gauge-invariant initial product states. We furthermore find evidence of detuned scarring regimes, which occur for finite-mass quenches starting in the physical vacua and the charge-proliferated state. Our results conclusively show that QMBS exist in a wide class of lattice gauge theories in one spatial dimension represented by spin -S QLMs coupled to dynamical fermions, and our findings can be tested on near-term cold-atom quantum simulators of these models.

TI Ultrafast inverse design of quantum dot optical spectra via a joint
   TD-DFT learning scheme and deep reinforcement learning
SO AIP ADVANCES
AB Here, we report a case study on inverse design of quantum dot optical spectra using a deep reinforcement learning algorithm for the desired target optical property of semiconductor CdxSeyTex-y quantum dots. Machine learning models were trained to predict the optical absorption and emission spectra by using the training dataset by time dependent density functional theory simulation. We show that the trained deep deterministic policy gradient inverse design agent can infer the molecular structure with an accuracy of less than 1 angstrom at a fixed computational time of milliseconds and up to 100-1000 times faster than the conventional heuristic particle swam optimization method. Most of the effective inverse design problems based on the surrogate machine learning and reinforcement learning model have been focused on the field of nano-photonics. Few attempts have been made in the field of quantum optical system in a similar manner. For the first time, our results, to our knowledge, provide concrete evidence that for computationally challenging tasks, a well-trained deep reinforcement learning agent can replace the existing quantum simulation and heuristics optimization tool, enabling fast and scalable simulations of the optical property of nanometer sized semiconductor quantum dots.

TI Can Wigner distribution functions with collisions satisfy complete
   positivity and energy conservation?
SO JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL ELECTRONICS
AB To avoid the computational burden of many-body quantum simulation, the interaction of an electron with a photon (phonon) is typically accounted for by disregarding the explicit simulation of the photon (phonon) degree of freedom and just modeling its effect on the electron dynamics. For quantum models developed from the (reduced) density matrix or its Wigner-Weyl transformation, the modeling of collisions may violate complete positivity (precluding the typical probabilistic interpretation). In this paper, we show that such quantum transport models can also strongly violate the energy conservation in the electron-photon (electron-phonon) interactions. After comparing collisions models to exact results for an electron interacting with a photon, we conclude that there is no fundamental restriction that prevents a collision model developed within the (reduced) density matrix or Wigner formalisms to satisfy simultaneously complete positivity and energy conservation. However, at the practical level, the development of such satisfactory collision model seems very complicated. Collision models with an explicit knowledge of the microscopic state ascribed to each electron seems recommendable (Bohmian conditional wavefunction), since they allow to model collisions of each electron individually in a controlled way satisfying both complete positivity and energy conservation.

TI High-fidelity dimer excitations using quantum hardware
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB The quantum simulation of entangled spin systems can play a central role in quantum magnetic materials discovery. Additionally, the simulation of spectroscopic signatures, such as the dynamical structure factor accessed in inelastic neutron scattering (INS), necessitates a long timescale for circuit evolution. This is because the energy resolution is directly related to the time over which the circuit could be meaningfully evolved. However, canonical Trotterization requires deep circuits precluding such long-time evolution-even for a small number of qubits. Here we demonstrate "direct" resource efficient fast-forwarding (REFF) measurements with short-depth circuits that can be used to capture longer time dynamics of spin Hamiltonians. We showcase the results of the dynamics of a quantum spin dimer, the basic quantum unit of emergent many-body spin systems, whose density of states we simulate accurately. The long temporal evolution and measurement of the two-spin correlation functions enable the calculation of the dynamical structure factor S(Q = 0, w) measured in the neutron scattering cross-section. We exhibit the clarity of the triplet gap and the triplet splitting of the quantum dimer with class-leading fidelity that enables comparison to experimental neutron data. Our results on current circuit hardware outline an important workflow to predict and benchmark against the outputs of INS experiments of quantum magnets.

TI Heat transport in an optical lattice via Markovian feedback control
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB Ultracold atoms offer a unique opportunity to study many-body physics in a clean and well-controlled environment. However, the isolated nature of quantum gases makes it difficult to study transport properties of the system, which are among the key observables in condensed matter physics. In this work, we employ Markovian feedback control to synthesize two effective thermal baths that couple to the boundaries of a one-dimensional Bose-Hubbard chain. This allows for the realization of a heat-current-carrying state. We investigate the steady-state heat current, including its scaling with system size and its response to disorder. In order to study large systems, we use semi-classical Monte-Carlo simulation and kinetic theory. The numerical results from both approaches show, as expected, that for non- and weakly interacting systems with and without disorder one finds the same scaling of the heat current with respect to the system size as it is found for systems coupled to thermal baths. Finally, we propose and test a scheme for measuring the energy flow. Thus, we provide a route for the quantum simulation of heat-current-carrying steady states of matter in atomic quantum gases.

TI Ab Initio Derivation of Lattice-Gauge-Theory Dynamics for Cold Gases in
   Optical Lattices
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB We introduce a method for quantum simulation of U(1) lattice gauge theories coupled to matter, utiliz-ing alkaline-earth(-like) atoms in state-dependent optical lattices. The proposal enables the study of both gauge and fermionic matter fields without integrating out one of them in one and two dimensions. We focus on a realistic and robust implementation that utilizes the long-lived metastable clock state available in alkaline-earth(-like) atomic species. Starting from an ab initio modeling of the experimental setting, we systematically carry out a derivation of the target U(1) gauge theory. This approach allows us to identify and address conceptual and practical challenges for the implementation of lattice gauge theo-ries that-while pivotal for a successful implementation-have never been rigorously addressed in the literature: those include the specific engineering of lattice potentials to achieve the desired structure of Wannier functions and the subtleties involved in realizing the proper separation of energy scales to enable gauge-invariant dynamics. We discuss realistic experiments that can be carried out within such a platform using the fermionic isotope 173Yb, addressing via simulations all key sources of imperfections, and pro-vide concrete parameter estimates for relevant energy scales in both one-and two-dimensional settings.

TI Exponentially Reduced Circuit Depths Using Trotter Error Mitigation
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Product formulas are a popular class of digital quantum simulation algorithms due to their conceptual simplicity, low overhead, and performance, which often exceeds theoretical expectations. Recently, Richardson extrapolation and polynomial interpolation have been proposed to mitigate the Trotter error incurred by the use of these formulas. This work provides a rigorous, general analysis of these techniques for computing time-evolved observables, simplifying the interpolation algorithm in the process, and shows that extrapolation generically improves the performance of product formulas for this task. We demonstrate that, to achieve error E in a simulation of time T using a pth-order product formula with extrapolation, circuit depths of O(T1+1/p polylog(1/E)) are sufficient-an exponential improvement in the precision over product formulas alone. Furthermore, we prove that these algorithms achieve commutator scaling, and improve the T complexity for the interpolation algorithm. By relaxing the requirement of performing exact Chebyshev interpolation, our simplified algorithm eliminates the need for fractional implementations of Trotter steps, reducing computational overhead. Finally, we show these techniques can be combined with the classical shadows method to estimate many time-evolved local observables. Taken together, our findings provide the strongest evidence yet for the utility of Trotter error-mitigation techniques in algorithmic applications.

TI Solving inference problems of Bayesian networks by probabilistic
   computing
SO AIP ADVANCES
AB Recently, probabilistic computing approach has shown its broad application in problems ranging from combinatorial optimizations and machine learning to quantum simulation where a randomly fluctuating bit called p-bit constitutes a basic building block. This new type of computing scheme tackles domain-specific and computationally hard problems that can be efficiently solved using probabilistic algorithms compared to classical deterministic counterparts. Here, we apply the probabilistic computing scheme to various inference problems of Bayesian networks with non-linear synaptic connections without auxiliary p-bits. The results are supported by nanomagnet-based SPICE (Simulation Program with Integrated Circuit Emphasis) results, behavioral model, and hardware implementations using a fieldprogrammable gate array. Two types of Monte Carlo sampling methods are tested, namely rejection and importance samplings, where clamping of p-bits is applicable as in Boltzmann networks in the latter. Partial parallelism that can be used for the sequential update of each p-bit in Bayesian networks is presented. Finally, the model is directly applied to temporal Bayesian networks with relevant inference problems. We believe that the proposed approaches provide valuable tools and practical methods for various inference problems in Bayesian networks. (c) 2023 Author(s).

TI Non-Markovianity between Site Pairs in FMO Complex Using Discrete-Time
   Quantum Jump Model
SO ACS OMEGA
AB The Fenna-Mathews-Olson (FMO) complex present in green sulfur bacteria is known to mediate the transfer of excitation energy between light-harvesting chlorosomes and membrane-embedded bacterial reaction centers. Due to the high efficiency of this transport process, it is an extensively studied pigment-protein complex system with the eventual aim of modeling and engineering similar dynamics in other systems and using it for real-time application. Some studies have attributed the enhancement of transport efficiency to wavelike behavior and nonMarkovian quantum jumps resulting in long-lived and revival of quantum coherence, respectively. Since dynamics in these systems reside in the quantum-classical regime, quantum simulation of such dynamics will help in exploring the subtle role of quantum features in enhancing the transport efficiency, which has remained unsettled. Discrete simulation of the dynamics in the FMO complex can help in efficient engineering of the heat bath and controlling the environment with the system. In this work, using the discrete quantum jump model we show and quantify the presence of higher non-Markovian memory effects in specific site pairs when internal structures and environmental effects are in favor of faster transport. As a consequence, our study leans toward the connection between non-Markovianity in quantum jumps with the enhancement of transport efficiency.

TI Gill and Massar type bound for estimation of SU(2) channel
SO PHYSICA SCRIPTA
AB In the estimation for a parametric family of quantum state on a Hilbert space H , the Gill and Massar bound is known as a lower bound of weighted traces of covariances of unbiased estimators. The Gill and Massar bound is derived by considering the convexity of the set of classical Fisher information matrices, and the bound is locally achievable by using randomized strategies when H = C-2 . In this paper, we show that estimation for a parametric SU(2) unitary channel model has a similar convex structure as qubit state model, and a Gill and Massar type lower bound of weighted traces of covariances of unbiased estimators can be derived for any weight matrix. We show that the Gill and Massar type lower bound is achievable by using randomized strategies when certain conditions are satisfied. To derive a convex structure of the set of classical Fisher information matrices, we introduce a Fisher information matrix J((U)) for a SU(2) unitary channel model, and we show a upper bound of inverse J((U)) weighted trace of classical Fisher information matrix. The optimal randomized strategy we construct in this paper does not require ancilla systems in many cases.

TI The potentials of boron-doped (nitrogen deficient) and nitrogen-doped
   (boron deficient) BNNT photocatalysts for decontamination of pollutants
   from water bodies
SO RSC ADVANCES
AB This work investigates the structural, elastic, electronic, and photoabsorption properties of boron- (N-deficient) and nitrogen- (B-deficient) doped single-walled boron nitride nanotube (SWBNNT) for photocatalytic applications for the first time. All calculations of the optimized systems were performed with DFT quantum simulation codes. The results of the structural analysis showed that SWBNNT is stable to both B and N dopants. It was also observed that the photodecomposition activity of the B-doped nanotube improved significantly under the condition of slight compressive stress, while it decreased for the N-doped nanotube. Therefore, N-doped SWBNNT showed poor performance under external pressure. Both B and N-doped systems could narrow the wide band gap of SWBNNT to the photocatalytic region below 3 eV, therefore this material can be used as photocatalysts in water splitting for hydrogen evolution, dye degradation, wastewater treatment, etc. Analysis of the optical properties revealed that B-doped SWBNNT absorbs more photons in the visible range than the N-doped SWBNNT and can therefore be considered as a more efficient photocatalyst. In addition, it was found that all doped nanotubes are anisotropic since the absorption in one direction of nanotube axes is worse than the other.

TI Connecting steady-states of driven-dissipative photonic lattices with
   spontaneous collective emission phenomena
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB Recent experimental advances enable the fabrication of photonic lattices in which the light propagates with engineered energy dispersions. When interfaced with quantum emitters, such systems yield strong collective spontaneous emission phenomena, such as perfect sub-radiance, in which the decay into the bath is completely suppressed, forming bound-states-in-the-continuum (BIC). Since such photonic lattices are generally lossy, an alternative way of probing them consists in coherently driving them to an steady-state from which photoluminescence can be extracted. Here, we formalize connections between these two seemingly different situations and use that intuition to predict the formation of non-trivial photonic steady-states in one and two dimensions. In particular, we show that subradiant emitter configurations are linked to the emergence of steady-state light-localization in the driven-dissipative setting, in which the light features the same form than the spontaneously formed BIC. Besides, we also find configurations which leads to the opposite behaviour, an anti-localization of light, that is, it distributes over all the system except for the region defined between the driving lasers. These results shed light on the recently reported optically-defined cavities in polaritonic lattices, and can guide further experimental studies.

TI Realizing topological edge states with Rydberg-atom synthetic dimensions
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Synthetic dimensions, states of a system engineered to act as if they were a reconfigurable extra spatial dimension, have been demonstrated with different systems previously. Here the authors create a synthetic dimension using Rydberg atoms and configure it to support topological edge states.
   A discrete degree of freedom can be engineered to match the Hamiltonian of particles moving in a real-space lattice potential. Such synthetic dimensions are powerful tools for quantum simulation because of the control they offer and the ability to create configurations difficult to access in real space. Here, in an ultracold Sr-84 atom, we demonstrate a synthetic-dimension based on Rydberg levels coupled with millimeter waves. Tunneling amplitudes between synthetic lattice sites and on-site potentials are set by the millimeter-wave amplitudes and detunings respectively. Alternating weak and strong tunneling in a one-dimensional configuration realizes the single-particle Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) Hamiltonian, a paradigmatic model of topological matter. Band structure is probed through optical excitation from the ground state to Rydberg levels, revealing symmetry-protected topological edge states at zero energy. Edge-state energies are robust to perturbations of tunneling-rates that preserve chiral symmetry, but can be shifted by the introduction of on-site potentials.

TI Few-body Bose gases in low dimensions-A laboratory for quantum dynamics
SO PHYSICS REPORTS-REVIEW SECTION OF PHYSICS LETTERS
AB Cold atomic gases have become a paradigmatic system for exploring fundamental physics, which at the same time allows for applications in quantum technologies. The accelerating developments in the field have led to a highly advanced set of engineering techniques that, for example, can tune interactions, shape the external geometry, select among a large set of atomic species with different properties, or control the number of atoms. In particular, it is possible to operate in lower dimensions and drive atomic systems into the strongly correlated regime. In this review, we discuss recent advances in few-body cold atom systems confined in low dimensions from a theoretical viewpoint. We mainly focus on bosonic systems in one dimension and provide an introduction to the static properties before we review the state-of-the-art research into quantum dynamical processes stimulated by the presence of correlations. Besides discussing the fundamental physical phenomena arising in these systems, we also provide an overview of the calculational and numerical tools and methods that are commonly used, thus delivering a balanced and comprehensive overview of the field. We conclude by giving an outlook on possible future directions that are interesting to explore in these correlated systems. (c) 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Anyonization of Bosons in One Dimension: An Effective Swap Model
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Anyons emerge as elementary excitations in low-dimensional quantum systems and exhibit behavior distinct from bosons or fermions. In one dimension, anyons can arise from unconventional scattering processes or density-dependent hopping on a lattice. Here, we introduce a novel framework for realizing anyonic correlations using the internal degrees of freedom of a spinor quantum gas. We propose a "swap" model, which assigns a complex phase factor to the swapping processes between two different species, referred to as "host particles" and "impurities." The anyonic characteristics are demonstrated through the one-body correlator of the impurity, using a spin-charge separation analysis. The impurity plays the role of both creating and directly probing the anyonic correlations in a quantum many-body system, which are not accessible in the conventional anyon-Hubbard model. For a single impurity, our framework can be effectively implemented by applying tilt potentials in a strongly interacting quantum gas [Dhar et al., Observing anyonization of bosons in a quantum gas, Nature (London) 642, 53 (2025).]. We further explore the dynamical properties of anyonic correlations and extend our analysis to the case of multiple impurities. Our Letter provides new avenues for engineering many-body anyonic behavior in quantum simulation platforms.

TI SiV0 centres in diamond: effect of isotopic substitution in
   carbon and silicon
SO PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY A-MATHEMATICAL PHYSICAL
   AND ENGINEERING SCIENCES
AB The neutrally charged silicon-vacancy defect (SiV0) is a colour centre in diamond with spin S = 1, a zero-phonon line (ZPL) at 946 nm and long spin coherence, which makes it a promising candidate for quantum network applications. For the proper performance of such colour centres, all of them must have identical optical characteristics. However, in practice, there are factors that influence each individual centre. One of these factors is non-uniform isotope composition for both carbon atoms in diamond lattice and silicon atoms of dopant. In this work, we studied the isotopic shifts of SiV0 centres for CVD-grown epitaxial layers of isotopically enriched C-12 and C-13 diamonds, as well as for diamond with natural isotope composition but doped only with one isotope of Si (Si-28, Si-29 and Si-30). The detected shift was 1.60 meV for C-12/C-13 couple and 0.33 meV for Si-28/Si-29 and Si-29/Si-30 couples, which are close to the previously obtained values of the isotopic shift for the negatively charged silicon vacancy (SiV-), which indicates a similar model of interaction with the environment for these two charge states of the SiV colour centres.

AB We herein investigate the heterobimetallic lantern complexes [PtVO(SOCR)4] as charge neutral electronic qubits based on vanadyl complexes (S = 1/2) with nuclear spin-free donor atoms. The derivatives with R = Me (1) and Ph (2) give highly resolved X-band EPR spectra in frozen CH2Cl2/toluene solution, which evidence the usual hyperfine coupling with the 51V nucleus (I = 7/2) and an additional superhyperfine interaction with the I = 1/2 nucleus of the 195Pt isotope (natural abundance ca. 34%). DFT calculations ascribe the spin density delocalization on the Pt2+ ion to a combination of pi and delta pathways, with the former representing the predominant channel. Spin relaxation measurements in frozen CD2Cl2/toluene-d8 solution between 90 and 10 K yield Tm values (1-6 mu s in 1 and 2-11 mu s in 2) which compare favorably with those of known vanadyl-based qubits in similar matrices. Coherent spin manipulations indeed prove possible at 70 K, as shown by the observation of Rabi oscillations in nutation experiments. The results indicate that the heavy Group 10 metal ion is not detrimental to the coherence properties of the vanadyl moiety and that Pt-VO lanterns can be used as robust spin-coherent building blocks in materials science and quantum technologies.
   Lantern complexes containing VO2+ and Pt2+ ions show electron spin coherence with phase memory times above 10 mu s at 10 K. EPR spectra prove the delocalization of the unpaired spin density to the heavy metal ion through both pi and delta coupling channels.

TI Precision measurement of lifetime and branching ratios of the
   4 f135d6s1[5/2]5/2 state in Yb+ ions
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB We report spectroscopic and time-resolved experimental observations to characterize the [Xe]4f13(2Fo5/2)5d6s(1D)1[5/2]o5/2 state in 172Yb+ions. We access this state from the metastable 4 f 145d(2D3/2,5/2) manifold and observe an unexpectedly long lifetime of tau = 37.9(9) mu s that allows visible Rabi oscillations and resolved-sideband spectroscopy. Using a combination of coherent population dynamics, high-fidelity detection and heralded state preparation, and optical pumping methods, we measure the branching ratios to the 2D3/2, 2D5/2, and 2S1/2 states to be 0.359(2), 0.639(2), and 0.0023(16), respectively. The branching ratio to the 4 f 136s2(2F7/2) is compatible with zero within our experimental resolution. We also report measurements of Land & eacute; g-factor of the 1[5/2]o5/2 state. Further, the branching ratio of the 2D5/2 to 2S1/2 decay in 172Yb+ was measured to be 0.188(3), improving its relative uncertainty by an order of magnitude. Our measurements provide experimental benchmarks for better understanding the atomic structure of Yb+ ions, which still lacks accurate numerical descriptions, and the use of high-lying excited states for partial detection and qubit manipulation in the omg architecture.

TI Mitigating the information degradation in a massive Unruh-DeWitt theory
SO JOURNAL OF HIGH ENERGY PHYSICS
AB We investigated the influence of the massive scalar field on the information degradation concerning the Unruh-DeWitt (UDW) detectors. In this conjecture, we adopted a system with a finite and large interaction time. To accomplish our purpose, one examines the quantum coherence of a uniformly accelerated qubit and the probability of finding the detector in the ground state. In this framework, we consider a quantum interferometric circuit to obtain the probability, visibility, and coherence. Naturally, these measurements provide us with wave-like information. Besides, one modifies the circuit to describe the path distinguishability and the particle-like information. These results are promising, as they allow us to understand the influence of the Unruh effect on the wave-particle duality. Thus, our findings announce that the increase in the scalar field mass induces a decrease in information degradation. Finally, we noted that the information concerning the Unruh effect remains preserved when m >= Omega. Therefore, the detector cannot absorb particles with mass equal to or greater than its energy gap. These results indicate that the scalar field mass is a protective factor against information degradation for systems under high acceleration conditions.

TI Implementing a Hybrid Quantum Neural Network for Wind Speed Forecasting:
   Insights from Quantum Simulator Experiences
SO ENERGIES
AB The intermittent nature of wind speed poses challenges for its widespread utilization as an electrical power generation source. As the integration of wind energy into the power system increases, accurate wind speed forecasting becomes crucial. The reliable scheduling of wind power generation heavily relies on precise wind speed forecasts. This paper presents an extended work that focuses on a hybrid model for 24 h ahead wind speed forecasting. The proposed model combines residual Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and a quantum neural network that is studied by a quantum simulator, leveraging the support of NVIDIA Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA). To ensure the desired accuracy, a comparative analysis is conducted, examining the qubit count and quantum circuit depth of the proposed model. The execution time required for the model is significantly reduced when the GPU incorporates CUDA, accounting for only 8.29% of the time required by a classical CPU. In addition, different quantum embedding layers with various entangler layers in the quantum neural network are explored. The simulation results utilizing an offshore wind farm dataset demonstrate that the proper number of qubits and embedding layer can achieve favorable 24 h ahead wind speed forecasts.

TI Diamond Color Center Based Quantum Metrology in Industries for Energy
   Applications
SO ACS OMEGA
AB Atomic scale defects in diamond are emerging as next-generation quantum sensors. One such defect is the nitrogen vacancy (NV) center which possesses artificial atom-like properties making it a strong contender for a room temperature solid state qubit. These spin defects are optically addressable by studying their optically detected magnetic resonance spectra (ODMR). The spin states can be initialized, controlled, and read out by a shining laser. The photoluminescence spectra contain information on the external magnetic field, electric field, temperature, etc. Thus, this type of multimodal sensor is exigent in various fields of research viz. chemistry, materials science, biology, and fundamental physics. In today's world where energy-related products are booming, deployment of quantum sensors can expedite the development. Based on existing works, this paper makes an attempt to identify the applications of color centers in diamond for energy sectors. We have highlighted the efficacy of quantum diamond sensors in the oil and gas industry, battery research, and photovoltaics. In addition, a summary of the structural and quantum properties of defects in diamond, synthesis of diamond, protocols for optical detection of spin states, different types of color centers, etc., is presented.

TI Beating one bit of communication with and without quantum
   pseudo-telepathy
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB According to Bell's theorem, certain entangled states cannot be simulated classically using local hidden variables (LHV). Suppose that we can augment LHV by some amount of classical communication. The question then arises as to how many bits are needed to simulate entangled states? There is very strong evidence that a single bit of communication is powerful enough to simulate projective measurements on any two-qubit entangled state. However, the problem of simulating measurements on higher-dimensional systems remains largely unexplored. In this study, we present Bell-like scenarios, even with three inputs per party, in which bipartite correlations resulting from measurements on higher-dimensional states cannot be simulated with a single bit of communication. We consider the case where the communication direction is fixed and the case where it is bidirectional. To this end, we introduce constructions based on parallel repetition of pseudo-telepathy games and an original algorithm based on branch-and-bound technique to compute the one-bit classical bound. Two copies of emblematic Bell expressions, such as the Magic square pseudo-telepathy game, prove to be particularly powerful, requiring a 16 x 16 state to beat the bidirectional one-bit classical bound, and look a promising candidate for implementation on an optical platform.

TI CMOS plus stochastic nanomagnets enabling heterogeneous computers for
   probabilistic inference and learning
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Extending Moore's law by augmenting complementary-metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) transistors with emerging nanotechnologies (X) has become increasingly important. One important class of problems involve sampling-based Monte Carlo algorithms used in probabilistic machine learning, optimization, and quantum simulation. Here, we combine stochastic magnetic tunnel junction (sMTJ)-based probabilistic bits (p-bits) with Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA) to create an energy-efficient CMOS + X (X = sMTJ) prototype. This setup shows how asynchronously driven CMOS circuits controlled by sMTJs can perform probabilistic inference and learning by leveraging the algorithmic update-order-invariance of Gibbs sampling. We show how the stochasticity of sMTJs can augment low-quality random number generators (RNG). Detailed transistor-level comparisons reveal that sMTJ-based p-bits can replace up to 10,000 CMOS transistors while dissipating two orders of magnitude less energy. Integrated versions of our approach can advance probabilistic computing involving deep Boltzmann machines and other energy-based learning algorithms with extremely high throughput and energy efficiency.
   Designing energy-efficient and scalable hardware capable of accelerating Monte Carlo algorithms is highly desirable for probabilistic computing. Here, Singh et al. combine stochastic magnetic tunnel junction-based probabilistic bits with versatile field programmable gate arrays to achieve this goa

TI Replacing Neural Networks by Optimal Analytical Predictors for the
   Detection of Phase Transitions
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW X
AB Identifying phase transitions and classifying phases of matter is central to understanding the properties and behavior of a broad range of material systems. In recent years, machine-learning (ML) techniques have been successfully applied to perform such tasks in a data-driven manner. However, the success of this approach notwithstanding, we still lack a clear understanding of ML methods for detecting phase transitions, particularly of those that utilize neural networks (NNs). In this work, we derive analytical expressions for the optimal output of three widely used NN-based methods for detecting phase transitions. These optimal predictions correspond to the results obtained in the limit of high model capacity. Therefore, in practice, they can, for example, be recovered using sufficiently large, well-trained NNs. The inner workings of the considered methods are revealed through the explicit dependence of the optimal output on the input data. By evaluating the analytical expressions, we can identify phase transitions directly from experimentally accessible data without training NNs, which makes this procedure favorable in terms of computation time. Our theoretical results are supported by extensive numerical simulations covering, e.g., topological, quantum, and many-body localization phase transitions. We expect similar analyses to provide a deeper understanding of other classification tasks in condensed matter physics.

TI Universality of Dicke superradiance in arrays of quantum emitters
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Dicke superradiance is an example of emergence of macroscopic quantum coherence via correlated dissipation. Starting from an initially incoherent state, a collection of excited atoms synchronizes as they decay, generating a macroscopic dipole moment and emitting a short and intense pulse of light. While well understood in cavities, superradiance remains an open problem in extended systems due to the exponential growth of complexity with atom number. Here we show that Dicke superradiance is a universal phenomenon in ordered arrays. We present a theoretical framework - which circumvents the exponential complexity of the problem - that allows us to predict the critical distance beyond which Dicke superradiance disappears. This critical distance is highly dependent on the dimensionality and atom number. Our predictions can be tested in state of the art experiments with arrays of neutral atoms, molecules, and solid-state emitters and pave the way towards understanding the role of many-body decay in quantum simulation, metrology, and lasing.
   Dicke superradiance is an important collective quantum phenomenon, but its analysis is hindered by the exponential growth of the state space with atom number. Here, the authors develop a theoretical framework that overcomes this, and predict a critical distance below which superradiant decay can be observed in large ordered arrays.

TI Photoluminescence spectra of point defects in semiconductors: Validation
   of first-principles calculations
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW MATERIALS
AB Optically and magnetically active point defects in semiconductors are interesting platforms for the development of solid state quantum technologies. Their optical properties are usually probed by measuring photoluminescence spectra, which provide information on excitation energies and on the interaction of electrons with lattice vibrations. We present a combined computational and experimental study of photoluminescence spectra of defects in diamond and SiC, aimed at assessing the validity of theoretical and numerical approximations used in first-principles calculations, including the use of the Franck-Condon principle and the displaced harmonic oscillator approximation. We focus on prototypical examples of solid state qubits, the divacancy centers in SiC and the nitrogen-vacancy in diamond, and we report computed photoluminescence spectra as a function of temperature that are in very good agreement with the measured ones. As expected we find that the use of hybrid functionals leads to more accurate results than semilocal functionals. Interestingly our calculations show that constrained density functional theory (CDFT) and time-dependent hybrid DFT perform equally well in describing the excited state potential energy surface of triplet states; our findings indicate that CDFT, a relatively cheap computational approach, is sufficiently accurate for the calculations of photoluminescence spectra of the defects studied here. Finally, we find that only by correcting for finite-size effects and extrapolating to the dilute limit can one obtain a good agreement between theory and experiment. Our results provide a detailed validation protocol of first-principles calculations of photoluminescence spectra, necessary both for the interpretation of experiments and for robust predictions of the electronic properties of point defects in semiconductors.

TI Quantum mechanical lateral force on an atom due to matter wave
SO HELIYON
AB The area of trapping the atoms or molecules using light has advanced tremendously in the last few decades. In contrast, the idea of controlling (not only trapping) the movement of atomic-sized particles using matter waves is a completely new emerging area of particle manipulation. Though a single previous report has suggested the pulling of atoms based on matter-wave tractor beams, an attempt is yet to be made to produce a lateral force using this technique. This article demonstrates an asymmetric setup that engenders reversible lateral force on an atom due to the interaction energy of the matter wave in the presence of a metal surface. Several full-wave simulations and analytical calculations were performed on a particular set-up of Xenon scatterers placed near a Copper surface, with two counter-propagating plane matter waves of Helium impinging in the direction parallel to the surface. By solving the time-independent Schro center dot dinger equation and using the solution, quantum mechanical stress tensor formalism is applied to compute the force acting on the particle. The simulation results are in excellent agreement with the analytical calculations. The results for the adsorbed scatterer case find this technique to be an efficient cleaning procedure similar to electron-stimulated desorption for futuristic applications.

TI Probing Planck scale effects on absolute mass limit in neutrino flavor
   evolution
SO NUCLEAR PHYSICS B
AB This work explores how the generalized uncertainty principle, a theoretical modification of the Heisenberg uncertainty principle inspired by quantum gravity, affects neutrino flavor oscillations. By extending the standard two-flavor neutrino model, we show that the oscillation probability acquires an additional phase term that depends on the square roots of the individual neutrino masses, introducing new features beyond the conventional mass-squared differences. To account for the non-Hermitian nature of the resulting dynamics, we employ parity-time (PT) symmetric quantum mechanics, which allows for consistent descriptions of systems with balanced gain and loss mechanisms. We analyze the feasibility of observing these effects in current and future neutrino experiments, such as DUNE, JUNO, IceCube, ORCA-KM3NeT, MINOS, Daya Bay, Hyper-Kamiokande, and KATRIN, and find that the predicted modifications could fall within the sensitivity of current experiments. Moreover, we propose that analog quantum simulation platforms, such as cold atoms, trapped ions, and photonic systems, offer a promising route to test these predictions under controlled conditions. Our findings suggest that neutrino oscillations may serve as an effective probe of quantum gravity effects, providing a novel connection between fundamental theory and experimental observables.

TI Disorder-Free Localization in an Interacting 2D Lattice Gauge Theory
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Disorder-free localization has been recently introduced as a mechanism for ergodicity breaking in low-dimensional homogeneous lattice gauge theories caused by local constraints imposed by gauge invariance. We show that also genuinely interacting systems in two spatial dimensions can become nonergodic as a consequence of this mechanism. This result is all the more surprising since the conventional many-body localization is conjectured to be unstable in two dimensions; hence the gauge invariance represents an alternative robust localization mechanism surviving in higher dimensions in the presence of interactions. Specifically, we demonstrate nonergodic behavior in the quantum link model by obtaining a bound on the localization-delocalization transition through a classical correlated percolation problem implying a fragmentation of Hilbert space on the nonergodic side of the transition. We study the quantum dynamics in this system by introducing the method of "variational classical networks," an efficient and perturbatively controlled representation of the wave function in terms of a network of classical spins akin to artificial neural networks. We identify a distinguishing dynamical signature by studying the propagation of line defects, yielding different light cone structures in the localized and ergodic phases, respectively. The methods we introduce in this work can be applied to any lattice gauge theory with finite-dimensional local Hilbert spaces irrespective of spatial dimensionality.

AB The misfit dislocation formation related to plastic strain relaxation in Si or Ge quantum well layers in SiGe heterostructures for spin qubits tends to negatively affect the qubit behaviors. Therefore, it is essential to understand and then suppress the misfit dislocation formation in the quantum well layers in order to achieve high-performance qubits. In this work, we studied the misfit dislocation propagation kinetics and interactions by annealing the strained Si or Ge layers grown by molecular beam epitaxy. The annealing temperatures are from 500 to 600 degrees C for Si layers and from 300 to 400 degrees C for Ge layers. The misfit dislocations were investigated by electron channeling contrast imaging. Our results show that the misfit dislocation propagation is a thermally activated process. Alongside, the blocking and unblocking interactions during misfit dislocations were also observed. The blocking interactions will reduce the strain relaxation according to theoretical calculation. These observations imply that it is possible to suppress the misfit dislocation formation kinetically by reducing the temperatures during the SiGe heterostructure epitaxy and post-epitaxy processes for developing well-functional SiGe-based spin qubits.

TI Pruning a restricted Boltzmann machine for quantum state reconstruction
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB Restricted Boltzmann machines (RBMs) have proven to be a powerful tool for learning quantum wavefunction representations from qubit projective measurement data. Since the number of classical parameters needed to encode a quantum wave function scales rapidly with the number of qubits, the ability to learn efficient representations is of critical importance. In this paper, we study magnitude-based pruning as a way to compress the wave-function representation in an RBM, focusing on RBMs trained on data from the transverse-field Ising model in one dimension. We find that pruning can reduce the total number of RBM weights, but the threshold at which the reconstruction accuracy starts to degrade varies significantly depending on the phase of the model. In a gapped region of the phase diagram, the RBM admits pruning over half of the weights while still accurately reproducing relevant physical observables. At the quantum critical point, however, even a small amount of pruning can lead to significant loss of accuracy in the physical properties of the reconstructed quantum state. Our results highlight the importance of tracking all relevant observables as their sensitivity varies strongly with pruning. Finally, we find that sparse RBMs are trainable, and we discuss how a successful sparsity pattern can be created without pruning.

TI Dual-unitary shadow tomography
SO QUANTUM
AB We introduce "dual-unitary shadow tomography" (DUST), a classical shadow tomography protocol based on dual-unitary brick-wall circuits. To quantify the performance of DUST, we study operator spreading and Pauli weight dynamics in one-dimensional qubit systems, evolved by random two-local dual-unitary gates arranged in a brick-wall structure, ending with a measurement layer. We do this by deriving general constraints on the Pauli weight transfer matrix and specializing to the case of dual-unitarity. Remarkably, we find that operator spreading in these circuits have a rich structure resembling that of relativistic quantum field theories, with massless chiral excitations that can decay or fuse into each other, which we call left-or right-movers. We develop a mean-field description of the Pauli weight in terms of rho(x, t), which represents the probability of having nontrivial support at site x and depth t starting from a fixed weight distribution. We develop an equation of state for rho(x, t) and simulate it numerically using Monte Carlo simulations. For the task of predicting operators with (nearly) full support, we show that DUST outperforms brick-wall Clifford shadows of equal depth. This advantage is further pronounced for small system sizes and our results are generally robust to finite-size effects.

TI Experimental display of generalized wave-particle duality
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB The quantification of wave-particle duality (WPD) by means of measurable features associated to it, such as fringe visibility (N) and path distinguishability (D), led to the establishment of the constraint N2 + D2 <= 1. The two involved quantities refer to so-called "quantons ", physical objects that are capable of generating an interferometric pattern, while being at least partially localizable. Any quanton's internal degree of freedom (DOF) can in principle be used as a path-marker. When the quanton and its internal DOF are simultaneously engaged, new constraints can be derived and experimentally tested. Generalized constraints show how N and D relate to other quantifiers and bring to light coherences that might remain otherwise hidden in both quantum and classical light. We submitted two-qubit constraints to experimental tests, using optical light beams. This shows that, despite the rather contrived nature of the constraints, linear optics setups are appropriate to test them. Our experimental results are in very good agreement with theoretical predictions related to the tested constraints. Our results also show that quantifiers such as N and D help not only to quantify, but also to generalize the concept of WPD.(c) 2022 Optica Publishing Group under the terms of the Optica Open Access Publishing Agreement

TI Degeneracy and Its Impact on the Decoding of Sparse Quantum Codes
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB The well-documented capacity-approaching performance of sparse codes in the realm of classical communications has inspired the search for their quantum counterparts. Sparse quantum codes are generally built as the amalgamation of two robust classical codes and are decoded via classical decoding algorithms. However, the quantum paradigm presents phenomena that act in a deleterious manner on sparse quantum codes when they are decoded based on classical methodologies. One such phenomenon is known as degeneracy, and it is a major contributor to why sparse quantum codes do not entirely evoke the stupendous error correcting abilities of their classical counterparts. In this paper, we adopt a group theoretical approach to discuss the issue of degeneracy as it relates to sparse quantum codes. Furthermore, we compare the decoding process of sparse quantum codes with that of sparse classical codes, illustrating the challenges that appear in the quantum domain. Finally, we provide a detailed example to illustrate the effects of degeneracy on sparse quantum codes and the challenges of designing an optimum decoder for these schemes.

TI Phase diagram and quench dynamics of a periodically driven Haldane model
SO CHINESE PHYSICS B
AB We investigate a periodically driven Haldane model subjected to a two-stage driving scheme in the form of a step function. By using the Floquet theory, we obtain the topological phase diagram of the system. We also find that anomalous Floquet topological phases exist in the system. Focusing on examining the quench dynamics among topological phases, we analyze the site distribution of the 0-mode and pi-mode edge states in long-period evolution after a quench. The results demonstrate that, under certain conditions, the site distribution of the 0-mode can be confined at the edge even in long-period evolution. Additionally, both the 0-mode and pi-mode can recover and become confined at the edge in long-period evolution when the post-quench parameters (T,M2M1) in the phase diagram cross away from the phase boundary M2M1=63t2M1-1 . Furthermore, we conclude that whether the edge state is confined at the edge in the long-period evolution after a quench depends on the similarity of the edge states before and after the quench. Our findings reveal some new characteristics of quench dynamics in a periodically driven system.

TI Comparative evaluation of different molecular methods for DNA extraction
   from individual Teladorsagia circumcincta nematodes
SO BMC BIOTECHNOLOGY
AB Background The purpose of this study was to develop a reliable DNA extraction protocol to use on individual Teladorsagia circumcincta nematode specimens to produce high quality DNA for genome sequencing and phylogenetic analysis. Pooled samples have been critical in providing the groundwork for T. circumcincta genome construction, but there is currently no standard method for extracting high-quality DNA from individual nematodes. 11 extraction kits were compared based on DNA quality, yield, and processing time. Results 11 extraction protocols were compared, and the concentration and purity of the extracted DNA was quantified. Median DNA concentration among all methods measured on NanoDrop 2000 (TM) ranged between 0.45-11.5 ng/mu L, and on Qubit (TM) ranged between undetectable - 0.962 ng/mu L. Median A260/280 ranged between 0.505-3.925, and median A260/230 ranged - 0.005 - 1.545. Larval exsheathment to remove the nematode cuticle negatively impacted DNA concentration and purity. Conclusions A Schistosoma sp. DNA extraction method was determined as most suitable for individual T. circumcincta nematode specimens due to its resulting DNA concentration, purity, and relatively fast processing time.

TI Observation of Bloch oscillations and Wannier-Stark localization on a
   superconducting quantum processor
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB The Bloch oscillation (BO) and Wannier-Stark localization (WSL) are fundamental concepts about metal-insulator transitions in condensed matter physics. These phenomena have also been observed in semiconductor superlattices and simulated in platforms such as photonic waveguide arrays and cold atoms. Here, we report experimental investigation of BOs and WSL simulated with a 5-qubit programmable superconducting processor, of which the effective Hamiltonian is an isotropic XY spin chain. When applying a linear potential to the system by properly tuning all individual qubits, we observe that the propagation of a single spin on the chain is suppressed. It tends to oscillate near the neighborhood of their initial positions, which demonstrates the characteristics of BOs and WSL. We verify that the WSL length is inversely correlated to the potential gradient. Benefiting from the precise single-shot simultaneous readout of all qubits in our experiments, we can also investigate the thermal transport, which requires the joint measurement of more than one qubits. The experimental results show that, as an essential characteristic for BOs and WSL, the thermal transport is also blocked under a linear potential. Our experiment would be scalable to more superconducting qubits for simulating various of out-of-equilibrium problems in quantum many-body systems.

TI Reducing the number of qubits in quantum simulations of one dimensional
   many-body Hamiltonians
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB We investigate the Ising and Heisenberg models using the block renormalization group method (BRGM), focusing on its behavior across different system sizes. The BRGM reduces the number of spins by a factor of 1/2 (1/3) for the Ising (Heisenberg) model, effectively preserving essential physical features of the model while using only a fraction of the spins. Through a comparative analysis, we demonstrate that as the system size increases, there is an exponential convergence between results obtained from the original and renormalized Ising Hamiltonians, provided the coupling constants are redefined accordingly. Remarkably, for a spin chain with 24 spins, all physical features, including magnetization, correlation function, and entanglement entropy, exhibit an exact correspondence with the results from the original Hamiltonian. The study of the Heisenberg model also shows this tendency, although complete convergence may appear for a size much larger than 24 spins, and is therefore beyond our computational capabilities. The success of BRGM in accurately characterizing the Ising model, even with a relatively small number of spins, underscores its robustness and utility in studying complex physical systems, and facilitates its simulation on current NISQ computers, where the available number of qubits is largely constrained.

TI Memristor-Based Cryogenic Programmable DC Sources for Scalable In Situ
   Quantum-Dot Control
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ELECTRON DEVICES
AB Current quantum systems based on spin qubits are controlled by classical electronics located out-side the cryostat. This approach creates a major wiring bottleneck, which is one of the main roadblocks toward scalable quantum computers. Thus, we propose a scalable memristor-based programmable dc source that can per-form biasing of quantum dots (QDs) inside the cryostat. This novel cryogenic approach would enable to control the applied voltage on the electrostatic gates by programming the resistance of the memristors, thus storing in the latter the appropriate conditions to form the QDs. In this study, we first demonstrate multilevel resistance programming of TiO2 memristors at 4.2 K, an essential feature to achieve voltage tunability of the memristor-based dc source. We then report hardware-based simulations of the electrical performance of the proposed dc source. A cryogenic TiO2 memristor model fit on our experimen-tal data at 4.2 K was used to show a 1 V voltage range and 100 mu V resolution in situ memristor-based dc source. Finally, we simulate the biasing of double QDs (DQDs), enabling 120 s stability diagrams. This demonstration is a first step toward advanced cryogenic applications for resistive memories, such as cryogenic control electronics for quantum computers.

TI From Quantum Rabi Model To Jaynes-Cummings Model: Symmetry-Breaking
   Quantum Phase Transitions, Symmetry-Protected Topological Transitions
   and Multicriticality
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB The ground state and excitation gap are studied for the anisotropic quantum Rabi model (QRM) which connects the fundamental QRM and the Jaynes-Cummings model (JCM). While conventionally the ground state has a second-order quantum phase transition in the low frequency limit, turning on finite frequencies sheds a novel light on the phase diagram to illuminate a fine structure of first-order transition series. It is found that the conventional quantum phase transition is accompanied with a hidden symmetry breaking, whereas the emerging series transitions are topological transitions without symmetry breaking. The topological structure of the wave function provides a novel universality classification in bridging the QRM and the JCM among the diversity that arises from finite frequencies. The aspect of topological transitions provides a renewed insight for the role of the counter-rotating interaction. Moreover, it is shown that the conventionally established tricritical point is actually a pentacritical or hexacritical point and following this multicritical point emerges a series of quadruple points. Besides the emerging multicriticality and reformed universality, the result demonstrates that a single-qubit system can even exhibit analogs of topological phase transitions which traditionally occur in condensed matter.

TI Efficient single-photon pair generation by spontaneous parametric
   down-conversion in nonlinear plasmonic metasurfaces
SO NANOSCALE
AB Spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) is one of the most versatile nonlinear optical techniques for the generation of entangled and correlated single-photon pairs. However, it suffers from very poor efficiency leading to extremely weak photon generation rates. Here we propose a plasmonic metasurface design based on silver nanostripes combined with a bulk lithium niobate (LiNbO3) crystal to realize a new scalable, ultrathin, and efficient SPDC source. By coinciding fundamental and higher order resonances of the metasurface with the generated signal and idler frequencies, respectively, the electric field in the nonlinear media is significantly boosted. This leads to a substantial enhancement in the SPDC process which, subsequently, by using the quantum-classical correspondence principle, translates to very high photon-pair generation rates. The emitted radiation is highly directional and perpendicular to the metasurface in contrast to relevant dielectric structures. The incorporation of circular polarized excitation further increases the photon-pair generation efficiency. The presented work will lead to the design of new efficient ultrathin SPDC single-photon nanophotonic sources working at room temperature that are expected to be critical components in free-space quantum optical communications. In a more general context, our findings can have various applications in the emerging field of quantum plasmonics.

TI DNA Gene's Basic Structure as a Nonperturbative Circuit Quantum
   Electrodynamics: Is RNA Polymerase II the Quantum Bus of Transcription?
SO CURRENT ISSUES IN MOLECULAR BIOLOGY
AB Previously, we described that Adenine, Thymine, Cytosine, and Guanine nucleobases were superconductors in a quantum superposition of phases on each side of the central hydrogen bond acting as a Josephson Junction. Genomic DNA has two strands wrapped helically around one another, but during transcription, they are separated by the RNA polymerase II to form a molecular condensate called the transcription bubble. Successive steps involve the bubble translocation along the gene body. This work aims to modulate DNA as a combination of n-nonperturbative circuits quantum electrodynamics with nine Radio-Frequency Superconducting Quantum Interference Devices (SQUIDs) inside. A bus can be coupled capacitively to a single-mode microwave resonator. The cavity mode and the bus can mediate long-range, fast interaction between neighboring and distant DNA SQUID qubits. RNA polymerase II produces decoherence during transcription. This enzyme is a multifunctional biomolecular machine working like an artificially engineered device. Phosphorylation catalyzed by protein kinases constitutes the driving force. The coupling between n-phosphorylation pulses and any particular SQUID qubit can be obtained selectively via frequency matching.

TI Quantum Keyless Private Communication With Decoy States for Space
   Channels
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION FORENSICS AND SECURITY
AB With the increasing demand for secure communication in optical space networks, it is essential to develop physical-layer scalable security solutions. In this context, we present the asymptotic security analysis of a keyless quantum private communication protocol that transmits classical information over quantum states. Different from the previous literature, our protocol sends dummy (decoy) states optimally obtained from the true information to deceive the eavesdropper. We analyze optical on-off keying (OOK) and binary phase shift keying (BPSK) for several detection scenarios. Our protocol significantly improves the protocol without decoy states whenever Bob is at a technological disadvantage with respect to Eve. Our protocol guarantees positive secrecy capacity when the eavesdropper gathers up to 90-99.9% (depending on the detection scenario) of the photon energy that Bob detects, even when Eve is only limited by the laws of quantum mechanics. We apply our results to the design of an optical inter-satellite link (ISL) study case with pointing losses, and introduce a new design methodology whereby the link margin is guaranteed to be secure by our protocol. Hence, our design does not require knowing the eavesdropper's location and/or channel state: the protocol aborts whenever the channel drops below the secured margin. Our protocol can be implemented with state-of-the-art space-proof technology. Finally, we also show the potential secrecy advantage when using (not yet available) squeezed quantum states technology.

TI Planar Quantum Low-Density Parity-Check Codes with Open Boundaries
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Although high-threshold and low-overhead quantum low-density parity-check (qLDPC) codes, such as bivariate bicycle (BB) codes, can reduce the physical-qubit cost by an order of magnitude compared to the Kitaev toric code, their torus layout remains difficult for physical implementation. In this work, we introduce the first systematic procedure to convert BB codes into fully planar, open-boundary qLDPC codes, preserving their performance. We present planar code families with logical dimensions 6 <= k <= 13, e.g., [78, 6, 6], [107, 7, 7]], [268, 8, 12], [405, 9, 15], [348, 10, 13], [[450, 11, 15], [386, 12, 12], and [362, 13, 11], all with geometrically local weight-6 stabilizers. Allowing weight-8 stabilizers produces a [282, 12, 14] code, exhibiting an efficiency metric (kd2/n) an order of magnitude higher than the surface code. The construction combines boundary-anyon condensation with the "lattice-grafting" optimization, yielding high-performance qLDPC codes natively compatible with planar hardware architectures. It also uncovers Sierpinski-type fractal logical operators the distance of which scales with the fractal area on finite lattices. These planar qLDPC codes provide an implementable route to resource-efficient, high-threshold fault tolerance and a flexible framework for future code design on realistic two-dimensional hardware.

TI Almost optimal measurement scheduling of molecular Hamiltonian via
   finite projective plane
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB We propose an efficient and almost optimal scheme for measuring molecular Hamiltonians in quantum chemistry on quantum computers, which requires 2N2 distinct measurements in the leading order with N being the number of molecular orbitals. It achieves the state-of-the-art by improving a previous proposal by Bonet-Monroig et al. [Phys. Rev. X 10, 031064 (2020)], which exhibits 103 N2 scaling in the leading order. We develop a method based on a finite projective plane to construct sets of simultaneously measurable operators contained in molecular Hamiltonians. Each measurement only requires a depth-O(N) circuit consisting of O(N2) one- and two-qubit gates under the Jordan-Wigner and parity mapping, assuming the linear connectivity of qubits on quantum hardwares. We perform numerical simulation of our method for molecular Hamiltonians of hydrogen chains. We count the number of sets of simultaneously measurable operators generated by our method and estimate the number of measurement shots required to achieve the small standard deviation of the energy expectation value for precise quantum chemistry calculations. Because evaluating expectation values of molecular Hamiltonians is one of the major bottlenecks in the applications of quantum devices to quantum chemistry, our finding is expected to accelerate such applications.

TI Influence of formalin fixation duration on RNA quality and quantity from
   formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded hepatocellular carcinoma tissues
SO PATHOLOGY INTERNATIONAL
AB Analyzing RNA samples from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues is essential for precision medicine. We investigated RNA quantity and quality from FFPE tumor tissues fixed in formalin for various times and compared sequencing metrics from next-generation sequencing (NGS). Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) tissues were fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin (1-240 h) and FFPE blocks were prepared. Total RNA was extracted, and the quantity and quality were assessed using the NanoDrop, Qubit and Bioanalyzer. After preparing sequencing libraries, NGS was performed on the Oncomine Dx Multi-CDx system. Total RNA yields of all samples met the threshold required for NGS, but longer fixation times resulted in decreased total RNA and long RNA fragment (>200 nt) yields. NGS analysis showed fewer sequencing reads of internal control genes from RNA with longer fixation times. RNA extracted from FFPE blocks stored for 500 days had reduced RNA yield and quality compared with RNA obtained from FFPE blocks prepared immediately. In conclusion, short and over-fixation should be avoided because of their negative impact on sequencing quality. Fixation process should be finished promptly within recommended guidelines (6-72 h) for cancer patients.

TI Gravity-related collapse of the wave function and spontaneous heating:
   Revisiting the experimental bounds
SO AVS QUANTUM SCIENCE
AB The possibility that the collapse of the wave function in quantum mechanics is real and ultimately connected to (classical) gravity has been debated for decades with main contributions by Diosi and Penrose (DP). In particular, Diosi proposed a noise-based dynamical reduction model, which captures the same order of magnitudes for the collapse time suggested by Penrose based on heuristic arguments. This is known in the literature as the DP model (Diosi-Penrose). A peculiarity of the DP model is the prediction of spontaneous heating of matter, which can be tested without the need for massive quantum superpositions. Notably, a very similar effect is predicted by recent theoretical approaches to gravity as a classical-only information channel. Here, we reconsider the current constraints on the DP model from spontaneous heating by analyzing experimental situations not properly considered before. We argue that the parameter-free version of the DP model is close to be ruled out by standard heat leak measurements at ultralow temperatures with a conclusive exclusion likely within reach with existing technology. This result would strengthen a recent claim of exclusion inferred by spontaneous x-ray emission experiments, which relies on the somewhat stronger assumption that the DP noise field is white up to x-ray frequencies.

TI Low-noise quantum frequency conversion in a monolithic cavity with bulk
   periodically poled potassium titanyl phosphate
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB Interfacing the different building blocks of a future large-scale quantum network will require efficient and noiseless frequency conversion of quantum light. Nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond are a lead-ing candidate to form the nodes of such a network. However, the performance of a suitable converter remains a bottleneck, with existing demonstrations severely limited by parasitic noise arising at the tar-get telecommunication wavelength. Here we demonstrate a platform for efficient low-noise quantum frequency conversion based on a monolithic bulk periodically poled potassium titanyl phosphate cav-ity and show its suitability for the conversion of 637-nm single photons from nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond to telecommunication wavelengths. By resonantly enhancing the power of an off-the-shelf pump laser, we achieve an internal conversion efficiency of (72.3 +/- 0.4)% while generating noise of only (110 +/- 4) kHz/nm at the target wavelength without the need for any active stabilization. This constitutes a fivefold reduction in noise over existing state-of-the-art single-step converters at these wave-lengths. We verify the almost-ideal preservation of nonclassical correlations by converting photons from a spontaneous-parametric-down-conversion source and moreover show the preservation of time-energy entanglement via Franson interferometry.

TI Non-Abelian Floquet Spin Liquids in a Digital Rydberg Simulator
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW X
AB Understanding topological matter is an outstanding challenge across several disciplines of physical science. Programmable quantum simulators have emerged as a powerful approach to studying such systems. While quantum spin liquids of paradigmatic toric code type have recently been realized in the laboratory, controlled exploration of topological phases with non-Abelian excitations remains an open problem. We introduce and analyze a new approach to simulating topological matter based on periodic driving. Specifically, we describe a model for a so-called Floquet spin liquid, obtained through a periodic sequence of parallel quantum gate operations that effectively simulates the Hamiltonian of the non-Abelian spin liquid in Kitaev's honeycomb model. We show that this approach, including the toolbox for preparation, control, and readout of topological states, can be efficiently implemented in state-of-the-art experimental platforms. One specific implementation scheme is based on Rydberg atom arrays and utilizes recently demonstrated coherent qubit transport combined with controlled-phase gate operations. We describe methods for probing the non-Abelian excitations, and the associated Majorana zero modes, and simulate possible fusion and braiding experiments. Our analysis demonstrates the potential of programmable quantum simulators for exploring topological phases of matter. Extensions including simulation of Kitaev materials and lattice gauge theories are also discussed.

TI Kerr non-linearity enhances the response of a graphene Josephson
   bolometer
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Bolometers are radiation sensors that are central to wide areas such as dark matter search, radio astronomy, material science, and qubit readouts, among others. There have been different kinds of bolometer realizations in the recent past. The challenge is to have a single device that combines high sensitivity, broad bandwidth, and a fast readout scheme. Here we demonstrate the usage of Josephson parametric amplifiers (JPA) as highly sensitive bolometers. Our key finding is that the Kerr non-linearity of the JPA boosts the device's sensitivity. When the bolometer is biased in the non-linear regime, it enhances the up-converted signals (similar to 100 times), resulting in an order of magnitude improvement in sensitivity compared to the linear regime. In the non-linear biasing, we achieve a NEP similar to 500 aW/root Hz. Our device offers a fast detection scheme with a thermal time constant of 4.26 mu s and an intrinsic JPA time constant of 70 ns. Our work integrates a JPA into a bolometer, enabling a fast and sensitive operation compared to previously studied graphene-based bolometers. Our study demonstrates a way forward to improve the quantum sensors based on 2D materials by leveraging the inherent non-linear response.

TI Evaluation of a physically defined silicon quantum dot for design of
   matching circuit for RF reflectometry charge sensing
SO AIP ADVANCES
AB This paper reports on the extraction of the equivalent circuit model parameters of a physically defined silicon quantum dot at a cryogenic temperature and design of the impedance matching circuits to improve the performance of a charge sensor for radio-frequency (RF) reflectometry. The I-V characteristics and the S-parameters of the quantum dot device are measured around a Coulomb peak at 4.2 K. The measured results are modeled by an RC parallel circuit, and the model parameters for the quantum dot device were obtained. We consider three impedance matching circuits for RF reflectometry of a quantum dot: shunt capacitor-series inductor type, shunt inductor-series capacitor type, and shunt inductor-series inductor-type. We formulate and compare the sensitivity and bandwidth of RF reflectometry for the three types of circuits. The analysis should be useful for selecting the optimal matching circuit and the circuit parameters for given equivalent circuit parameters and working frequency. This procedure is demonstrated for a quantum dot with the characterized model circuit along with simulated performance. This design technique of matching circuit for RF reflectometry can be applied to any device that can be represented by an RC parallel circuit. These results will facilitate to realize fast semiconductor qubit readout in various quantum dot platforms.

TI Quantum electrodynamics in anisotropic and tilted Dirac photonic
   lattices
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB One of the most striking predictions of quantum electrodynamics is that vacuum fluctuations of the electromagnetic field can lead to spontaneous emission of atoms as well as photon-mediated interactions among them. Since these processes strongly depend on the nature of the photonic bath, a current burgeoning field is the study of their modification in the presence of photons with non-trivial energy dispersions, e.g. the ones confined in photonic crystals. A remarkable example is the case of isotropic Dirac-photons, which has been recently shown to lead to non-exponential spontaneous emission as well as dissipation-less long-range emitter interactions. In this work, we show how to further tune these processes by considering anisotropic Dirac cone dispersions, which include tilted, semi-Dirac, and the recently discovered type II and III Dirac points. In particular, we show how by changing the anisotropy of the lattice one can change both the spatial shape of the interactions as well as its coherent/incoherent nature. Finally, we theoretically analyze a possible implementation based on subwavelength atomic arrays where these energy dispersions can be engineered and interfaced with quantum emitters.

TI Entanglement and quantum strategies reduce congestion costs in Pigou
   networks
SO PHYSICA A-STATISTICAL MECHANICS AND ITS APPLICATIONS
AB Pigou's problem has many applications in real life scenarios like traffic networks, graph theory, data transfer in internet networks, etc. The two player classical Pigou's network has an unique Nash equilibrium with the Price of Stability and Price of Anarchy agreeing with each other. The situation changes for the k person classical Pigou's network with n being the total number of people. If we fix the behaviour of (n - 2) people and assume that k persons take path P-2 where k < (n - 2) and the remaining take path P-1, the minimum cost of Nash equilibrium becomes k dependent and we find a particular k for which the cost is an absolute minimum. In contrast to the two person classical Pigou's network, the quantum two qubit Pigou's network with maximal entanglement gives a lower cost for the Nash equilibrium. In contrast to k person classical Pigou's network, its quantum version with the quantum miracle move strategy M has reduced cost for the Nash equilibrium. This has major implications for information transfer in both classical as well as quantum data networks. By employing entanglement and quantum strategies, one can significantly reduce congestion costs in quantum data networks. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Ultralow Photon Flux OWC Links Using UV-C Single-Photon Detection
SO LASER & PHOTONICS REVIEWS
AB Low photon flux optical wireless communication (OWC) links are difficult to operate under normal daylight conditions as the interference from daylight will overwhelm any signal. However, in the UV-C region of the spectrum, light from the sun is highly attenuated, offering the possibility of link operation. In this paper, ultralow photon flux OWC links using a UV-C micro-LED and a silicon photomultiplier (SiPM) based UV-C single-photon detector (SPD) are reported. A 1 megabaud per second (MB s-1) symbol rate 128-pulse-position modulation (128-PPM) link is demonstrated with 7.7 transmitted photons per bit, corresponding to 0.97 detected photon per bit. A maximum bit rate of 120 Mbit s-1 is achieved in 8-PPM links with a transmitted power of 1.7 nW. In addition, a 500 MHz single-photon link is established with a bit error rate (BER) of 4.32x10-2$4.32 \times {{10}<^>{ - 2}}$ and a measured bit rate of 2.12 Mbit s-1, showing the potential for a quantum key distribution (QKD) system operating at the UV-C region.

TI Floquet Codes without Parent Subsystem Codes
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB We propose a new class of error-correcting dynamic codes in two and three dimensions that has no explicit connection to any parent subsystem code. The two-dimensional code, which we call the CSS (Calderbank-Shor-Steane) honeycomb code, is geometrically similar to that of the honeycomb code by Hastings and Haah and also dynamically embeds an instantaneous toric code. However, unlike the honeycomb code, it possesses an explicit CSS structure and its gauge checks do not form a subsystem code. Nevertheless, we show that our dynamic protocol conserves logical information and possesses a threshold for error correction. We generalize this construction to three dimensions and obtain a code that fault tolerantly alternates between realizing two type-I fracton models, the checkerboard and the X-cube model. Finally, we show the compatibility of our CSS honeycomb-code protocol and the honeycomb code by showing the possibility of randomly switching between the two protocols without information loss while still measuring error syndromes. We call this more general aperiodic structure "dynamic tree codes," which we also generalize to three dimensions. We construct a probabilistic finite automaton prescription that generates dynamic tree codes correcting any single-qubit Pauli errors and can be viewed as a step toward the development of practical fault-tolerant random codes.

TI Quantum value for a family of I3322 -like Bell
   functionals
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We introduce a three-parameter family of Bell functionals that extends those studied previously [Kaniewski, Phys. Rev. Res. 2, 033420 (2020)] by including a marginal contribution. An analysis of their largest value achievable by quantum realizations naturally splits the family into two branches, and for the first of them we show that this value is given by a simple function of the parameters defining the functionals. In this case we completely characterize the realizations attaining the optimal value and show that these functionals can be used to self-test any partially entangled state of two qubits. The optimal measurements, however, are not unique and form a one-parameter family of qubit measurements. The second branch, which includes the well-known I-3322 functional, is studied numerically. We identify the region in the parameter space where the optimal value can be attained with two-dimensional quantum systems and characterize the state and measurements attaining this value. Finally, we show that the set of realizations introduced by Pal and Vertesi [Phys. Rev. A 82, 022116 (2010)] to obtain the maximal violation of the I(3322 )inequality succeeds in approaching the optimal value for a large subset of the functionals in this branch. In these cases we analyze and discuss the main features of the optimal realizations.

TI The XYZ2 hexagonal stabilizer code
SO QUANTUM
AB We consider a topological stabilizer code on a honeycomb grid, the "XYZ(2) " code. The code is inspired by the Kitaev honeycomb model and is a simple realization of a "matching code" discussed by Wootton [1], with a specific implementation of the boundary. It utilizes weight-six (XYZXYZ) plaquette stabilizers and weight-two (XX) link stabilizers on a planar hexagonal grid composed of 2d(2) qubits for code distance d, with weight-three stabilizers at the boundary, stabilizing one logical qubit. We study the properties of the code using maximum-likelihood decoding, assuming perfect stabilizer measurements. For pure X, Y, or Z noise, we can solve for the logical failure rate analytically, giving a threshold of 50 %. In contrast to the rotated surface code and the XZZX code, which have code distance d(2) only for pure Y noise, here the code distance is 2d(2) for both pure Z and pure Y noise. Thresholds for noise with finite Z bias are similar to the XZZX code, but with markedly lower sub-threshold logical failure rates. The code possesses distinctive syndrome properties with unidirectional pairs of plaquette defects along the three directions of the triangular lattice for isolated errors, which may be useful for efficient matching-based or other approximate decoding.

TI Few-Electron Single and Double Quantum Dots in an InAs Two-Dimensional
   Electron Gas
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Most proof-of-principle experiments for spin qubits have been performed with GaAs-based quantum dots because of the excellent control they offer over tunneling barriers and the orbital and spin degrees of freedom. Here we present the first realization of high-quality single and double quantum dots hosted in an InAs two-dimensional electron gas, demonstrating accurate control down to the few-electron regime, where we observe a clear Kondo effect and singlet-triplet spin blockade. We measure an electronic g factor of 16 and a typical magnitude of the random hyperfine fields on the quantum dots of approximately 0.6 mT. We estimate the spin-orbit length in the system to be approximately 5 - 10 mu m (which is almost 2 orders of magnitude longer than typically measured in InAs nanostructures), achieved by a very symmetric design of the quantum well. These favorable properties put the InAs two-dimensional electron gas on the map as a compelling host for studying fundamental aspects of spin qubits. Furthermore, having weak spin-orbit coupling in a material with a large Rashba coefficient potentially opens up avenues for engineering structures with spin-orbit coupling that can be controlled locally in space and/or time.

TI Temperature-dependent characterization of large-area superconducting
   microwire array with single-photon sensitivity in the near-infrared
SO JOURNAL OF INSTRUMENTATION
AB Superconducting nanowire single photon detectors (SNSPDs) are a leading detector technology for time-resolved single-photon counting from the ultraviolet to the near-infrared regime. The recent advancement in single-photon sensitivity in micrometer-scale superconducting wires opens up promising opportunities to develop large area SNSPDs with applications in low background dark matter detection experiments. We present the first detailed temperature-dependent study of a 4-channel 1 x 1 mm2 WSi superconducting microwire single photon detector (SMSPD) array, including the internal detection efficiency, dark count rate, and importantly the coincident dark counts across pixels. The detector shows saturated internal detection efficiency for photon wavelengths ranging from 635 nm to 1650 nm, time jitter of about 160 ps for 1060 nm photons, and a low dark count rate of about 10-2 Hz. Additionally, the coincidences of dark count rate across pixels are studied for the first time in detail, where we observed an excess of correlated dark counts, which has important implications for low background dark matter experiments. The results presented is the first step towards characterizing and developing SMSPD array systems and associated background for low background dark matter detection experiments.

TI A Configurable CRYSTALS-Kyber Hardware Implementation with Side-Channel
   Protection
SO ACM TRANSACTIONS ON EMBEDDED COMPUTING SYSTEMS
AB In this work, we present a configurable and side channel resistant implementation of the post-quantum key-exchange algorithm CRYSTALS-Kyber. The implemented design can be configured for different performance and area requirements leading to different trade-offs for different applications. A low area implementation can be achieved in 5,269 LUTs and 2,422 FFs, whereas a high performance implementation required 7,151 LUTs and 3,730 FFs. Due to a deeply pipelined architecture, a high operating speed of more than 250 MHz could be achieved on 28nm Xilinx FPGAs. The side channel resistance is implemented using a carefully chosen set of novel and known techniques such as Fault Detection Hashes, Instruction Randomization, FSM Protection and so on. resulting in a low overhead of less than 5% while being highly configurable. To the best of our knowledge, this work presents the first side-channel and fault attack protected configurable accelerator for CRYSTALS-Kyber. Using TVLA (test vector leakage assessment), we validate the implemented protection techniques and demonstrate that the design does not leak information even after 200 K traces. Furthermore, one of the configuration choices results in the smallest hardware implementation of CRYSTALS-Kyber known in the literature.

TI Characterising and bounding the set of quantum behaviours in
   contextuality scenarios
SO QUANTUM
AB The predictions of quantum theory resist generalised noncontextual explanations. In addition to the foundational relevance of this fact, the particular extent to which quantum theory violates noncontextuality limits available quantum advantage in communication and information processing. In the first part of this work, we formally define contextuality scenarios via prepare-and-measure experiments, along with the polytope of general contextual behaviours containing the set of quantum contextual behaviours. This framework allows us to recover several properties of set of quantum behaviours in these scenarios, including contextuality scenarios and associated noncontextuality inequalities that require for their violation the individual quantum preparation and measurement procedures to be mixed states and unsharp measurements. With the framework in place, we formulate novel semidefinite programming relaxations for bounding these sets of quantum contextual behaviours. Most significantly, to circumvent the inadequacy of pure states and projective measurements in contextuality scenarios, we present a novel unitary operator based semidefinite relaxation technique. We demonstrate the efficacy of these relaxations by obtaining tight upper bounds on the quantum violation of several noncontextuality inequalities and identifying novel maximally contextual quantum strategies. To further illustrate the versatility of these relaxations, we demonstrate monogamy of preparation contextuality in a tripartite setting, and present a secure semi-device independent quantum key distribution scheme powered by quantum advantage in parity oblivious random access codes.

TI Exploiting a Multi-Mode Laser in Homodyne Detection for
   Vacuum-Fluctuation-Based Quantum Random Number Generator
SO PHOTONICS
AB To realize a vacuum-fluctuation-based quantum random number generator (QRNG), various implementations can be explored to improve efficiency and practicality. In this study, we employed a multi-mode (MM) laser as the local oscillator in a vacuum-fluctuation QRNG and compared its performance with that of a conventional single-mode (SM) laser. Despite experiencing frequency-mode hopping, the MM laser successfully interfered with the vacuum state, similar to the SM reference. The common-mode rejection ratio of the balanced homodyne detection setup exceeded 35 dB for all laser sources. The digitized raw data were processed with a cryptographic hash function to generate full-entropy data. These outputs passed both the independent and identically distributed test recommended in NIST SP 800-90B and the statistical test suite under the SP 800-22 guideline, confirming their quality as quantum random numbers. Our results demonstrate that full-entropy data derived from either SM or MM lasers are applicable to systems requiring high-quality randomness, such as quantum key distribution. This study represents the first demonstration of an MM-laser-based vacuum-fluctuation QRNG, achieving a generation rate of 10 Gbps and indicating potential for compact and practical implementation.

TI Communicating at a record 14.5 bits per received photon through a
   photon-starved channel
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Exploration of the Universe requires communication with Earth, either on a direct path or through a cascade of proximate celestial bodies. Microwaves have traditionally been used for space communication, but electromagnetic waves of higher frequencies, such as in the optical domain, will enable probing farther in space due to their considerably lower diffraction loss. The ultimate range limit to point-to-point optical communication, at a given transmitter power, is determined by the photon information efficiency (PIE), which measures the number of information bits extracted per photon incident on a detector. As distances across space and, consequently, path loss increases, systems achieving the highest PIE can enable communication at the longest distances. We report here an experimental demonstration of optical detection at a record PIE of 14.5 bits per incident photon, or 17.8 bits per detected photon, after 87.5 dB of attenuation. Expressed in terms of energy per bit, this corresponds to 8.84 zeptojoules per bit, or 0.069 photons per bit at 1550 nm. To our knowledge, this is the highest PIE or lowest energy per bit detection system ever demonstrated at optical frequencies. Such a sensitive detection system holds promise for a wide range of applications.

TI Spacing-Tailored Multicore Fiber Interface for Efficient FIFO Devices
SO JOURNAL OF LIGHTWAVE TECHNOLOGY
AB Multicore fibers (MCFs) have attracted intense attention to overcome the capacity limit of single-core optical fiber communication system. However, as indispensable connection devices between the MCF and the individual single mode fiber (SMF), fan-in and fan-out (FIFO) devices are challenging to achieve overall performance in terms of coupling efficiency, crosstalk, return loss, and device compactness. Here we develop an MCF reverse-tapering technique to increase the core-to-core spacing of the MCF and construct a spacing-tailored interface between the MCF and the normal SMF bundle. The fabricated FIFO device for the small-core MCF with narrow core-to-core spacing of 35 mu m features a low average coupling loss (similar to 0.6 dB), extraordinarily low crosstalk (<-65 dB) and a return loss (<-60 dB) without using any bridge elements, where the remarkably low crosstalk is about 20 dB lower than using special bridge fibers for the same type of MCF. The flexibility of reverse tapering of MCFs can overcome its intrinsic integration challenge and provide a powerful approach to constructing all-fiber FIFO devices with compact construction and excellent overall performance.

TI Scalable photonic quantum processing via isometric energy-conserving
   transformations: bridging hybrid optical modes
SO OPTICS CONTINUUM
AB The precise manipulation of quantum states of light lies at the heart of advancing photonic technologies, yet scalable solutions for hybrid photonic systems-where disparate optical modes such as polarization, time-bin, and frequency must coherently interact-remain a critical challenge. While current literature demonstrates various energy-conserving devices that effectively map between Hilbert spaces of unequal dimensions, there is a growing need for frameworks that address variable-dimensional transformations in a more unified manner. In this paper, we introduce an operator-level framework that systematically integrates both unitary and rectangular isometric energy-conserving transformations in multi-dimensional photonic systems. Unlike prior mode-specific approaches, our formalism enables modular modeling of hybrid optical modes within effective signal spaces, offering practical tools for scalable photonic quantum processors. By classifying these transformations into fixed-and variable-dimensional regimes, we derive universal design criteria for energy-conserving photonic signal processors. This work not only advances the fundamental understanding of photonic quantum processing but also delivers actionable tools for engineering next-generation scalable optical technologies, including multi-purpose, programmable photonic circuits, energy-efficient optical signal processing in reconfigurable networks, and high-dimensional quantum key distribution with hybrid mode encoding.

TI Studies on the readability and on the detection rate in a Mach-Zehnder
   interferometer-based implementation for high-rate, long-distance QKD
   protocols
SO EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL D
AB We study the way that chromatic dispersion affects the visibility and the synchronization on quantum key distribution (QKD) protocols in a widely used setup based on the use of two fiber-based Mach-Zehnder interferometers at transmitter/receiver stations. We identify the necessary conditions for the path length difference between the two arms of the interferometers for achieving the desired visibility given the transmission distance, where the form of the detector's window can be considered. We also associate the above limitations with the maximum detection rate that can be recorded in our setup, including the quantum nonlinearity phenomenon, and with the maximum time window of the detector's gate. Exploiting our results, we provide two methods, depending on the clock rate of the setup, to perform chromatic dispersion compensation techniques to the signal for keeping the correct order of the transmitted symbols. At the end, we apply our theoretical outcomes in a more realistic QKD deployment, considering the case of phase-encoding BB84 QKD protocol, which is widely used. Our proposed methods, depending on the transmission distance and on the photon emission rate at transmitter station, can be easily generalized to every fiber-optic QKD protocol, for which the discrimination of each symbol is crucial.

TI A Survey of Data Security Sharing
SO SYMMETRY-BASEL
AB In the digital era, secure data sharing has become a core requirement for enabling cross-domain collaboration, cloud computing, and Internet of Things (IoT) applications, as well as a critical measure for safeguarding privacy and defending against malicious attacks. In light of the risks of data leakage and misuse in open environments, achieving efficient, controllable, and privacy-preserving data sharing has emerged as a key research focus. This paper first provides a systematic review of the prevailing secure data sharing technologies, including proxy re-encryption, searchable encryption, key agreement and distribution, and attribute-based encryption, summarizing their design principles and application features. Subsequently, game-theoretic modeling based on incentive theory is introduced to construct a strategic interaction framework between data owners and data users, aiming to analyze and optimize benefit allocation mechanisms. Furthermore, the paper explores the integration of game theory with secure sharing mechanisms to enhance the sustainability and stability of the data sharing ecosystem. Finally, it outlines the critical challenges currently faced in secure data sharing and discusses future research directions, offering theoretical insights and technical references for building a more comprehensive data sharing framework.

TI Gate- and flux-tunable sin(2φ) Josephson element with planar-Ge

SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Hybrid superconductor-semiconductor Josephson field-effect transistors (JoFETs) function as Josephson junctions with gate-tunable critical current. Additionally, they can feature a non-sinusoidal current-phase relation (CPR) containing multiple harmonics of the superconducting phase difference, a so-far underutilized property. Here we exploit this multi-harmonicity to create a Josephson circuit element with an almost perfectly pi-periodic CPR, indicative of a largely dominant charge-4e supercurrent transport. We realize such a Josephson element, recently proposed as building block of a protected superconducting qubit, using a superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) with low-inductance aluminum arms and two nominally identical JoFETs. The latter are fabricated from a SiGe/Ge/SiGe quantum-well heterostructure embedding a high-mobility two-dimensional hole gas. By carefully adjusting the JoFET gate voltages and finely tuning the magnetic flux through the SQUID close to half a flux quantum, we achieve a regime where the sin(2 phi)\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$\sin (2\varphi )$$\end{document} component accounts for more than 95% of the total supercurrent.

TI On the Use of Total State Decompositions for the Study of Reduced
   Dynamics
SO OPEN SYSTEMS & INFORMATION DYNAMICS
AB The description of the dynamics of an open quantum system in the presence of initial correlations with the environment needs different mathematical tools than the standard approach to reduced dynamics, which is based on the use of a time-dependent completely positive trace preserving (CPTP) map. Here, we take into account an approach that is based on a decomposition of any possibly correlated bipartite state as a conical combination involving statistical operators on the environment and general linear operators on the system, which allows one to fix the reduced-system evolution via a finite set of time-dependent CPTP maps. In particular, we show that such a decomposition always exists, also for infinite dimensional Hilbert spaces, and that the number of resulting CPTP maps is bounded by the Schmidt rank of the initial global state. We further investigate the case where the CPTP maps are semigroups with generators in the Gorini-Kossakowski-Lindblad-Sudarshan form; for two simple qubit models, we identify the positivity domain defined by the initial states that are mapped into proper states at any time of the evolution fixed by the CPTP semigroups.

TI Observation of a quantum phase transition in the quantum Rabi model with
   a single trapped ion
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Quantum phase transitions (QPTs) are usually associated with many-body systems in the thermodynamic limit when their ground states show abrupt changes at zero temperature with variation of a parameter in the Hamiltonian. Recently it has been realized that a QPT can also occur in a system composed of only a two-level atom and a single-mode bosonic field, described by the quantum Rabi model (QRM). Here we report an experimental demonstration of a QPT in the QRM using a Yb-171(+) ion in a Paul trap. We measure the spin-up state population and the average phonon number of the ion as two order parameters and observe clear evidence of the phase transition via adiabatic tuning of the coupling between the ion and its spatial motion. An experimental probe of the phase transition in a fundamental quantum optics model without imposing the thermodynamic limit opens up a window for controlled study of QPTs and quantum critical phenomena. Quantum phase transition occurs in many-body systems with abrupt changes in the ground state around zero temperature. Here the authors report signatures of quantum phase transition in single trapped ion that can be described using quantum Rabi model.

TI Long distance QKD propagation using optical single sideband scheme
SO OPTICS CONTINUUM
AB Implementation of the passive radio over -fiber technique permits modulating the low -frequency sub -carrier onto an optical channel for dissemination through a light -wave fiber network. Single-sideband modulation for optical signals allows the impressive utilization of channel capacity in optical fiber. Dispersion reduction techniques limit the pulse spreading of a propagated signal in any photonic scheme. To control pulse -spreading effects, the optical singlesideband modulation technique at different phase shifts is modeled, analyzed, and compared to examine the performance of a sub -carrier multiplexing system. Hence, in this paper, a quantum key distribution network using a single sideband modulation technique based on a Li-Nb Mach-Zehnder modulator has been proposed at different electrical phase shifts. In this suggested model, the Optisystem 14.2 simulator is used to analyze the nonlinear characteristics. We have designed a single-sideband contour reduction and amplification with each couplet of 120 km by increasing the distance up to 720 km, and the phase between quantum states is determined. The system performance of the suggested model is investigated and compared based on output power (dBm), quality factor, eye diagram, bit error rate (BER), extinction ratio (ER), and optical spectrum of the received signal by varying link distance (km), channel spacing (nm), input power (dBm), and fiber dispersion (ps/ns/km).

TI Fast adaptive optics for high-dimensional quantum communications in
   turbulent channels
SO COMMUNICATIONS PHYSICS
AB Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) promises a provably secure method to transmit information from one party to another. Free-space QKD allows for this information to be sent over great distances and in places where fibre-based communications cannot be implemented, such as ground-satellite. The primary limiting factor for free-space links is the effect of atmospheric turbulence, which can result in significant error rates and increased losses in QKD channels. Here, we employ the use of a high-speed Adaptive Optics (AO) system to make real-time corrections to the wavefront distortions on spatial modes that are used for high-dimensional QKD in our turbulent channel. First, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the AO system in improving the coupling efficiency of a Gaussian mode that has propagated through turbulence. Through process tomography, we show that our system is capable of significantly reducing the crosstalk of spatial modes in the channel. Finally, we show that employing AO reduces the quantum dit error rate for a high-dimensional orbital angular momentum-based QKD protocol, allowing for secure communication in a channel where it would otherwise be impossible. These results are promising for establishing long-distance free-space QKD systems.

TI Dirac gauge theory for topological spinors in 3+1 dimensional networks
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS A-MATHEMATICAL AND THEORETICAL
AB Gauge theories on graphs and networks are attracting increasing attention not only as approaches to quantum gravity but also as models for performing quantum computation. Here we propose a Dirac gauge theory for topological spinors in 3+ 1 dimensional networks associated to an arbitrary metric. Topological spinors are the direct sum of 0-cochains and 1-cochains defined on a network and describe a matter field defined on both nodes and links of a network. Recently in Bianconi (2021 J. Phys. Complex. 2 035022) it has been shown that topological spinors obey the topological Dirac equation driven by the discrete Dirac operator. In this work we extend these results by formulating the Dirac equation on weighted and directed 3+ 1 dimensional networks which allow for the treatment of a local theory. The commutators and anti-commutators of the Dirac operators are non vanishing an they define the curvature tensor and magnetic field of our theory respectively. This interpretation is confirmed by the non-relativistic limit of the proposed Dirac equation. In the non-relativistic limit of the proposed Dirac equation the sector of the spinor defined on links follows the Schrodinger equation with the correct giromagnetic moment, while the sector of the spinor defined on nodes follows the Klein-Gordon equation and is not negligible. The action associated to the proposed field theory comprises of a Dirac action and a metric action. We describe the gauge invariance of the action under both Abelian and non-Abelian transformations and we propose the equation of motion of the field theory of both Dirac and metric fields. This theory can be interpreted as a limiting case of a more general gauge theory valid on any arbitrary network in the limit of almost flat spaces.

TI Effect of disorder and strain on the operation of planar Ge hole spin
   qubits
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Germanium quantum dots in strained Ge/Si1-xGex heterostructures exhibit fast and coherent hole qubit control. Nevertheless, a full theoretical understanding of their underlying physics is lacking due to the absence of a systematic method of accounting for inhomogeneous strain, whose effects often overwhelm the bare spin-orbit coupling in the Luttinger Hamiltonian. Here we seek to remedy this shortcoming by addressing the effects of random alloy disorder and gate-induced strain on the operation of planar Ge hole spin qubits. In good agreement with experimental numbers, our hybrid approach to realistic device modeling suggests that the resultant strain inhomogeneity make a strong contribution to the linear-k spin-orbit coupling1, which is Dresselhaus-like and eventually dominates hole spin EDSR; and there exist specific in-plane B-field and and the microwave drive (Eac\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$${\tilde{{\bf{E}}}}_{{\rm{ac}}}$$\end{document}) orientations for maximum hole spin EDSR Rabi frequency.

TI Rare earth ions doped mixed crystals for fast quantum computers with
   optical frequency qubits
SO OPTICS COMMUNICATIONS
AB The possibility of using mixed crystals highly doped with rare earth ions (REIs) as physical systems for creating fast quantum computers with a sampling time of 10(-9) s is discussed. The electronic (4)f states of rare earth ions with small values of the diagonal elements of the Judd-Ofelt matrix U-(2) are proposed as optical frequency qubit levels. CNOT and other conditional gate operations are performed by exciting the rare earth ion into the (4)f state with a large diagonal element of U-(2), causing a Stark blockade. It is found that the main interaction responsible for this blockade is the quadrupole-quadrupole interaction. The large inhomogeneous broadening of the frequencies of the electronic transitions in mixed crystals and the weak interaction of (4)f electrons with phonons make it possible to achieve a high computation rate and a long decoherence time of the qubits. An ensemble of closest REIs is described that can act as an OQC instance; the frequencies of the corresponding qubits can be found using the spectral hole burning method.

TI Stable and low loss oxide layer on α-Ta (110) film for superconducting
   qubits
SO JOURNAL OF VACUUM SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY B
AB The presence of amorphous oxide layers can significantly affect the coherent time of superconducting qubits due to their high dielectric loss. Typically, the surface oxides of superconductor films exhibit lossy and unstable behavior when exposed to air. To increase the coherence time, it is essential for qubits to have stable and low dielectric loss oxides, either as barrier or passivation layers. In this study, we highlight the robust and stable nature of an amorphous tantalum oxide layer formed on alpha-Ta (110) film by employing chemical and structural analyses. Such kind of oxide layer forms in a self-limiting process on the surface of alpha-Ta (110) film in piranha solution, yielding stable thickness and steady chemical composition. Quarter-wavelength coplanar waveguide resonators are made to study the loss of this oxide. One resonator has a Q(i) of 3.0 x 10(6) in the single photon region. The Q(i) of most devices are higher than 2.0 x 10(6). Moreover, most of them are still over 1 x 10(6) even after exposed to air for months. Based on these findings, we propose an all-tantalum superconducting qubit utilizing such oxide as passivation layers, which possess low dielectric loss and improved stability.

TI Nonperturbative Analytical Diagonalization of Hamiltonians with
   Application to Circuit QED
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Deriving effective Hamiltonian models plays an essential role in quantum theory, with particular emphasis in recent years on control and engineering problems. In this work, we present two symbolic methods for computing effective Hamiltonian models: the nonperturbative analytical diagonalization (NPAD) and the recursive Schrieffer-Wolff transformation (RSWT). NPAD makes use of the Jacobi iteration and works without the assumptions of perturbation theory while retaining convergence, allowing us to treat a very wide range of models. In the perturbation regime, it reduces to RSWT, which takes advantage of an in-built recursive structure where, remarkably, the number of terms increases only linearly with the perturbation order, exponentially decreasing the number of terms compared to the ubiquitous Schrieffer-Wolff method. In this regime, NPAD further gives an exponential reduction in terms, i.e., superexponential compared to the Schrieffer-Wolff transformation, relevant to high-precision expansions. Both methods consist of algebraic expressions and can be easily automated for symbolic computation. To demonstrate the application of the methods, we study the ZZ and cross-resonance interactions of superconducting qubit systems. We investigate both suppressing and engineering the coupling in near-resonant and quasidispersive regimes. With the proposed methods, the coupling strength in the effective Hamiltonians can be estimated with high precision comparable to numerical results.

TI Energy-filtered random-phase states as microcanonical thermal pure
   quantum states
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB We propose a method to calculate finite-temperature properties of a quantum many-body system for a microcanonical ensemble by introducing a pure quantum state named here an energy-filtered random-phase state, which is also a potentially promising application of near-term quantum computers. In our formalism, a microcanonical ensemble is specified by two parameters, i.e., the energy of the system and its associated energy window. Accordingly, the density of states is expressed as a sum of Gaussians centered at the target energy with its spread corresponding to the width of the energy window. We then show that the thermodynamic quantities such as entropy and temperature are calculated by evaluating the trace of the time-evolution operator and the trace of the time-evolution operator multiplied by the Hamiltonian of the system. We also describe how these traces can be evaluated using random diagonal-unitary circuits appropriate to quantum computation. The pure quantum state representing our microcanonical ensemble is related to a state of the form introduced by Wall and Neuhauser for the filter diagonalization method [M. R. Wall and D. Neuhauser, J. Chem. Phys. 102, 8011 (1995)], and therefore we refer to it as an energy-filtered random-phase state. The energy-filtered random-phase state is essentially a Fourier transform of a time-evolved state whose initial state is prepared as a random-phase state, and the cut-off time in the time-integral for the Fourier transform sets the inverse of the width of the energy window. The proposed method is demonstrated numerically by calculating thermodynamic quantities for the one-dimensional spin-1/2 Heisenberg model on small clusters up to 28 qubits, showing that the method is most efficient for the target energy around which the dense distribution of energy eigenstates is found.

TI Experimental and computational approaches of methoxy naphthylbithiophene
   derivatives and their use as corrosion protection for carbon steel in
   acidic medium
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB The inhibition efficiency and adsorption affinity were investigated for two novel compounds, namely: 6-methoxy-2-naphthyl-[2, 2'-bithiophene]-5-carboxamidine hydrochloride salt (MA-1440) and 5'-(4-chlorophenyl)-2, 2'-bifuran-5-carboxamidine hydrochloride salt (MA-1456). The inhibition study was conducted on carbon steel surface in 1.0 M HCl with different inhibitor doses and different temperature levels, to investigate the optimum dose and preferable temperature. The performed investigation included chemical, electrochemical, instrumental, and quantum computation techniques. A chemical technique was accomplished by using weight-loss measurements. Different factors were studied using weight-loss measurements in order to reach the maximum inhibition efficiency. The adsorption study revealed that the examined inhibitors obey the Langmuir adsorption isotherm and are chemically adsorbed on the steel surface. The electrochemical measurements were accomplished through the electrochemical impedance (EIS) and potentiodynamic polarization (PDP) techniques. Based on the electrochemical measurements, the examined compounds were categorized as mixed inhibitors. The instrumental examination using different techniques namely: scanning electron microscope (SEM), energy dispersive X-ray (EDX), Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) confirmed that the considered inhibitors are excellently adsorbed over the carbon steel surface. The extent of the adsorption affinity of these compounds on the carbon steel surface was studied theoretically using quantum computations and Monte Carlo simulation. The theoretical investigation results of quantum chemistry were validated with those obtained by chemical and electrochemical methodologies. All investigations prove that, the tested compounds were adsorbed chemically on the steel surface and achieved maximum inhibition efficiency of, 94.69% and 90.85% for M-1440 and MA-1456, respectively, at the optimum concentration 30 x-10(-6) mol-L-1 and temperature 328 K.

TI Long-Range Entanglement from Measuring Symmetry-Protected Topological
   Phases
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW X
AB A fundamental distinction between many-body quantum states are those with short- and long-range entanglement (SRE and LRE). The latter cannot be created by finite-depth circuits, underscoring the nonlocal nature of Schr & ouml;dinger cat states, topological order, and quantum criticality. Remarkably, examples are known where LRE is obtained by performing single-site measurements on SRE, such as the toric code from measuring a sublattice of a 2D cluster state. However, a systematic understanding of when and how measurements of SRE give rise to LRE is still lacking. Here, we establish that LRE appears upon performing measurements on symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases -of which the cluster state is one example. For instance, we show how to implement the Kramers-Wannier transformation by adding a cluster SPT to an input state followed by measurement. This transformation naturally relates states with SRE and LRE. An application is the realization of double-semion order when the input state is the Z 2 Levin-Gu SPT. Similarly, the addition of fermionic SPTs and measurement leads to an implementation of the Jordan-Wigner transformation of a general state. More generally, we argue that a large class of SPT phases protected by G x H symmetry gives rise to anomalous LRE upon measuring G -charges, and we prove that this persists for generic points in the SPT phase under certain conditions. Our work introduces a new practical tool for using SPT phases as resources for creating LRE, and we uncover the classification result that all states related by sequentially gauging Abelian groups or by Jordan-Wigner transformation are in the same equivalence class, once we augment finite-depth circuits with single-site measurements. In particular, any topological or fracton order with a solvable finite gauge group can be obtained from a product state in this way.

TI A cryogenic chamber setup for superfluid helium experiments with optical
   fiber and electrical access
SO REVIEW OF SCIENTIFIC INSTRUMENTS
AB Superfluid helium is a prototypical quantum liquid. As such, it has been a prominent platform for the study of quantum many body physics. More recently, the outstanding mechanical and optical properties of superfluid helium, such as low mechanical dissipation and low optical absorption, have positioned superfluid helium as a promising material platform in applications ranging from dark matter and gravitational wave detection to quantum computation. However, experiments with superfluid helium incur a high barrier to entry, as they require the incorporation of complex optical and electrical setups within a hermetically sealed cryogenic chamber to confine the superfluid. Here, we report on the design and construction of a helium chamber setup for operation inside a dilution refrigerator at millikelvin temperatures, featuring electrical and optical fiber access. By incorporating an automated gas handling system, we can precisely control the amount of helium gas inserted into the chamber, rendering our setup particularly promising for experiments with superfluid helium thin films, such as superfluid thin film optomechanics. Using silicon nanophotonic resonators, we demonstrate precise control and in situ tuning of the thickness of a superfluid helium film on the sub-nanometer level. By making use of the exceptional tunability of the superfluid film thickness, we demonstrate optomechanically induced phonon lasing of phononic crystal cavity third sound modes in the superfluid film and show that the lasing threshold crucially depends on the film thickness. The large internal volume of our chamber (V-chamber approximate to 1 l) is adaptable for the integration of various optical and electrical measurement and control techniques. Therefore, our setup provides a versatile platform for a variety of experiments in fundamental and applied superfluid helium research. (c) 2025 Author(s).

TI Quantum double structure in cold atom superfluids
SO AVS QUANTUM SCIENCE
AB The theory of topological quantum computation is underpinned by two important classes of models. One is based on non-abelian Chern-Simons theory, which yields the so-called SU(2)(k) anyon models that often appear in the context of electrically charged quantum fluids. The physics of the other is captured by symmetry broken Yang-Mills theory in the absence of a Chern-Simons term and results in the so-called quantum double models. Extensive resources have been invested into the search for SU(2)(k) anyon quasi-particles, in particular, the so-called Ising anyons (k = 2) of which Majorana zero modes are believed to be an incarnation. In contrast to the SU(2)(k) models, quantum doubles have attracted little attention in experiments despite their pivotal role in the theory of error correction. Beyond topological error correcting codes, the appearance of quantum doubles has been limited to contexts primarily within mathematical physics, and as such, they are of seemingly little relevance for the study of experimentally tangible systems. However, recent works suggest that quantum double anyons may be found in spinor Bose-Einstein condensates. In light of this, the core purpose of this article is to provide a self-contained exposition of the quantum double structure, framed in the context of spinor condensates, by constructing explicitly the quantum doubles for various ground state symmetry groups and discuss their experimental realisability. We also derive analytically an equation for the quantum double Clebsch-Gordan coefficients from which the relevant braid matrices can be worked out. Finally, the existence of a particle-vortex duality is exposed and illuminated upon in this context. (c) 2023 Author(s).

TI Parity-time symmetry enabled ultra-efficient nonlinear optical signal
   processing
SO ELIGHT
AB Nonlinear optical signal processing (NOSP) has the potential to significantly improve the throughput, flexibility, and cost-efficiency of optical communication networks by exploiting the intrinsically ultrafast optical nonlinear wave mixing. It can support digital signal processing speeds of up to terabits per second, far exceeding the line rate of the electronic counterpart. In NOSP, high-intensity light fields are used to generate nonlinear optical responses, which can be used to process optical signals. Great efforts have been devoted to developing new materials and structures for NOSP. However, one of the challenges in implementing NOSP is the requirement of high-intensity light fields, which is difficult to generate and maintain. This has been a major roadblock to realize practical NOSP systems for high-speed, high-capacity optical communications. Here, we propose using a parity-time (PT) symmetric microresonator system to significantly enhance the light intensity and support high-speed operation by relieving the bandwidth-efficiency limit imposed on conventional single resonator systems. The design concept is the co-existence of a PT symmetry broken regime for a narrow-linewidth pump wave and near-exceptional point operation for broadband signal and idler waves. This enables us to achieve a new NOSP system with two orders of magnitude improvement in efficiency compared to a single resonator. With a highly nonlinear AlGaAs-on-Insulator platform, we demonstrate an NOSP at a data rate approaching 40 gigabits per second with a record low pump power of one milliwatt. These findings pave the way for the development of fully chip-scale NOSP devices with pump light sources integrated together, potentially leading to a wide range of applications in optical communication networks and classical or quantum computation. The combination of PT symmetry and NOSP may also open up opportunities for amplification, detection, and sensing, where response speed and efficiency are equally important.

TI ROBUST ITERATIVE METHOD FOR SYMMETRIC QUANTUM SIGNAL PROCESSING IN ALL
   PARAMETER REGIMES
SO SIAM JOURNAL ON SCIENTIFIC COMPUTING
AB This paper addresses the problem of solving nonlinear systems in the context of symmetric quantum signal processing (QSP), a powerful technique for implementing matrix functions on quantum computers. Symmetric QSP focuses on representing target polynomials as products of matrices in SU(2) that possess symmetry properties. We present a novel Newton's method tailored for efficiently solving the nonlinear system involved in determining the phase factors within the symmetric QSP framework. Our method demonstrates rapid and robust convergence in all parameter regimes, including the challenging scenario with ill-conditioned Jacobian matrices, using standard double precision arithmetic operations. For instance, solving symmetric QSP for a highly oscillatory target function \alpha cos(1000 x ) (polynomial degree \approx1433) takes 6 iterations to converge to machine precision when \alpha = 0.9, and the number of iterations only increases to 18 iterations when \alpha = 1- 10- 9 with a highly ill-conditioned Jacobian matrix. Leveraging the matrix product state structure of symmetric QSP, the computation of the Jacobian matrix incurs a computational cost comparable to a single function evaluation. Moreover, we introduce a reformulation of symmetric QSP using real- number arithmetics, further enhancing the method's efficiency. Extensive numerical tests validate the effectiveness and robustness of our approach, which has been implemented in the QSPPACK software package.

AB Maxwell unified the disparate concepts of electric and magnetic fields with one theory (electromagnetism) and Einstein then unified the disparate theories of electromagnetism and mechanics with one kinematics (Minkowski space of special relativity). In this talk, we will briefly explain how the disparate kinematics of quantum mechanics (finite-dimensional Hilbert space) and special relativity can be unified with one principle (relativity principle). This result follows from the axiomatic reconstruction of quantum mechanics via information-theoretic principles, which has successfully recast quantum mechanics as a principle theory a la Einstein, i.e., the formalism of the theory follows from an empirically discovered fact, just like special relativity. According to the quantum reconstruction program, the empirically discovered fact whence the Hilbert space formalism of quantum mechanics is Information Invariance & Continuity. Of course, the empirically discovered fact whence the Lorentz transformations of special relativity is the light postulate, i.e., everyone measures the same value for the speed of light c, regardless of their relative motions. Obviously, the light postulate can be justified by the relativity principle-the laws of physics are the same in all inertial reference frames-because c is a constant of Nature per Maxwell's electromagnetism. [We label this "NPRF + c" for short, where NPRF stands for "no preferred reference frame."] As we will show, Information Invariance & Continuity can also be justified by the relativity principle by first spatializing the quantum reconstruction program's operational notion of measurement. In that case, Information Invariance & Continuity entails the empirically discovered fact that everyone measures the same value for Planck's constant h, regardless of their relative spatial orientations or locations (Planck postulate). Since Poincare transformations relate inertial reference frames via spatial rotations and translations as well as boosts, and h is a constant of Nature per Planck's radiation law, the relativity principle justifies the Planck postulate (NPRF + h) just like it justifies the light postulate (NPRF + c). Thus, the kinematics of quantum mechanics and special relativity are unified in that both follow most fundamentally from the relativity principle in the adynamical global constraints NPRF + h and NPRF + c. This approach provides a principle solution to the mystery of quantum entanglement that does not violate locality, statistical independence, intersubjective agreement, or the uniqueness of experimental outcomes and it does not alter quantum mechanics as a principle theory. An ontology consistent with this unification is introduced and we deflate both the 'big' and 'small' measurement problems.

TI A quantum constraint generation framework for binary linear programs
SO EPJ QUANTUM TECHNOLOGY
AB We propose a new approach to utilize quantum computers for binary linear programming (BLP), which can be extended to general integer linear programs (ILP). Quantum optimization algorithms, hybrid or quantum-only, are currently general purpose, standalone solvers for ILP. However, to consider them practically useful, we expect them to overperform the current state of the art classical solvers. That expectation is unfair to quantum algorithms: in classical ILP solvers, after many decades of evolution, many different algorithms work together as a robust machine to get the best result. This is the approach we would like to follow now with our quantum 'solver' solutions. In this study we wrap any suitable quantum optimization algorithm into a quantum informed classical constraint generation framework. First we relax our problem by dropping all constraints and encode it into an Ising Hamiltonian for the quantum optimization subroutine. Then, by sampling from the solution state of the subroutine, we obtain information about constraint violations in the initial problem, from which we decide which coupling terms we need to introduce to the Hamiltonian. The coupling terms correspond to the constraints of the initial binary linear program. Then we optimize over the new Hamiltonian again, until we reach a feasible solution, or other stopping conditions hold. Since one can decide how many constraints they add to the Hamiltonian in a single step, our algorithm is at least as efficient as the (hybrid) quantum optimization algorithm it wraps. We support our claim with results on small scale minimum cost exact cover problem instances.

TI Quantum Generative Models for Small Molecule Drug Discovery
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM ENGINEERING
AB Existing drug discovery pipelines take 5-10 years and cost billions of dollars. Computational approaches aim to sample from regions of the whole molecular and solid-state compounds called chemical space, which could be on the order of 10(60). Deep generative models can model the underlying probability distribution of both the physical structures and property of drugs and relate them nonlinearly. By exploiting patterns in massive datasets, these models can distill salient features that characterize the molecules. Generative adversarial networks (GANs) discover drug candidates by generating molecular structures that obey chemical and physical properties and show affinity toward binding with the receptor for a target disease. However, classical GANs cannot explore certain regions of the chemical space and suffer from training instabilities. The practical utility of such models is limited due to the vast size of the search space, characterized by millions of parameters. A full quantum GAN may require more than 90 qubits even to generate small molecules with up to nine heavy atoms. The proposed quantum GAN with a hybrid generator (QGAN-HG) model is composed of a hybrid quantum generator that supports various number of qubits and quantum circuit layers, and a classical discriminator. The QGAN-HG with less than 20% of the original parameters can learn molecular distributions as efficiently as its classical counterpart. Another extended version of the proposed QGAN-HG, which utilizes multiple quantum subcircuits, considerably accelerates our standard QGAN-HG training process and avoids the potential gradient vanishing issue of deep neural networks.

TI Covariance Matrix Preparation for Quantum Principal Component Analysis
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Principal component analysis (PCA) is a dimensionality reduction method in data analysis that involves diagonalizing the covariance matrix of the dataset. Recently, quantum algorithms have been formulated for PCA based on diagonalizing a density matrix. These algorithms assume that the covariance matrix can be encoded in a density matrix, but a concrete protocol for this encoding has been lacking. Our work aims to address this gap. Assuming amplitude encoding of the data, with the data given by the ensemble (pi, |psi i)}, then one can easily prepare the ensemble average density matrix p = sigma i pi| psi i)iota psi i|. We first show that p is precisely the covariance matrix whenever the dataset is centered. For quantum datasets, we exploit global phase symmetry to argue that there always exists a centered dataset consistent with p, and hence p can always be interpreted as a covariance matrix. This provides a simple means for preparing the covariance matrix for arbitrary quantum datasets or centered classical datasets. For uncentered classical datasets, our method is so-called "PCA without centering," which we interpret as PCA on a symmetrized dataset. We argue that this closely corresponds to standard PCA, and we derive equations and inequalities that bound the deviation of the spectrum obtained with our method from that of standard PCA. We numerically illustrate our method for the Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology (MNIST) handwritten digit dataset. We also argue that PCA on quantum datasets is natural and meaningful, and we numerically implement our method for molecular ground-state datasets.

TI Phase transitions in random circuit sampling
SO NATURE
AB Undesired coupling to the surrounding environment destroys long-range correlations in quantum processors and hinders coherent evolution in the nominally available computational space. This noise is an outstanding challenge when leveraging the computation power of near-term quantum processors1. It has been shown that benchmarking random circuit sampling with cross-entropy benchmarking can provide an estimate of the effective size of the Hilbert space coherently available2-8. Nevertheless, quantum algorithms' outputs can be trivialized by noise, making them susceptible to classical computation spoofing. Here, by implementing an algorithm for random circuit sampling, we demonstrate experimentally that two phase transitions are observable with cross-entropy benchmarking, which we explain theoretically with a statistical model. The first is a dynamical transition as a function of the number of cycles and is the continuation of the anti-concentration point in the noiseless case. The second is a quantum phase transition controlled by the error per cycle; to identify it analytically and experimentally, we create a weak-link model, which allows us to vary the strength of the noise versus coherent evolution. Furthermore, by presenting a random circuit sampling experiment in the weak-noise phase with 67 qubits at 32 cycles, we demonstrate that the computational cost of our experiment is beyond the capabilities of existing classical supercomputers. Our experimental and theoretical work establishes the existence of transitions to a stable, computationally complex phase that is reachable with current quantum processors.

TI Quantum Metropolis-Hastings algorithm with the target distribution
   calculated by quantum Monte Carlo integration
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB The Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method, especially the Metropolis-Hastings (MH) algorithm, is a widely used technique for sampling from a target probability distribution P on a state space ⠂ and applied to various problems such as estimation of parameters in statistical models in the Bayesian approach. Quantum algorithms for MCMC have been proposed, yielding the quadratic speedup with respect to the spectral gap ⠃ compared to classical counterparts. In this paper, we consider the quantum version of the MH algorithm in the case that calculating P is costly because the log-likelihood L for a state x & ISIN; ⠂ is obtained via computing the sum of many terms, 1EM-1 i=0 ⠄(i, x). We propose calculating L by quantum Monte Carlo integration and combine it M with the existing method called quantum simulated annealing (QSA) to generate the quantum state that encodes P in amplitudes. We consider not only state generation but also finding a credible interval for a parameter, a common task in Bayesian inference. In the proposed method for credible interval calculation, the number of queries to the quantum circuit to compute ⠄ scales on ⠃, the required accuracy ⠅, and the standard deviation & sigma; of ⠄ as O & SIM;(& sigma; /⠅2 ⠃3/2), in contrast to O & SIM;(M/⠅ ⠃1/2) for QSA with L calculated exactly. Therefore, the proposed method is advantageous if & sigma; scales on M sublinearly. As one such example, we consider parameter estimation in a gravitational wave experiment, where & sigma; = O(M1/2).

Rev. A 110, 052427] serves as a pivotal tool for labeling the samples. A key observation is that steerable Gaussian states are vastly outnumbered by unsteerable ones, particularly in configurations where the untrusted party possesses significantly more modes than the trusted party. This leads to a highly skewed distribution of sample states in the dataset. In response to this phenomenon and to make comparison, we propose the imbalance factor \documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$\xi$$\end{document} and prepare three types of datasets to be trained: balanced datasets, naturally generated datasets and augmented datasets with \documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$\xi =30$$\end{document} via a data augmentation strategy. Numerical experiments for seven low modes scenarios reveal that the classifiers obtained by utilizing the ensemble learning method training on augmented dataset have the best overall performance, significantly improving generalization capabilities with low cost and high test accuracy, achieving detection times as fast as \documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$10<^>{-5}$$\end{document} seconds, at least 100 times faster than calculating \documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$\mathcal {J}$$\end{document}. The speed advantage of machine learning detection will be more obvious in the case of higher modes. Thus the approach is both efficient and reliable, offering valuable insights into the broader potential of machine learning applications in quantum information science and providing a robust framework for machine learning utilized to classification tasks, especially in data-imbalanced scenarios.

TI Quantum-Centric Computational Study of Methylene Singlet and Triplet
   States
SO JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL THEORY AND COMPUTATION
AB This study involves quantum simulations of the dissociation of the ground-state triplet and first excited singlet states of the CH2 molecule (methylene), which are relevant for interstellar and combustion chemistry. These were modeled as (6e, 23o) systems using 52 qubits on a quantum processor by applying the sample-based quantum diagonalization (SQD) method within a quantum-centric supercomputing framework. We evaluated the ability of SQD to provide accurate results of the singlet-triplet gap in comparison to selected configuration interaction (SCI) calculations and experimental values. To our knowledge, this is the first study of an open-shell system (the CH2 triplet) using SQD. To obtain accurate energy values, we implemented post-SQD orbital optimization and employed a warm-start approach using previously converged states. The results for the singlet state dissociation were highly accurate, differing by only a few milli-Hartrees from the SCI reference values. Similarly, the SQD-calculated singlet-triplet energy gap aligned well with both experimental and SCI values, underscoring the method's capability to capture key features of CH2 chemistry. However, the triplet state exhibited greater variability, likely due to differences in bit-string handling within the SQD method for open- versus closed-shell systems and the inherently complex wavefunction character of the triplet state. These findings highlight the strengths and limitations of SQD for modeling open-shell systems while laying a foundation for its application in large-scale electronic structure studies using quantum algorithms.

TI Broadband transient full-Stokes luminescence spectroscopy
SO NATURE
AB Materials emitting circularly polarized light (CPL) are highly sought after for applications ranging from efficient displays to quantum information technologies1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6-7. However, established methods for time-resolved CPL (TRCPL) characterization have notable limitations8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16-17, generally requiring a compromise between sensitivity, accessible timescales and spectral information. This has limited the acquisition of in-depth photophysical insight necessary for materials development. Here we demonstrate a high-sensitivity (noise level of the order of 10-4), broadband (about 400-900 nm), transient (nanosecond resolution, millisecond range) full-Stokes (CPL and linear polarizations) spectroscopy setup. The achieved combination of high-sensitivity, broad wavelength response and flexible time ranges represents a substantial advancement over previous TRCPL approaches. As a result, TRCPL measurements are shown to be applicable to hitherto inaccessible material systems and photophysical processes, including systems with low (10-3) dissymmetry factors and luminescence pathways spanning nanosecond to millisecond time ranges. Finally, full-Stokes measurements allow tracking the temporal evolution of linear polarization components, of interest by themselves, but especially relevant in the context of controlling for associated CPL artefacts18,19 in the time domain.

TI Recent Progress of Solid-State Cavity Quantum Electrodynamics Based on
   Interaction Between Plasmonic Nanocavity and Two-Dimensional Excitons
   (Invited)
SO LASER & OPTOELECTRONICS PROGRESS
AB The study of cavity quantum electrodynamics based on optical microcavities and solid-state quantum systems such as quantum emitters and quantum spin systems are widely applied to modern quantum optics and quantum information science. In recent years, the study of the interaction between plasmonic nanocavity with mode volume beyond diffraction limit and high-performance two-dimensional (2D) semiconductor excitons receives extensive attention, and it is expected that such cavity-exciton system can be applied to integrated quantum optical systems. The study first introduces the weak and strong coupling between plasmonic nanocavities and 2D semiconductor excitons, and summarizes the modulation of excitonic spin-valley photonics of 2D semiconductor excitons and the coupling at the nanoscale. Then, the coupling of the nanocavity with the 2D single defective quantum emitter is introduced, demonstrating the potential application of such system in future integrated nano-optoelectronics. Finally, the challenges and opportunities for the study of plasmonic nanocavities and low-dimensional exciton systems are discussed.

TI Hilbert-Space Ergodicity in Driven Quantum Systems: Obstructions and
   Designs
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW X
AB Despite its long history, a canonical formulation of quantum ergodicity that applies to general classes of quantum dynamics, including driven systems, has not been fully established. Here we introduce and study a notion of quantum ergodicity for closed systems with time-dependent Hamiltonians, defined as statistical randomness exhibited in their longtime dynamics. Concretely, we consider the temporal ensemble of quantum states (time-evolution operators) generated by the evolution, and investigate the conditions necessary for them to be statistically indistinguishable from uniformly random states (operators) in the Hilbert space (space of unitaries). We find that the number of driving frequencies underlying the Hamiltonian needs to be sufficiently large for this to occur. Conversely, we show that statistical pseudorandomness-indistinguishability up to some large but finite moment-can already be achieved by a quantum system driven with a single frequency, i.e., a Floquet system, as long as the driving period is sufficiently long. Our work relates the complexity of a time-dependent Hamiltonian and that of the resulting quantum dynamics, and offers a fresh perspective to the established topics of quantum ergodicity and chaos from the lens of quantum information.

TI Optoelectronic Readout of Single Er Adatom's Electronic States Adsorbed
   on the Si(100) Surface at Low Temperature (9 K)
SO ACS NANO
AB Integrating nanoscale optoelectronic functions is vital for applications such as optical emitters, detectors, and quantum information. Lanthanide atoms show great potential in this endeavor due to their intrinsic transitions. Here, we investigate Er adatoms on Si(100)-2x1 at 9 K using a scanning tunneling microscope (STM) coupled to a tunable laser. Er adatoms display two main adsorption configurations that are optically excited between 800 and 1200 nm while the STM reads the resulting photocurrents. Our spectroscopic method reveals that various photocurrent signals stem from the bare silicon surface or Er adatoms. Additional photocurrent peaks appear as the signature of the Er adatom relaxation, triggering efficient dissociation of nearby trapped excitons. Calculations using density functional theory with spin-orbit coupling correction highlight the origin of the observed photocurrent peaks as specific 4f -> 4f or 4f -> 5d transitions. This spectroscopic technique can facilitate optoelectronic analysis of atomic and molecular assemblies by offering insight into their intrinsic quantum properties.

TI High-Efficiency Circularly Polarized Light-Emitting Diodes Based on
   Chiral Metal Nanoclusters
SO JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY
AB Circularly polarized light-emitting diodes (CP-LEDs) are critical for next-generation optical technologies, ranging from holography to quantum information processing. Currently deployed chiral luminescent materials, with their intricate synthesis and processing and limited efficiency, are the main bottleneck for CP-LEDs. Chiral metal nanoclusters (MNCs) are potential CP-LED materials, given their ease of synthesis and processability as well as diverse structures and excited states. However, their films are usually plagued by inferior electronic quality and aggregation-caused photoluminescence quenching, necessitating their incorporation into host materials; without such a scheme, MNC-based LEDs exhibit external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) < 10%. Herein, we achieve an efficiency leap for both CP-LEDs and cluster-based LEDs by using novel chiral MNCs with aggregation-induced emission enhancement. CP-LEDs using enantiopure MNC films attain EQEs of up to 23.5%. Furthermore, by incorporating host materials, the devices yield record EQEs of up to 36.5% for both CP-LEDs and cluster-based LEDs, along with electroluminescence dissymmetry factors (|g EL|) of around 1.0 x 10(-3). These findings open a new avenue for advancing chiral light sources for next-generation optoelectronics.

TI Effects of aberrations on 3D optical topologies
SO COMMUNICATIONS PHYSICS
AB Optical knots and links are nontrivial three-dimensional topologies consisting of trajectories of phase or polarisation singularities. They are theoretically predicted and experimentally observed in paraxial and nonparaxial regimes and in random and speckle fields. The topological nature of optical knots suggests that environmental disturbances should not alter their topology, hence becoming a resilient vector of information. However, the robustness of optical knots under typical disturbances encountered in optical experiments has not been investigated. Here, we provide the experimental analysis of the effects of optical phase aberrations on optical knots and links. We demonstrate that Hopf links, trefoil and cinquefoil knots are robust to misalignment and phase aberrations. The observed knots are obliterated for high aberration strengths and defining apertures close to the characteristic optical beam size. Our observations indicate these photonic topological structures as viable alternatives for both classical and quantum information processing noisy channels, where optical modes are not applicable.
   Optical knots are three-dimensional topologies made of singularities in phase or polarization, but the robustness of their topological structure under optical disturbances is still unexplored. The authors experimentally verify the robustness of optical knots to environmental disturbances, indicating them as a viable vector of information.

TI Spectral Hong-Ou-Mandel Effect between a Heralded Single-Photon State
   and a Thermal Field: Multiphoton Contamination and the Nonclassicality
   Threshold
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB The Hong-Ou-Mandel (HOM) effect is crucial for quantum information processing, and its visibility determines the system's quantum-classical characteristics. In an experimental and theoretical study of the spectral HOM effect between a thermal field and a heralded single-photon state, we demonstrate that the HOM visibility varies dependent on the relative photon statistics of the interacting fields. Our findings reveal that multiphoton components in a heralded state get engaged in quantum interference with a thermal field, resulting in improved visibilities at certain mean photon numbers. We derive a theoretical relationship for the HOM visibility as a function of the mean photon number of the thermal field and the thermal part of the heralded state. We show that the nonclassicality degree of a heralded state is reflected in its HOM visibility with a thermal field; our results establish a lower bound of 41.42% for the peak visibility, indicating the minimum assignable degree of nonclassicality to the heralded state. This research enhances our understanding of the HOM effect and its application to high-speed remote secret key sharing, addressing security concerns due to multiphoton contamination in heralded states.

TI Recent progress on optomagnetic coupling and optical manipulation based
   on cavity-optomagnonics
SO FRONTIERS OF PHYSICS
AB Recently, the photon-magnon coherent interaction based on the collective spins excitation in ferromagnetic materials has been achieved experimentally. Under the prospect, the magnons are proposed to store and process quantum information. Meanwhile, cavity-optomagnonics which describes the interaction between photons and magnons has been developing rapidly as an interesting topic of the cavity quantum electrodynamics. Here in this short review, we mainly introduce the recent theoretical and experimental progress in the field of optomagnetic coupling and optical manipulation based on cavity-optomagnonics. According to the frequency range of the electromagnetic field, cavity optomagnonics can be divided into microwave cavity optomagnonics and optical cavity optomagnonics, due to the different dynamics of the photon-magnon interaction. As the interaction between the electromagnetic field and the magnetic materials is enhanced in the cavity-optomagnonic system, it provides great significance to explore the nonlinear characteristics and quantum properties for different magnetic systems. More importantly, the electromagnetic response of optomagnonics covers the frequency range from gigahertz to terahertz which provides a broad frequency platform for the multi-mode controlling in quantum systems.

TI Singularities in nearly uniform one-dimensional condensates due to
   quantum diffusion
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Dissipative systems often exhibit wavelength-dependent loss rates. One prominent example is Rydberg polaritons formed by electromagnetically induced transparency, which have long been a leading candidate for studying the physics of interacting photons and also hold promise as a platform for quantum information. In this system, dissipation is in the form of quantum diffusion, i.e., proportional to k(2) (k being the wavevector) and vanishing at long wavelengths as k -> 0. Here, we show that one-dimensional condensates subject to this type of loss are unstable to long-wavelength density fluctuations in an unusual manner: after a prolonged period in which the condensate appears to relax to a uniform state, local depleted regions quickly form and spread ballistically throughout the system. We connect this behavior to the leading-order equation for the nearly uniform condensate-a dispersive analog to the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang equation-which develops singularities in finite time. Furthermore, we show that the wavefronts of the depleted regions are described by purely dissipative solitons within a pair of hydrodynamic equations, with no counterpart in lossless condensates. We close by discussing conditions under which such singularities and the resulting solitons can be physically realized.

TI Bosonic and fermionic Gaussian states from Kahler structures
SO SCIPOST PHYSICS CORE
AB We show that bosonic and fermionic Gaussian states (also known as "squeezed coherent states") can be uniquely characterized by their linear complex structure J which is a linear map on the classical phase space. This extends conventional Gaussian methods based on covariance matrices and provides a unified framework to treat bosons and fermions simultaneously. Pure Gaussian states can be identified with the triple (G, Omega, J) of compatible Kahler structures, consisting of a positive definite metric G, a symplectic form Omega and a linear complex structure J with J(2) = -1. Mixed Gaussian states can also be identified with such a triple, but with J(2) not equal -1. We apply these methods to show how computations involving Gaussian states can be reduced to algebraic operations of these objects, leading to many known and some unknown identities. We apply these methods to the study of (A) entanglement and complexity, (B) dynamics of stable systems, (C) dynamics of driven systems. From this, we compile a comprehensive list of mathematical structures and formulas to compare bosonic and fermionic Gaussian states side-by-side. Copyright L. Hackl and E. Bianchi.

TI Spectral phase transitions in optical parametric oscillators
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Driven nonlinear resonators provide a fertile ground for phenomena related to phase transitions far from equilibrium, which can open opportunities unattainable in their linear counterparts. Here, we show that optical parametric oscillators (OPOs) can undergo second-order phase transitions in the spectral domain between degenerate and non-degenerate regimes. This abrupt change in the spectral response follows a square-root dependence around the critical point, exhibiting high sensitivity to parameter variation akin to systems around an exceptional point. We experimentally demonstrate such a phase transition in a quadratic OPO. We show that the divergent susceptibility of the critical point is accompanied by spontaneous symmetry breaking and distinct phase noise properties in the two regimes, indicating the importance of a beyond nonlinear bifurcation interpretation. We also predict the occurrence of first-order spectral phase transitions in coupled OPOs. Our results on non-equilibrium spectral behaviors can be utilized for enhanced sensing, advanced computing, and quantum information processing. Non-equilibrium and collective behaviors such as phase transitions in optical systems can lead to interesting applications in photonics. Here the authors demonstrate spectral phase transition in a ubiquitous nonlinear driven-dissipative system, the optical parametric oscillator.

TI Accelerated variational quantum eigensolver with joint Bell measurement
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB The variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) stands as a prominent quantum -classical hybrid algorithm for near -term quantum computers to obtain the ground states of molecular Hamiltonians in quantum chemistry. However, due to the noncommutativity of the Pauli operators in the Hamiltonian, the number of measurements required on quantum computers increases significantly as the system size grows, which may hinder practical applications of VQE. In this work, we present a protocol termed joint Bell measurement VQE (JBM-VQE) to reduce the number of measurements and speed up the VQE algorithm. Our method employs joint Bell measurements, enabling the simultaneous measurement of the absolute values of all expectation values of Pauli operators present in the Hamiltonian. In the course of the optimization, JBM-VQE estimates the absolute values of the expectation values of the Pauli operators for each iteration by the joint Bell measurement, while the signs of them are measured less frequently by the conventional method to measure the expectation values. Our approach is based on the empirical observation that the signs do not often change during optimization. We illustrate the speed-up of JBM-VQE compared to conventional VQE by numerical simulations for finding the ground states of molecular Hamiltonians of small molecules, and the speed-up of JBM-VQE at the early stage of the optimization becomes increasingly pronounced in larger systems. Our approach based on the joint Bell measurement is not limited to VQE and can be utilized in various quantum algorithms whose cost functions are expectation values of many Pauli operators.

TI Quantum Shannon Information Theory-Design of Communication, Ciphers, and
   Sensors
SO ENTROPY
AB One of the key aspects of Shannon theory is that it provides guidance for designing the most efficient systems, such as minimizing errors and clarifying the limits of coding. This theory has seen great developments in the 50 years since 1948. It has played a vital role in enabling the development of modern ultra-fast, stable, and highly dependable information and communication systems. Shannon theory is supported by statistical communication theories such as detection and estimation theory. The theory of communication systems that transmit Shannon information using quantum media is called quantum Shannon information theory, and research began in the 1960s. The theoretical formulation comparable to conventional Shannon theory has been completed. Its important role is to suggest that application of quantum effects will surpass existing communication performance. It would be meaningless if performance, efficiency, and utility were to deteriorate due to quantum effects, even if a certain new function is given. This paper suggests that there are various limitations to utilizing quantum Shannon information theory to benefit real-world communication systems and presents a theoretical framework for achieving the ultimate goal. Finally, we present the perfect secure cipher that overcomes the Shannon impossibility theorem without degrading communication performance and sensors as an example.

TI An optical atomic clock using 4DJ states of rubidium
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB We analyze an optical atomic clock using two-photon 5S(1/2)-> 4D(J) transitions in rubidium. Four one- and two-color excitation schemes to probe the fine-structure states 4D(3/2) and 4D(5/2) are considered in detail. We compare key characteristics of Rb 4D(J) and 5D(5/2) two-photon clocks. The 4DJ clock features a high signal-to-noise ratio due to two-photon decay at favorable wavelengths, low dc electric and magnetic susceptibilities, and minimal black-body shifts. Ac Stark shifts from the clock interrogation lasers are compensated by two-color Rabi-frequency matching. We identify a "magic" wavelength near 1060 nm, which allows for in-trap, Doppler-free clock-transition interrogation with lattice-trapped cold atoms. From our analysis of clock statistics and systematics, we project a quantum-noise-limited relative clock stability at the 10(-13)/root tau(s)-level, with integration time tau in seconds, and a relative accuracy of similar to 10(-13). We describe a potential architecture for implementing the proposed clock using a single telecom clock laser at 1550 nm, which is conducive to optical communication and long-distance clock comparisons. Our work could be of interest in efforts to realize small and portable Rb clocks and in high-precision measurements of atomic properties of Rb 4D(J)-states.

TI In-Plane Nanowire Growth of Topological Crystalline Insulator
   Pb1-xSnxTe
SO ADVANCED FUNCTIONAL MATERIALS
AB Predicted topological crystalline insulators such as Pb1 - xSnxTe are an interesting candidate for applications in quantum technology, as they can host spin-polarized surface states. Moreover, in the nanowire geometry, a quasi-1D system can be realized with potential applications exploiting Majorana fermions. Herein, the selective area growth of Pb1 - xSnxTe islands and nanowires over the full range of x is demonstrated, and their in-depth growth dynamics and faceting are analyzed. By transmission electron microscopy, the single-crystalline and defect-free nature of the grown material and the homogeneous, controllable Pb/Sn ratio in the nanowires is confirmed. With support of phase-field growth simulations, it is shown that the crystal faceting mainly follows the driving force of surface energy minimization, favoring the lowest energy {200} surfaces. A kinetic enhancement of adatom incorporation on {110} facets is recognized to limit their extension with respect to {200} and {111} facets. After inspecting all possible in-plane orientations, we identify the & LANGBRAC;110 & rang; directions as the optimal candidate for the growth of high-quality and perfectly straight Pb1 - xSnxTe nanowires, enabling the design of complex networks due to their threefold symmetry. This work opens the way to systematic transport investigation of the carrier density in Pb1 - xSnxTe nanowires and can facilitate further optimization of the Pb1 - xSnxTe system.

TI Ultrafast Electron Microscopy of Nanoscale Charge Dynamics in
   Semiconductors
SO ACS NANO
AB The ultrafast dynamics of charge carriers in solids plays a pivotal role in emerging optoelectronics, photonics, energy harvesting, and quantum technology applications. However, the investigation and direct visualization of such nonequilibrium phenomena remains as a long-standing challenge, owing to the nanometer-femtosecond spatiotemporal scales at which the charge carriers evolve. Here, we propose and demonstrate an interaction mechanism enabling nanoscale imaging of the femtosecond dynamics of charge carriers in solids. This imaging modality, which we name charge dynamics electron microscopy (CDEM), exploits the strong interaction of free-electron pulses with terahertz (THz) near fields produced by the moving charges in an ultrafast scanning transmission electron microscope. The measured free-electron energy at different spatiotemporal coordinates allows us to directly retrieve the THz near-field amplitude and phase, from which we reconstruct movies of the generated charges by comparison to microscopic theory. The CDEM technique thus allows us to investigate previously inaccessible spatiotemporal regimes of charge dynamics in solids, providing insight into the photo-Dember effect and showing oscillations of photogenerated electron-hole distributions inside a semiconductor. Our work facilitates the exploration of a wide range of previously inaccessible charge-transport phenomena in condensed matter using ultrafast electron microscopy.

TI Quantum many-body scars and weak breaking of ergodicity
SO NATURE PHYSICS
AB Thermalization is the inevitable fate of many complex quantum systems, whose dynamics allow them to fully explore the vast configuration space regardless of the initial state-the behaviour known as quantum ergodicity. In a quest for experimental realizations of coherent long-time dynamics, efforts have focused on ergodicity-breaking mechanisms, such as integrability and localization. The recent discovery of persistent revivals in quantum simulators based on Rydberg atoms have pointed to the existence of a new type of behaviour where the system rapidly relaxes for most initial conditions, while certain initial states give rise to non-ergodic dynamics. This collective effect has been named 'quantum many-body scarring' by analogy with a related form of weak ergodicity breaking that occurs for a single particle inside a stadium billiard potential. In this Review, we provide a pedagogical introduction to quantum many-body scars and highlight the emerging connections with the semiclassical quantization of many-body systems. We discuss the relation between scars and more general routes towards weak violations of ergodicity due to embedded algebras and non-thermal eigenstates, and highlight possible applications of scars in quantum technology.
   Most large quantum systems are ergodic, meaning that over time they forget their initial conditions and thermalize. This article reviews our understanding of seemingly ergodic systems that in fact have some long-lived, non-thermal states.

TI High-resolution vibronic spectroscopy of a single molecule embedded in a
   crystal
SO JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS
AB Vibrational levels of the electronic ground states in dye molecules have not been previously explored at a high resolution in solid matrices. We present new spectroscopic measurements on single polycyclic aromatic molecules of dibenzoterrylene embedded in an organic crystal made of para-dichlorobenzene. To do this, we use narrow-band continuous-wave lasers and combine spectroscopy methods based on fluorescence excitation and stimulated emission depletion to assess individual vibrational linewidths in the electronic ground state at a resolution of similar to 30 MHz dictated by the linewidth of the electronic excited state. In this fashion, we identify several exceptionally narrow vibronic levels with linewidths down to values around 2 GHz. Additionally, we sample the distribution of vibronic wavenumbers, relaxation rates, and Franck-Condon factors, in both the electronic ground and excited states for a handful of individual molecules. We discuss various noteworthy experimental findings and compare them with the outcome of density functional theory calculations. The highly detailed vibronic spectra obtained in our work pave the way for studying the nanoscopic local environment of single molecules. The approach also provides an improved understanding of the vibrational relaxation mechanisms in the electronic ground state, which may help create long-lived vibrational states for applications in quantum technology.

TI Cryogenic Fiber-coupled Electro-optic Characterization Platform for
   High-speed Photodiodes
SO JOURNAL OF INFRARED MILLIMETER AND TERAHERTZ WAVES
AB We have developed a cryogenic characterization platform for ultrafast photodiodes, whose time domain responses are extracted by electro-optic sampling using femtosecond laser pulses in a pump-probe configuration. The excitation of the photodiodes with the pump beam and the electro-optic sampling crystals with the probe beam are realized in a fully fiber-coupled manner. This allows us to use the characterization platform at different temperatures, ranging from cryogenic to room temperature. As an application example, we characterize the time-domain response of commercial p-i-n photodiodes with a nominal bandwidth of 20 GHz and 60 GHz at temperatures of 4 K and 300 K and in a large parameter range of photocurrent and reverse bias. For these photodiodes, we detect frequency components up to approximately 250 GHz, while the theoretical bandwidth of our sampling method exceeds 1 THz. Our measurements demonstrate a significant excitation power and temperature dependence of the photodiodes' ultrafast time responses, reflecting, most likely, changes in carrier mobilities and electric field screening. Since our system is an ideal tool to characterize and optimize the response of fast photodiodes at cryogenic temperatures, it has a direct impact on applications in superconducting quantum technology such as the enhancement of optical links to superconducting qubits and quantum-accurate waveform generators.

TI Magneto-optical trapping in a near-suface borehole
SO PLOS ONE
AB Borehole gravity sensing can be used in a number of applications to measure features around a well, including rock-type change mapping and determination of reservoir porosity. Quantum technology gravity sensors, based on atom interferometry, have the ability to offer increased survey speeds and reduced need for calibration. While surface sensors have been demonstrated in real world environments, significant improvements in robustness and reductions to radial size, weight, and power consumption are required for such devices to be deployed in boreholes. To realise the first step towards the deployment of cold atom-based sensors down boreholes, we demonstrate a borehole-deployable magneto-optical trap, the core package of many cold atom-based systems. The enclosure containing the magneto-optical trap itself had an outer radius of (60 & PLUSMN; 0.1) mm at its widest point and a length of (890 & PLUSMN; 5) mm. This system was used to generate atom clouds at 1 m intervals in a 14 cm wide, 50 m deep borehole, to simulate how in-borehole gravity surveys are performed. During the survey, the system generated, on average, clouds of (3.0 & PLUSMN; 0.1) x 10(5 87)Rb atoms with the standard deviation in atom number across the survey observed to be as low as 8.9 x 10(4).

TI Proposal for a solid-state magnetoresistive Larmor quantum clock
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB We propose a solid-state implementation of the Larmor clock that exploits tunnel magnetoresistance to distill information on how long itinerant spins take to traverse a barrier embedded in it. Keeping in mind that the tunneling time innately involves pristine preselection and postselection, our proposal takes into account the detrimental aspects of multiple reflections by incorporating multiple contacts, multiple current measurements, and suitably defined magnetoresistance signals. Our analysis provides a direct mapping between the magnetoresistance signals and the tunneling times and aligns well with the interpretation in terms of generalized quantum measurements and quantum weak values. By means of an engineered preselection in one of the ferromagnetic contacts, we also elucidate how one can make the measurement ???weak??? by minimizing the backaction, whereas keeping the tunneling time unchanged. We then analyze the resulting interpretations of the tunneling time and the measurement backaction in the presence of phase breaking effects that are intrinsic to solid-state systems. We unravel that whereas the time-keeping aspect of the Larmor clock is reasonably undeterred due to momentum and phase relaxation processes, it degrades significantly in the presence of spin dephasing. We believe that the ideas presented here also open up a fructuous solid-state platform to encompass emerging ideas in quantum technology, such as quantum weak values and its applications that are currently exclusive to quantum optics and cold atoms.

TI Quantum-Optical Spectrometry in Relativistic Laser-Plasma Interactions
   Using the High-Harmonic Generation Process: A Proposal
SO PHOTONICS
AB Quantum-optical spectrometry is a recently developed shot-to-shot photon correlation-based method, namely using a quantum spectrometer (QS), that has been used to reveal the quantum optical nature of intense laser-matter interactions and connect the research domains of quantum optics (QO) and strong laser-field physics (SLFP). The method provides the probability of absorbing photons from a driving laser field towards the generation of a strong laser-field interaction product, such as high-order harmonics. In this case, the harmonic spectrum is reflected in the photon number distribution of the infrared (IR) driving field after its interaction with the high harmonic generation medium. The method was implemented in non-relativistic interactions using high harmonics produced by the interaction of strong laser pulses with atoms and semiconductors. Very recently, it was used for the generation of non-classical light states in intense laser-atom interaction, building the basis for studies of quantum electrodynamics in strong laser-field physics and the development of a new class of non-classical light sources for applications in quantum technology. Here, after a brief introduction of the QS method, we will discuss how the QS can be applied in relativistic laser-plasma interactions and become the driving factor for initiating investigations on relativistic quantum electrodynamics.

TI Encoding Information on the Excited State of a Molecular Spin Chain
SO ADVANCED FUNCTIONAL MATERIALS
AB The quantum states of nano-objects can drive electrical transport properties across lateral and local-probe junctions. This raises the prospect, in a solid-state device, of electrically encoding information at the quantum level using spin-flip excitations between electron spins. However, this electronic state has no defined magnetic orientation and is short-lived. Using a novel vertical nanojunction process, these limitations are overcome and this steady-state capability is experimentally demonstrated in solid-state spintronic devices. The excited quantum state of a spin chain formed by Co phthalocyanine molecules coupled to a ferromagnetic electrode constitutes a distinct magnetic unit endowed with a coercive field. This generates a specific steady-state magnetoresistance trace that is tied to the spin-flip conductance channel, and is opposite in sign to the ground state magnetoresistance term, as expected from spin excitation transition rules. The experimental 5.9 meV thermal energy barrier between the ground and excited spin states is confirmed by density functional theory, in line with macrospin phenomenological modeling of magnetotransport results. This low-voltage control over a spin chain's quantum state and spintronic contribution lay a path for transmitting spin wave-encoded information across molecular layers in devices. It should also stimulate quantum prospects for the antiferromagnetic spintronics and oxides electronics communities.

TI Functionalized Nanodiamonds for Targeted Neuronal Electromagnetic Signal
   Detection
SO ACS APPLIED MATERIALS & INTERFACES
AB Intracellular sensing technologies necessitate a delicate balance of spatial resolution, sensitivity, biocompatibility, and stability. While existing methods partially fulfill these criteria, none offer a comprehensive solution. Nanodiamonds (NDs) harboring nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers have emerged as promising candidates due to their sensing capabilities under biological conditions and their ability to meet all aforementioned requirements. This study focuses on expanding the application of NDs and NV center-based sensing to neuronal contexts by investigating their functionalization and subsequent effects on three distinct cell lines relevant to neurodegenerative disease research. Our study concentrates on positioning fluorescent NDs (FNDs) with NV center point defects onto neuronal cell surfaces. Achieving this through specific antibody attachment enhances the proximity of FND to neurites, facilitating the detection of local action potentials. Targeting voltage-dependent calcium channels (Cav2.2) with biotin-streptavidin-bound antibodies enables the precise positioning of FNDs. The functionalized FNDs (f-FNDs) show increased size and zeta potential, confirming the antibody presence without compromising cell viability. Two-color confocal imaging and co-localization algorithms are employed to further attest to the success of the functionalization. The f-FNDs are applied to cell cultures of three cell lines: SH-SY5Y, differentiated dopaminergic neurons, and hippocampal rat neurons; their biocompatibility and effects on synaptic activity are explored. Moreover, preliminary total internal reflection fluorescence - optically detected magnetic resonance (TIRF-ODMR) experiments across cellular sites demonstrate the magnetic field sensitivity of our sensor network. The successful establishment of this sensor network provides a platform for characterizing neuronal signaling in healthy models and conditions mimicking Parkinson's disease.

TI Tailored Multi-Color Dispersive Wave Formation in Quasi-Phase-Matched
   Exposed Core Fibers
SO ADVANCED SCIENCE
AB Widely wavelength-tunable femtosecond light sources in a compact, robust footprint play a central role in many prolific research fields and technologies, including medical diagnostics, biophotonics, and metrology. Fiber lasers are on the verge in the development of such sources, yet widespan spectral tunability of femtosecond pulses remains a pivotal challenge. Dispersive wave generation, also known as Cherenkov radiation, offers untapped potentials to serve these demands. In this work, the concept of quasi-phase matching for multi-order dispersive wave formation with record-high spectral fidelity and femtosecond durations is exploited in selected, partially conventionally unreachable spectral regions. Versatile patterned sputtering is utilized to realize height-modulated high-index nano-films on exposed fiber cores to alter fiber dispersion to an unprecedented degree through spatially localized, induced resonances. Nonlinear optical experiments and simulations, as well as phase-mismatching considerations based on an effective dispersion, confirm the conversion process and reveal unique emission features, such as almost power-independent wavelength stability and femtosecond duration. This resonance-empowered approach is applicable to both fiber and on-chip photonic systems and paves the way to instrumentalize dispersive wave generation as a unique tool for efficient, coherent femtosecond multi-frequency conversion for applications in areas such as bioanalytics, life science, quantum technology, or metrology.

TI Fuel fragmentation and relocation (FFR) model in SPACE code PART 2:
   Validation and sensitivity analyses
SO ANNALS OF NUCLEAR ENERGY
AB The new ECCS regulations were recently considered in South Korea. One of the major concerns in this revision is the consideration of fuel fragmentation, relocation, and dispersal (FFRD) phenomena during a loss of coolant accident (LOCA). In response, the FFR model was newly implemented in the SPACE code, which is a safety analysis code. The FFR model based on the QT model, which was developed by Quantum Technology Corporation, was developed with a threshold size of fuel fragments for fuel relocation, fuel power distribution, and so on. In this study, to validate the newly developed FFR model in SPACE code, calculations using Halden IFA-650 tests are conducted. Overall, the results show that the newly developed FFR model yields results that are consistent with experimental results in terms of fuel relocation and their effects on cladding temperature. However, when the cladding deformation is not well predicted, the fuel relocation prediction is poor. Thus, the cladding deformation is the most critical parameter for the FFR phenomena. In addition, for a fresh fuel condition, the threshold fragment size is additionally proposed in the fuel relocation model. For a better understanding of the FFR model behavior during a LOCA, some sensitivity tests for major FFR model parameters are conducted. This can give valuable information to develop FFR modeling in safety analysis methodology.

TI Laser spectroscopy of hot atomic vapours: from 'scope to theoretical fit
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB The spectroscopy of hot atomic vapours is a hot topic. Many of the work-horse techniques of contemporary atomic physics were first demonstrated in hot vapours. Alkali-metal atomic vapours are ideal media for quantum-optics experiments as they combine: a large resonant optical depth; long coherence times; and well-understood atom-atom interactions. These features aid with the simplicity of both the experimental set up and the theoretical framework. The topic attracts much attention as these systems are ideal for studying both fundamental physics and has numerous applications, especially in sensing electromagnetic fields and quantum technology. This tutorial reviews the necessary theory to understand the Doppler broadened absorption spectroscopy of alkali-metal atoms, and explains the data taking and processing necessary to compare theory and experiment. The aim is to provide a gentle introduction to novice scientists starting their studies of the spectroscopy of thermal vapours while also calling attention to the application of these ideas in the contemporary literature. In addition, the work of expert practitioners in the field is highlighted, explaining the relevance of three extensively-used software packages that complement the presentation herein.

TI Near-field detection of gate-tunable anisotropic plasmon polaritons in
   black phosphorus at terahertz frequencies
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Polaritons in two-dimensional layered crystals offer an effective solution to confine, enhance and manipulate terahertz (THz) frequency electromagnetic waves at the nanoscale. Recently, strong THz field confinement has been achieved in a graphene-insulator-metal structure, exploiting THz plasmon polaritons (PPs) with strongly reduced wavelength (lambda p approximate to lambda 0/66) compared to the photon wavelength lambda 0. However, graphene PPs propagate isotropically, complicating the directional control of the THz field, which, on the contrary, can be achieved exploiting anisotropic layered crystals, such as orthorhombic black-phosphorus. Here, we detect PPs, at THz frequencies, in hBN-encapsulated black phosphorus field effect transistors through THz near-field photocurrent nanoscopy. The real-space mapping of the thermoelectrical near-field photocurrents reveals deeply sub-wavelength THz PPs (lambda p approximate to lambda 0/76), with dispersion tunable by electrostatic control of the carrier density. The in-plane anisotropy of the dielectric response results into anisotropic polariton propagation along the armchair and zigzag crystallographic axes of black-phosphorus. The achieved directional subwavelength light confinement makes this material system a versatile platform for sensing and quantum technology based on nonlinear optics.
   Polaritons in 2D materials offer the possibility to confine and manipulate light in the terahertz (THz) range. Here, the authors report the observation of THz elliptic plasmon polaritons in 2D black phosphorus, showing deep subwavelength light confinement and anisotropic polariton propagation.

TI Analysis of plasmon modes in Bi2Se3/graphene
   heterostructures via electron energy loss spectroscopy
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Topological Insulators (TIs) are promising platforms for Quantum Technology due to their topologically protected surface states (TSS). Plasmonic excitations in TIs are especially interesting both as a method of characterisation for TI heterostructures, and as potential routes to couple optical and spin signals in low-loss devices. Since the electrical properties of the TI surface are critical, tuning TI surfaces is a vital step in developing TI structures that can be applied in real world plasmonic devices. Here, we present a study of Bi2Se3/graphene heterostructures, prepared using a low-cost transfer method that reliably produces mono-layer graphene coatings on Bi2Se3 flakes. Using both Raman spectroscopy and electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS), we show that the graphene layer redshifts the energy of the \documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$\pi$$\end{document} plasmon mode in Bi2Se3, creating a distinct surface plasmon that differs significantly from the behaviour of a TI-trivial insulator boundary. We demonstrate that this is likely due to band-bending and electron transfer between the TI surface and the graphene layer. Based on these results, we outline how graphene overlayers can be used to create tuneable, stable plasmonic materials based on topological insulators.

TI Enhancement of Terahertz radiation due to excitation of SPW on graphene
   strip coated on GaAs structure
SO RESULTS IN OPTICS
AB The present study proposes a methodology for improving terahertz (THz) radiation through the utilisation of a laser directed towards a graphene strip that has been coated onto a GaAs structure. The presence of a nonuniform voltage results in the production of a transient current when the laser interacts with GaAs material. The generation of THz radiation is attributed to the current that is produced along the length of GaAs structures. Concurrently, a portion of the laser beam interacts with the graphene strip, inducing a surface plasma wave (SPW) that propagates along the surface of the graphene. The amplitude of the SPW experiences an exponential decay as it travels away from the interface in both the media. The impact of the transverse electric field of surface plasmon waves in graphene on the transient current in GaAs material has been observed to enhance THz radiation. The frequency of the SPW increases in a parabolic manner as the graphene strip increases with rises with rise in propagation vector. The plasmonics (Graphene plasmons: GPs) approach used for the proposed model enables us to making the emitted radiation suitable for Terahertz spectroscopy, imaging and non-destructive testing, Highspeed data transfer, Terahertz microscopy, Terahertz microscopy, Terahertz microscopy, Quantum technology.

TI Advanced Numerical and Experimental Analysis of Ultra-Miniature Surface
   Resonators
SO APPLIED COMPUTATIONAL ELECTROMAGNETICS SOCIETY JOURNAL
AB Many scientific and technological applica-tions make use of strong microwave fields. These are often realized in conjunction with microwave resonators that have small geometric features in which such fields are generated. For example, in magnetic resonance, large microwave and RF magnetic fields make it possible to achieve fast control over the measured electron or nuclear spins in the sample and to detect them with high sensitivity. The numerical analysis of resonators with small geometric features can pose a significant challenge. This paper describes a general method of analysis and characterization of surface microresonators in the context of electron spin resonance (ESR) spec-troscopy and spin-based quantum technology. Our anal-ysis is based on the Electric Field Integral Equation (EFIE) and the Poggio-Miller-Chang-Harrington-Wu-Tsai (PMCHWT) formulation. In particular, we focus on a class of resonator configurations that possesses extremely small subwavelength features, which normally would require an ultra-fine mesh. We present several effi-cient techniques to numerically model, solve, and ana-lyze these types of configurations for both normal and superconducting structures. The validation of these tech-niques is established both numerically and experimen-tally by the S11 parameters as well as the provision of direct mapping of the resonator's microwave magnetic field component using a unique electron spin resonance micro-imaging method.

AB Photonic integrated circuits (PICs) have experienced an exponential growth in a number of applications, including telecom/datacom, LiDAR, optical sensing/metrology and quantum technology. Most materials and platforms commonly used in integrated photonics, such as silicon-on-insulator (SOI), silicon nitride (Si3N4) and indium phosphide (InP) do not show transmission below similar to 400 nm, hindering the development of PICs operating in the ultraviolet wavelength range. Furthermore, devices in this wavelength range also require fast modulation and switching in order to enable complex emerging applications.
   Aluminum nitride (AlN) is a material with a band gap of 6.2 eV, exhibiting a wide transparency window, from the ultraviolet to the mid-infrared. AlN has the capacity to achieve high electro-optic[1], non-linear[2] and piezo-electric[3,4] coefficients, which makes AlN an interesting material for PICs with operation down to the ultraviolet wavelength range. However, high losses have prevented PICs from benefiting from its excellent optical properties.
   In this work, we present our work on the sputter deposition of low-loss AlN slab waveguides. The optical performance of AlN sputtered slab waveguides after annealing at different temperatures and their relation with the film morphology will be discussed. Preliminary slab propagation losses as low as 1.5 dB/cm at 633 nm of wavelength have been demonstrated.

TI Prospects for assembling ultracold radioactive molecules from
   laser-cooled atoms
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB Molecules with unstable isotopes often contain heavy and deformed nuclei and thus possess a high sensitivity to parity-violating effects, such as the Schiff moments. Currently the best limits on Schiff moments are set with diamagnetic atoms. Polar molecules with quantum-enhanced sensing capabilities, however, can offer better sensitivity. In this work, we consider the prototypical (FrAg)-Fr-223-Ag-107 molecule, as the octupole deformation of the unstable Fr-223 francium nucleus amplifies the nuclear Schiff moment of the molecule by two orders of magnitude relative to that of spherical nuclei and as the silver atom has a large electron affinity. To develop a competitive experimental platform based on molecular quantum systems, Fr-223 atoms and Ag-107 atoms have to be brought together at ultracold temperatures. That is, we explore the prospects of forming (FrAg)-Fr-223-Ag-107 from laser-cooled Fr and Ag atoms. We have performed fully relativistic electronic-structure calculations of ground and excited states of FrAg that account for the strong spin-dependent relativistic effects of Fr and the strong ionic bond to Ag. In addition, we predict the nearest-neighbor densities of magnetic-field Feshbach resonances in ultracold Fr-223 + Ag-107 collisions with coupled-channel calculations. These resonances can be used for magneto-association into ultracold, weakly-bound FrAg. We also determine the conditions for creating (FrAg)-Fr-223-Ag-107 molecules in their absolute ground state from these weakly-bound dimers via stimulated Raman adiabatic passage using our calculations of the relativistic transition electric dipole moments.

SO MATERIALS FOR QUANTUM TECHNOLOGY
AB Nitrogen vacancy (NV) color centers in diamond have shown great potential for various applications in quantum technology due to their long coherence times, high sensitivity to magnetic fields and atomic scale resolution. However, one major challenge in utilizing near surface NV centers is the decoherence caused by spins and charges fluctuating on the surface, which affects the spin properties of the sensors. To reduce the induced noise, various oxygen surface treatments such as low power oxygen plasma treatment and annealing under oxygen atmosphere have been explored to terminate the diamond surface and reduce its impact on NV coherence. We showed that the NV center's coherence time can be enhanced up to a factor of 3 over a large spectral range of noise. Double electron-electron resonance measurements revealed an extra source of decoherence, scaling similarly as the P1 spin bath. The improvement in coherence times is accompanied with an increase in measured ketone/ether content and reduction of sp2 signal in x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy measurements. Finally we compared the performance of different NV ensembles and surface treatments for sensing external proton spins. The oxygen annealing is an effective procedure of enhancing the spin coherence times and reducing broad band spin noise experienced by shallow implanted ensemble NV centers in diamond.

TI Experimental evidence for a current-biased Josephson junction acting as
   either a macroscopic boson or fermion
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB It is well known that elementary particles in the real 3 + 1 -dimensional world are either bosons or fermions, without exception, and not both. Here, we show that a quantized current -biased Josephson junction (CBJJ), as an artificial macroscopic "particle," can serve as either a boson or a fermion or the combination, depending on the amplitude of the biased dc current. By using high vacuum two -angle electron beam evaporations, we fabricated CBJJ devices and calibrated their physical parameters by applying low -frequency signal drivings. At 50 mK temperature environment, the microwave transmission characteristics of the fabricated CBJJ devices were measured at the low power limit. The experimental results verify the relevant theoretical predictions, i.e., when the bias current is significantly lower than the critical ones of the junctions, the device works in a very linear regime and thus behaves as a harmonic oscillator "boson"; while if the biased current is sufficiently large (especially approaching the junctions' critical currents), the device works manifestly in the nonlinear regime and thus behaves as a two -level artificial atom "fermion." Therefore, by adjusting the biased dc current, the CBJJ device can be effectively switched from a Bose -type macroscopic particle to a Fermi -type one and thus might open an approach for quantum technology applications at a macroscopic scale.

TI A 0.32 x 0.12 mm2 Cryogenic BiCMOS 0.1-8.8 GHz Low Noise
   Amplifier Achieving 4 K Noise Temperature for SNWD Readout
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON MICROWAVE THEORY AND TECHNIQUES
AB A significant number of cryogenic low -noise amplifiers (cryo-LNAs) are required for the readout of superconducting nanowire detector (SNWD) arrays. It is desirable to have compact cryo-LNAs in place so that the size of the readout circuitry for the SNWD array can be reduced. In this study, we first examined the bandwidth, linearity, and noise requirements of the cryo-LNA for SNWD readout. After that, the design and implementation of a wideband silicon- germanium (SiGe) BiCMOS cryo-LNA were described in detail. The LNA features two cascode stages with resistive shunt- shunt feedback for wideband input impedance matching. The capacitive peaking techniques and emitter inductive degeneration via a slab inductor were utilized to increase the bandwidth without compromising the layout's compactness. To ensure the amplifier works well at cryogenic temperatures, we modified the model parameters from the foundry -provided models based on the device's reported cryogenic test data. The measurement results at 3.6 K demonstrate that the cryo-LNA, occupying a core size of only 0.03 mm(2), achieves a noiseequivalent temperature (NET) of 4-10 K and an average gain of 30.5 dB in the frequency band from 0.1 to 8.8 GHz, under a power consumption of 8.2 mW. We successfully integrated this LNA with a quantum sensor array on a printed circuit board (PCB) and obtained favorable test results, demonstrating the potential application of LNAs for reading large-scale SNWDs.

TI First evaluation of near-real-time photosynthetically active radiation
   from Himawari remote sensing observations under different aerosol,
   precipitable water, and cloud conditions in the tropical environment of
   Thailand
SO AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
AB This study presents the first comprehensive assessment of near-real-time photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) derived from Himawari satellite products (PAR(Himawari)) in the complex tropical environment of Thailand, which is characterized by variable aerosol concentration, precipitable water vapor, and cloud movement. Level 2.0 quality-assured PAR(Himawari) data were validated against ground-based EKO quantum sensor measurements (PAR(EKO)) at three regions (Chiang Mai, Nakhon Pathom, and Songkhla) from 2018 to 2022. Results show strong linear correlations between PAR(Himawari) and PAR(EKO) (R-2 > 0.7). However, the magnitude of estimates remains uncertain. The Nash-Sutcliffe equation (NSE) was negative at Chiang Mai (-1.10), indicating poor estimation performance, while moderate NSE values of 0.29 and 0.50 were found at Nakhon Pathom and Songkhla, respectively. The relative root mean square error (rRMSE) ranged from 33.15 % to 64.32 %, and the relative mean bias error (rMBE) ranged from 23.82 % to 55.09 %, suggesting systematic overestimation by the satellite product. Further analysis confirmed that PAR(Himawari) residuals increase with aerosol optical depth (AOD) and precipitable water vapor. For cloud optical thickness (COT), residuals median values were positive under clear-sky conditions, approached zero under intermediate sky conditions, and shifted negative under overcast conditions. Overall, PAR(Himawari) shows higher errors when providing high PAR values, underscoring the need for improved aerosol and moisture corrections to enhance satellite PAR retrievals in tropical environments for ecological and agricultural applications.

TI Small multimodal thermometry with detonation-created multi-color centers
   in detonation nanodiamond
SO APL MATERIALS
AB Detonation nanodiamond (DND) is the smallest class of diamond nanocrystal capable of hosting various color centers with a size akin to molecular pores. Their negatively charged nitrogen-vacancy center (NV-) is a versatile tool for sensing a wide range of physical and even chemical parameters at the nanoscale. The NV- is, therefore, attracting interest as the smallest quantum sensor in biological research. Nonetheless, recent NV- enhancement in DND has yet to yield sufficient fluorescence per particle, leading to efforts to incorporate other group-IV color centers into DND. An example is adding a silicon dopant to the explosive mixture to create negatively charged silicon-vacancy centers (SiV-). In this paper, we report on efficient observation (similar to 50% of randomly selected spots) of the characteristic optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) NV- signal in silicon-doped DND (Si-DND) subjected to boiling acid surface cleaning. The NV- concentration is estimated by continuous-wave electron spin resonance spectroscopy to be 0.35 ppm without the NV- enrichment process. A temperature sensitivity of 0.36K/Hz in an NV- ensemble inside an aggregate of Si-DND is achieved via the ODMR-based technique. Transmission electron microscopy survey reveals that the Si-DNDs core sizes are similar to 11.2 nm, the smallest among the nanodiamond's temperature sensitivity studies. Furthermore, temperature sensing using both SiV- (all-optical technique) and NV- (ODMR-based technique) in the same confocal volume is demonstrated, showing Si-DND's multimodal temperature sensing capability. The results of the study thereby pave a path for multi-color and multimodal biosensors and for decoupling the detected electrical field and temperature effects on the NV- center.

TI Subwavelength-engineered O-band silicon nitride photonic metacrystal
   cavities with large Q/V
SO OPTICS LETTERS
AB Silicon nitride is emerging as a leading material platform for next-generation photonics due to its wide transparency window and foundry compatibility. As this platform matures, it is imperative to develop photonic structures that increase light-matter interactions to reduce the footprint and power requirements for on-chip applications, including data communication and quantum information systems. We report on two subwavelength-engineered photonic metacrystal nanobeam cavities with high Q designed for O-band telecommunications wavelengths: a bowtie unit cell (loaded Q(L) = 5 x 10(4), fabricated critical dimension of 22nm) and an antislot unit cell (loaded Q(L) = 1 x 10(4), fabricated critical dimension of 55 nm). These unit cells are designed to better confine light and reduce mode volume by geometrically exploiting electromagnetic boundary conditions. We also demonstrate that further reducing the critical feature size or suspending the photonic metacrystals could produce a figure-of-merit Q/V greater than 10(6).

TI Optimizing light extraction from non-planar site-controlled pyramidal
   quantum dot system: comparative modeling of three fabricable geometries
SO MATERIALS FOR QUANTUM TECHNOLOGY
AB This work explores three different fabrication methods to improve light extraction efficiency of site-controlled pyramidal GaAs quantum dot (QD) system. In the theoretically analyzed structures (mimicking the as-obtained experimentally), we focus on the effects of geometry on light emission intensity, far-field profiles, and Purcell enhancement. The three methods include a back-etched approach, which exposes the pyramid's apex, a pillar fabrication process, and a 'mirrored' pyramid technique. Simulation results suggest that all three techniques have the potential to improve light extraction from as grown structures, with the pillar method offering the highest extraction efficiency (43% for a numerical aperture of 0.999) and the back-etched configuration exhibiting a strong Purcell enhancement effect. The mirrored pyramid method is also of interest, as it provides a promising alternative to the back-etched approach, potentially simplifying the integration of electrical contacts for tuning QD properties. Ultimately, we emphasize the importance of precise control over the fabrication process to optimize the performance of this QD system for future applications in quantum information processing.

TI Controlling nonergodicity in quantum many-body systems by reinforcement
   learning
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Finding optimal control strategies to suppress quantum thermalization for arbitrarily initial states, the so-called quantum nonergodicity control, is important for quantum information science and technologies. Previous control methods relied largely on theoretical model of the target quantum system, but invertible model approximations and inaccuracies can lead to control failures. We develop a model-free and deep reinforcement-learning (DRL) framework for quantum nonergodicity control. It is a machine-learning method with the unique focus on balancing exploration and exploitation strategies to maximize the cumulative rewards so as to preserve the initial memory in the time-dependent nonergodic metrics over a long stretch of time. We use the paradigmatic one-dimensional tilted Fermi-Hubbard system to demonstrate that the DRL agent can efficiently learn the quantum many-body system solely through the interactions with the environment. The optimal policy obtained by the DRL provides broader control scenarios for managing nonergodicity in the phase diagram as compared to, e.g., the specific protocol for Wannier-Stark localization. The continuous control protocols and observations are experimentally feasible. The model-free nature of DRL and its versatile search space for control functions render promising nonergodicity control in more complex quantum many-body systems.

TI How to Cross an Energy Barrier at Zero Kelvin without Tunneling Effect
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB This Letter deals with the broad class of magnetic systems having a single or collective spin S with an energy barrier, such as rare-earth elements and their compounds, single molecule magnets with uniaxial anisotropy, and more generally any other anisotropic quantum system made of single or multiple objects with discrete energy levels. Till now, the reversal of the magnetization of such systems at zero kelvin required making use of quantum tunneling with a significant transverse field or transverse anisotropy term, at resonance. Here, we show that another very simple method exists. It simply consists in the application of a particular sequence of electromagnetic radiations in the ranges of optical or microwave frequencies, depending on the characteristics of the system (spin and anisotropy values for magnetic systems). This produces oscillations of the Rabi type that pass above the barrier, thus extending these oscillations between the two energy wells with mixtures of all the 2S + 1 states. In addition to its basic character, this approach opens up new directions of research in quantum information with possible breakthroughs in the current use of multiple quantum bits.

TI Optical-parametric oscillation in photonic-crystal ring resonators
SO OPTICA
AB By-design access to laser wavelength, especially with integrated photonics, is critical to advance quantum sensors, such as optical clocks and quantum-information systems, and open opportunities in optical communication. Semiconductor-laser gain provides exemplary efficiency and integration but merely in developed wavelength bands. Alternatively, nonlinear optics requires control of phase matching, but the principle of nonlinear conversion of a pump laser to a designed wavelength is extensible. We report on laser-wavelength access by versatile customization of optical-parametric oscillation (OPO) with a photonic-crystal ring resonator (PhCR). Leveraging the exquisite control of laser propagation provided by a photonic crystal in a traveling-wave ring resonator, we enable OPO generation across a wavelength range of 1234-2093 nm with a 1550-nm pump and 1016-1110 nm with a 1064-nm pump. Moreover, our platform offers pump-to-sideband conversion efficiency of >10% and negligible additive optical-frequency noise across the output range. From laser design to simulation of nonlinear dynamics, we use a Lugiato-Lefever framework that predicts the system characteristics, including bidirectional OPO generation in the PhCR and conversion efficiency in agreement with our observations. Our experiments introduce broadband lasers by design with PhCR OPOs, providing critical functionalities in integrated photonics.

TI Coherent control of optical soliton interaction via electromagnetically
   induced transparency with spatial modulation
SO AIP ADVANCES
AB We propose a scheme to realize the coherent control of optical soliton propagation and interaction in a three level ? type electromagnetically induced transparency system with the control field being spatially modulated. We show that the spatial perturbation of the control field has no influence on the linear propagation properties and self-phase modulation of the probe field but can produce an equivalent external potential to affect the nonlinear propagation of the probe field. For single soliton propagation, we realize the transmission and trapping of optical solitons via external potential. For double soliton interaction, we realize the coherent control of attractive and repulsion interactions of two optical solitons and design an XNOR logical operation. Finally, for the triple soliton incident case, based on the coherent control of interaction between three solitons via external potential, we design a beam selector. The results obtained here are useful not only for the deep understanding of optical soliton interaction but also for applications in all optical quantum information processing. (c) 2021 Author(s).

TI Quantum Stochastic Processes and Quantum non-Markovian Phenomena
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB The field of classical stochastic processes forms a major branch of mathematics. Stochastic processes are, of course, also very well studied in biology, chemistry, ecology, geology, finance, physics, and many more fields of natural and social sciences. When it comes to quantum stochastic processes, however, the topic is plagued with pathological issues that have led to fierce debates amongst researchers. Recent developments have begun to untangle these issues and paved the way for generalizing the theory of classical stochastic processes to the quantum domain without ambiguities. This tutorial details the structure of quantum stochastic processes, in terms of the modern language of quantum combs, and is aimed at students in quantum physics and quantum-information theory. We begin with the basics of classical stochastic processes and generalize the same ideas to the quantum domain. Along the way, we discuss the subtle structure of quantum physics that has led to troubles in forming an overarching theory for quantum stochastic processes. We close the tutorial by laying out many exciting problems that lie ahead in this branch of science.

TI Quantum supercritical crossover with dynamical singularity
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB Bounded by crossover lines exhibiting universal scaling, the supercritical regime above the critical end point is characterized by strong fluctuations and intriguing phenomena. In this study, we extend this notable concept of supercritical crossover to the quantum critical end point (QCEP), by studying the prototypical mixed-field quantum Ising and Potts models through tensor network calculations and scaling analyses. We reveal the existence of quantum supercritical (QSC) crossover lines, determined by not only response functions but also quantum information quantities, near the QCEP. A supercritical scaling law, h similar to (g-gc)degrees, is found, where g (h) is the transverse (longitudinal) field, gc is the critical field, and degrees is the so-called gap exponent of the QCEP. Moreover, we demonstrate that the QSC crossover line acts as a boundary for the emergence of dynamical singularities in quench dynamics. This singularity manifests as a distinctive cusp with a critical exponent of 1/2, signaling a new dynamical universality class. We also propose utilizing Rydberg atom arrays as an experimental platform to observe these QSC crossovers and dynamical singularities. Our work establishes a theoretical framework for understanding the role of a QCEP and associated supercritical crossovers in both equilibrium and nonequilibrium quantum many-body systems.

TI Spin Squeezing with Itinerant Magnetic Dipoles
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW X
AB Entanglement can improve the measurement precision of quantum sensors beyond the shot noise limit. Neutral atoms, the basis of some of the most precise and accurate optical clocks and interferometers, do not naturally exhibit the all-to-all interactions traditionally used to generate such entangled states. On the other hand, these systems exhibit exceedingly high degrees of experimental control over parameters such as temperature, spatial entropy, and itinerancy. In this work, we investigate spin squeezing in a highly coherent itinerant system of neutral atoms with magnetic dipole-dipole interactions. We achieve 7.1 dB of metrologically useful squeezing using finite-range spin-exchange interactions in an erbium quantum gas microscope, and we demonstrate that introducing atomic motion, realizing a dipolar t-J model, protects the spin sector coherence at low fillings, significantly improving the achievable spin squeezing in a 2D dipolar system. This work's protocol can be implemented with most neutral atoms, opening the door to quantumenhanced metrology in other itinerant dipolar systems, such as molecules or optical lattice clocks, and serves as a novel method for studying itinerant quantum magnetism with long-range interactions.

TI Spin-polarized self-trapped excitons in low-dimensional cesium copper
   halide
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Spin polarized excitons induced by spin injection from magnetic ion to a single quantum dot, has been considered as a basic unit of quantum information transfer between spin and photon for spin-photonic applications. However, this state-of-the-art technology has only been found with limited coupling strength and weak excitonic emission. Here, we demonstrate a spin-polarized self-trapped exciton naturally formed in the zero-dimensional lattice of cesium copper iodide. Upon excitation, the conversion from Cu+ ion to spin-1/2 Cu2+ ion results in an in-situ self-trapped exciton, which facilitates a local Jahn-Teller distortion and guarantees the strong spin-exciton coupling and near-unity excitonic emission efficiency. Consequently, a giant Zeeman splitting of -53 meV and an effective excitonic g-factor of -93.5 are observed from magneto-photoluminescence. More importantly, this nano-scale coupling can also be driven by an external electric field, which generates electroluminescence with a circular polarization of 44.5% at 4.2 K and 8% at 300 K. The spin-optic properties of this copper compound will stimulate the fabrication of next-generation spin-photonic devices based on self-trapped excitons.

TI Inverse design of polaritonic devices
SO APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS
AB Polaritons, arising from the strong coupling between excitons and photons within microcavities, hold promise for optoelectronic and all-optical devices. They have found applications in various domains, including low-threshold lasers and quantum information processing. To realize complex functionalities, non-intuitive designs for polaritonic devices are required. In this contribution, we use finite-difference time-domain simulations of the dissipative Gross-Pitaevskii equation, written in a differentiable manner, and combine it with an adjoint formulation. Such a method allows us to use topology optimization to engineer the potential landscape experienced by polariton condensates to tailor its characteristics on demand. The potential directly translates to a blueprint for a functional device, and various fabrication and optical control techniques can experimentally realize it. We inverse-design a selection of polaritonic devices, i.e., a structure that spatially shapes the polaritons into a flat-top distribution, a metalens that focuses a polariton, and a nonlinearly activated isolator. The functionalities are preserved when employing realistic fabrication constraints such as minimum feature size and discretization of the potential. Our results demonstrate the utility of inverse design techniques for polaritonic devices, providing a stepping stone toward future research in optimizing systems with complex light-matter interactions.

TI Logarithmic entanglement scaling in dissipative free-fermion systems
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB We study the quantum information spreading in one-dimensional free-fermion systems in the presence of localized thermal baths. We employ a nonlocal Lindblad master equation to describe the system-bath interaction, in the sense that the Lindblad operators are written in terms of the Bogoliubov operators of the closed system, and hence are nonlocal in space. The statistical ensemble describing the steady state is written in terms of a convex combination of the Fermi-Dirac distributions of the baths. Due to the singularity of the free-fermion dispersion, the steady-state mutual information exhibits singularities as a function of the system parameters. While the mutual information generically satisfies an area law, at the singular points it exhibits logarithmic scaling as a function of subsystem size. By employing the Fisher-Hartwig theorem, we derive the prefactor of the logarithmic scaling, which depends on the parameters of the baths and plays the role of an effective "central charge." This is upper bounded by the central charge governing ground-state entanglement scaling. We provide numerical checks of our results in the paradigmatic tight-binding chain and the Kitaev chain.

TI Spectral control of high order harmonics through non-linear propagation
   effects
SO APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS
AB High harmonic generation (HHG) in crystals has revealed a wealth of perspectives such as all-optical mapping of the electronic band structure, ultrafast quantum information, and the creation of all-solid-state attosecond sources. Significant efforts have been made to understand the microscopic aspects of HHG in crystals, whereas the macroscopic effects, such as non-linear propagation of the driving pulse and its impact on the HHG process, are often overlooked. In this work, we study macroscopic effects by comparing two materials with distinct optical properties, silicon (Si) and zinc oxide (ZnO). By scanning the focal position of 85 fs duration and 2.123 mu m wavelength pulses inside the crystals, (Z-scan) we reveal spectral shifts in the generated harmonics. We interpret the overall blueshift of the emitted harmonic spectrum as an imprint of the spectral modulation of the driving field on the high harmonics. This process is supported with numerical simulations. This study demonstrates that through manipulation of the fundamental driving field through non-linear propagation effects, precise control of the emitted HHG spectrum in solids can be realized. This method could offer a robust way to tailor HHG spectra for a range of applications.

TI Time-Resolved Calibration of Photon Detection Efficiency and Afterpulse
   Probability in 100 MHz Gated InGaAs/InP Single-Photon Avalanche Diodes
SO PHOTONICS
AB InGaAs/InP single-photon avalanche diodes (SPADs) are widely used in applications such as quantum information, deep-space communication, and LiDAR. However, the existence of afterpulsing effects leads to inaccuracies in the calibration of their performance, particularly in terms of photon detection efficiency (PDE). In this paper, we employ the capacitance-balancing method to achieve a 100 MHz gated InGaAs/InP SPAD and propose a time-correlated calibration method to measure its performance. The distribution of the afterpulse counts over time is predicted, enabling a valid distinction between photogenerated counts and error counts. A PDE higher than similar to 30% is reached with an afterpulse probability of similar to 15%, while the repetition frequency of the incident laser (f(laser)) changes from 1 MHz to 50 MHz. A comparison of the existing methodologies for calculating PDE reveals that PDE increases with f(laser). This increase is particularly pronounced when the PDE is high. However, under the time-correlated calibration scheme employed, the PDE remains almost constant, thereby validating the reliability of the results.

TI Signatures of rotating black holes in quantum superposition
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
AB A new approach for operationally studying the effects of spacetime in quantum superpositions of semiclassical states has recently been proposed by some of the authors. This approach was applied to the case of a (2 + 1)-dimensional Ba & ntilde;ados-Teitelboim-Zanelli (BTZ) black hole in a superposition of masses, where it was shown that a two-level system interacting with a quantum field residing in the spacetime exhibits resonant peaks in its response at certain values of the superposed masses. Here, we extend this analysis to a mass-superposed rotating BTZ black hole, considering the case where the twolevel system corotates with the black hole in a superposition of trajectories. We find similar resonances in the detector response function at rational ratios of the superposed outer horizon radii, specifically in the case where the ratio of the inner and outer horizons is fixed. This suggests a connection with Bekenstein's seminal conjecture concerning the discrete horizon spectra of black holes in quantum gravity, generalized to the case of rotating black holes. Our results further indicate that deeper insights into quantumgravitational phenomena may be accessible via tools in relativistic quantum information and curved spacetime quantum field theory.

TI Prediction of Two-Dimensional Janus Transition-Metal Chalcogenides:
   Robust Ferromagnetic Semiconductor with High Curie Temperature
SO MOLECULES
AB Two-dimensional (2D) ferromagnetic semiconductors (FM SCs) provide an ideal platform for the development of quantum information technology in nanoscale devices. However, many developed 2D FM materials present a very low Curie temperature (TC), greatly limiting their application in spintronic devices. In this work, we predict two stable 2D transition metal chalcogenides, V3Se3X2 (X = S, Te) monolayers, by using first-principles calculations. Our results show that the V3Se3Te2 monolayer is a robust bipolar magnetic SC with a moderate bandgap of 0.53 eV, while V3Se3S2 is a direct band-gap FM SC with a bandgap of 0.59 eV. Interestingly, the ferromagnetisms of both monolayers are robust due to the V-S/Se/Te-V superexchange interaction, and TCs are about 406 K and 301 K, respectively. Applying biaxial strains, the FM SC to antiferromagnetic (AFM) SC transition is revealed at 5% and 3% of biaxial tensile strain. In addition, their high mechanical, dynamical, and thermal stabilities are further verified by phonon dispersion calculations and ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) calculations. Their outstanding attributes render the V3Se3Y2 (Y = S, Te) monolayers promising candidates as 2D FM SCs for a wide range of applications.

TI Electron-correlation-induced nonclassicality of light from high-order
   harmonic generation
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We study the effect of electron -electron correlations on the quantum state of the light emitted from highharmonic generation (HHG). The quantum state of the emitted light is obtained by using a fully quantummechanical description of both the optical modes as well as the electronic system. This is different from the usual semiclassical description of HHG, which only treats the electronic target system quantum mechanically. Using the generic Fermi -Hubbard model, the strength of the electron -electron correlation can be treated as a parameter enabling us to investigate the two limiting cases of a completely uncorrelated phase and a correlated Mott -insulating phase. In the completely uncorrelated phase, the model reduces to a single -band tight -binding model in which only intraband currents contribute to the spectrum. In this limit, we analytically find that the emitted light is in a classical coherent state. In the Mott -insulating phase, a consideration of the photon statistics and squeezing of the emitted photonic state shows that the inter-Hubbard-subband current generates nonclassical light. In this sense, we show that electron -electron correlation can induce the generation of nonclassical states of light.

TI Ultrafast many- body bright-dark exciton transition in anatase TiO2
SO PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF
   AMERICA
AB The momentum- forbidden dark excitons can have a pivotal role in quantum information processing, Bose-Einstein condensation, and light- energy harvesting. Anatase TiO2 with an indirect band gap is a prototypical platform to study bright to momentum- forbidden dark exciton transition. Here, we examine, by GW plus the real -time Bethe-Salpeter equation combined with the nonadiabatic molecular dynamics (GW + rtBSE- NAMD), the many -body transition that occurs within 100 fs from the optically excited bright to the strongly bound momentum- forbidden dark excitons in anatase TiO2. Comparing with the single- particle picture in which the exciton transition is considered to occur through electron-phonon scattering, within the GW + rtBSE-NAMD framework, the many -body electron-hole Coulomb interaction activates additional exciton relaxation channels to notably accelerate the exciton transition in competition with other radiative and nonradiative processes. The existence of dark excitons and ultrafast bright-dark exciton transitions sheds insights into applications of anatase TiO2 in optoelectronic devices and light- energy harvesting as well as the formation process of dark excitons in semiconductors.

TI Achieving quantum advantage in a search for a violations of the Goldbach
   conjecture, with driven atoms in tailored potentials
SO SCIPOST PHYSICS CORE
AB The famous Goldbach conjecture states that any even natural number N greater than 2 can be written as the sum of two prime numbers p(I) and p(II). In this article we propose a quantum analogue device that solves the following problem: given a small prime p(I), identify a member N of a N-strong set even numbers for which N-p(I) is also a prime. A table of suitable large primes p(II) is assumed to be known a priori. The device realizes the Grover quantum search protocol and as such ensures a i & check;N quantum advantage. Our numerical example involves a set of 51 even numbers just above the highest even classical-numerically explored so far [T. O. e Silva, S. Herzog, and S. Pardi, Mathematics of Computation 83, 2033 (2013)]. For a given small prime number p(I) = 223, it took our quantum algorithm 5 steps to identify the number N = 4 x 1018 + 14 as featuring a Goldbach partition involving 223 and another prime, namely p(II) = 4x1018-239. Currently, our algorithm limits the number of evens to be tested simultaneously to N similar to ln(N): larger samples will typically contain more than one even that can be partitioned with the help of a given p(I), thus leading to a departure from the Grover paradigm.

TI Optimization Technology of Civil Aircraft Stand Assignment Based on
   MSCOEA Model
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVANCED COMPUTER SCIENCE AND APPLICATIONS
AB The Chinese aviation transportation industry is constantly developing towards multiple objectives and constraints. The conventional optimization method for stand assignment of civil aviation aircraft has low efficiency and can no longer meet practical needs. Based on this, the paper firstly focuses on the problem of convergence and uniformity in multi-objective optimization, and uses the multi-strategy algorithm to optimize the multi-strategy algorithm of Multi-strategy competitive- cooperative co-evolutionary algorithm (MSCOEA). Then, for the problem of high time complexity in the traditional chromosome coding mode, the characteristics of quantum evolution algorithm can be reduced by MSCOEA algorithm. Front the results, the prediction accuracy of the research method was above 90% on both the training and validation sets. With the increase of iterations, the final accuracy was 96.8% and 97.53%, respectively. This algorithm achieved the same performance as some other comparative algorithms in most of the objectives. The optimal flight allocation rate reached 98.4%. The mean, optimal value, and variance of the number of flights allocated to remote stands were 5.75E+00, 4.00E+00, and 1.04E+00, respectively, which were superior to other comparative algorithms. The deigned stand assignment optimization method achieves efficient stand assignment, and improves the allocation efficiency of large and multi-objective stands.

TI Performance study of variational quantum linear solver with an improved
   ansatz for reservoir flow equations
SO PHYSICS OF FLUIDS
AB This paper studies the performance of the variational quantum linear solver (VQLS) with an improved ansatz for discretized reservoir flow equations for the first time. First, we introduce the two typical flow equations in reservoir simulation, namely, the diffusion equation for pressure and the convection-dominated Buckley-Leverett equation for water saturation, and their commonly used finite volume or finite difference-based discretized linear equations. Then, we propose an improved ansatz in VQLS to enhance the convergence and accuracy of VQLS and a strategy of adjusting grid order to reduce the complexity of the quantum circuit for preparing the quantum state corresponding to the coefficient vector of the discretized reservoir flow equations. Finally, we apply the modified VQLS to solve the discretized reservoir flow equations by employing the Xanadu's PennyLane open-source library. Four numerical examples are implemented, and the results show that VQLS can calculate reservoir flow equations with high accuracy, and the improved ansatz significantly outperforms the original one. Moreover, we study the effects of reservoir heterogeneity, the number of ansatz layers, the equation type, and the number of shots on the computational performance. Limited by the current computing capacity, the number of grids subject to the involved number of quantum bits in the implemented examples is small; we will further explore this quantum algorithm to practical examples that require a large number of quantum bits in the future.

TI Room-Temperature Self-Cavity Lasing From Organic Spintronic Materials
SO LASER & PHOTONICS REVIEWS
AB Crystal defects in solid-state spintronic materials play a crucial role in altering the optical properties of their hosts, enabling widespread applications in the field of quantum information processing. While the majority of the leading platforms are inorganic, they come with limitations such as the challenging material preparations and insufficient amount of active spins. Here, pentacene-doped p-terphenyl (Pc:Ptp), an organic spintronic material with easy preparations and tailorable functionalities normally used for microwave quantum electronics, is demonstrated for the first time its ability of self-cavity laser emission at room temperature. The laser emission is characterized by strong polarization and anisotropy, attributed to the unique packing of the doped molecules (i.e., active spins) within the crystal. The optical coherence is found to be a figure of merit to distinguish the processes of the amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) and lasing in Pc:Ptp. This work highlights the potential of Pc:Ptp as a compact and efficient platform for light-matter interactions, offering significant promise for enhancing the performance of solid-state quantum devices based on the organic spintronic material.

TI Flying electron spin control gates
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB The control of "flying" (or moving) spin qubits is an important functionality for the manipulation and exchange of quantum information between remote locations on a chip. Typically, gates based on electric or magnetic fields provide the necessary perturbation for their control either globally or at well-defined locations. Here, we demonstrate the dynamic control of moving electron spins via contactless gates that move together with the spins. The concept is realized using electron spins trapped and transported by moving potential dots defined by a surface acoustic wave (SAW). The SAW strain at the electron trapping site, which is set by the SAW amplitude, acts as a contactless, tunable gate that controls the precession frequency of the flying spins via the spin-orbit interaction. We show that the degree of precession control in moving dots exceeds previously reported results for unconstrained transport by an order of magnitude and is well accounted for by a theoretical model for the strain contribution to the spin-orbit interaction. This flying spin gate permits the realization of an acoustically driven optical polarization modulator based on electron spin transport, a key element for on-chip spin information processing with a photonic interface.

TI Enhancement of quantum excitation transport by photonic nonreciprocity
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Enhanced interaction between two two-level emitters (e.g., atoms) by nonreciprocal photonic media can be of benefit to broad areas, from quantum information science to biological detection. Here we provide a detailed analysis on why nonreciprocal photon-mediated interaction enhances interatomic excitation transport efficiency. We investigate a system consisting of two two-level emitters embedded in a generic photonic environment. By comparing symmetric and asymmetric photon exchange, we analytically show that breaking electromagnetic reciprocity makes it possible for the cooperative decay rate to exceed the spontaneous decay rate, even in a translation-invariant homogeneous system. This means that the excitation of an emitter must decay mostly into the other emitter rather than leaking and dissipating into the reservoir photonic modes. We also provide an example where a chain of two-level emitters dominantly interacts via the reciprocal modes of a plasmonic waveguide. We then show that breaking reciprocity in such a system via driving a dc current through the plasmonic material can drastically increase the probability of photon emission from one emitter to another, leading to an order-of-magnitude enhancement in quantum energy-transport efficiency.

TI Creating boundaries along a synthetic frequency dimension
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB The exploration of topological boundary effects is one of the important aspects that could foster the development of future topological photonics devices. Here the authors propose a straightforward method to construct sharp boundaries in synthetic dimensions using a modulated ring resonator strongly coupled to an auxiliary ring.
   Synthetic dimensions have garnered widespread interest for implementing high dimensional classical and quantum dynamics on low-dimensional geometries. Synthetic frequency dimensions, in particular, have been used to experimentally realize a plethora of bulk physics effects. However, in synthetic frequency dimension there has not been a demonstration of a boundary which is of paramount importance in topological physics due to the bulk-edge correspondence. Here we construct boundaries in the frequency dimension of dynamically modulated ring resonators by strongly coupling an auxiliary ring. We explore various effects associated with such boundaries, including confinement of the spectrum of light, discretization of the band structure, and the interaction of boundaries with one-way chiral modes in a quantum Hall ladder, which exhibits topologically robust spectral transport. Our demonstration of sharp boundaries fundamentally expands the capability of exploring topological physics, and has applications in classical and quantum information processing in synthetic frequency dimensions.

TI Convexity of a certain operator trace functional
SO LINEAR ALGEBRA AND ITS APPLICATIONS
AB In this article the operator trace function Lambda(rr,s)(A)[K, M] := tr(K*A(tau)MA(T)K)(s) is introduced and its convexity and concavity properties are investigated. This function has a direct connection to several well-studied operator trace functions that appear in quantum information theory, in particular when studying data processing inequalities of various relative entropies. In the paper the interplay between Delta(r,s) and the well-known operator functions Gamma(p,s) and Psi(p,q,s) is used to study the stability of their convexity (concavity) properties. This interplay may be used to ensure that Lambda(s) is convex (concave) in certain parameter ranges when M = I or K = I. However, our main result shows that convexity (concavity) is surprisingly lost when perturbing those matrices even a little. To complement the main theorem, the convexity (concavity) domain of lambda itself is examined. The final result states that lambda(r,s) is never concave and it is convex if and only if r = 1 and s >= 1/2. (c) 2022 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI Room-temperature quantum nanoplasmonic coherent perfect absorption
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Light-matter superposition states obtained via strong coupling play a decisive role in quantum information processing, but the deleterious effects of material dissipation and environment-induced decoherence inevitably destroy coherent light-matter polaritons over time. Here, we propose the use of coherent perfect absorption under near-field driving to prepare and protect the polaritonic states of a single quantum emitter interacting with a plasmonic nanocavity at room temperature. Our scheme of quantum nanoplasmonic coherent perfect absorption leverages an inherent frequency specificity to selectively initialize the coupled system in a chosen plasmon-emitter dressed state, while the coherent, unidirectional and non-perturbing near-field energy transfer from a proximal plasmonic waveguide can in principle render the dressed state robust against dynamic dissipation under ambient conditions. Our study establishes a previously unexplored paradigm for quantum state preparation and coherence preservation in plasmonic cavity quantum electrodynamics, offering compelling prospects for elevating quantum nanophotonic technologies to ambient temperatures.
   Quantum states are incredibly sensitive to their environment, making them perfect for ultrasensitive quantum detection-if they can be maintained long enough. Here, the authors showed that they can 'immortalize' the excited state of a coupled light-matter system using a technique called 'coherent perfect absorption'.

TI A photonic engine fueled by entangled two atoms
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB Entangled states are an important resource for quantum information processing and for the fundamental understanding of quantum physics. An intriguing open question would be whether entanglement can improve the performance of quantum heat engines in particular. One of the promising platforms to address this question is to use entangled atoms as a non-thermal bath for cavity photons, where the cavity mirror serves as a piston of the engine. Here we theoretically investigate a photonic quantum engine operating under an effective reservoir consisting of quantum-correlated pairs of atoms. We find that maximally entangled Bell states alone do not help extract useful work from the reservoir unless some extra populations in the excited states or ground states are taken into account. Furthermore, high efficiency and work output are shown for the non-maximally entangled superradiant state, while negligible for the subradiant state due to lack of emitted photons inside the cavity. Our results provide insights in the role of quantum-correlated atoms in a photonic engine and present new opportunities in designing a better quantum heat engine.

TI Wigner function tomography via optical parametric amplification
SO OPTICA
AB Wigner function tomography is indispensable for characterizing quantum states, but its commonly used version, balanced homodyne detection, suffers from several weaknesses. First, it requires efficient detection, which is critical for measuring fragile non-Gaussian states, especially bright ones. Second, it needs a local oscillator, tailored to match the spatiotemporal properties of the state under test, and fails for multimode and broadband states. Herewe proposeWigner function tomography based on optical parametric amplification followed by direct detection. The method is immune to detection inefficiency and loss, and suitable for broadband, spatially and temporally multimode quantum states. To prove the principle, we experimentally reconstruct theWigner function of squeezed vacuum occupying a single mode of a strongly multimode state. We obtain a squeezing of 7.5 +/- 0.4 dB and purity of 0.91(-0.08)(+0.09) despite more than 97% loss caused mainly by filtering. Theoretically, we also consider the reconstruction of a squeezed single photon-a bright non-Gaussian state. Due to multimode parametric amplification, the method allows for simultaneous tomography of multiple modes. This makes it a powerful tool for optical quantum information processing.

TI Superior Resilience of Non-Gaussian Entanglement against Local Gaussian
   Noises
SO ENTROPY
AB Entanglement distribution task encounters a problem of how the initial entangled state should be prepared in order to remain entangled the longest possible time when subjected to local noises. In the realm of continuous-variable states and local Gaussian channels it is tempting to assume that the optimal initial state with the most robust entanglement is Gaussian too; however, this is not the case. Here we prove that specific non-Gaussian two-mode states remain entangled under the effect of deterministic local attenuation or amplification (Gaussian channels with the attenuation factor/power gain k i and the noise parameter m i for modes i = 1, 2) whenever k1 mu(2)(2) + k(2) mu(2)(1) < 1/4 (k(1) + k(2))(1 + k(1) k(2)), which is a strictly larger area of parameters as compared to where Gaussian entanglement is able to tolerate noise. These results shift the "Gaussian world" paradigm in quantum information science (within which solutions to optimization problems involving Gaussian channels are supposed to be attained at Gaussian states).

TI Vortices nucleation by inherent fluctuations in nematic liquid crystal
   cells
SO NONLINEAR DYNAMICS
AB Multistable systems are characterized by exhibiting domain coexistence, where each domain accounts for the different equilibrium states. In case these systems are described by vectorial fields, domains can be connected through topological defects. Vortices are one of the most frequent and studied topological defect points. Optical vortices are equally relevant for their fundamental features as beams with topological features and their applications in image processing, telecommunications, optical tweezers, and quantum information. A natural source of optical vortices is the interaction of light beams with matter vortices in liquid crystal cells. The rhythms that govern the emergence of matter vortices due to fluctuations are not established. Here, we investigate the nucleation mechanisms of the matter vortices in liquid crystal cells and establish statistical laws that govern them. Based on a stochastic amplitude equation, the law for the number of nucleated vortices as a function of anisotropy, voltage, and noise level intensity is set. Experimental observations in a nematic liquid crystal cell with homeotropic anchoring and a negative anisotropic dielectric constant under the influence of a transversal electric field show a qualitative agreement with the theoretical findings.

TI Level attraction and idler resonance in a strongly driven Josephson
   cavity
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Nonlinear Josephson circuits play a crucial role in the growing landscape of quantum information and technologies. The typical circuits studied in this field consist of qubits, whose anharmonicity is much larger than their linewidth, and also of parametric amplifiers, which are engineered with linewidths of tens of MHz or more. The regime of small anharmonicity but also narrow linewidth, corresponding to the dynamics of a high-Q Duffing oscillator, has not been extensively explored using Josephson cavities. Here, we use two-tone spectroscopy to study the susceptibility of a strongly driven high-Q Josephson microwave cavity. Under blue-detuned driving, we observe a shift of the cavity susceptibility, analogous to the AC Stark effect in atomic physics. When applying a strong red-detuned drive, we observe the appearance of an additional idler mode above the bifurcation threshold with net external gain. Strong driving of the circuit leads to the appearance of two exceptional points and a level attraction between the quasimodes of the driven cavity. Our results provide insights on the physics of driven nonlinear Josephson resonators and form a starting point for exploring topological physics in strongly-driven Kerr oscillators.

TI Acoustoelectric current in graphene nanoribbon due to Landau damping
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB We perform self-consistent analysis of the Boltzmann transport equation for momentum and energy in the hypersound regime i.e., ql >> 1 (q is the acoustic wavenumber and l is the mean free path). We investigate the Landau damping of acoustic phonons (LDOAP) in graphene nanoribbons, which leads to acoustoelectric current generation. Under a non-quantized field with drift velocity, we observed an acoustic phonon energy quantization that depends on the energy gap, the width, and the sub-index of the material. An effect similar to Cerenkov emission was observed, where the electron absorbed the confined acoustic phonon energy, causing the generation of acoustoelectric current in the graphene nanoribbon. A qualitative analysis of the dependence of the absorption coefficient and the acoustoelectric current on the phonon frequency is in agreement with experimental reports. We observed a shift in the peaks when the energy gap and the drift velocity were varied. Most importantly, a transparency window appears when the absorption coefficient is zero, making graphene nanoribbons a potential candidate for use as an acoustic wave filter with applications in tunable gate-controlled quantum information devices and phonon spectrometers.

TI Deterministic generation of genuine tri-partite hybrid atom-photon
   entanglement through dissipation
SO JOURNAL OF THE OPTICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA B-OPTICAL PHYSICS
AB The ability to deterministically generate genuine multi-partite entanglement is fundamental for the advancement of quantum information science. We show that the interaction between entangled twin beams of light and an atomic ensemble under conditions for electromagnetically induced transparency leads to the generation of genuine hybrid tri-partite entanglement between the two input fields and the atomic ensemble. In such a configuration, the system is driven through dissipation to a steady state given by the hybrid entangled state. To show the presence of the genuine hybrid entanglement, we introduce a new approach to treat the atomic operators that makes it possible to show a violation of a tri-partite entanglement criterion based on the properties of the two optical fields and collective properties of the atomic ensemble. Additionally, we show that while neither of the input optical fields exhibits single beam quadrature squeezing, as the fields propagate through the atomic medium, their individual quadratures can become squeezed and in some cases oscillate between the presence and absence of squeezing. Finally, we propose a technique to characterize the tri-partite entanglement through joint measurements of the fields leaving the atomic medium, making such an approach experimentally accessible.

TI Multifunctional Infrared Polarizer Based on Aligned Growth of
   High-Density Boron Nitride Nanotubes
SO ADVANCED SCIENCE
AB Boron nitride nanotubes (BNNTs) are an emerging mid-infrared optical material that exhibits significant potential in nanoscale resonators, lasers, detectors, and sensors due to the strong light-matter interactions induced by phonon polaritons (PhPs). However, the large-scale controllable synthesis and device applications of BNNTs still face huge challenges. In this study, a substrate-pretreated and boron source dual-catalyst infiltrated growth method, and a damage-free purification method toward the high-density and aligned BNNT (ABNNT) thin films is developed. The polarization sensitivity and linear dichroism characteristics of BNNTs with a maximum anisotropy ratio of 4.53 in the mid-infrared and near-infrared regions are comprehensively verified. The nanotube-alignment induced permittivity anisotropy outside RB and the near-isotropic PhP absorption within RB enable a wavelength-selective polarizer and absorber throughout a broad infrared range. Uniquely, the BNNT polarizer exhibits excellent stability of polarization dichroism under severe bending conditions, demonstrating great potential in flexible and wearable optical devices. This work can initiate the utilization of high-density BNNT thin films in quantum information processing and high-resolution infrared imaging applications.

TI Eigenvalue Spectra of Rabi Models with Infinite Matrix Representations
SO AXIOMS
AB We investigate the relationship between confluent Heun functions and the eigenvalue spectra of infinite matrices related to the semi-classical and quantum Rabi models, revealing distinct connections in each case. In the semi-classical model, the eigenvalues are explicitly expressed through confluent Heun functions, whereas in the quantum Rabi model, they are determined by zeros of a condition involving confluent Heun functions. Our findings establish a unified framework for solving the eigenvalue problem of infinite-dimensional unbounded matrices related to the Rabi models. We derive some new identities for confluent Heun functions, enabling simplifications and broader applications in mathematics and physics. The explicit eigenvalue expressions in the semi-classical case align with approximate results from earlier studies, while the derived conditions for the quantum model provide a concise and unified form, encompassing special cases that are typically treated as exceptions. We also discuss the energy spectrum of the quantum Rabi model, uncovering intriguing phenomena and patterns. Our results deepen the understanding of Rabi models and extend their potential applications in quantum optics and quantum information.

TI Does a Bell inequality violation imply irrealism?
SO PHYSICA SCRIPTA
AB Seminal for the raising of the quantum information age and quintessential for a deep understanding of nature, Bell inequality violations are known for having provided a profound disruption to classical models of the physical world. Yet, their meaning is still debatable nowadays. An important point under dispute in this context concerns the relevance of realism. While some believe that a Bell inequality violation implies the manifestation of nonlocal aspects, others defend that it is the notion of realism that should be abandoned. The purpose of the present work is to shed some light on the matter by employing a formal definition of (ir)realism. Our strategy consists of (i) rephrasing Bell's assumption of local causality in terms of more primitive hypotheses and (ii) assessing where the fundamental difficulties emerge when using the quantum formalism. We analyze the question posed in the title using two distinct approaches and assert that a positive answer is justifiable. Nevertheless, even in this scenario, it becomes evident that violations of locality cannot be avoided. As a byproduct of our approach, the connections of (ir)realism with both quantum steering and entanglement are also discussed.

TI Sample-Efficient Device-Independent Quantum State Verification and
   Certification
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Authentication of quantum sources is a crucial task in building reliable and efficient protocols for quantum-information processing. Steady progress vis-a-vis verification of quantum devices in the scenario with fully characterized measurement devices has been observed in recent years. When it comes to the scenario with uncharacterized measurements, the so-called black-box scenario, practical verification methods are still rather scarce. Development of self-testing methods is an important step forward, but these results so far have been used for reliable verification only by considering the asymptotic behavior of large, identically and independently distributed (IID) samples of a quantum resource. Such strong assumptions deprive the verification procedure of its truly device-independent character. In this paper, we develop a systematic approach to device-independent verification of quantum states free of IID assumptions in the finite copy regime. Remarkably, we show that device-independent verification can be performed with optimal sample efficiency. Finally, for the case of independent copies, we develop a device-independent protocol for quantum state certification: a protocol in which a fragment of the resource copies is measured to warrant the rest of the copies to be close to some target state.

TI Quantum approximate optimization algorithm with random and subgraph
   phase operators
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB The quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) is a promising quantum algorithm that can be used to approximately solve combinatorial optimization problems. The usual QAOA ansatz consists of an alternating application of the cost and mixer Hamiltonians. In this work, we study how using Hamiltonians other than the usual cost Hamiltonian, dubbed custom phase operators, can affect the performance of the QAOA. We derive an expected value formula for the QAOA with custom phase operators at p = 1 and show numerically that some of these custom phase operators can achieve higher approximation ratios than the original algorithm implementation. Out of all the graphs tested at p = 1, 0.036% of the random custom phase operators, 75.9% of the subgraph custom phase operators, 95.1% of the triangle-removed custom phase operators, and 93.9% of the maximal degree edge-removed custom phase operators have a higher approximation ratio than the original QAOA implementation. Furthermore, we numerically simulate these phase operators for p = 2 and p = 3 levels of QAOA and find that there exist a large number of subgraph, triangle-removed, and maximal degree edge-removed custom phase operators that have a higher approximation ratio than the QAOA at the same depth. These findings open up the question of whether better phase operators can be designed to further improve the performance of the QAOA.

TI Single-Query Quantum Hidden Shift Attacks
SO IACR TRANSACTIONS ON SYMMETRIC CRYPTOLOGY
AB Quantum attacks using superposition queries are known to break many classically secure modes of operation. While these attacks do not necessarily threaten the security of the modes themselves, since they rely on a strong adversary model, they help us to draw limits on their provable security. Typically these attacks use the structure of the mode (stream cipher, MAC or authenticated encryption scheme) to embed a period-finding problem, which can be solved with a dedicated quantum algorithm. The hidden period can be recovered with a few superposition queries (e.g., O(n) for Simon's algorithm), leading to state or key-recovery attacks. However, this strategy breaks down if the period changes at each query, e.g., if it depends on a nonce. In this paper, we focus on this case and give dedicated state-recovery attacks on the authenticated encryption schemes Rocca, Rocca-S, Tiaoxin-346 and AEGIS128L. These attacks rely on a procedure to find a Boolean hidden shift with a single superposition query, which overcomes the change of nonce at each query. This approach has the drawback of a lower success probability, meaning multiple independent (and parallelizable) runs are needed. We stress that these attacks do not break any security claim of the authors, and do not threaten the schemes if the adversary only makes classical queries.

TI Quantum reservoir probing: An inverse paradigm of quantum reservoir
   computing for exploring quantum many-body physics
SO SCIPOST PHYSICS
AB Quantum reservoir computing (QRC) is a brain-inspired computational paradigm that exploits the natural dynamics of a quantum system for information processing. To date, a multitude of quantum systems have been utilized in QRC, with diverse computational capabilities demonstrated accordingly. This study proposes a reciprocal research direction: Probing quantum systems themselves through their information processing performance in the QRC framework. Building upon this concept, here we develop quantum reservoir probing (QRP), an inverse extension of the QRC. The QRP establishes an operator-level linkage between physical properties and computational performance. A systematic scan of this correspondence reveals the intrinsic quantum dynamics of the reservoir system from both computational and informational perspectives. Unifying quantum information and quantum matter, the QRP holds great promise as a potent tool for exploring various aspects of quantum many-body physics. In this study, we specifically apply it to analyze information propagation in a one-dimensional quantum Ising chain. We demonstrate that the QRP not only distinguishes between ballistic and diffusive information propagation, reflecting the system's dynamical characteristics, but also identifies system-specific information a distinct over conventional methods.

TI Horizon causality from holographic scattering in asymptotically

SO JOURNAL OF HIGH ENERGY PHYSICS
AB In the AdS/CFT correspondence, a direct scattering in the bulk may not have a local boundary analog. A nonlocal implementation on the boundary requires O(1/GN) mutual information. This statement is formalized by the connected wedge theorem, which can be proven using general relativity within AdS3 but also argued for using quantum information theory on the boundary, suggesting that the theorem applies to any holographic duality. We examine scattering within the static patch of asymptotically dS3 spacetime, which is conjectured to be described by a quantum theory on the stretched horizon in static patch holography. We show that causality on the horizon induced from null infinities I\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$ \mathcal{I} $$\end{document}+/- is consistent with the theorem.

TI One-dimensional topological phase and tunable soliton states in atomic
   nanolines on Si(001) surface
SO NPJ QUANTUM MATERIALS
AB Formation of exotic topological states on technologically important semiconductor substrate is significant from the aspects of both fundamental research and practical implementation. Here, we demonstrate one-dimensional (1D) topological phase and tunable soliton states in atomic nanolines self-assembled on Si(001) surface. By first-principles calculations and tight-binding modeling, we reveal that Bi nanolines provide an ideal system to realize a multi-orbital Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model, and the electronic properties can be modulated by substrate-orbital-filtering effect. The topological features are confirmed by nontrivial end states for a finite-length nanoline and (anti-)soliton states at the boundary of two topologically distinct phases. We demonstrate that solitons are highly mobile on the surface, and their formation could be controlled by surface B/N doping. As these nanolines can extend several micrometers long without kinks, and quantum transport simulations suggest clear signatures of topological states characterized by transmission resonance peaks, our work paves an avenue to achieve 1D topological phase compatible with semiconductor technology and to engineer the properties with high tunability and fidelity for quantum information processing.

TI Strain-driven Switching Between Antiferromagnetic States in Frustrated
   Antiferromagnet UO2 Probed by Exchange Bias Effect
SO ADVANCED FUNCTIONAL MATERIALS
AB Frustrated antiferromagnets offer a captivating platform to study the intricate relationship of magnetic interactions, geometric constraints, and emergent phenomena. By controlling spin orientations, these materials can be tailored for applications in spintronics and quantum information processing. The research focuses on the interplay of magnetic and exchange anisotropy effects in artificial heterostructures based on a canonical frustrated antiferromagnet, UO2. The potential to manipulate the spin directions in this material and switch between distinct antiferromagnetic (AFM) states is investigated using substrate-induced strain. The phenomenon is probed using exchange bias effects in stoichiometric UO2/Fe3O4 bilayers. By employing many-body first-principles calculations magnetic configurations in the UO2 layers are identified. Even a minor tetragonal distortion triggers a transition between AFM states of different symmetries, driven by a robust alteration of single-ion anisotropy due to the distortion. Consequently, this change influences the arrangement of magnetic moments at the UO2/Fe3O4 interface, affecting the magnitude of exchange bias. The findings showcase how epitaxial strain can effectively manipulate the AFM states in frustrated antiferromagnets by controlling single-site anisotropy.

TI Entangled spin-polarized excitons from singlet fission in a rigid dimer
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Singlet fission is recognized as an enabling process for next-generation solar cells. Here the authors design a molecular system where specific spin sub-levels can be initialized to produce a highly entangled state and demonstrate that the coherence between magnetic sub-levels of that state is preserved at higher temperatures than those encountered in conventional superconducting quantum hardware.
   Singlet fission, a process that splits a singlet exciton into a biexciton, has promise in quantum information. We report time-resolved electron paramagnetic resonance measurements on a conformationally well-defined acene dimer molecule, TIPS-BP1', designed to exhibit strongly state-selective relaxation to specific magnetic spin sublevels. The resulting optically pumped spin polarization is a nearly pure initial state from the ensemble. The long-lived spin coherences modulate the signal intrinsically, allowing a measurement scheme that substantially removes noise and uncertainty in the magnetic resonance spectra. A nonadiabatic transition theory with a minimal number of spectroscopic parameters allows the quantitative assignment and interpretation of the spectra. In this work, we show that the rigid dimer TIPS-BP1' supports persistent spin coherences at temperatures far higher than those used in conventional superconducting quantum hardware.

TI Information preservation of two qubits in a structured environment
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB The environment-induced decoherence of a quantum open system makes it fundamentally import to preserve the initial quantum information of the system in its steady state. Here we study information preservation of two maximally entangled qubits lying inside a photonic-crystal waveguide with semi-infinite cavity-array structure. We generalize our study to arbitrary position and arbitrary frequency detuning of the qubits. We find that for weak qubits-waveguide couplings, the information preservation greatly depends on the position and the frequency detuning of the qubits, while for strong couplings, both of these dependence is significantly weakened. Interestingly, by suitably choosing the position and the frequency of the qubits, high information preservation could be achieved for both weak and strong couplings, irrespective to Markovian or non-Markovian dynamics. Physically, we analytically verify that the ability of information preservation is indeed determined by the existence of the bound states of the entire system, but the probability of information preservation is closely related to the probability of the initial state of the qubits in the bound states. Our results provide an alternative route getting high information preservation without any external controls of the system.

TI Complexity, information geometry, and Loschmidt echo near quantum
   criticality
SO JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL MECHANICS-THEORY AND EXPERIMENT
AB We consider the Nielsen complexity (NC) C-N, the Loschmidt echo (LE) L, and the Fubini-study complexity tau in the transverse XY model, following a sudden quantum quench, in the thermodynamic limit. At small times, the first two are related by L similar to e(-CN). By computing a novel time-dependent quantum information metric, we show that in this regime, C-N similar to d tau(2), up to lowest order in perturbation. The former relation continues to hold in the same limit at large times, whereas the latter does not. Our results indicate that in the thermodynamic limit, the NC and the LE show enhanced temporal oscillations when one quenches from a close neighbourhood of the critical line, while such oscillations are notably absent when the quench is on such a line. We explain this behaviour by studying the nature of quasi-particle excitations in the vicinity of criticality. Finally, we argue that the triangle inequality for the NC might be violated in certain regions of the parameter space, and point out why one should be careful about the nature of the interaction Hamiltonian, while using this measure.

TI A model of interacting quantum neurons with a dynamic synapse
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB Motivated by recent advances in neuroscience, in this work, we explore the emergent behaviour of quantum systems with a dynamical biologically-inspired qubits interaction. We use a minimal model of two interacting qubits with an activity-dependent dynamic interplay as in classical dynamic synapses that induces the so-called synaptic depression, that is, synapses that present synaptic fatigue after heavy presynaptic stimulation. Our study shows that in absence of synaptic depression the two-qubits quantum system shows typical Rabi oscillations whose frequency decreases when synaptic depression is introduced, so one can trap excitations for a large period of time. This creates a population imbalance between the qubits even though the Hamiltonian is Hermitian. This imbalance can be sustained in time by introducing a small energy shift between the qubits. In addition, we report that long time entanglement between the two qubits raises naturally in the presence of synaptic depression. Moreover, we propose and analyse a plausible experimental setup of our two-qubits system which demonstrates that these results are robust and can be experimentally obtained in a laboratory.

TI Improved proof-by-contraction method and relative homologous entropy
   inequalities
SO JOURNAL OF HIGH ENERGY PHYSICS
AB The celebrated holographic entanglement entropy triggered investigations on the connections between quantum information theory and quantum gravity. An important achievement is that we have gained more insights into the quantum states. It allows us to diagnose whether a given quantum state is a holographic state, a state whose bulk dual admits semiclassical geometrical description. The effective tool of this kind of diagnosis is holographic entropy cone (HEC), an entropy space bounded by holographic entropy inequalities allowed by the theory. To fix the HEC and to prove a given holographic entropy inequality, a proof-by-contraction technique has been developed. This method heavily depends on a contraction map f, which is very difficult to construct especially for more-region (n >= 4) cases. In this work, we develop a general and effective rule to rule out most of the cases such that f can be obtained in a relatively simple way. In addition, we extend the whole framework to relative homologous entropy, a generalization of holographic entanglement entropy that is suitable for characterizing the entanglement of mixed states.

TI Quantifying resources for the Page-Wootters mechanism: Shared asymmetry
   as relative entropy of entanglement
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Recently, some attention has been given to the so-called Page-Wootters mechanism of quantum clocks. Among the various proposals to explore the mechanism using more modern techniques, some have chosen to use a quantum information perspective, defining and using informational measures to quantify how well a quantum system can stand as a reference frame for other quantum system. In this work, we explore the proposal based on a resource theory of asymmetry, known as mutual or shared asymmetry, which actually is equivalent to the approach from coherence theory in the case of interest here: quantum reference frames described by the U(1) compact group. We extend some previous results in the literature about shared asymmetry and the Page-Wootters mechanism to more general cases, culminating in the enunciation of a theorem relating shared asymmetry of a bipartite state rho(SR) with the relative entropy of entanglement of internal states rho(M) on the charge sectors of the Hilbert space H-S circle times H-R. Using this result, we reinterpret the relation between the Page-Wootters mechanism and entanglement, and we also open some paths to further studies.

TI Processing light with an optically tunable mechanical memory
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Mechanical systems are one of the promising platforms for classical and quantum information processing and are already widely-used in electronics and photonics. Cavity optomechanics offers many new possibilities for information processing using mechanical degrees of freedom; one of them is storing optical signals in long-lived mechanical vibrations by means of optomechanically induced transparency. However, the memory storage time is limited by intrinsic mechanical dissipation. More over, in-situ control and manipulation of the stored signals processing has not been demonstrated. Here, we address both of these limitations using a multi-mode cavity optomechanical memory. An additional optical field coupled to the memory modifies its dynamics through time-varying parametric feedback. We demonstrate that this can extend the memory decay time by an order of magnitude, decrease its effective mechanical dissipation rate by two orders of magnitude, and deterministically shift the phase of a stored field by over 2. This further expands the information processing toolkit provided by cavity optomechanics. The use of cavity optomechanics for optical information processing is hindered by mechanical dissipation and the difficulties in stored signal control. Here, the authors improve performances on both fronts using time-varying parametric feedback through an additional optical field in a multi-mode cavity.

AB There has been a very large body of research on searching a marked vertex on a graph based on quantum walks, and Grover's algorithm can be regarded as a quantum walk-based search algorithm on a special graph. However, the existing quantum walk-based search algorithms suffer severely from the souffle problem, which mainly means that the success probability of finding a marked vertex could shrink dramatically, even to zero, when the number of search steps is greater than the right one, thus heavily reducing the robustness and practicability of the algorithm. Surprisingly, while the souffle problem of Grover's algorithm has attracted enough attention, how to address this problem for general quantum walk-based search algorithms is missing in the literature. Here we initiate the study of overcoming the souffle problem for quantum walk-based search algorithms by presenting a quantum walk-based search framework that achieves robustness without sacrificing the quantum speedup. In this framework, for any adjustable parameter epsilon, the quantum algorithm can find a marked vertex on an N-vertex complete bipartite graph with probability at least 1 - epsilon, whenever the number of search steps h satisfies h >= ln(2/root epsilon)root N + 1. Note that the algorithm need not know the exact number of marked vertices. Consequently, we obtain quantum search algorithms with stronger robustness and practicability.

TI van der Waals Decoration of Ultra-High-Q Silica Microcavities for
   χ(2)-χ(3) Hybrid Nonlinear Photonics
SO NANO LETTERS
AB Optical nonlinear processes are indispensable in a wide range of applications, including ultrafast lasers, microscopy, and quantum information technologies. Among the diverse nonlinear processes, second-order effects usually overwhelm the higher-order ones, except in centrosymmetric systems, where the second-order susceptibility vanishes to allow the use of the third-order nonlinearity. Here we demonstrate a hybrid photonic platform whereby the balance between second- and third-order susceptibilities can be tuned flexibly. By decorating ultra-high-Q silica microcavities with atomically thin tungsten diselenide, we observe cavity-enhanced second-harmonic generation and sum-frequency generation with continuous-wave excitation at a power level of only a few hundred microwatts. We show that the coexistence of second- and third-order nonlinearities in a single device can be achieved by carefully choosing the size and location of the two-dimensional material. Our approach can be generalized to other types of cavities, unlocking the potential of hybrid systems with controlled nonlinear susceptibilities for novel applications.

TI Extracting many-body quantum resources within one-body reduced density
   matrix functional theory
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Quantum Fisher information (QFI) is a central concept in quantum sciences used to quantify the ultimate precision limit of parameter estimation, detect quantum phase transitions, witness genuine multipartite entanglement, or probe nonlocality. Despite this widespread range of applications, computing the QFI value of quantum many-body systems is, in general, a very demanding task. Here we combine ideas from functional theories and quantum information to develop a functional framework for the QFI of fermionic and bosonic ground states. By relying upon the constrained-search approach, we demonstrate that the QFI matrix terms can universally be determined by the one-body reduced density matrix (1-RDM), thus avoiding the use of exponentially large wave functions. Furthermore, we show that QFI functionals can be determined from the universal 1-RDM functional by calculating its derivatives with respect to the coupling strengths, thus becoming the generating functional of the QFI. We showcase our approach with the Bose-Hubbard model and present exact analytical and numerical QFI functionals. Our results provide the first connection between the one-body reduced density matrix functional theory and the quantum Fisher information.

TI A Numerical Study of Quantum Entropy and Information in the
   Wigner-Fokker-Planck Equation for Open Quantum Systems
SO ENTROPY
AB Kinetic theory provides modeling of open quantum systems subject to Markovian noise via the Wigner-Fokker-Planck equation, which is an alternate of the Lindblad master equation setting, having the advantage of great physical intuition as it is the quantum equivalent of the classical phase space description. We perform a numerical inspection of the Wehrl entropy for the benchmark problem of a harmonic potential, since the existence of a steady state and its analytical formula have been proven theoretically in this case. When there is friction in the noise terms, no theoretical results on the monotonicity of absolute entropy are available. We provide numerical results of the time evolution of the entropy in the case with friction using a stochastic (Euler-Maruyama-based Monte Carlo) numerical solver. For all the chosen initial conditions studied (all of them Gaussian states), up to the inherent numerical error of the method, one cannot disregard the possibility of monotonic behavior even in the case under study, where the noise includes friction terms.

TI Optically Addressing Exciton Spin and Pseudospin in Nanomaterials for
   Spintronics Applications
SO ACS APPLIED OPTICAL MATERIALS
AB Oriented exciton spins that can be generated and manipulated optically are of interest for a range of applications, including spintronics, quantum information science, and neuromorphic computing architectures. Although materials that host such excitons often lack practical coherence times for use on their own, strategic transduction of the magnetic information across interfaces can combine fast modulation with longer-term storage and readout. Several nanostructure systems have been put forward due to their interesting magneto-optical properties and their possible manipulation using circularly polarized light. These material systems are presented here, namely two-dimensional (2D) systems due to the unique spin-valley coupling properties and quantum dots for their exciton fine structure. 2D magnets are also discussed for their anisotropic spin behavior and extensive 2D magnetic states that are not yet fully understood but could pave the way for emergent techniques of magnetic control. This review also details the experimental and theoretical tools to measure and understand these systems along with a discussion on the progress of optical manipulation of spins and magnetic order transitions.

TI Discrete Elemental Distributions inside a Single Mixed-Halide Perovskite
   Nanocrystal for the Self-Assembly of Multiple Quantum-Light Sources
SO NANO LETTERS
AB An in-depth understanding of the structure-property relationships in semiconductor mixed-halide perovskites is critical for their potential applications in various light-absorbing and light-emitting optoelectronic devices. Here we show that during the crystal growth of mixed-halide CsPbBr1.2I1.8 nanocrystals (NCs), abundant Ruddlesden-Popper (RP) plane stacking faults are formed to release the lattice strain. These RP planes hinder the exchange of halide species across them, resulting in the presence of multiple nanodomains with discrete mixed-halide compositions inside a single CsPbBr1.2I1.8 NC. Photoluminescence peaks from these pre-segregated nanodomains, whose correlated intensity and wavelength variations signify the interactions of coupled quantum dots within a single CsPbBr1.2I1.8 NC, can be simultaneously resolved at cryogenic temperature. Our findings thus point to a fascinating scenario in which a semiconductor nanostructure can be further divided into multiple quantum-light sources, the interaction and manipulation of which will promote novel photophysics to facilitate their potential applications in quantum information technologies.

TI Mollow triplets under few-photon excitation
SO OPTICA
AB Resonant excitation is an essential tool in the development of semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) for quantum information processing. One central challenge is to enable transparent access to the QD signal without post-selection information loss. A viable path is through cavity enhancement, which has successfully lifted the resonantly scattered field strength over the laser background under weak excitation. Here, we extend this success to the saturation regime using a QD-micropillar device with a Purcell factor of 10.9 and ultra-low background cavity reflectivity of just 0.0089 +/- 0.0001. We achieve a signal to background ratio of 55 and overall system responsivity of 3.01 +/- 0.08%, i.e., we detect on average 0.03 resonantly scattered single photons for every incident laser photon. Raising the excitation to the few-photon level, the QD response is brought into saturation where we observe Mollow triplets as well as the associated cascaded single photon emissions, without resorting to any laser background rejection technique. Our work offers a perspective on a QD cavity interface that is not restricted by the laser background. (c) 2023 Optica Publishing Group under the terms of the Optica Open Access Publishing Agreement

TI Regression of high-dimensional angular momentum states of light
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB The orbital angular momentum (OAM) of light is an infinite-dimensional degree of freedom of light with several applications in both classical and quantum optics. However, to fully take advantage of the potential of OAM states, reliable detection platforms to characterize generated states in experimental conditions are needed. Here, we present an approach to reconstruct input OAM states from measurements of the spatial intensity distributions they produce. To obviate issues arising from intrinsic symmetry of Laguerre-Gauss modes, we employ a pair of intensity profiles per state projecting it only on two distinct bases, showing how this allows to uniquely recover input states from the collected data. Our approach is based on a combined application of dimensionality reduction via principal component analysis, and linear regression, and thus has a low computational cost during both training and testing stages. We showcase our approach in a real photonic setup, generating up-to-four-dimensional OAM states through quantum walk dynamics. The high performance and versatility of the demonstrated approach make it an ideal tool to characterize high-dimensional states in quantum information protocols.

TI Localization-enhanced dissipation in a generalized Aubry-Andre-Harper
   model coupled with Ohmic baths
SO PHYSICS LETTERS A
AB In this work, the exact dynamics of excitation in the generalized Aubry-Andre-Harper model coupled with an Ohmic-type environment is discussed by evaluating the survival probability and inverse participation ratio of the state of system. In contrast to the common belief that localization will preserve the information of the initial state in the system against dissipation into the environment, our study found that strong localization can enhance the dissipation of quantum information instead. By a thorough examination of the dynamics, we show that the coherent transition between the energy state of system is crucial for understanding this unusual behavior. Under this circumstance, the coupling induced energy exchange between the system and its environment can induce the periodic population of excitation on the states of system. As a result, the stable or localization-enhanced decaying of excitation can be observed, dependent on the energy difference between the states of system. This point is verified in further by checking the varying of dynamics of excitation in the system when the coupling between the system and environment is more strong. (c) 2022 Elsevier B.V.

TI Quantum frequency conversion based on resonant four-wave mixing
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Quantum frequency conversion (QFC), a critical technology in photonic quantum information science, requires that the quantum characteristics of the frequency-converted photon must be the same as the input photon except for the color. In nonlinear optics, the wave mixing effect far away from the resonance condition is often used to realize QFC because it can prevent the vacuum field reservoir from destroying the quantum state of the converted photon effectively. Under conditions far away from resonance, experiments typically require strong pump light to generate large nonlinear interactions to achieve high-efficiency QFC. However, strong pump light often generates additional noise photons through spontaneous Raman or parametric conversion processes. Herein, we theoretically study another efficient QFC scheme based on a resonant four-wave mixing system. Due to the effect of electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT), this resonant QFC scheme can greatly suppress vacuum field noise at low light levels; consequently, the converted photon can inherit the quantum state of the input photon with high fidelity. Our research demonstrates that if the conversion efficiency of the EIT-based QFC is close to 100%, the wave function and quadrature variance of the converted photon are almost the same as the input probe photon.

TI Observing movement of Dirac cones from single-photon dynamics
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB Graphene with honeycomb structure, critically important in understanding physics of matter, exhibits exceptionally unusual half-integer quantum Hall effect and unconventional electronic spectrum with quantum relativistic phenomena. Particularly, graphenelike structure can be used for realizing topological insulator which inspires an intrinsic topological protection mechanism with strong immunity for maintaining coherence of quantum information. These various peculiar physics arise from the unique properties of Dirac cones which show high hole degeneracy, massless charge carriers, and linear intersection of bands. Experimental observation of Dirac cones conventionally focuses on the energy-momentum space with bulk measurement. Here, we demonstrate a direct observation of the movement of Dirac cones from single-photon dynamics in photonic graphene under different biaxial strains. Sharing the same spirit of wave-particle nature in quantum mechanics, we identify the movement of Dirac cones by dynamically detecting the edge modes and extracting the diffusing distance of the packets with accumulation and statistics on individual single-particle registrations. Our results of observing movement of Dirac cones from single-photon dynamics, together with the method of direct observation in real space by mapping the band structure defined in momentum space, paves a novel way to understand and explore a variety of artificial structures.

TI An Improved Artificial Potential Field Path Planning Based on Gradient
   Statistical Mutation Quantum Genetic Algorithm
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB In the field of vehicle path planning, the traditional Artificial Potential Field (APF) has the disadvantage that it is difficult to jump out of the local extremum. Therefore, an improved Artificial Potential Field based on the Gradient Statistical Mutation Quantum Genetic Algorithm (GSM-QGA) is proposed. Based on the traditional circular influence domain, the dynamic elliptical influence domain of the repulsive potential field is proposed by analyzing the motion state of the vehicle and obstacles. Through an analysis of the factors influencing the potential field function, the velocity factor is introduced to design the repulsive and attractive potential field functions. The GSM-QGA is introduced as a modified local optimal correction strategy for the improved APF. When the vehicle falls into the local extremum reciprocating motion, a pseudo-global map is constructed based on the current position of the vehicle, and a feasible path to jump out of the local extremum range is planned. The effectiveness of the improved algorithm in vehicle path planning is proved by simulation experiments. Compared with other algorithms, the path length planned by the improved algorithm is shorter and the path is smoother. The algorithm can effectively jump out of the local optimal state.

TI Magnetic-field controlled on-off switchable non-reciprocal negative
   refractive index in non-Hermitian photon-magnon hybrid systems
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Photon-magnon coupling, where electromagnetic waves interact with spin waves, and negative refraction, which bends the direction of electromagnetic waves unnaturally, constitute critical foundations and advancements in the realms of optics, spintronics, and quantum information technology. Here, we explore a magnetic-field-controlled, on-off switchable, non-reciprocal negative refractive index within a non-Hermitian photon-magnon hybrid system. By integrating an yttrium iron garnet film with an inverted split-ring resonator, we discover pronounced negative refractive index driven by the system's non-Hermitian properties. This phenomenon exhibits unique non-reciprocal behavior dependent on the signal's propagation direction. Our analytical model sheds light on the crucial interplay between coherent and dissipative coupling, significantly altering permittivity and permeability's imaginary components, crucial for negative refractive index's emergence. This work pioneers new avenues for employing negative refractive index in photon-magnon hybrid systems, signaling substantial advancements in quantum hybrid systems.
   The authors demonstrate a magnetic-field-controlled, on-off switchable non-reciprocal negative refractive index in a non-Hermitian photon-magnon hybrid system, highlighting the crucial role of non-Hermitian dynamics in advancing photonics and magnonics in quantum hybrid technologies.

TI Nonlinear parametric generation and optical vortex transfer in graphene
   ensemble under Landau quantization
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB We explore the dynamics of nonlinear parametric generation and light beam propagation in a Landau-quantized graphene structure with three energy levels interacting with two laser pulses, utilizing the Maxwell-Bloch equations. By applying a laser field to one transition of the graphene sample while keeping the second beam initially absent, the distinctive preparation of the graphene sample, coupled with its weak interaction with laser radiation, results in the parametric generation of a new laser beam in a different transition. We investigate the influence of diverse system parameters on both the efficiency of the generated beam and the propagation dynamics of both beams. Our findings reveal that manipulating these parameters can induce oscillations in the intensity of propagated beams, mitigate absorption losses during propagation allowing for earlier relaxation, and enhance the efficiency of energy transfer from the initial to the generated beam. Additionally, we demonstrate the transfer of optical vortices within the graphene ensemble by introducing an optical vortex to the initial beam. This scheme holds promise for applications in high-dimensional quantum information processing.

TI Tunable multiphoton bundles emission in a Kerr-type two-photon
   Jaynes-Cummings model
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB We present a study on manipulation and enhancement of multiphoton bundles emission under a moderate atom-cavity coupling, by constructing a two-photon Jaynes-Cummings model integrated with Kerr nonlinearity in a single atom-cavity system. We show that the vacuum-Rabi splittings for the nth dressed states can be significantly enhanced by Kerr interaction. This remarkable enhancement in energy-spectrum anharmonicity with the well-resolved multiphoton resonance facilitates the generation of special nonclassical states beyond the strong-coupling limit in the experiment. In particular, both two- and three-photon blockades are observed with adjusting the amplitude of the cavity-driving or atom-pump fields. Moreover, we discover that transitions between two- and three-photon bundles can be achieved through tuning the atom-cavity detuning or Kerr nonlinearity. It further showcases the three-photon blockade is substantially strengthened when both the cavity and atomic fields are jointly driven. Our proposal unveils a pathway for realizing highly controllable nonclassical states and quantum devices with combining two-photon Jaynes-Cummings interactions and Kerr nonlinearity, which may pave the way for versatile applications in quantum information science, e.g., all-optical switches and transistors.

TI Ultrafast photoluminescence and multiscale light amplification in
   nanoplasmonic cavity glass
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Interactions between plasmons and exciton nanoemitters in plexcitonic systems lead to fast and intense luminescence, desirable in optoelectonic devices, ultrafast optical switches and quantum information science. While luminescence enhancement through exciton-plasmon coupling has thus far been mostly demonstrated in micro- and nanoscale structures, analogous demonstrations in bulk materials have been largely neglected. Here we present a bulk nanocomposite glass doped with cadmium telluride quantum dots (CdTe QDs) and silver nanoparticles, nAg, which act as exciton and plasmon sources, respectively. This glass exhibits ultranarrow, FWHM = 13 nm, and ultrafast, 90 ps, amplified photoluminescence (PL), lambda(em)congruent to 503 nm, at room temperature under continuous-wave excitation, lambda(exc) = 405 nm. Numerical simulations confirm that the observed improvement in emission is a result of a multiscale light enhancement owing to the ensemble of QD-populated plasmonic nanocavities in the material. Power-dependent measurements indicate that >100 mW coherent light amplification occurs. These types of bulk plasmon-exciton composites could be designed comprising a plethora of components/functionalities, including emitters (QDs, rare earth and transition metal ions) and nanoplasmonic elements (Ag/Au/TCO, spherical/anisotropic/miscellaneous), to achieve targeted applications.

TI Coherent Spin-Phonon Scattering in Facilitated Rydberg Lattices
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB We investigate the dynamics of a one-dimensional spin system with facilitation constraint that can be studied using Rydberg atoms in arrays of optical tweezer traps. The elementary degrees of freedom of the system are domains of Rydberg excitations that expand ballistically through the lattice. Because of mechanical forces, Rydberg excited atoms are coupled to vibrations within their traps. At zero temperature and large trap depth, it is known that virtually excited lattice vibrations only renormalize the timescale of the ballistic propagation. However, when vibrational excitations are initially present-i.e., when the external motion of the atoms is prepared in an excited Fock state, coherent state or thermal state-resonant scattering between spin domain walls and phonons takes place. This coherent and deterministic process, which is free from disorder, leads to a reduction of the power-law exponent characterizing the expansion of spin domains. Furthermore, the spin domain dynamics is sensitive to the coherence properties of the atoms' vibrational state, such as the relative phase of coherently superimposed Fock states. Even for a translationally invariant initial state the latter manifests macroscopically in a phase-sensitive asymmetric expansion.

TI Certifying unknown genuine multipartite entanglement by neural networks
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Suppose we have an unknown multipartite quantum state, how can we experimentally find out whether it is genuine multipartite entangled or not? Recall that even for a bipartite quantum state whose density matrix is known, it is already NP-Hard to determine whether it is entangled or not. Therefore, it is hard to efficiently solve the above problem generally. However, since genuine multipartite entanglement (GME) is such a fundamental concept that plays a crucial role in many-body physics and quantum information processing tasks, finding realistic approaches to certify GME is undoubtedly necessary. In this work, we show that neural networks can provide a nice solution to this problem, where measurement statistics data produced by measuring involved quantum states with local measurement devices serve as input features of neural networks. By testing our models on many specific multipartite quantum states, we show that they can certify GME very accurately, even including some new results unknown before. We also exhibit a possible way to improve the efficiency of our models by reducing the size of features. Lastly, we show that our models enjoy remarkable robustness against flaws in measurement devices, implying that they are very experiment-friendly.

TI Systematic analysis of crystalline phases in bosonic lattice models with
   algebraically decaying density-density interactions
SO SCIPOST PHYSICS
AB We propose a general approach to analyse diagonal ordering patterns in bosonic lattice models with algebraically decaying density-density interactions on arbitrary lattices. The key idea is a systematic search for the energetically best order on all unit cells of the lattice up to a given extent. Using resummed couplings we evaluate the energy of the ordering patterns in the thermodynamic limit using finite unit cells. We apply the proposed approach to the atomic limit of the extended Bose-Hubbard model on the triangular lattice at fillings f = 1/2 and f = 1. We investigate the ground-state properties of the antiferromagnetic long-range Ising model on the triangular lattice and determine a six-fold degenerate plain-stripe phase to be the ground state for finite decay exponents. We also probe the classical limit of the Fendley-Sengupta-Sachdev model describing Rydberg atom arrays. We focus on arrangements where the atoms are placed on the sites or links of the Kagome lattice. Our method provides a general framework to treat cristalline structures resulting from long-range interactions.

TI Hawking radiation and the quantum marginal problem
SO JOURNAL OF COSMOLOGY AND ASTROPARTICLE PHYSICS
AB In 1974 Steven Hawking showed that black holes emit thermal radiation, which eventually causes them to evaporate. The problem of the fate of information in this process is known as the "black hole information paradox". Two main types of resolution postulate either a fundamental loss of information in Nature - hence the breakdown of quantum mechanics - or some sort of new physics, e.g. quantum gravity, which guarantee the global preservation of unitarity. Here we explore the second possibility with the help of recent developments in continuous-variable quantum information. Concretely, we employ the solution to the Gaussian quantum marginal problem to show that the thermality of all individual Hawking modes is consistent with a global pure state of the radiation. Surprisingly, we find out that the mods of radiation of an astrophysical black hole are thermal until the very last burst. In contrast, the single-mode thermality of Hawking radiation originating from microscopic black holes, expected to evaporate through several quanta, is not excluded, though there are constraints on modes' frequencies. Our result paves the way towards a systematic study of multi-mode correlations in Hawking radiation.

TI Effect of intersystem crossing rates and optical illumination on the
   polarization of nuclear spins close to nitrogen-vacancy centers
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB Several efforts have been made to polarize the nearby nuclear environment of nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers for quantum metrology and quantum information applications. Different methods showed different nuclear spin polarization efficiencies and rely on electronic spin polarization associated to the NV center, which in turn crucially depends on the intersystem crossing. Recently, the rates involved in the intersystem crossing have been measured leading to different transition rate models. Here, we consider the effect of these rates on several nuclear polarization methods based on the level anticrossing, and precession of the nuclear population while the electronic spin is in the m(s) = 0 and m(s) = 1 spin states. We show that the nuclear polarization depends on the power of optical excitation used to polarize the electronic spin. The degree of nuclear spin polarization is different for each transition rate model. Therefore, the results presented here are relevant for validating these models and for polarizing nuclear spins. Furthermore, we analyze the performance of each method by considering the nuclear position relative to the symmetry axis of the NV center.

AB In the classical private information retrieval (PIR) setup, a user wants to retrieve a file from a database or a distributed storage system (DSS) without revealing the file identity to the servers holding the data. In the quantum PIR (QPIR) setting, a user privately retrieves a classical file by receiving quantum information from the servers. The QPIR problem has been treated by Song et al. in the case of replicated servers, both with and without collusion. QPIR over [n, k] maximum distance separable (MDS) coded servers was recently considered by Allaix et al., but the collusion was essentially restricted to t = n - k servers in the sense that a smaller t would not improve the retrieval rate. In this paper, the QPIR setting is extended to allow for retrieval with high rate for any number of colluding servers t with 1 <= t <= n - k. Similarly to the previous cases, the rates achieved are better than those known or conjectured in the classical counterparts, as well as those of the previously proposed coded and colluding QPIR schemes. This is enabled by considering the stabilizer formalism and weakly self-dual generalized Reed-Solomon (GRS) star product codes.

AB The Isogeny to Endomorphism Ring Problem (IsERP) asks to compute the endomorphism ring of the codomain of an isogeny between supersingular curves in characteristic p given only a representation for this isogeny, i.e. some data and an algorithm to evaluate this isogeny on any torsion point. This problem plays a central role in isogeny-based cryptography; it underlies the security of pSIDH protocol (ASIACRYPT 2022) and it is at the heart of the recent attacks that broke the SIDH key exchange. Prior to this work, no efficient algorithm was known to solve IsERP for a generic isogeny degree, the hardest case seemingly when the degree is prime.
   In this paper, we introduce a new quantum polynomial-time algorithm to solve IsERP for isogenies whose degrees are odd and have O(log log p) many prime factors. As main technical tools, our algorithm uses a quantum algorithm for computing hidden Borel subgroups, a group action on supersingular isogenies from EUROCRYPT 2021, various algorithms for the Deuring correspondence and a new algorithm to lift arbitrary quaternion order elements modulo an odd integer N with O(log log p) many prime factors to powersmooth elements.
   As a main consequence for cryptography, we obtain a quantum polynomial-time key recovery attack on pSIDH. The technical tools we use may also be of independent interest.

TI Exploiting the combined dynamic and geometric phases for optical vortex
   beam generation using metasurfaces
SO NANOPHOTONICS
AB The generation of optical vortex beams is pivotal for a myriad of applications, encompassing optical tweezing, optical communications, and quantum information, among others. The metasurface-based approach has realized significant advancements in vortex production, utilizing either dynamic or geometric phases. The dynamic design exhibits indifference to the polarization state of incident light, while the geometric design is inextricably tied to it. In the study, we put forth the proposition that combining dynamic and geometric phases could unlock the potential of metasurface design in generating optical vortices. A hybrid design that harnesses the combined dynamic and geometric phases can attain the same objective while offering tunable functional control over the polarization of light. We establish a correlation between the structural parameters of metasurface and the topological charge of the resulting vortices. The experimental results fully demonstrate the design's flexibility and its effective control over the polarization constraints of incident light. Our research uncovers the capacity for vortex generation through the manipulation of hybrid phases introduced by metasurfaces, indicating significant potential for the design of optical devices and the future advancement of innovative optical applications.

TI Transition-Metal-Related Quantum Emitters in Wurtzite AlN and GaN
SO ACS NANO
AB Transition-metal centers exhibit a paramagnetic ground state in wide-bandgap semiconductors and are promising for nanophotonics and quantum information processing. Specifically, there is a growing interest in discovering prominent paramagnetic spin defects that can be manipulated using optical methods. Here, we investigate the electronic structure and magneto-optical properties of Cr and Mn substitutional centers in wurtzite AlN and GaN. We use state-of-the-art hybrid density functional theory calculations to determine level structure, stability, optical signatures, and magnetic properties of these centers. The excitation energies are calculated using the constrained occupation approach and rigorously verified with the complete active space configuration interaction approach. Our simulations of the photoluminescence spectra indicate that Cr-Al(1+) in AlN and Cr-Ga(1+) in GaN are responsible for the observed narrow quantum emission near 1.2 eV. We compute the zero-field splitting (ZFS) parameters and outline an optical spin polarization protocol for Cr-Al(1+) and Cr-Ga(1+) . Our results demonstrate that these centers are promising candidates for spin qubits.

TI Complete classification of steerability under local filters and its
   relation with measurement incompatibility
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB The study of quantum steering has both foundational and practical interest. Here, the authors show that transformability of a steerable resource into another via local filtering at the trusted party is determined by whether they have the same steering equivalent observables (SEO).
   Quantum steering is a central resource for one-sided device-independent quantum information. It is manipulated via one-way local operations and classical communication, such as local filtering on the trusted party. Here, we provide a necessary and sufficient condition for a steering assemblage to be transformable into another via local filtering. We characterize the equivalence classes with respect to filters in terms of the steering equivalent observables (SEO), first proposed to connect the problem of steerability and measurement incompatibility. We provide an efficient method to compute the extractable steerability that is maximal via local filters and show that it coincides with the incompatibility of the SEO. Moreover, we show that there always exists a bipartite state that provides an assemblage with steerability equal to the incompatibility of the measurements on the untrusted party. Finally, we investigate the optimal success probability and rates for transformation protocols (distillation and dilution) in the single-shot scenario together with examples.

TI Semiconductor nanowire metamaterial for broadband near-unity absorption
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB The realization of a semiconductor near-unity absorber in the infrared will provide new capabilities to transform applications in sensing, health, imaging, and quantum information science, especially where portability is required. Typically, commercially available portable single-photon detectors in the infrared are made from bulk semiconductors and have efficiencies well below unity. Here, we design a novel semiconductor nanowire metamaterial, and show that by carefully arranging an InGaAs nanowire array and by controlling their shape, we demonstrate near-unity absorption efficiency at room temperature. We experimentally show an average measured efficiency of 93% (simulated average efficiency of 97%) over an unprecedented wavelength range from 900 to 1500 nm. We further show that the near-unity absorption results from the collective response of the nanowire metamaterial, originating from both coupling into leaky resonant waveguide and transverse modes. These coupling mechanisms cause light to be absorbed directly from the top and indirectly as light scatters from one nanowire to neighbouring ones. This work leads to the possible development of a new generation of quantum detectors with unprecedented broadband near-unity absorption in the infrared, while operating near room temperature for a wider range of applications.

TI Realistic non-Gaussian-operation scheme in parity-detection-based
   Mach-Zehnder quantum interferometry
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We theoretically analyze phase sensitivity using a parity-detection-based Mach-Zehnder interferometer (MZI) with the input states generated by performing non-Gaussian operations, viz., photon subtraction, photon addition, and photon catalysis, on a two-mode squeezed vacuum (TMSV) state. Since these non-Gaussian operations are probabilistic, it is of utmost importance to take the success probability into account. To this end, we consider a realistic model of photon subtraction, addition, and catalysis and derive a single expression of the Wigner function for photon subtracted, added, and catalyzed TMSV states. The Wigner function is used to evaluate the lower bound on the phase sensitivity via quantum Cram??r-Rao bound and parity-detection-based phase sensitivity in the MZI. We identify the ranges of squeezing and transmissivity parameters where the non-Gaussian states provide better phase sensitivity than the TMSV state. Taking the success probability into account, it turns out that the photon addition is the most advantageous among all three non-Gaussian operations. We hope that the generalized Wigner function derived in this paper will be useful in various quantum information protocols and state characterization.

AB With the second quantum revolution and the growing need of a competent workforce in Quantum Information Science, formal instruction on contemporary physics topics such as quantum mechanics (QM) is a particularly important component of modern secondary science education. Additionally, a formal introduction to physics is incomplete without an exploration of the quantum realm and the findings of the first quantum revolution. Exposure to QM can radically alter an individual's view of the physical universe and can broadly engage secondary students. Exposure to QM in secondary schools has increased substantially in recent years yet is still an understudied area with a limited body of research on this topic. The aim of this paper is to analyze this body of research by bibliometric analysis, examining yearly output, citation index, author nationality, publishing venue, and keywords of relevant publications. The academic search engines SCOPUS and Web of Science were used to collect publications emphasizing the teaching and learning of QM at the secondary level. First, we present a quantitative analysis of the bibliometrics, followed by an assessment of publication trends in teaching and learning. Lastly, an analysis of research gaps and opportunities for further investigation is discussed.

TI Lindblad-like quantum tomography for non-Markovian quantum dynamical
   maps
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB We introduce Lindblad-like quantum tomography (L & ell;QT) as a quantum characterization technique of time-correlated noise in quantum information processors. This approach enables the estimation of time-local master equations, including their possible negative decay rates, by maximizing a likelihood function subject to dynamical constraints. We discuss L & ell;QT for the dephasing dynamics of single qubits in detail, which allows for a neat understanding of the importance of including multiple snapshots of the quantum evolution in the likelihood function, and how these need to be distributed in time depending on the noise characteristics. By a detailed comparative study employing both frequentist and Bayesian approaches, we assess the accuracy and precision of L & ell;QT of a dephasing quantum dynamical map that goes beyond the Lindblad limit, focusing on two different microscopic noise models that can be realised in either trapped-ion or superconducting-circuit architectures. We explore the optimization of the distribution of measurement times to minimize the estimation errors, assessing the superiority of each learning scheme conditioned on the degree of non-Markovinity of the noise, and setting the stage for future experimental designs of non-Markovian quantum tomography.

TI Transparency, nonclassicality, and nonreciprocity in chiral waveguide
   quantum electrodynamics
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB We examine quantum statistical properties of transmission and reflection from a chiral waveguide coupled to qubits for arbitrary input powers. We report on several remarkable features of output fields such as transparency, quantum nonreciprocity, and the second-order correlation function g(2)(0) values less than unity. In particular, for two qubits detuned antisymmetrically with respect to the central waveguide frequency, we find transparency in forward transmission and in photon numbers for arbitrary values of the input powers provided the phase separation between qubits is an integer multiple of pi. Values of g(2)(0) less than unity can be reached even for nonzero value of the intrinsic damping by using phase separation different from integer multiple of pi, marking the transition from classical to quantum light. We also uncover a different type of critical coupling regime for qubits that enables complete suppression of forward-propagating amplitude transmission at specific driving powers, giving rise to enhanced nonreciprocal effects in both transmission and quantum fluctuations in amplitudes. Forward propagation amplifies the quantum fluctuations in amplitudes, while backward propagation significantly suppresses them. These findings open pathways for controlling light-matter interactions in chiral quantum electrodynamics, with potential applications in quantum information and nonreciprocal quantum devices.

TI On One-Parameter Families of Hermiticity-Preserving Superoperators which
   Are Not Positive
SO OPEN SYSTEMS & INFORMATION DYNAMICS
AB A one-parameter family of hermiticity-preserving superoperators is a time-dependent family {Phi t: Mn(C) -> Mn(C)}t is an element of R of hermiticity-preserving superoperators determined, in a certain sense, by real and complex polynomial functions in the variable t is an element of R. The paper studies sufficient computable criteria for nonpositivity of superoperators in one-parameter families. More precisely, we give sufficient conditions for the following assertions to hold: (1) every Phi t is not positive, (2) Phi t is not positive for t in some (u,v) subset of R and (3) there is some Phi t which is not positive. We show that (3) implies (2). Our approach to the problem is based on the Descartes rule of signs and the Sturm-Tarski theorem. In order to apply these facts, we introduce the sign variation formulas. These formulas are first order logical formulas in one variable t, generalising sign sequences of polynomials used in Descartes rule of signs.

TI On the feasibility of detecting quantum delocalization effects on
   relativistic time dilation in optical clocks
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB We derive the predicted time dilation of delocalized atomic clocks in an optical lattice setup in the presence of a gravitational field to leading order in quantum relativistic corrections. We investigate exotic quantum states of motion whose relativistic time dilation is outside of the realm of classical general relativity, finding a regime where 24Mg optical lattice clocks currently in development would comfortably be able to detect the special-relativistic contribution to the quantum effect (if the technical challenge of generating the necessary states can be met and the expected accuracy of such clocks can be attained). We find that the gravitational contribution, on the other hand, is negligible in this setup. We provide a detailed experimental protocol and analyse the effects of noise on our predictions. We also show that the magnitude of our predicted quantum time dilation effect remains just out of detectable reach for the current generation of 87Sr optical lattice clocks. Our calculations agree with the predicted time dilation of classical general relativity when restricting to Gaussian states.

TI Enantiospecificity in NMR enabled by chirality-induced spin selectivity
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Spin polarization in chiral molecules is a magnetic molecular response associated with electron transport and enantioselective bond polarization that occurs even in the absence of an external magnetic field. An unexpected finding by Santos and co-workers reported enantiospecific NMR responses in solid-state cross-polarization (CP) experiments, suggesting a possible additional contribution to the indirect nuclear spin-spin coupling in chiral molecules induced by bond polarization in the presence of spin-orbit coupling. Herein we provide a theoretical treatment for this phenomenon, presenting an effective spin-Hamiltonian for helical molecules like DNA and density functional theory (DFT) results on amino acids that confirm the dependence of J-couplings on the choice of enantiomer. The connection between nuclear spin dynamics and chirality could offer insights for molecular sensing and quantum information sciences. These results establish NMR as a potential tool for chiral discrimination without external agents.
   The authors present a theoretical treatment demonstrating that NMR experiments on chiral molecules can reveal enantioselective nuclear J-couplings due to bond polarization and spin-orbit interaction. This also aids in understanding chirality-induced phenomena more generally and their applications.

TI Improving photon number resolvability of a superconducting nanowire
   single-photon detector array using a level comparator circuit
SO SUPERCONDUCTOR SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY
AB Photon number resolving (PNR) capability is very important in many optical applications, including quantum information processing, fluorescence detection, and few-photon-level ranging and imaging. Superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors (SNSPDs) with a multipixel interleaved architecture give the array an excellent spatial PNR capability. However, the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the PNR (SNRPNR) of the array will be degraded with increasing the element number due to the electronic noise in the readout circuit, which limits the PNR resolution as well as the maximum PNR number. In this study, a 16-element interleaved SNSPD array was fabricated, and the PNR capability of the array was investigated and analyzed. By introducing a level comparator circuit (LCC), the SNRPNR of the detector array was improved over a factor of four. In addition, we performed a statistical analysis of the photon number on this SNSPD array with LCC, showing that the LCC method effectively enhances the PNR resolution. Besides, the system timing jitter of the detector was reduced from 90 ps to 72 ps due to the improved electrical SNR.

TI Tunable zero modes and quantum interferences in flat-band topological
   insulators
SO QUANTUM
AB We investigate the interplay between Aharonov-Bohm (AB) caging and topological protection in a family of quasi-one-dimensional topological insulators, which we term CSSH ladders. Hybrids of the Creutz ladder and the SSH chain, they present a regime with completely flat bands, and a rich topological phase diagram, with several kinds of protected zero modes. These are reminiscent of the Creutz ladder edge states in some cases, and of the SSH chain edge states in others. Furthermore, their high degree of tunability, and the fact that they remain topologically protected even in small systems in the rungless case, due to AB caging, make them suitable for quantum information purposes. One of the ladders can belong to the BDI, AIII and D symmetry classes depending on its parameters, the latter being unusual in a non-superconducting model. Two of the models can also harbor topological end modes which do not follow the usual bulk-boundary correspondence, and are instead related to a Chern number. Finally, we propose some experimental setups to implement the CSSH ladders with current technology, focusing on the photonic lattice case.

TI Twisted Nonlinear Optics in Monolayer van der Waals Crystals
SO ACS NANO
AB In addition to a plethora of emergent phenomena, the spatial topology of optical vortices enables an array of applications in optical communications and quantum information science. Multibeam nonlinear optical processes, augmented by optical vortices, are essential in this context, providing robust access to an infinitely large set of quantum states associated with the orbital angular momentum of light. Here, we push the boundaries of vortex nonlinear optics to the ultimate limits of material dimensionality. By exploiting multipulse difference frequency, sum frequency, and four-wave mixing in monolayer quantum materials, we demonstrate their ability to independently control the orbital angular momentum and radial distribution of vortex light-fields in addition to their wavelength. Due to the atomically thin nature of the host crystal, this control spans a broad spectral bandwidth in a highly integrable platform that is unconstrained by the traditional limits of bulk nonlinear optical materials. Our work heralds an innovative path for ultracompact and scalable hybrid nanophotonic technologies empowered by twisted nonlinear light-matter interactions in van der Waals nanomaterials.

TI Tailoring the properties of the 2D ferromagnet CrSBr by lanthanide
   doping
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS-MATERIALS
AB The increasing fascination with 2D van der Waals (vdW) magnetic materials arises from their distinctive properties and promising applications in spintronics, magnonics, and quantum information technologies. Among them, CrSBr is a semiconductor that stands out owing to its high Curie temperature (TC similar to 146 K), air stability and tunable electronic and magnetic properties. Here, we present a systematic investigation of the effects of Dy doping (12.5%, 25%, and 50%) on the structural, electronic and magnetic properties of CrSBr monolayer. Our results reveal that Dy incorporation enhances magnetic anisotropy and modulates TC that arise from strong ferromagnetic and weak antiferromagnetic interactions. Additionally, we investigate the properties of DySBr, DySI and DySeI monolayers, which are isostructural to the CrSBr. Our results reveal the feasibility of exfoliating them down to the single layer and the presence of long-range magnetic order at low temperatures, relying on the combination of both weak exchange interactions and large spin-orbit coupling. This work provides insights into tuning the properties of CrSBr through rare earth doping, unlocking new possibilities for advanced applications at the 2D limit.

TI Toward Universal Transformations of Orbital Angular Momentum of a Single
   Photon
SO LASER & PHOTONICS REVIEWS
AB High-dimensional quantum systems offer many advantages over low-dimensional quantum systems. Meanwhile, unitary transformations on quantum states are important parts in various quantum information tasks, whereas they become technically infeasible as the dimensionality increases. The photonic orbital angular momentum (OAM), which is inherent in the transverse spatial mode of photons, offers a natural carrier to encode information in high-dimensional spaces. However, it is even more challenging to realize arbitrary unitary transformations on the photonic OAM states. Here, by combining the path and OAM degrees of freedom of a single photon, an efficient scheme to realize arbitrary unitary transformations on the path-OAM coupled quantum states is proposed. The proposal reduces the number of required interferometers by approximately one quarter compared with previous works, while maintaining the symmetric structure. It is shown that by using OAM-to-path interfaces, this scheme can be utilized to realize arbitrary unitary transformations on the OAM states of photons. This work facilitates the development of high-dimension quantum state transformations and opens a new door to the manipulation of the photonic OAM states.

   modulator at near-IR wavelengths
SO OPTICA
AB Integrated photonics at near-IR (NIR) wavelengths currently lacks high bandwidth and low-voltage modulators, which add electro-optic functionality to passive circuits. Here, integrated hybrid thin-film lithium niobate (TFLN) electro-optic Mach-Zehnder modulators (MZM) are shown, using TFLN bonded to planarized silicon nitride waveguides. The design does not require TFLN etching or patterning. The push-pull MZM achieves a half-wave voltage length product (V pi L) of 0.8 V.cm at 784 nm. MZM devices with 0.4 cm and 0.8 cm modulation length show a broadband electro-optic response with a 3 dB bandwidth beyond 100 GHz, with the latter showing a record bandwidth to half-wave voltage ratio of 100 GHz/V and a high extinction ratio exceeding 30 dB. Such fully integrated high-performance NIR electro-optic devices may benefit data communications, analog signal processing, test and measurement instrumentation, quantum information processing and other applications.

TI Loop quantum gravity's boundary maps
SO CLASSICAL AND QUANTUM GRAVITY
AB In canonical quantum gravity, the presence of spatial boundaries naturally leads to boundary quantum states, representing quantum boundary conditions for the bulk fields. As a consequence, quantum states of the bulk geometry need to be upgraded to wave-functions valued in the boundary Hilbert space: the bulk becomes quantum operator acting on boundary states. We apply this to loop quantum gravity and describe spin networks with 2d boundary as wave-functions mapping bulk holonomies to spin states on the boundary. This sets the bulk-boundary relation in a clear mathematical framework, which allows to define the boundary density matrix induced by a bulk spin network states after tracing out the bulk degrees of freedom. We ask the question of the bulk reconstruction and prove a boundary-to-bulk universal reconstruction procedure, to be understood as a purification of the mixed boundary state into a pure bulk state. We further perform a first investigation in the algebraic structure of induced boundary density matrices and show how correlations between bulk excitations, i.e. quanta of 3d geometry, get reflected into the boundary density matrix.

TI Electrical tuning of phase-change antennas and metasurfaces
SO NATURE NANOTECHNOLOGY
AB A metasurface comprising electrically controlled heating units and a phase-change material offer non-volatile and reversible modulation of reflectance by more than fourfold.
   The success of semiconductor electronics is built on the creation of compact, low-power switching elements that offer routing, logic and memory functions. The availability of nanoscale optical switches could have a similarly transformative impact on the development of dynamic and programmable metasurfaces, optical neural networks and quantum information processing. Phase-change materials are uniquely suited to enable their creation as they offer high-speed electrical switching between amorphous and crystalline states with notably different optical properties. Their high refractive index has already been harnessed to fashion them into compact optical antennas. Here, we take the next important step, by showing electrically-switchable phase-change antennas and metasurfaces that offer strong, reversible, non-volatile, multi-phase switching and spectral tuning of light scattering in the visible and near-infrared spectral ranges. Their successful implementation relies on a careful joint thermal and optical optimization of the antenna elements that comprise a silver strip that simultaneously serves as a plasmonic resonator and a miniature heating stage. Our metasurface affords electrical modulation of the reflectance by more than fourfold at 755 nm.

   glasses
SO COMPUTER PHYSICS COMMUNICATIONS
AB We release a set of GPU programs for the study of the Quantum (S = 1/2) Spin Glass on a square lattice, with binary couplings. The library contains two main codes: MCQSG (that carries out Monte Carlo simulations using both the Metropolis and the Parallel Tempering algorithms, for the problem formulated in the Trotter-Suzuki approximation), and EDQSG (that obtains the extremal eigenvalues of the Transfer Matrix using the Lanczos algorithm). EDQSG has allowed us to diagonalize transfer matrices with size up to 2(36) x 2(36). From its side, MCQSG running on four NVIDIA A100 cards delivers a sub-picosecond time per spin-update, a performance that is competitive with dedicated hardware. We include as well in our library GPU programs for the analysis of the spin configurations generated by MCQSG. Finally, we provide two auxiliary codes: the first generates the lookup tables employed by the random number generator of MCQSG; the second one simplifies the execution of multiple runs using different input data.

   Nature of problem: The critical properties of quantum disordered systems are known only in a few, simple, cases whereas there is a growing interest in gaining a better understanding of their behaviour due to the potential application of quantum annealing techniques for solving optimization problems. In this context, we provide a suite of codes, that we have recently developed, to the purpose of studying the 2D Quantum Ising Spin Glass.
   Solution method: We provide a highly tuned multi-GPU code for the Montecarlo simulation of the 2D QISG based on a combination of Metropolis and Parallel Tempering algorithms. Moreover, we provide a code for the evaluation of the eigenvalues of the transfer matrix of the 2D QISG for size up to L=6. The eigenvalues are computed by using the classic Lanczos algorithm that, however, relies on a custom multi-GPU-CPU matrix-vector product that speeds-up dramatically the execution of the algorithm.

TI Hermitian Kirkwood-Dirac-real operators for discrete Fourier
   transformations
SO JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL PHYSICS
AB The Kirkwood-Dirac (KD) distribution is a quantum state representation that relies on two chosen fixed orthonormal bases, or alternatively, on the transition matrix of these two bases. In recent years, it has been discovered that the KD distribution has numerous applications in quantum information science. The presence of negative or nonreal KD distributions may indicate certain quantum features or advantages. If the KD distribution of a quantum state consists solely of positive or zero elements, the state is called a KD-positive state. Consequently, a crucial inquiry arises regarding the determination of whether a quantum state is KD-positive when subjected to various physically relevant transition matrices. When the transition matrix is discrete Fourier transform (DFT) matrix of dimension p [Langrenez et al., J. Math. Phys. 65, 072201 (2024)] or p(2) [Yang et al., J. Phys. A: Math. Theor. 57, 435303 (2024)] with p being prime, it is proved that any KD-positive state can be expressed as a convex combination of pure KD-positive states. In this work, we prove that when the transition matrix is the DFT matrix of any finite dimension, any KD-positive state can be expressed as a real linear combination of pure KD-positive states.

TI Storing light near an exceptional point
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Photons with zero rest mass are impossible to be stopped. However, a pulse of light can be slowed down and even halted through strong light-matter interaction in a dispersive medium in atomic systems. Exceptional point (EP), a non-Hermitian singularity point, can introduce an abrupt transition in dispersion. Here we experimentally observe room-temperature storing light near an exceptional point induced by nonlinear Brillouin scattering in a chip-scale 90-mu m-radius optical microcavity, the smallest platform up to date to store light. Through nonlinear coupling, a Parity-Time (PT) symmetry can be constructed in optical-acoustical hybrid modes, where Brillouin scattering-induced absorption (BSIA) can lead to both slow light and fast light of incoming pulses. A subtle transition of slow-to-fast light reveals a critical point for storing a light pulse up to half a millisecond. This compact and room-temperature scheme of storing light paves the way for practical applications in all-optical communications and quantum information processing.
   Exceptional point introduces the ability to control and tune light propagation. Here the authors demonstrate a 90-mu m-radius optical microcavity to store light, induced by nonlinear Brillouin scattering at room temperature.

TI A note on the bulk interpretation of the quantum extremal surface
   formula
SO JOURNAL OF HIGH ENERGY PHYSICS
AB Defining quantum information quantities directly in bulk quantum gravity is a difficult problem due to the fluctuations of spacetime. Some progress was made recently in [1], which provided a bulk interpretation of the Bekenstein Hawking formula for two sided BTZ black holes in terms of the entanglement entropy of gravitational edge modes. We generalize those results to give a bulk entanglement entropy interpretation of the quantum extremal surface formula in AdS3 gravity, as applied to a single interval in the boundary theory. Our computation further supports the proposal that AdS3 gravity can be viewed as a topological phase in which the bulk gravity edge modes are anyons that transform under the quantum group \documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$${{\text{SL}}}_{q}<^>{+}\left(2,{\mathbb{R}}\right)$$\end{document} . These edge modes appear when we cut open the Euclidean path integral along bulk co-dimension 2 slices, and satisfies a shrinkable boundary condition which ensures that the Gibbons-Hawking calculation gives the correct state counting.

TI Quasilocal entanglement across the Mott-Hubbard transition
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB The possibility to directly measure, in a cold-atom quantum simulator, the von Neumann entropy and mutual information between a site and its environment opens new perspectives on the characterization of the Mott-Hubbard metal-insulator transition, in the framework of quantum information theory. In this work, we provide an alternative view of the Mott transition in the two-dimensional Hubbard model in terms of rigorous quasilocal measures of entanglement and correlation between two spatially separated electronic orbitals, with no contribution from their environment. A space-resolved analysis of cluster dynamical mean-field theory results elucidates the prominent role of the nearest-neighbor entanglement in probing Mott localization: both its lower and upper bounds sharply increase at the metal-insulator transition. The two-site entanglement beyond nearest neighbors is shown to be quickly damped as the intersite distance is increased. These results ultimately resolve a conundrum of previous analyses based on the single-site von Neumann entropy, which has been found to monotonically decrease when the interaction is increased. The quasilocal two-site entanglement recovers instead the distinctive character of Mott insulators as strongly correlated quantum states, demonstrating its central role in the 2d Hubbard model.

TI Charge-4e supercurrent in a two-dimensional InAs-Al
   superconductor-semiconductor heterostructure
SO COMMUNICATIONS PHYSICS
AB Superconducting qubits with intrinsic noise protection offer a promising approach to improve the coherence of quantum information. Crucial to such protected qubits is the encoding of the logical quantum states into wavefunctions with disjoint support. Such encoding can be achieved by a Josephson element with an unusual charge-4e supercurrent emerging from the coherent transfer of pairs of Cooper-pairs. In this work, we demonstrate the controlled conversion of a conventional charge-2e dominated to a charge-4e dominated supercurrent in a superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) consisting of gate-tunable planar Josephson junctions. We investigate the ac Josephson effect of the SQUID and measure a dominant photon emission at twice the fundamental Josephson frequency together with a doubling of the number of Shapiro steps, both consistent with the appearance of charge-4e supercurrent. Our results present a step towards protected superconducting qubits based on superconductor-semiconductor hybrid materials.
   Charge-4e transport could be useful for realizing parity-protected superconducting qubits. In this work, the authors demonstrated the controlled conversion between charge-2e dominated and charge-4e dominated supercurrent in a superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) fabricated in an InAs two-dimensional electron gas proximitized by the vicinity to an epitaxial Al layer.

TI Simultaneously enhanced magnomechanical cooling and entanglement
   assisted by an auxiliary microwave cavity
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB We propose a mechanism to simultaneously enhance quantum cooling and entanglement via coupling an auxiliary microwave cavity to a magnomechanical cavity. The auxiliary cavity acts as a dissipative cold reservoir that can efficiently cool multiple localized modes in the primary system via beam-splitter interactions, which enables us to obtain strong quantum cooling and entanglement. We analyze the stability of the system and determine the optimal parameter regime for cooling and entanglement under the auxiliary -microwave -cavity -assisted (AMCA) scheme. The maximum cooling enhancement rate of the magnon mode can reach 98.53%, which clearly reveals that the magnomechanical cooling is significantly improved in the presence of the AMCA. More importantly, the dual -mode entanglement of the system can also be significantly enhanced by AMCA in the full parameter region, where the initial magnon-phonon entanglement can be maximally enhanced by a factor of about 11. Another important result of the AMCA is that it also increases the robustness of the entanglement against temperature. Our approach provides a promising platform for the experimental realization of entanglement and quantum information processing based on cavity magnomechanics.

TI Referenceless characterization of complex media using physics-informed
   neural networks
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB In this work, we present a method to characterize the transmission matrices of complex scattering media using a physics-informed, multi-plane neural network (MPNN) without the requirement of a known optical reference field. We use this method to accurately measure the transmission matrix of a commercial multi-mode fiber without the problems of output-phase ambiguity and dark spots, leading to up to 58% improvement in focusing efficiency compared with phase-stepping holography. We demonstrate how our method is significantly more noise-robust than phase-stepping holography and show how it can be generalized to characterize a cascade of transmission matrices, allowing one to control the propagation of light between independent scattering media. This work presents an essential tool for accurate light control through complex media, with applications ranging from classical optical networks, biomedical imaging, to quantum information processing.Published by Optica Publishing Group under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License.

TI Enhanced Spontaneous Emission of CsPbI3 Perovskite
   Nanocrystals Using a Hyperbolic Metamaterial Modified by Dielectric
   Nanoantenna
SO NANOMATERIALS
AB In this work, we demonstrate, theoretically and experimentally, a hybrid dielectric-plasmonic multifunctional structure able to provide full control of the emission properties of CsPbI3 perovskite nanocrystals (PNCs). The device consists of a hyperbolic metamaterial (HMM) composed of alternating thin metal (Ag) and dielectric (LiF) layers, covered by TiO2 spherical MIE nanoresonators (i.e., the nanoantenna). An optimum HMM leads to a certain Purcell effect, i.e., an increase in the exciton radiative rate, but the emission intensity is reduced due to the presence of metal in the HMM. The incorporation of TiO2 nanoresonators deposited on the top of the HMM is able to counteract such an undesirable intensity reduction by the coupling between the exciton and the MIE modes of the dielectric nanoantenna. More importantly, MIE nanoresonators result in a preferential light emission towards the normal direction to the HMM plane, increasing the collected signal by more than one order of magnitude together with a further increase in the Purcell factor. These results will be useful in quantum information applications involving single emitters based on PNCs together with a high exciton emission rate and intensity.

TI Charged black hole with string cloud deformation: Entanglement and chaos
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
AB We perform a holographic analysis of several quantum information-theoretic observables-entanglement entropy (EE), mutual information (MI), entanglement wedge cross section (EWCS), butterfly velocity (vB), and thermo mutual information (TMI)-in the background of charged anti-de Sitter (AdS) black hole deformed by a homogeneous string cloud. This configuration is dual to a large Nc strongly coupled field theory at finite temperature and finite chemical potential, in presence of quark-cloud. We study how the entanglement structure and chaotic dynamics in the boundary theory are affected by the charge and backreaction. In our observation we find that both EE and EWCS increase monotonically with charge and backreaction, indicating enhanced correlations due to additional degrees of freedom. On the other hand MI and TMI show a more intricate dependence: backreaction tends to strengthen correlations, while increasing charge suppresses entanglement and makes the system more susceptible to scrambling. The analysis of the butterfly velocity vB indicates that the presence of charge and the backreaction suppress the chaotic behavior of the system by. Furthermore, TMI exhibits a sharp transition under shockwave perturbations, with interboundary entanglement being entirely disrupted beyond a critical shock strength, which decreases with increasing charge.

TI Long-propagating ghost phonon polaritons enabled by selective mode
   excitation
SO LIGHT-SCIENCE & APPLICATIONS
AB The ability to precisely control the excitation of phonon polaritons (PhPs) provides unique opportunities for various nanophotonic applications, such as on-chip optical communication, quantum information processing, and controlled thermal radiation. Recently, ghost hyperbolic phonon polaritons (g-HPs) have been discovered, which exhibit in-plane hyperbolic dispersion on the surface and oblique wavefronts in the bulk. These g-HPs exhibit long-range, ray-like propagation, which is highly desirable. However, selective excitation of polaritonic modes and flexible control over the directionality of g-HPs remains an open problem. In this work, we experimentally demonstrate that changing the shape of the launching micro/nano antenna allows for control over the polariton mode excitation. Using a single asymmetric triangular gold antenna fabricated on a calcite crystal surface, we showcase highly directional g-HP excitation through selectively exciting desirable polariton modes. Our near-field imaging experiments verify that the g-HP excited by the triangular antenna can propagate over 80 microns, which is consistent with our numerical predictions. Overall, by combining g-HP theory with structural engineering, our work has further developed the potential of such anisotropic materials, enabling unexpected control over g-HPs, thus opening opportunities for various applications in mid-IR optoelectronics.

TI First-principles spin and optical properties of vacancy clusters in
   lithium fluoride
SO JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS
AB Vacancy-cluster color centers in lithium fluoride have been studied in detail both theoretically and experimentally for over a century, giving rise to various applications in solid-state lasers, broadband photonic devices, and radiation dosimeters. These color centers are also attractive candidate platforms for applications in quantum information science, due to their spin properties and strong coupling to the crystal lattice, which allows their properties to be easily tuned. Here, we present hybrid functional calculations of common vacancy defects in lithium fluoride, including their energetic, spin, and optical properties. We show that, for a wide range of hybrid functional parameters tuned to match the experimental bandgap, certain defects have little variation in their predicted optical properties. We further demonstrate that the parameters needed to satisfy the generalized Koopman's theorem and correctly position defect levels within the gap can vary dramatically, even for different charge states of the same defect. Our work establishes the accuracy of the computationally lightweight hybrid-functional approach for predicting the optical and energetic properties of color centers in polar materials.

TI Sum-of-Squares Relaxations for Information Theory and Variational
   Inference
SO FOUNDATIONS OF COMPUTATIONAL MATHEMATICS
AB We consider extensions of the Shannon relative entropy, referred to as f-divergences. Three classical related computational problems are typically associated with these divergences: (a) estimation from moments, (b) computing normalizing integrals, and (c) variational inference in probabilistic models. These problems are related to one another through convex duality, and for all of them, there are many applications throughout data science, and we aim for computationally tractable approximation algorithms that preserve properties of the original problem such as potential convexity or monotonicity. In order to achieve this, we derive a sequence of convex relaxations for computing these divergences from non-centered covariance matrices associated with a given feature vector: starting from the typically non-tractable optimal lower-bound, we consider an additional relaxation based on "sums-of-squares", which is is now computable in polynomial time as a semidefinite program. We also provide computationally more efficient relaxations based on spectral information divergences from quantum information theory. For all of the tasks above, beyond proposing new relaxations, we derive tractable convex optimization algorithms, and we present illustrations on multivariate trigonometric polynomials and functions on the Boolean hypercube.

TI The Round Complexity of Local Operations and Classical Communication
   (LOCC) in Random-Party Entanglement Distillation
SO QUANTUM
AB A powerful operational paradigm for distributed quantum information processing involves manipulating pre-shared entanglement by local operations and classical communication (LOCC). The LOCC round complexity of a given task describes how many rounds of classical communication are needed to complete the task. Despite some results separating one-round versus two-round protocols, very little is known about higher round complexities. In this paper, we revisit the task of one-shot random-party entanglement distillation as a way to highlight some interesting features of LOCC round complexity. We first show that for random-party distillation in three qubits, the number of communication rounds needed in an optimal protocol depends on the entanglement measure used; for the same fixed state some entanglement measures need only two rounds to maximize whereas others need an unbounded number of rounds. In doing so, we construct a family of LOCC instruments that require an unbounded number of rounds to implement. We then prove explicit tight lower bounds on the LOCC round number as a function of distillation success probability. Our calculations show that the original W-state random distillation protocol by Fortescue and Lo is essentially optimal in terms of round complexity.

TI Duality for Optimal Couplings in Free Probability
SO COMMUNICATIONS IN MATHEMATICAL PHYSICS
AB We study the free probabilistic analog of optimal couplings for the quadratic cost, where classical probability spaces are replaced by tracial von Neumann algebras, and probability measures on R-m are replaced by non-commutative laws of m-tuples. We prove an analog of the Monge-Kantorovich duality which characterizes optimal couplings of non-commutative laws with respect to Biane and Voiculescu's non-commutative L-2-Wasserstein distance using a new type of convex functions. As a consequence, we show that if (X, Y) is a pair of optimally coupled m-tuples of non-commutative random variables in a tracial W*-algebra A, then W*((1 - t)X + tY) = W* (X, Y) for all t is an element of (0, 1). Finally, we illustrate the subtleties of non-commutative optimal couplings through connections with results in quantum information theory and operator algebras. For instance, two non-commutative laws that can be realized in finite-dimensional algebras may still require an infinite-dimensional algebra to optimally couple. Moreover, the space of non-commutative laws of m-tuples is not separable with respect to the Wasserstein distance for m > 1.

TI Optical line shapes of color centers in solids from classical

SO NPJ COMPUTATIONAL MATERIALS
AB Color centers play key roles in, e.g., solid state lighting and quantum information technology. Here, we describe an approach for predicting the optical line shapes of such emitters based on direct sampling of the underlying autocorrelation functions through molecular dynamics simulations (MD-ACF). The energy landscapes are represented by a machine-learned potential that describes both the ground and excited state landscapes through a single model, guaranteeing size-consistent predictions.

Unlike the latter, it is, however, also applicable at high temperatures as it avoids harmonic and parallel-mode approximations and can be applied to study non-crystalline materials. The MD-ACF methodology thus promises to substantially widen the range of computational predictions of the optical properties of color centers and related defects.

TI Optimizing Phononic Crystal Waveguides for Enhanced Surface Acoustic
   Wave Confinement
SO PHYSICA STATUS SOLIDI B-BASIC SOLID STATE PHYSICS
AB Through the use of strain and induced piezoelectric fields, surface acoustic waves (SAWs) have been shown to control quantum information processes, such as single photon emission and the coherent transport of electron spins. Regarding the latter, systems using plane surface waves have provided suitable demonstration systems, but to build complexity, more control over the acoustic wave may be required. One method for acoustic control is the use of phononic crystals consisting of periodic arrays of nanofabricated holes on the surface of a device. These inclusions form a metamaterial-like layer with properties different from the host material to dictate the physics of wave motion. Exploiting these surface properties can lead to acoustic waveguides, which can be designed to control the path of the SAWs. The design parameters of a new type of phononic crystal waveguide are explored that use twofold elliptical cylinder inclusions to create a slow region that also limits coupling and radiative loss to bulk acoustic modes. Such a waveguide will be the foundational piece in an acoustic circuit that can then mediate complex spin transport geometries.

TI Rearrangement of Single Atoms by Solving Assignment Problems via
   Convolutional Neural Network
SO APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
AB Featured Application This work provides a systematic way to produce a defect-free atom array of neutral atom platforms for quantum information processing.Abstract This paper aims to present an approach to address the atom rearrangement problem by developing Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models. These models predict the coordinates for atom movements while ensuring collision-free transitions and filling all vacancies in the target array. The process begins with designing a cost function for the assignment problem that incorporates constraints to prevent collisions and guarantee vacancy filling. We then build and train CNN models using datasets for three different grid sizes: 10x10, 13x13, and 21x21. Our models achieve high accuracy in predicting atom positions, with individual position accuracies of 99.63%, 98.93%, and 97.24%, respectively, for the aforementioned grid sizes. Despite limitations in training larger models due to hardware constraints, our approach demonstrates significant improvements in speed and accuracy. The final section of the paper presents detailed accuracy results and calculation times for each model, highlighting the potential of CNN-based methods in optimizing atom rearrangement processes.

TI Quantum error cancellation in photonic systems: Undoing photon losses
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Real photonic devices are subject to photon losses that can decohere quantum information encoded in the system. In the absence of full fault tolerance, quantum error mitigation techniques have been introduced to help manage errors in noisy quantum devices. In this paper, we introduce an error mitigation protocol inspired by probabilistic error cancellation (a popular error mitigation technique in discrete variable systems) for continuous variable systems. We show that our quantum error cancellation protocol can undo photon losses in expectation value estimation tasks. To do this, we analytically derive the (nonphysical) inverse photon loss channel and decompose it into a sum over physically realizable channels with potentially negative coefficients. The bias of our ideal expectation value estimator can be made arbitrarily small at the cost of increasing the sampling overhead. The protocol requires a noiseless amplification followed by a series of photon subtractions. While these operations can be implemented probabilistically, for certain classes of initial state one can avoid the burden of carrying out the amplification and photon subtractions by leveraging Monte Carlo methods to give an unbiased estimate of the ideal expectation value. We validate our proposed mitigation protocol by simulating the scheme on squeezed vacuum states, cat states, and entangled coherent states.

TI Lineup polytopes of products of simplices
SO ANNALES DE L INSTITUT HENRI POINCARE D
AB Consider a real point configuration A of size n and an integer r n. The vertices of the r-lineup polytope of A correspond to the possible orderings of the top r points of the configuration obtained by maximizing a linear functional. The motivation behind the study of lineup polytopes comes from the representability problem in quantum chemistry. In that context, the relevant point configurations are the vertices of hypersimplices and the integer points contained in an inflated regular simplex. The central problem consists in providing an inequality representation of lineup polytopes as efficiently as possible. In this article, we adapt the developed techniques to the quantum information theory setup. The appropriate point configurations become the vertices of products of simplices. A particular case is that of lineup polytopes of cubes, which form a type B analog of hypersimplices, where the symmetric group of type A naturally acts. To obtain the inequalities, we center our attention on the combinatorics and the symmetry of products of simplices to obtain an algorithmic solution. Along the way, we establish relationships between lineup polytopes of products of simplices with the Gale order, standard Young tableaux, and the resonance arrangement.

TI Bending effects and optical properties of WSe2 nanoribbons of
   topological phase
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW MATERIALS
AB A WSe2 monolayer of 1T' phase is a large band-gap quantum spin Hall insulator, supporting dissipationless charge and spin transports through the topologically protected edge states. In this paper, we explore the nanoribbon forms of 1T'-phase WSe2 by first-principles density functional calculations and the many-body perturbation GW and Bethe-Salpeter equation method. We found that the 1T' WSe2 nanoribbon can show topological edge states with a ribbon width of similar to 4-6 nm. Those edge bands show crossing through the Fermi level an odd number of times, with one kind of spin-polarization connecting the valence band and conduction band continua. The topological features of the edge bands hold even under small and medium bending in the nanoribbon, while large bending induces large band splitting, resulting in a topological switch-off in the edge bands. The semiconducting 1T' WSe2 nanoribbon shows a large tunability with bending in optical absorption spectra and exciton states. The lowest-energy exciton is changed from optically dark in the flat nanoribbon to bright in the bent nanoribbons. These properties in the 1T' WSe2 nanoribbons suggest potential applications in controllable quantum electronics and exciton-based quantum information processes.

TI How not to extract information from black holes: Cosmic censorship as a
   guiding principle
SO PHYSICS LETTERS B
AB Black holes in general relativity are commonly believed to evolve towards a Schwarzschild state as they gradually lose angular momentum and electrical charge under Hawking evaporation. However, when Kim and Wen applied quantum information theory to Hawking evaporation and argued that Hawking particles with maximum mutual information could dominate the emission process, they found that charged black holes tend towards extremality. In view of some evidence pointing towards extremal black holes being effectively singular, this would violate the cosmic censorship conjecture. Nevertheless, since the Kim-Wen model is too simplistic (e.g. it assumes a continuous spectrum of particles with arbitrary charge-to-mass ratio), one might hope that a more realistic model could avoid this problem. In this work, we show that having only a finite species of charged particles would actually worsen the situation, with some end states becoming a naked singularity. With this model as an example, we emphasize the need to study whether charged black holes can violate cosmic censorship under a given model of Hawking evaporation. (C) 2022 The Author(s).

TI In operando charge transport imaging of atomically thin dopant
   nanostructures in silicon
SO NANOSCALE
AB Novel approaches to materials design, fabrication processes and device architectures have accelerated next-generation electronics component production, pushing device dimensions down to the nano- and atomic-scale. For device metrology methods to keep up with these developments, they should not only measure the relevant electrical parameters at these length-scales, but ideally do so during active operation of the device. Here, we demonstrate such a capability using the full functionality of an advanced scanning microwave/scanning capacitance/kelvin probe atomic force microscope to inspect the charge transport and performance of an atomically thin buried phosphorus wire device during electrical operation. By interrogation of the contact potential, carrier density and transport properties, we demonstrate the capability to distinguish between the different material components and device imperfections, and assess their contributions to the overall electric characteristics of the device in operando. Our experimental methodology will facilitate rapid feedback for the fabrication of patterned nanoscale dopant device components in silicon, now important for the emerging field of silicon quantum information technology. More generally, the versatile setup, with its advanced inspection capabilities, delivers a comprehensive method to determine the performance of nanoscale devices while they function, in a broad range of material systems.

TI Tunable microwave-optical entanglement and conversion in multimode
   electro-opto-mechanics
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB We study tunable double-channel microwave-optical (M-O) entanglement and coherent conversion by controlling the quantum interference effect. This is realized in a two-mechanical-mode electro-opto-mechanical (EOM) system, in which two mechanical resonators (MRs) are coupled with each other by phase-dependent phonon-phonon interaction, and link the interaction between the microwave and optical cavity. It's demonstrated that the mechanical coupling between two MRs leads to the interference of two pathways of electro-opto-mechanical interaction, which can generate the tunable double-channel phenomena in comparison with a typical three-mode EOM system. In particular, by tuning of phonon-phonon interaction and couplings between cavities with MRs, we can not only steer the switch from the M-O interaction with a single channel to that of the double-channel, but also modulate the entanglement and conversion characteristics in each channel. Moreover, our scheme can be extended to an N-mechanical-mode EOM system, in which N discrete channels will be observed and controlled. This study opens up prospects for quantum information transduction and storage with a wide bandwidth and multichannel quantum interface.

TI Single-Photon Emission by the Plasmon-Induced Transparency Effect in
   Coupled Plasmonic Resonators
SO PHOTONICS
AB The plasmon-induced transparency (PIT) effect with unique spectrum transmission characteristics is a significant property of plasmonic structures. A resonant nanocavity with nanoscale dimensions around a single-photon emitter dramatically enhances the emission rate of the emitter. Thus, we propose detuned resonant nanocavities to manipulate the emission rate of the emitter inside, of which either cell consists of a rectangular resonator surrounded by a U-like resonator. An InGaAs quantum dot in a GaAs nanowire placed in the center of the detuned resonant nanocavity was employed as a single-photon emitter. The finite-difference time domain simulation revealed that the distribution of the electromagnetic field can be affected by changing the coupling intensity between the bright and dark states of the PIT. Consequently, the emission rate of the single-photon emitter was dramatically enhanced by more than 2000 times due to the Purcell effect induced by the PIT in the resonant cavity. With the achievement of an ultrafast single-photon emission rate, the proposed single-photon emitter could have diverse applications in quantum information and quantum communications.

TI Vertical Electric-Field-Induced Switching from Strong to Asymmetric
   Strong-Weak Confinement in GaAs Cone-Shell Quantum Dots Using
   Transparent Al-Doped ZnO Gates
SO NANOMATERIALS
AB The first part of this work evaluates Al-doped ZnO (AZO) as an optically transparent top-gate material for studies on semiconductor quantum dots. In comparison with conventional Ti gates, samples with AZO gates demonstrate a more than three times higher intensity in the quantum dot emission under comparable excitation conditions. On the other hand, charges inside a process-induced oxide layer at the interface to the semiconductor cause artifacts at gate voltages above U approximate to 1 V. The second part describes an optical and simulation study of a vertical electric-field (F)-induced switching from a strong to an asymmetric strong-weak confinement in GaAs cone-shell quantum dots (CSQDs), where the charge carrier probability densities are localized on the surface of a cone. These experiments are performed at low U and show no indications of an influence of interface charges. For a large F, the measured radiative lifetimes are substantially shorter compared with simulation results. We attribute this discrepancy to an F-induced transformation of the shape of the hole probability density. In detail, an increasing F pushes the hole into the wing part of a CSQD, where it forms a quantum ring. Accordingly, the confinement of the hole is changed from strong, which is assumed in the simulations, to weak, where the local radius is larger than the bulk exciton Bohr radius. In contrast to the hole, an increasing F pushes the electron into the CSQD tip, where it remains in a strong confinement. This means the radiative lifetime for large F is given by an asymmetric confinement with a strongly confined electron and a hole in a weak confinement. To our knowledge, this asymmetric strong-weak confinement represents a novel kind of quantum mechanical confinement and has not been observed so far. Furthermore, the observed weak confinement for the hole represents a confirmation of the theoretically predicted transformation of the hole probability density from a quantum dot into a quantum ring. For such quantum rings, application as storage for photo-excited charge carriers is predicted, which can be interesting for future quantum photonic integrated circuits.

AB It follows from a result by Friedl, Ivanyos, Magniez, Santha and Sen from 2014 that, for any fixed integer m > 0 (thought of as being small), there exists a quantum algorithm for solving the hidden shift problem in an arbitrary finite abelian group (G, +) with time complexity
   poly(log vertical bar G vertical bar). 2(O) ((root log vertical bar mG vertical bar)).
   As discussed in the current paper, this can be viewed as a modest statement of Pohlig-Hellman type for hard homogeneous spaces. Our main contribution is a somewhat simpler algorithm achieving the same run-time for m = 2(t)p, with t any non-negative integer and p any prime number, where additionally the memory requirements are mostly in terms of quantum random access classical memory; indeed, the amount of qubits that need to be stored is poly(log vertical bar G vertical bar). Our central tool is an extension of Peikert's adaptation of Kuperberg's collimation sieve to arbitrary finite abelian groups. This allows for a reduction, in said time, to the hidden shift problem in the quotient G/2(t)pG, which can then be tackled in polynomial time, by combining methods by Friedl et al. for p-torsion groups and by Bonnetain and Naya-Plasencia for 2(t) -torsion groups.

TI Detectors for local discrimination of sets of generalized Bell states
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB A fundamental problem in quantum information processing is the discrimination among a set of orthogonal quantum states of a composite system under local operations and classical communication (LOCC). Corresponding to the LOCC indistinguishable sets of four ququad-ququad orthogonal maximally entangled states constructed by Yu et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 109, 020506 (2012)], the maximum commutative sets were introduced as detectors for the local distinguishability of the set of generalized Bell states (GBSs) for which the detectors are sufficient to determine the LOCC distinguishability. In this work, we show how to determine all the detectors for a given GBS set. We also construct several four-GBS sets without detectors, most of which are one-way LOCC indistinguishable and only one of which is one-way LOCC distinguishable, indicating that the detectors are not necessary for LOCC distinguishability. Furthermore, we show that for four-GBS sets in the quantum system CC6 (R) CC6, the detectors are almost necessary for one-way LOCC distinguishability, except for one set in the sense of local unitary equivalence. The problem of one-way LOCC discrimination of four-GBS sets in CC6 (R) CC6 is completely resolved.

TI Chiral light-matter interactions in solution-processable semiconductors
SO NATURE REVIEWS CHEMISTRY
AB Chirality is a fundamental property widely observed in nature, arising in objects without a proper rotation axis, therefore existing as forms with distinct handedness. This characteristic can profoundly impact the properties of materials and can enable new functionality, especially for spin-optoelectronics. Chirality enables asymmetric light and spin interactions in materials, with widespread potential applications ranging from energy-efficient displays, holography, imaging, and spin-selective and enantio-selective chemistry to quantum information technologies. This Review focuses on the emerging material class of solution-processable chiral semiconductors, a broad material class comprising organic, inorganic and hybrid materials. These exciting materials offer the opportunity to design desirable light-matter interactions based on symmetry rules, potentially enabling the simultaneous control of light, charge and spin. We briefly discuss the various types of solution-processible chiral semiconductors, including small molecules, polymers, supramolecular self-assemblies and halide perovskites. We then examine the interplay between chirality and spin in these materials, the various mechanisms of chiral light-matter interactions, and techniques utilized to characterize them. We conclude with current and future applications of chiral semiconductors that take advantage of their chiral light-matter interactions.

TI High power, frequency agile comb spectroscopy in the mid-infrared
   enabled by a continuous-wave optical parametric oscillator
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB While mid-infrared optical frequency combs have been widely utilized in areas such as trace gas sensing, chemical kinetics, and combustion science, their relatively low power has limited sensitivities and led to correspondingly long acquisition times. We have developed a new approach in which an electro-optic frequency comb is utilized to pump a continuous-wave singly-resonant optical parametric oscillator in order to spectrally translate the comb into the mid-infrared (2.19 mu m and 4.00 mu m) with watt-level powers. Through the use of electro-optic combs produced via chirped waveforms we have produced mid-infrared combs containing up to 2400 comb teeth. We show that an ultraflat comb can be generated on the non-resonant idler and we use these combs to perform high resolution spectroscopy on methane. In addition, we describe the underlying theory of this method and demonstrate that phase matching should allow for combs as broad as several THz to be spectrally translated to the mid-infrared. The high power and mutual coherence as well as the relatively low complexity of this approach should allow for broad application in areas such as chemical dynamics, quantum information, and photochemistry.

TI Fragility of the Schrodinger Cat in thermal environments
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB We describe the decoherence instability of Schrodinger Cat states in the two-site Bose-Hubbard model with an attractive on-site interaction between particles. For N particles with onsite attractive energy U and hopping amplitude between sites t, Cat states exist for u equivalent to UN/2t < -1 at zero temperature. However, they are increasingly unstable to small thermal fluctuations as the Cat itself is increasingly well-defined and its components become well-separated. For any given u < -1, the decoherence temperature becomes smaller for large N. The loss of off-diagonal coherence peaks in the equilibrium density matrix is dominated by the thermal admixture of the first excited state of the many-body system with its ground state. Particle number fluctuations, described in the grand canonical ensemble also reduce coherence, but to a lesser degree than thermal fluctuations. The full density matrix of the Schrodinger Cat is obtained by exact numerical diagonalization of the many-body Hamiltonian and a narrow regime in the parameter space of the particle number, temperature, and U/t is identified where small Cat states may survive decoherence in a physical environment.

TI Proposal for a continuous wave laser with linewidth well below the
   standard quantum limit
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Laser performance is constrained by various factors. Here, the authors show theoretically that the linewidth can be reduced below the standard quantum limit by engineering the output coupling of a laser to reduce noise, and discuss the potential practical implementation of this approach.
   Due to their high coherence, lasers are ubiquitous tools in science. We show that by engineering the coupling between the gain medium and the laser cavity as well as the laser cavity and the output port, it is possible to eliminate most of the noise due to photons entering as well as leaving the laser cavity. Hence, it is possible to reduce the laser linewidth by a factor equal to the number of photons in the laser cavity below the standard quantum limit. We design and theoretically analyze a superconducting circuit that uses Josephson junctions, capacitors and inductors to implement a microwave laser, including the low-noise couplers that allow the design to surpass the standard quantum limit. Our proposal relies on the elements of superconducting quantum information, and thus is an example of how quantum engineering techniques can inspire us to re-imagine the limits of conventional quantum systems.

TI Machine learning assisted zero-area pulse design in an open quantum
   system
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Accurate and precise quantum control is crucial for quantum information processing. Zero-area pulse control, originally developed for closed systems, has played a significant role in driving quantum systems toward desired states. However, its effectiveness is often compromised by environmental noise. Traditional methods can find optimal pulses for fixed environmental parameters, and they need to be recalculated again once the environmental parameters change. Here, we propose a supervised learning (SL)-based protocol to design optimal zero-area pulses in noisy environments. By including environmental parameters as input during training, the neural network (NN) learns to generate effective controls for various environmental parameters. We demonstrate the protocol using quantum state transmission through a spin chain governed by a non-Markovian master equation. The SL-optimized pulses significantly enhance transmission fidelity compared to ideal pulses, with greater improvements observed at higher system-bath coupling and temperature, where more optimization space exists. Interestingly, fidelity first increases and then decreases with stronger Markovianity, suggesting that highly Markovian environments limit control performance. We also compare the SL method with a genetic algorithm, and the similar results confirm the accuracy and generalization ability of the NN-based approach.

TI Dynamical multipartite entanglement in a generalized Tavis-Cummings
   model with XY spin interaction
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We present the dynamical multipartite entanglement, which is in terms of the quantum Fisher information, of a generalized Tavis-Cummings (TC) model introducing the XY spin interaction. Since our model cannot be solved exactly, the effective description of the model is theoretically derived and numerically examined. By the HolsteinPrimakoff transformation, we show the bridge from the generalized TC model to the central spin model. We also discuss the effect of the temperature, the coupling constant, and the magnetic field on the dynamical multipartite entanglement in the central spin model, where the central spin is initially unentangled. Strong coupling and low temperature are necessary conditions for a genuine multipartite entanglement in the XY model. The former governs the maximum entanglement, while the latter plays a crucial role in stabilizing the entanglement. The magnetic field modulates the period and amplitude of multipartite entanglement, primarily affecting the stable waveform of it. Our findings allow for a better comprehension of dynamical multipartite entanglement and provide a viable experimental platform for driving advances in quantum metrology and quantum information processing.

TI Bidirectional high-purity structured light beams transformation based on
   multi-plane light conversion
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Structured light beams are essential in optical communications, quantum information processing, and light-matter interactions. The generation and conversion of high-purity structured light beams are crucial for these applications. In this study, we propose a bidirectional high-purity structured light beam transformation approach based on the multi-plane light conversion (MPLC) method. This approach enables mutual conversion of arbitrary orthogonal modes and precise control of system loss and mode purity. Using the proposed method, we demonstrate the conversion of 7-modes Gaussian beams array (GBA) and perfect vortex beams (PVB), achieving a bidirectional output modes signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) exceeding 30 dB and a loss of 5.23 dB. For generation of 13-modes, an SNR above 25 dB and an insertion loss below 5.45 dB are obtained. Furthermore, the validity of methods is confirmed by generating multi-wavelength and structured light beams with more complex field distribution. The work paves the way toward structured- light-beam-based optical communications, high-dimensional quantum communications, and advancements in MPLC.

TI Correlation between two distant quasiparticles in separate
   superconducting islands mediated by a single spin
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Controlled coupling between distant particles is a key requirement for the implementation of quantum information technologies. A promising platform are hybrid systems of semiconducting quantum dots coupled to superconducting islands, where the tunability of the dots is combined with the macroscopic coherence of the islands to produce states with non-local correlations, e.g. in Cooper pair splitters. Electrons in hybrid quantum dots are typically not amenable to long-distance spin alignment as they tend to be screened into a localized singlet state by bound superconducting quasiparticles. However, two quasiparticles coming from different superconductors can overscreen the quantum dot into a doublet state, leading to ferromagnetic correlations between the superconducting islands. We present experimental evidence of a stabilized overscreened state, implying correlated quasiparticles over a micrometer distance. We propose alternating chains of quantum dots and superconducting islands as a novel platform for controllable large-scale spin coupling.
   The authors experimentally study a chain of superconducting islands (SI) and quantum dots (QD), where a Bogoliubov quasiparticle occupies each SI. They demonstrate correlations between the quasiparticles in each SI mediated by a single spin on the QD, known as an "over-screened" doublet state of the QD.

TI Generating superposition of squeezed states and photon-added squeezed
   states
SO PHYSICA SCRIPTA
AB The scheme of an arrangement is considered for the preparation of some non-classical superposed states from squeezed states by using the optical parametric amplifier (OPA) apparatus, which is based on an idea recently proposed to generate photon-added states from the coherent states of light. This technique allows one to obtain linear combinations of squeezed vacuum states (SVSs) and n-photon-added squeezed vacuum states (n-PASVSs), that can enrich the non-classicality of the SVSs and n-PASVSs and improve their performances in quantum information protocols. Their characteristics are greatly affected by the gain of the OPA and the coherent field amplitude (or, mean number of photons). For this purpose, a comprehensive analysis of the non-classical features of these states has been presented in four different behavioral regimes, i.e. low- and high-gain regimes in the presence of weak and strong coherent fields. Finally, the role of the gain parameter of the light state from OPA as one of the input states of the Mach-Zehnder interferometer (MZI) apparatus in phase sensitivity optimization is discussed.

TI Controlling quantum many-body systems using reduced-order modeling
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Quantum many-body control is among the most challenging problems in quantum science due to its outstanding computational complexity in a general case. We propose an efficient approach to a class of many-body quantum control problems, where time-dependent controls are applied to a sufficiently small subsystem. The method employs a tensor-network scheme to construct a reduced-order model of a subsystem's non-Markovian dynamics. The resulting reduced-order model serves as a digital twin of the original subsystem. Such twins allow significantly more efficient dynamics simulation, which enables the use of a gradient-based optimization toolbox in the control parameter space. This approach to building control protocols takes advantage of non-Markovian dynamics of subsystems by design. We validate the proposed method by solving control problems for quantum spin chains. In particular, the approach automatically identifies control sequences for exciting and guiding quasiparticles to recover and transmit quantum information across the system. In addition, we find generalized spin-echo sequences for a system in a many-body localized phase enabling significant revivals. We expect our approach can be useful for ongoing experiments with noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices.

TI Generations of Structured Light (Invited)
SO LASER & OPTOELECTRONICS PROGRESS
AB A structural beam refers to a light field that is "customized" in both space and time, characterized by its unique distribution of amplitude, phase, and polarization state in both space and time. Recently, research on structured light beams has developed rapidly. This has led to the evolution of a special distribution of optical parameters from specific spatial transverse and longitudinal structures to customized spatiotemporal structures. This type of beam with different spatiotemporal structures has brought breakthroughs in many fields, including optical communication, optical sensing, optical micromanipulation, quantum information processing, and super-resolution imaging. Therefore, various methods have been proposed, and related devices have been manufactured to generate structured light beams by adjusting the distribution of various optical parameters of the beam in spatial and spatiotemporal domains. This study mainly introduces the preparation methods for different types of structured light beams, such as spatially structured and spatiotemporal structured beams. Therefore, it provides a comprehensive overview of the generated structured beams, along with a discussion and outlook on the future development direction of structured beams.

TI High-peak-power random Yb-fiber laser with intracavity Raman-frequency
   comb generation
SO HIGH POWER LASER SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING
AB The random fiber laser (RFL) has been an excellent platform for exploring novel optical dynamics and developing new functional optoelectronic devices. However, it is challenging for RFLs to regulate their emission into regular narrow pulses due to their intrinsic randomness. Here, through engineering the laser configuration (cavity Q value, gain distribution and nonlinearity), we demonstrate that narrow (similar to 2.5 ns) pulses with record peak power as high as 64.3 kW are achieved from a self-Q-switched random ytterbium fiber laser. Based on high intracavity intensity and efficient interplay of multiple nonlinear processes (stimulated Brillouin scattering, stimulated Raman scattering and four-wave mixing), an over-one-octave visible-near-infrared (NIR) Raman-frequency comb is generated from single-mode silica fibers for the first time. After spectrally filtering the Raman peaks, wavelength-tunable pulses with durations of several hundreds of picoseconds are obtained. Such a high-peak-power random Q-switched fiber laser and wide frequency comb in the visible-NIR region can find applications in diverse areas, such as spectroscopy, biomedical imaging and quantum information.

AB Over the past few years, machine learning has emerged as a powerful computational tool to tackle complex problems in a broad range of scientific disciplines. In particular, artificial neural networks have been successfully used to mitigate the exponential complexity often encountered in quantum many-body physics, the study of properties of quantum systems built from a large number of interacting particles. In this article, we review some applications of neural networks in condensed matter physics and quantum information, with particular emphasis on hands-on tutorials serving as a quick start for a newcomer to the field. The prerequisites of this tutorial are basic probability theory and calculus, linear algebra, basic notions of neural networks, statistical physics, and quantum mechanics. The reader is introduced to supervised machine learning with convolutional neural networks to learn a phase transition, unsupervised learning with restricted Boltzmann machines to perform quantum tomography, and the variational Monte Carlo method with recurrent neural networks for approximating the ground state of a many-body Hamiltonian. For each algorithm, we briefly review the key ingredients and their corresponding neural network implementation, and show numerical experiments for a system of interacting Rydberg atoms in two dimensions.

TI The binary-outcome detection loophole
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB The detection loophole problem arises when quantum devices fail to provide an output for some runs. If treating these devices in a device-independent manner, failure to include the unsuccessful runs in the output statistics can lead to an adversary falsifying security i.e. Bell inequality violation. If the devices fail with too high frequency, known as the detection threshold, then no security is possible, as the full statistics cannot violate a Bell inequality. In this work we provide an intuitive local hidden-variable strategy that the devices may use to falsify any two-party, binary-outcome no-signalling distribution up to a threshold of 2(m (A) + m (B) - 8)/(m (A) m (B) - 16), where m (A), m (B) refer to the number of available inputs choices to the two parties. This value is the largest analytically predicted lower bound for no-signalling distributions. We strongly conjecture it gives the true detection threshold for m (A) = m (B), and for computationally tractable scenarios we provide the Bell inequality which verifies this. We also prove that a non-trivial detection threshold remains, even when allowing one party an arbitrary number of input choices.

TI Strong nanophotonic quantum squeezing exceeding 3.5 dB in a
   foundry-compatible Kerr microresonator
SO OPTICA
AB Squeezed light, with its quantum noise reduction capabilities, has emerged as a powerful resource in quantum information processing and precision metrology. To reach noise reduction levels such that a quantum advantage is achieved, off-chip squeezers are typically used. The development of on-chip squeezed light sources, particularly in nanophotonic platforms, has been challenging. We report 3.7 +/- 0.2 dB of directly detected nanophotonic quantum squeezing using foundry-fabricated silicon nitride (Si3N4) microrings with an inferred squeezing level of 10.2 dB on-chip. The squeezing level is robust across multiple devices and pump detunings, and is consistent with the overcoupling degree without noticeable degradation from excess classical noise. We also offer insights to mitigate thermally induced excess noise, which typically degrades squeezing, by using small-radius rings with a larger free spectral range (450 GHz) and consequently lower parametric oscillation thresholds. Our results demonstrate that Si3N4 is a viable platform for strong quantum noise reduction in a CMOS-compatible, scalable architecture.

TI Internal structure of gauge-invariant projected entangled pair states
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS A-MATHEMATICAL AND THEORETICAL
AB Projected entangled pair states (PEPS) are very useful in the description of strongly correlated systems, partly because they allow encoding symmetries, either global or local (gauge), naturally. In recent years, PEPS with local symmetries have increasingly been used in the study of non-perturbative regimes of lattice gauge theories, most prominently as a way to construct variational ansatz states depending only on a small number of parameters and yet capturing the relevant physical properties. For the case of one-dimensional PEPS (matrix product states-MPS) a bidirectional connection was established between the internal structure of the tensor network, i.e. the mathematical properties of the constituent tensors, and the symmetry. In higher dimensions this has only been done for global symmetries, where in the local (gauge) case it is known only how to construct gauge-invariant states, but not what the symmetry implies on the internal structure of the PEPS. In the present work we complete this missing piece and study the internal structure of PEPS with a gauge symmetry. The PEPS we consider consist of matter and gauge field tensors placed on the vertices and edges, respectively, of arbitrary graphs.

TI Black holes, complex curves, and graph theory: Revising a conjecture by
   Kasner
SO NUCLEAR PHYSICS B
AB Editor: The ratios \/ 8/9 = 2 2/3 approximate to 0.9428 . 9428 and \/3/2 approximate to 0.866 . 866 appear in various contexts of black hole physics, as values of the charge-to-mass ratio Q / M or the rotation parameter a / M for ReissnerNordstr & ouml;m and Kerr black holes, respectively. In this work, in the Reissner-Nordstr & ouml;m case, I relate these ratios with the quantization of the horizon area, or equivalently of the entropy. Furthermore, these ratios are related to a century-old work of Kasner, in which he conjectured that certain sequences arising from complex analysis may have a quantum interpretation. These numbers also appear in the case of Kerr black holes, but the explanation is not as straightforward. The Kasner ratio may also be relevant for understanding the random matrix and random graph approaches to black hole physics, such as fast scrambling of quantum information, via a bound related to Ramanujan graph. Intriguingly, some other pure mathematical problems in complex analysis, notably complex interpolation in the unit disk, appear to share some mathematical expressions with the black hole problem and thus also involve the Kasner ratio.

TI Measuring entanglement entropy and its topological signature for
   phononic systems
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Entanglement entropy is a fundamental concept with rising importance in various fields ranging from quantum information science, black holes to materials science. In complex materials and systems, entanglement entropy provides insight into the collective degrees of freedom that underlie the systems' complex behaviours. As well-known predictions, the entanglement entropy exhibits area laws for systems with gapped excitations, whereas it follows the Gioev-Klich-Widom scaling law in gapless fermion systems. However, many of these fundamental predictions have not yet been confirmed in experiments due to the difficulties in measuring entanglement entropy in physical systems. Here, we report the experimental verification of the above predictions by probing the nonlocal correlations in phononic systems. We obtain the entanglement entropy and entanglement spectrum for phononic systems with the fermion filling analog. With these measurements, we verify the Gioev-Klich-Widom scaling law. We further observe the salient signatures of topological phases in entanglement entropy and entanglement spectrum.
   Entanglement entropy exhibits rich phenomenology connected to different kinds of phases in condensed matter. Here, the authors confirm some of these predictions by experimentally probing nonlocal correlations in 1D and 2D phononic crystal based on interconnected resonating acoustic cavities.

TI Demonstrating long-term stable optical coupling between single-mode
   optical fibers and well-defined energy photons emitted from nitrogen
   impurity centers in GaAs flakes
SO JAPANESE JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS
AB A key challenge in realizing scalable optical quantum information technology is not only to obtain stable single photons coupled to single-mode fibers but also to match the emission energy between remote emitters. We have fabricated an energy-matching favorable and long-term stable structure by coupling a nitrogen impurity center with a well-defined emission energy to a single-mode optical fiber core. The nitrogen-doped GaAs microflakes sandwiched between the two FC (acronym for "ferrule connector" or "fiber channel") connectors yielded sharp emission peaks due to nitrogen isoelectronic traps. Although some emitters showed spectral diffusion, the unaffected emitters showed stable emission and were able to generate photons stably for over 20 h continuously without photodegradation. In addition, the photoluminescence spectrum does not change in shape and intensity after more than 3 years, indicating that the photon source with this structure is resistant to thermal cycling and positional drift and has excellent long-term stability.

TI Topological resonances in a Mobius ring resonator
SO COMMUNICATIONS PHYSICS
AB A Mobius strip, fascinating for its unique topological property of being a one-side nonorientable surface, has inspired mathematicians, physicists, engineers, and artists for many centuries. In a coherent system, coherent waves on the nonorientable surfaces reveal rich topological dynamics due to the interplay of coherence and topology. Here we experimentally observe topological resonances in a Mobius ring resonator formed in a twisted optical fiber loop. The twisted polarization-maintaining fiber ring encourages the hybridization of two polarization states, giving rise to the crucial Berry phase. This geometrical phase leads to the frequency shifts of fiber resonant modes with a non-trivial fractional mode number. Moreover, the resonant modes are topological, only resonating with certain polarized modes with circular chirality. These topological features introduce geometrical factors into coherent wave resonances, paving the way for topological information processing for quantum information, and coherent wave dynamics.
   The Mobius strip exhibits unique topological resonances, which are fundamental for topology-based signal processing. The authors realise a Mobius ring resonator via polarization-maintaining fibers, observing topological resonances emerging from the coupling between the two polarization modes along the fast and slow axes of the ring.

TI Programmable photon pair source
SO APL PHOTONICS
AB Photon pairs produced by the pulse-pumped nonlinear parametric processes have been a workhorse of quantum information science (QIS). Engineering the spectral property of quantum states is crucial for practical QIS applications. However, photon pairs with desirable spectral properties are currently achieved with specially engineered optical hardware but with severely limited flexibility in tuning the spectral properties of the sources. Here, we demonstrate a spectrally programmable photon pair source by exploiting a two-stage nonlinear interferometer scheme with a computer-controlled phase device. The phase-control device can introduce phase shifts for spectral engineering by a programmable phase function that can be arbitrarily defined. When the phase function is properly designed, the output spectrum of the source can be freely customized and changed without replacing any hardware component in the system. Using this approach, we are able to program photon pairs with factorable positively correlated and negatively correlated spectra. In addition, we also realize a source of multi-dimensional three-channel spectrally factorable photon pairs. Our investigation provides a flexible and powerful new approach for engineering the mode profile of photon pairs and should find wide applications in QIS.

TI Functional Metasurface Quarter-Wave Plates for Simultaneous Polarization
   Conversion and Beam Steering
SO ACS NANO
AB The capability to manipulate the polarization state of light at the nanoscale is of paramount importance in many emerging research areas ranging from optical communication to quantum information processing. Gap-surface plasmon (GSP) metasurfaces, which provide advantages and abilities of molding reflected fields, have been demonstrated excellently suited for integration of multifunctional polarization optics into a single device. Here, we establish a versatile GSP metasurface platform based on nanoscale quarter-wave plates (nano-QWPs) that enable efficient circular-to-linear polarization conversion along with the complete phase control over reflected fields. Capitalizing on the nano-QWP design, we demonstrate, both theoretically and experimentally, how resonance and geometric phases can be used in concert to achieve independent and simultaneous phase modulation of both co- and cross-polarized circularly polarized (CP) waves by realizing arbitrary beam steering of co- and cross-polarized CP channels in a broadband near-infrared range. The GSP metasurface platform established in our work provides versatile and flexible solutions to enrich multiple functionalities for diversified metasurface-based polarization optics exploited in modern integrated photonic devices and systems.

TI Probing resonating valence bond states in artificial quantum magnets
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Designing and characterizing the many-body behaviors of quantum materials represents a prominent challenge for understanding strongly correlated physics and quantum information processing. We constructed artificial quantum magnets on a surface by using spin-1/2 atoms in a scanning tunneling microscope (STM). These coupled spins feature strong quantum fluctuations due to antiferromagnetic exchange interactions between neighboring atoms. To characterize the resulting collective magnetic states and their energy levels, we performed electron spin resonance on individual atoms within each quantum magnet. This gives atomic-scale access to properties of the exotic quantum many-body states, such as a finite-size realization of a resonating valence bond state. The tunable atomic-scale magnetic field from the STM tip allows us to further characterize and engineer the quantum states. These results open a new avenue to designing and exploring quantum magnets at the atomic scale for applications in spintronics and quantum simulations. The resonating valence bond state is a spin-liquid state where spins continuously alter their singlet partners. Here Yang et al. use spin-1/2 atoms precision-placed by a scanning tunnelling microscope to create artificial quantum magnets exhibiting the resonating valence bond state.

TI Measurement-induced phase transitions for free fermions in a
   quasiperiodic potential
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB We study the dynamics under continuous measurements for free fermions in a quasiperiodic potential by using the Aubry-Andre-Harper model with hopping rate J and potential strength V. On the basis of the quantum trajectory method, we obtain the phase diagram for the steady-state entanglement entropy and demonstrate that robust logarithmic system-size scaling emerges up to a critical potential strength V-c/J similar to 2.3. Moreover, we find that the measurement induces entanglement phase transitions from the logarithmic-law phase to the area-law phase for the potential strength V < V-c, while any finite measurement stabilizes the area-law phase for V > V-c. This result is distinct from the entanglement scaling in the unitary limit, where volume-law and area-law phases undergo a transition at V/J = 2. To further support the phase diagram, we analyze the connected correlation function and find that it shows algebraic decay in the logarithmic-law phase, while it decays quickly in the arealaw phase. Our results can be tested in ultracold atoms by introducing quasiperiodic potentials and continuously monitoring the local occupation number with an off-resonant probe light.

TI Theoretical framework for chip-scale wavefront shaping with transverse
   spatial mode modulation
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Visible-wavelength applications such as quantum information systems, portable displays, and biological sensing and imaging devices require compact wavefront shaping capabilities. However, current chip-scale methods based on optical phased arrays require complex control of a large number of waveguides, leading to a large device footprint and limited field-of-view. Here, we propose an alternative framework for wavefront shaping using amplitude and phase control of transverse spatial modes within compact multimode waveguides. We show through analytical calculations and numerical simulations that changing the modal superposition of as few as 10 modes allows for dynamic control over the field both inside and outside of the waveguide. Grating-lobe-free beam steering over a 130 degrees field-of-view is demonstrated with peak resolution below 5 degrees and side lobe suppression levels up to -51 dB from a 5 mu m aperture. Reconfigurable focusing of points in the waveguide and in the near field, coupling to free-space Her mite-Gaussian modes, and generation of non-diffracting Bessel and Airy beams are also demonstrated, showing the vast capabilities possible within near-term experimental reach.

AB In recent years, there has been a significant increase in developing specialized education programmes in the field of quantum science and engineering. These initiatives are complicated, multi-actor, and resource-intensive by nature, and tend to require cooperation from a range of participants. Often, a range of recommendations from numerous community members need to be taken into consideration to solve these challenges. This paper explores the challenges of developing an inclusive curriculum for second-generation quantum education (i.e., QEdu 2.0) and considers suggestions highlighted by experts from within the sector, in addition to policymakers and funding organizations (public, private, and both regional and international). This work offers recommendations for developing additional programmes, as well as providing an update on the state of education programmes in order to be compatible with QEdu 2.0. Ultimately, in order to maximize the continuous significant investments being made in quantum information science, the proposed work and its activities call for the creation of a thorough strategic plan for workforce development and quantum education.

TI Statistical estimations of a five-level atom influenced by a two-mode
   field and nonlinear Kerr medium
SO ALEXANDRIA ENGINEERING JOURNAL
AB The nonclassical behavior of the optical model has important applications in numerous quantum information fields. The suggested optical model in this study is based on a five -level atom (5LA) influenced by a twomode quantized field (2MQF) inside a high -Q cavity that is filled with three types of nonlinear Kerr media. The nonlinear optical model has been solved analytically in which the components of this optical model are in perfect resonance. By considering the initial state of 5LA is in the upper state (excited state), whilst the initial state of 2MQF is in the coherent state. Some useful statistical measurements such as population inversion, Shannon entropy, second -order correlation, as well as Cauchy-Schwarz inequality that corresponds to P -functions are studied and discussed. The effects of the Kerr parameters on these statistical measurements are analyzed. All proposed statistical measurements confirm the existence of nonclassical behavior with time except for some small-time intervals.

TI Bound for Gaussian-state quantum illumination using a direct photon
   measurement
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB It is important to find feasible measurement bounds for quantum information protocols. We present analytic bounds for quantum illumination with Gaussian states when using an on-off detection or a photon number resolving (PNR) detection, where its performance is evaluated with signal-to-noise ratio. First, for coincidence counting measurement, the best performance is given by the two-mode squeezed vacuum (TMSV) state which outperforms the coherent state and the classically correlated thermal (CCT) state. However, the coherent state can beat the TMSV state with increasing signal mean photon number in the case of the on-off detection. Second, the performance is enhanced by taking Fisher information approach with all counting probabilities including non-detection events. In the Fisher information approach, the TMSV state still presents the best performance but the CCT state can beat the TMSV state with increasing signal mean photon number in the case of the on-off detection. Furthermore, we show that it is useful to take the PNR detection on the signal mode and the on-off detection on the idler mode, which reaches similar performance of using PNR detection on both modes.

TI Synthesis of mono-nitroxides and of bis-nitroxides with varying
   electronic through-bond communication
SO ORGANIC & BIOMOLECULAR CHEMISTRY
AB Nitroxides are a unique class of persistent radicals finding a wide range of applications, from spin probes to polarizing agents, and recently bis-nitroxides have been used as proof-of-concept molecules for quantum information processing. Here we present the syntheses of pyrroline-based nitroxide (NO) radicals and give a comparision of two possible synthetic routes to form two key intermediates, namely 2,2,5,5-tetramethylpyrroline-1-oxyl-3-acetylene (TPA) and 1-oxyl-2,2,5,5-tetramethylpyrroline-3-carboxylic acid (TPC). TPC and TPA were then used as precursors for the synthesis of three model compounds featuring two distant NO groups with a variable degree of conjugation and thus electronic communication between them. Using relatively facile synthetic routes, we produced a number of mono- and bis-nitroxides with the structures of multiple compounds unambiguously characterized by X-ray crystallography, while Continuous Wave Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (CW-EPR) allowed us to quantify the electronic communication in the bis-nitroxides. Our study expands the repertoire of mono- and bis-nitroxides with possibilities of exploiting them for studying quantum coherence effects and as polarizing agents.

TI High-efficiency and broadband on-chip electro-optic frequency comb
   generators
SO NATURE PHOTONICS
AB Developments in integrated photonics have led to stable, compact and broadband comb generators that support a wide range of applications including communications(1), ranging(2), spectroscopy(3), frequency metrology(4), optical computing(5,6) and quantum information(7,8). Broadband optical frequency combs can be generated in electro-optical cavities, where light passes through a phase modulator multiple times while circulating in an optical resonator(9-12). However, broadband electro-optic frequency combs are currently limited by low conversion efficiencies. Here we demonstrate an integrated electro-optic frequency comb with a conversion efficiency of 30% and an optical span of 132 nm, based on a coupled-resonator platform on thin-film lithium niobate(13). We further show that, enabled by the high efficiency, the device acts as an on-chip femtosecond pulse source (336 fs pulse duration), which is important for applications in nonlinear optics, sensing and computing. As an example, in the ultrafast and high-power regime, we demonstrate a frequency comb with simultaneous electro-optic and third-order nonlinearity effects.

TI Deterministic Relation between Optical Polarization and Lattice Symmetry
   Revealed in Ion-Doped Single Microcrystals
SO ACS NANO
AB Rare-earth ion doped crystals are of great significance for microsensing and quantum information, while the ions in the crystals emit light with spontaneous partial polarization, which is, though believed to be originated from the crystal lattice structure, still lacking a deterministic explanation that can be tested with quantitative accuracy. We report experimental evidence showing the profound physical relation between the polarization degree of light emitted by the doped ion and the lattice symmetry by demonstrating, with high precision, that the lattice constant ratio c/a directly quantifies the macroscopic effective polar angle of the electric and magnetic dipoles, which essentially determines the linear polarization degree of the emission. Based on this result, we further propose a pure optical technology to identify the three-dimensional orientation of a rod-shaped single microcrystal using the polarization-resolved microspectroscopy. Our results, demonstrating the physical origin of light polarization in ion-doped crystals, allow work toward on-demand polarization control with crystallography and provide a versatile platform for polarization-based microscale sensing in dynamical systems.

TI Focusing the electromagnetic field to 10-6λ for
   ultra-high enhancement of field-matter interaction
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Focusing electromagnetic field to enhance the interaction with matter has been promoting researches and applications of nano electronics and photonics. Usually, the evanescent-wave coupling is adopted in various nano structures and materials to confine the electromagnetic field into a subwavelength space. Here, based on the direct coupling with confined electron oscillations in a nanowire, we demonstrate a tight localization of microwave field down to 10(-6)lambda. A hybrid nanowire-bowtie antenna is further designed to focus the free-space microwave to this deep-subwavelength space. Detected by the nitrogen vacancy center in diamond, the field intensity and microwave-spin interaction strength are enhanced by 2.0 x 10(8) and 1.4 x 10(4) times, respectively. Such a high concentration of microwave field will further promote integrated quantum information processing, sensing and microwave photonics in a nanoscale system.
   Subwavelength focusing of electromagnetic fields often uses evanescent waves and nanostructures to aid confinement. Here, the authors localize a microwave field to 6 orders of magnitude smaller than the wavelength, by coupling to confined electron oscillations in a hybrid nanowire-bowtie antenna.

TI Observation of Single-Electron Transport and Charging on Individual
   Point Defects in Atomically Thin WSe2
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY C
AB Defects significantly impact the properties of 2D semiconductors, providing in-gap quantum states that can serve as a natural platform for single-electron operations, localization sites for excitons to serve as single-photon sources, and potentially quantum spin memories. To date, however, a microscopic observation of such a single-electron transport (SET) behavior has been rarely reported on single defects of 2D semiconductors. Here, we report a SET and charge-state transition on individual point-defect states buried in the bilayer WSe2 using scanning tunneling microscopy. SET characteristics of their states is evidenced by both the Coulomb staircase and the saturation behavior of the transport current, consistent with the SET model. Furthermore, we demonstrate that, through the local field of a scanning tunneling microscope tip, it is possible to successively charge the defects by single electrons, suggested by both the ring structures and charging peaks in dI/dV measurements. Our results provide new insights into the quantum nature of these defect-bound states, as well as the possibility of using their single-electron behavior and response for applications in quantum information and local-field sensing.

TI High-efficiency nonlinear frequency conversion enabled by optimizing the
   ferroelectric domain structure in x-cut LNOI ridge waveguide
SO NANOPHOTONICS
AB Photonic devices based on ferroelectric domain engineering in thin film lithium niobate are key components for both classical and quantum information processing. Periodic poling of ridge waveguide can avoid the selective etching effect of lithium niobate, however, the fabrication of high-quality ferroelectric domain is still a challenge. In this work, we optimized the applied electric field distribution, and rectangular inverted domain structure was obtained in the ridge waveguide which is beneficial for efficient non-linear frequency conversions. Second harmonic confocal microscope, piezoresponse force microscopy, and chemical selective etching were used to characterize the inverted domain in the ridge waveguide. In addition, the performance of nonlinear frequency conversion of the periodically poled nano-waveguide was investigated through second harmonic generation, and the normalized conversion efficiency was measured to be 1,720 % W-1 cm(-2), which is close to 60 % that of the theoretical value. The fabrication technique described in this work will pave the way for the development of high-efficiency, low-loss lithium niobate nonlinear photonic devices.

TI Ownerless island and partial entanglement entropy in island phases
SO SCIPOST PHYSICS
AB In the context of partial entanglement entropy (PEE), we study the entanglement structure of the island phases realized in several 2-dimensional holographic set-ups. From a pure quantum information perspective, the entanglement islands emerge from the selfencoding property of the system, which gives us new insights on the construction of the PEE and the physical interpretation of two-point functions of twist operators in island phases. With the contributions from the entanglement islands properly taken into account, we give a generalized prescription to construct PEE and balanced partial entanglement entropy (BPE). Here the ownerless island region, which lies inside the island Is(AB) of A u B but outside Is(A) u Is(B), plays a crucial role. Remarkably, we find that under different assignments for the ownerless island, we get different BPEs, which exactly correspond to different saddles of the entanglement wedge cross-section (EWCS) in the entanglement wedge of A u B. The assignments can be settled by choosing the one that minimizes the BPE. Furthermore, under this assignment we study the PEE and give a geometric picture for the PEE in holography, which is consistent with the geometric picture in the no-island phases.

TI Analytical nonadiabatic coupling and state-specific energy gradient for
   the crystal field Hamiltonian describing lanthanide single-ion magnets
SO JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS
AB Paramagnetic molecules with a metal ion as an electron spin center are promising building blocks for molecular qubits and high-density memory arrays. However, fast spin relaxation and decoherence in these molecules lead to a rapid loss of magnetization and quantum information. Nonadiabatic coupling (NAC), closely related to spin-vibrational coupling, is the main source of spin relaxation and decoherence in paramagnetic molecules at higher temperatures. Predicting these couplings using numerical differentiation requires a large number of computationally intensive ab initio or crystal field electronic structure calculations. To reduce computational cost and improve accuracy, we derive and implement analytical NAC and state-specific energy gradient for the ab initio parametrized crystal field Hamiltonian describing single-ion molecular magnets. Our implementation requires only a single crystal field calculation. In addition, the accurate NACs and state-specific energy gradients can be used to model spin relaxation using sophisticated nonadiabatic molecular dynamics, which avoids the harmonic approximation for molecular vibrations. To test our implementation, we calculate the NAC values for three lanthanide complexes. The predicted values support the relaxation mechanisms reported in previous studies.

TI High-Yield Deterministic Focused Ion Beam Implantation of Quantum
   Defects Enabled by In Situ Photoluminescence Feedback
SO ADVANCED SCIENCE
AB Focused ion beam implantation is ideally suited for placing defect centers in wide bandgap semiconductors with nanometer spatial resolution. However, the fact that only a few percent of implanted defects can be activated to become efficient single photon emitters prevents this powerful capability to reach its full potential in photonic/electronic integration of quantum defects. Here an industry adaptive scalable technique is demonstrated to deterministically create single defects in commercial grade silicon carbide by performing repeated low ion number implantation and in situ photoluminescence evaluation after each round of implantation. An array of 9 single defects in 13 targeted locations is successfully created-a approximate to 70% yield which is more than an order of magnitude higher than achieved in a typical single pass ion implantation. The remaining emitters exhibit non-classical photon emission statistics corresponding to the existence of at most two emitters. This approach can be further integrated with other advanced techniques such as in situ annealing and cryogenic operations to extend to other material platforms for various quantum information technologies.

TI Single charge control of localized excitons in heterostructures with
   ferroelectric thin films and two-dimensional transition metal
   dichalcogenides
SO NANOSCALE
AB Single charge control of localized excitons (LXs) in two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) is crucial for potential applications in quantum information processing and storage. However, traditional electrostatic doping method by applying metallic gates onto TMDCs may cause inhomogeneous charge distribution, optical quenching, and energy loss. Herein, by locally controlling the ferroelectric polarization of the ferroelectric thin film BiFeO3 (BFO) with a scanning probe, we can deterministically manipulate the doping type of monolayer WSe2 to achieve p-type and n-type doping. This nonvolatile approach can maintain the doping type and hold the localized excitonic charges for a long time without applied voltage. Our work demonstrated that the ferroelectric polarization of BFO can control the charges of LXs effectively. Neutral and charged LXs have been observed in different ferroelectric polarization regions, confirmed by magnetic optical measurement. Highly circular polarization degree with 90% photon emission from these quantum emitters was achieved in high magnetic fields. Controlling the single charge of LXs in a non-volatile way shows a great potential for deterministic photon emission with desired charge states for photonic long-term memory.

TI On-Chip High Extinction Ratio Single-Stage Mach-Zehnder Interferometer
   Based on Multimode Interferometer
SO IEEE PHOTONICS JOURNAL
AB On-chip high extinction ratio Mach-Zehnder interferometers (MZI) have always attracted interest from researchers as it can be used in many applications including astrophotonics, optical switching, programmable photonic circuit, and quantum information. However, in previous research studies, ultra-high extinction ratio on-chip MZIs have only been achieved by using a multi-stage MZI approach. In this paper, we investigate a high extinction ratio single-stage MZI based on two cascaded multimode interferometers (MMI). We determine that TM noise is an important factor that can prevent us from achieving high extinction ratio MZI. By introducing a bend-based TM filter without additional loss, we experimentally demonstrate that such a TM filter can improve the maximum extinction ratio of the MMI-MZI by more than 10 dB. With the TM filter, we report a record high 61.2 dB extinction ratio on a single stage, thermally tunable MMI-MZI with only 1.5 dB insertion loss and more than 60 nm bandwidth. These results pave the way for many interesting applications.

TI Algebraic and geometric structures inside the Birkhoff polytope
SO JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL PHYSICS
AB The Birkhoff polytope B-d consisting of all bistochastic matrices of order d assists researchers from many areas, including combinatorics, statistical physics, and quantum information. Its subset U-d of unistochastic matrices, determined by squared moduli of unitary matrices, is of particular importance for quantum theory as classical dynamical systems described by unistochastic transition matrices can be quantized. In order to investigate the problem of unistochasticity, we introduce the set L-d of bracelet matrices that forms a subset of B-d, but a superset of U-d. We prove that for every dimension d, this set contains the set of factorizable bistochastic matrices F-d and is closed under matrix multiplication by elements of F-d. Moreover, we prove that both L-d and F-d are star-shaped with respect to the flat matrix. We also analyze the set of d x d unistochastic matrices arising from circulant unitary matrices and show that their spectra lie inside d-hypocycloids on the complex plane. Finally, applying our results to small dimensions, we fully characterize the set of circulant unistochastic matrices of order d & LE; 4 and prove that such matrices form a monoid for d = 3.

TI Green Spin Light-Emitting Diodes Enabled by Perovskite Nanocrystals
   in Situ Modified with Chiral Ligands
SO ACS ENERGY LETTERS
AB Spin-polarized light-emitting diodes (spin-LEDs) hold promise for next-generation technologies across optical communication, biological imaging, and quantum information processing. Chiral metal halide perovskites, which combine advantageous optoelectronic properties with chirality, are promising materials for high-performance spin-LEDs. However, such spin-LEDs still suffer from low efficiency and limited brightness, as they often rely on low-dimensional chiral perovskites with rather inferior charge-transport properties as spin filter layers. Herein, we demonstrate bright and efficient green spin-LEDs based on chiral perovskite nanocrystals as emitters. We employed an in situ chiral ligand modification using R-/S-1-(4-bromophenyl)-ethylammonium bromide to imprint chirality onto CsPbBr3 nanocrystals, which exhibited both a high photoluminescence quantum yield of 89% and improved spin relaxation lifetime. A remarkable spin-polarization of 88% was observed for the CsPbBr3 nanocrystal films. Consequently, our spin-LEDs without a commonly used spin filter layer simultaneously achieved a maximum brightness of 12,800 cd m-2, a record-high peak external quantum efficiency of 15.4%, and a circularly polarized electroluminescence with a dissymmetry factor of 2.16 x 10-3 at room temperature, setting new benchmarks for perovskite-based spin-LEDs.

AB Coupling NV-rich diamond with optical fibers opens the door to guiding quantum information via the NV center's spin state. While diamond-functionalized fiber sensors have shown excellent sensitivity to localized magnetic fields, their distributed sensing capabilities have been untapped. By embedding diamonds throughout the fiber's core, we create a sensor sensitive to magnetic fields along its entire length. This theoretically allows for distributed optical readout of small magnetic fields. However, challenges remain in pinpointing the source's location and understanding the performance of a sensor where the NV-center fluorescence is detected at a single endpoint, integrating signals from color centers in varying field and microwave conditions. We present a demonstration of distributed magnetic field sensing using a step-index fiber with NV-rich diamonds incorporated throughout the core. By collecting the NV fluorescence at the fiber's output and recording Optically Detected Magnetic Resonance (ODMR) spectra as the excitation source moves, we can map the magnetic field profile along the fiber, accurately locating the field source. This straightforward sensor design holds promise for applications such as magnetic field mapping of integrated circuits in photonics and spintronics.

TI Approximation of Diffeomorphisms for Quantum State Transfers
SO IEEE CONTROL SYSTEMS LETTERS
AB In this letter, we seek to combine two emerging standpoints in control theory. On the one hand, recent advances in infinite-dimensional geometric control have unlocked a method for controlling (with arbitrary precision and in arbitrarily small times) state transfers for bilinear Schr & ouml;dinger PDEs posed on a Riemannian manifold M. In particular, these arguments rely on controllability results in the group of the diffeomorphisms of M. On the other hand, using tools of $\Gamma $ -convergence, it has been proved that we can phrase the retrieval of a diffeomorphism of M as an ensemble optimal control problem. More precisely, this is done by employing a control-affine system for simultaneously steering a finite swarm of points towards the respective targets. Here we blend these two theoretical approaches and numerically find control laws driving state transitions (such as eigenstate transfers) in small time in a bilinear Schr & ouml;dinger PDE posed on the torus. Such systems have experimental relevance and are currently used to model rotational dynamics of molecules, and cold atoms trapped in periodic optical lattices.

TI Topological states switching and group velocity control in
   two-dimensional non-reciprocal Hermitian photonic lattice
SO CHINESE PHYSICS B
AB We proposed a model with non reciprocal coupling coefficients, in which the imaginary parts gamma indicate the phase delay or exceed term. The distributions of band structure and the group velocity are both characterized as a function of the coupling. we studied the system's topological states and group velocity control. The results show that the movement and breaking of Dirac points exist in the energy band of the system. By changing the coupling coefficients, the conversion between any topological states corresponds to different Chern number. Topological edge states exist in topological non-trivial systems that correspond to the two different Chern numbers. Besides, it is also found that both the coupling coefficient and the wave vector can cause the oscillation of the pulse group velocity. At the same time, the topological state can suppress the amplitude of the group velocity profiles. Our findings enrich the theory of light wave manipulation in high-dimensional photonic lattices and provide a novel view for realizing linear localization and group velocity regulation of light waves, which has potential application in high-speed optical communication and quantum information fields.

TI Monolayer-Based Single-Photon Source in a Liquid-Helium-Free Open Cavity
   Featuring 65% Brightness and Quantum Coherence
SO NANO LETTERS
AB Solid-state single-photon sources are central building blocks in quantum information processing. Atomically thin crystals have emerged as sources of nonclassical light; however, they perform below the state-of-the-art devices based on volume crystals. Here, we implement a bright single-photon source based on an atomically thin sheet of WSe2 coupled to a tunable optical cavity in a liquid-helium-free cryostat without the further need for active stabilization. Its performance is characterized by high singlephoton purity (g((2))(0) = 4.7 +/- 0.7%) and record-high, first-lens brightness of linearly polarized photons of 65 +/- 4%, representing a decisive step toward real-world quantum applications. The high performance of our devices allows us to observe two-photon interference in a Hong-Ou-Mandel experiment with 2% visibility limited by the emitter coherence time and setup resolution. Our results thus demonstrate that the combination of the unique properties of two-dimensional materials and versatile open cavities emerges as an inspiring avenue for novel quantum optoelectronic devices.

TI Optima Multi-port-based Teleportation Schemes
SO QUANTUM
AB In this paper, we introduce optimal versions of a multi-port based teleportation scheme allowing to send a large amount of quantum information. We fully characterise probabilistic and deterministic case by presenting expressions for the average probability of success and entanglement fidelity. In the probabilistic case, the final expression depends only on global parameters describing the problem, such as the number of ports N, the number of teleported systems k, and local dimension d. It allows us to show square improvement in the number of ports with respect to the non-optimal case. We also show that the number of teleported systems can grow when the number N of ports increases as o(N) still giving high efficiency. In the deterministic case, we connect entanglement fidelity with the maximal eigenvalue of a generalised teleportation matrix. In both cases the optimal set of measurements and the optimal state shared between sender and receiver is presented. All the results are obtained by formulating and solving primal and dual SDP problems, which due to existing symmetries can be solved analytically. We use extensively tools from representation theory and formulate new results that could be of the separate interest for the potential readers.

TI Observation of Selective Light-Trapping in Half-Dislocation
   Dual-Photonic Crystal Microcavity
SO LASER & PHOTONICS REVIEWS
AB Topological photonic crystal (PhC) microcavities, renowned for their exotic characteristics like high-quality factors (Q - factors) and near-diffraction-limited mode volume, hold tremendous promise for applications in quantum information, laser technology, and integrated photonic chips. However, achieving flexible tunability and asymmetry in multi-cavity systems remains a challenge. In this work, an innovative real-momentum topological dual-optical microcavity system is proposed with two degenerated zero modes. Quite different from the proposed multi-microcavity systems, these two modes exhibit the same phase and are represented as the even mode in one cavity under both dual-cavity coupling and time-reversal symmetry (T-symmetry) breaking, while in the other cavity they display opposite phases and are characterized as the odd modes, which results in only one cavity surviving after superposition. By dynamically manipulating the orientation of the external magnetic field, electric field localization can be selectively activated in a designated microcavity. Both simulations and experimental measurements verify the symmetry of our model. As a promising application, an asymmetric radiation antenna is further proposed, which paves a new avenue for flexible topological PhC devices.

TI Three Cases of Complex Eigenvalue/Vector Distributions of Symmetric
   Order-Three Random Tensors
SO PROGRESS OF THEORETICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL PHYSICS
AB Random tensor models have applications in a variety of fields, such as quantum gravity, quantum information theory, mathematics of modern technologies, etc., and studying their statistical properties, e.g. tensor eigenvalue/vector distributions, is interesting and useful. Recently some tensor eigenvalue/vector distributions have been computed by expressing them as partition functions of 0D quantum field theories. In this paper, using this method, we compute three cases of complex eigenvalue/vector distributions of symmetric order-three random tensors, where the three cases can be characterized by the Lie-group invariances, $O(N,\mathbb {R})$, $O(N,\mathbb {C})$, and $U(N,\mathbb {C})$, respectively. Exact closed-form expressions of the distributions are obtained by computing partition functions of four-fermi theories, where the last case is of the "signed" distribution, which counts the distribution with a sign factor coming from a Hessian matrix. As an application, we compute the injective norm of the complex symmetric order-three random tensor in the large-N limit by computing the edge of the last signed distribution, obtaining agreement with an earlier numerical result in the literature.

TI Unfolding system-environment correlation in open quantum systems:
   Revisiting master equations and the Born approximation
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Understanding system-environment correlations in open quantum systems is vital for various quantum information and technology applications. However, these correlations are often overlooked or hidden in derivations of open-quantum-system master equations, especially when applying the Born approximation. To address this issue, given a microscopic model, we demonstrate how to retain system-environment correlation within commonly used master equations, such as the Markovian Lindblad, Redfield, second-order time convolutionless, second-order Nakajima-Zwanzig, and second-order universal Lindblad-like equations. We show that each master equation corresponds to a particular approximation on the system-environment correlation operator. In particular, our analysis exposes the form of the hidden system-environment correlation in the Markovian Lindblad equation derived using the Born approximation. We also identify that the processes leading to the Redfield equation yield an inaccurate initial-time system-environment correlation approximation. By fixing this problem, we propose a corrected Redfield equation with an improved prediction for early stages of the time evolution. We further illustrate our results in two examples, which imply that the second-order universal Lindblad-like equation captures correlation more accurately than the other standard master equations.

TI On-Demand Indistinguishable and Entangled Photons Using Tailored Cavity
   Designs
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB The biexciton-exciton emission cascade commonly used in quantum-dot systems to generate polarization entanglement yields photons with intrinsically limited indistinguishability. In the present work, it focuses on the generation of pairs of photons with high degrees of polarization entanglement and simultaneously high indistinguishability. It achieves this goal by selectively reducing the biexciton lifetime with an optical resonator. It demonstrates that a suitably tailored circular Bragg reflector fulfills the requirements of sufficient selective Purcell enhancement of biexciton emission paired with spectrally broad photon extraction and twofold degenerate optical modes. The in-depth theoretical study combines (i) the optimization of realistic photonic structures solving Maxwell's equations from which model parameters are extracted as input for (ii) microscopic simulations of quantum-dot cavity excitation dynamics with full access to photon properties. It reports non-trivial dependencies on system parameters and use the predictive power of the combined theoretical approach to determine the optimal range of Purcell enhancement that maximizes indistinguishability and entanglement to near unity values, here specifically for the telecom C-band at 1550 nm.

TI Measurement-based preparation of stable coherent states of a Kerr
   parametric oscillator
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Kerr parametric oscillators (KPOs) have attracted increasing attention in terms of their application to quantum information processing and quantum simulations. The state preparation and measurement of KPOs are typical requirements when used as qubits. The methods previously proposed for state preparations of KPOs utilize modulation of external fields such as a pump and drive fields. We study the stochastic state preparation of stable coherent states of a KPO with homodyne detection, which does not require modulation of external fields, and thus can reduce experimental efforts and exclude unwanted effects of possible imperfection in control of external fields. We quantitatively show that the detection data, if averaged over an optimal averaging time to decrease the effect of measurement noise, has a strong correlation with the state of the KPO, and therefore can be used to estimate the state (stochastic state preparation). We examine the success probability of the state estimation taking into account the measurement noise and bit flips. Moreover, the proper range of the averaging time to realize a high success probability is obtained by developing a binomial-coherent-state model, which describes the stochastic dynamics of the KPO under homodyne detection.

TI Temperature Dependence of Spin-Phonon Coupling in
   [VO(acac)2]: A Computational and Spectroscopic Study
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY C
AB Molecular electronic spins are good candidates as qubits since they are characterized by a large tunability of their electronic and magnetic properties through a rational chemical design. Coordination compounds of light transition metals are promising systems for spin-based quantum information technologies, thanks to their long spin coherence times up to room temperature. Our work aims at presenting an in-depth study on how the spin-phonon coupling in vanadyl-acetylacetonate, [VO(acac)(2)], can change as a function of temperature using terahertz time-domain spectroscopy and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Powder THz spectra were recorded between 10 and 300 K. The temperature dependence of vibrational frequencies was then accounted for in the periodic DFT calculations using unit-cell parameters measured at two different temperatures and the optimized ones, as usually reported in the literature. In this way, it was possible to calculate the observed THz anharmonic frequency shift with high accuracy. The overall differences in the spin-phonon coupling magnitudes as a function of temperature were also highlighted showing that the computed trends have to be ascribed to the anisotropic variation of cell parameters.

TI Floquet-Nambu theory of electron quantum optics with superconductors
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB We present a comprehensive Floquet-Nambu theory to describe the time-dependent quantum transport in mesoscopic circuits involving superconductors. The central object of our framework is the first-order correlation function, which accounts for the excitations that are generated by a time-dependent voltage and their coherent scattering off the interface with a superconductor. We analyze the time-dependent current generated by periodic voltage pulses and how it depends on the excitation energies of the voltage drive compared to the gap of the superconductor. Our general formalism allows us to identify the conditions for the excitations that are scattered off the superconductor to become coherent electron-hole superpositions. To this end, we consider the purity of the outgoing states, which characterizes their ability to carry quantum information. To illustrate our formalism, we apply it to a system composed of chiral quantum Hall edge states connected to a superconductor, and we calculate the current in the outgoing lead and the purity of the outgoing states for Lorentzian and harmonic voltage drives. Our framework paves the way for systematic investigations of time-dependent scattering problems involving superconductivity, and it may help interpret future experiments in electron quantum optics with superconductors.

TI Configurable optical vortex ladder in free space
SO APL PHOTONICS
AB Light eigenmodes with cylindrical symmetry, such as the Laguerre-Gaussian (LG) modes, are characterized by the radial and angular quantum numbers indicating radial nodes and orbital angular momentum (OAM), which are independent and invariant upon beam propagation. Here, we connect these two quantum numbers and produce a configurable optical vortex ladder. An LG vortex ladder that consists of multiple LG modes with different radial quantum numbers is proposed, whose OAM state of the mainlobe can change step by step upon propagation. By controlling radial quantum numbers within the LG vortex ladder, every step change of the OAM state can be configured arbitrarily, such as topological charge of OAM state increasing by two in every step. Manipulating the evolution of photonic OAM states is of great significance for quantum information processing and longitudinal manipulation of OAM have potential applications in communications, all-optical switch, and optical tweezers.

TI Dipolar spin wave packet transport in a van der Waals antiferromagnet
SO NATURE PHYSICS
AB Antiferromagnets are promising platforms for transduction and transmission of quantum information via magnons-the quanta of spin waves-and they offer advantages over ferromagnets in regard to dissipation, speed of response and robustness to external fields. Recently, transduction was shown in a van der Waals antiferromagnet, where strong spin-exciton coupling enables readout of the amplitude and phase of coherent magnons by photons of visible light. This discovery shifts the focus of research to transmission, specifically to exploring the non-local interactions that enable magnon wave packets to propagate. Here we demonstrate that magnon propagation is mediated by long-range dipole-dipole interaction. This coupling is an inevitable consequence of fundamental electrodynamics and, as such, will likely mediate the propagation of spin at long wavelengths in the entire class of van der Waals magnets currently under investigation. Successfully identifying the mechanism of spin propagation provides a set of optimization rules, as well as caveats, that are essential for any future applications of these promising systems.
   Understanding the mechanism by which magnons-the quanta of spin waves-propagate is important for developing practical devices. Now it is shown that long-range dipole-dipole interactions mediate the propagation in a van der Waals antiferromagnet.

TI Control of photon-photon interaction via a cavity
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Controlling the interaction between photons is one of the important technologies applied to quantum information processing at the few-photon level. We investigate the two-photon interaction via a Xi-type atom, where one atomic transition is coupled to a one-dimensional waveguide, and the other transition is coupled to a cavity field. Whether the cavity is initially in the vacuum state or not, determines the effective configuration of the quantum emitter. When the cavity is in the vacuum state, only one bound state appears. We further found that the joint probability of transmitted photons oscillates with their spatial separation due to the coexistence of two bound states, if the cavity is in fock state |n⟩ (n not equal 0). With the incoming wave function consists entirely of plane waves, we present the exact out-state function that exhibit the bunching and antibunching behaviors. And, we discuss in detail with the behaviors of varying both the photon pair energy(E) and the energy difference between the two photons ( increment ). Moreover, the spatial attraction and repulsion between the two transmitted photons can be controlled by the parameters of the cavity.

TI The mixed-state entanglement in holographic p-wave superconductor model
SO JOURNAL OF HIGH ENERGY PHYSICS
AB In this paper, we investigate the mixed-state entanglement in a model of p-wave superconductivity phase transition using holographic methods. We calculate several entanglement measures, including holographic entanglement entropy (HEE), mutual information (MI), and entanglement wedge cross-section (EWCS). Our results show that these measures display critical behavior at the phase transition points, with the EWCS exhibiting opposite temperature behavior compared to the HEE. Furthermore, we explore the behavior of thermodynamics and holographic quantum information at the zeroth-order phase transition point and find that it is opposite to that observed in the first-order phase transition. Additionally, we find that the critical exponents of all entanglement measures are twice those of the condensate. Our findings also suggest that the EWCS is a more sensitive indicator of the critical behavior of phase transitions than the HEE. Lastly, we uncover a universal inequality in the growth rates of EWCS and MI near critical points in thermal phase transitions, such as p-wave and s-wave superconductivity, suggesting that MI captures more information than EWCS when a phase transition first occurs.

TI Principles and Applications of Resonance Energy Transfer Involving Noble
   Metallic Nanoparticles
SO MATERIALS
AB Over the past several years, resonance energy transfer involving noble metallic nanoparticles has received considerable attention. The aim of this review is to cover advances in resonance energy transfer, widely exploited in biological structures and dynamics. Due to the presence of surface plasmons, strong surface plasmon resonance absorption and local electric field enhancement are generated near noble metallic nanoparticles, and the resulting energy transfer shows potential applications in microlasers, quantum information storage devices and micro-/nanoprocessing. In this review, we present the basic principle of the characteristics of noble metallic nanoparticles, as well as the representative progress in resonance energy transfer involving noble metallic nanoparticles, such as fluorescence resonance energy transfer, nanometal surface energy transfer, plasmon-induced resonance energy transfer, metal-enhanced fluorescence, surface-enhanced Raman scattering and cascade energy transfer. We end this review with an outlook on the development and applications of the transfer process. This will offer theoretical guidance for further optical methods in distance distribution analysis and microscopic detection.

TI Towards optical toroidal wavepackets through tight focusing of the
   cylindrical vector two dimensional spatiotemporal optical vortex
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Spatiotemporal optical vortices (STOVs) carrying transverse orbital angular mo-mentum (OAM) are of rapidly growing interest for the field of optics due to the new degree of freedom that can be exploited. In this paper, we propose cylindrical vector two dimensional STOVs (2D-STOVs) containing two orthogonal transverse OAMs in both x-t and y-t planes for the first time, and investigate the tightly focusing of such fields using the Richards-Wolf vectorial diffraction theory. Highly confined spatiotemporal wavepackets with polarization structure akin to toroidal topology is generated, whose spatiotemporal intensity distributions resemble the shape of Yo-Yo balls. Tightly focused radially polarized 2D-STOVs will produce wavepackets towards transverse magnetic toroidal topology, while the focused azimuthally polarized 2D-STOVs will give rise to wavepackets towards transverse electric toroidal topology. The presented method may pave a way to experimentally generate the optical toroidal wavepackets in a controllable way, with potential applications in electron acceleration, nanophotonics, energy, transient light-matter interaction, spectroscopy, quantum information processing, etc.(c) 2022 Optica Publishing Group under the terms of the Optica Open Access Publishing Agreement

TI Robust single modified divacancy color centers in 4H-SiC under resonant
   excitation
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Color centers in silicon carbide (SiC) offer exciting possibilities for quantum information processing. However, the challenge of ionization during optical manipulation leads to charge variations, hampering the efficacy of spin-photon interfaces. Recent research predicted that modified divacancy color centers can stabilize their charge states, resisting photoionization. This study presents a method for precisely creating single divacancy arrays in 4H-SiC using a focused helium ion beam. Photoluminescence tests reveal consistent emission with minimal linewidth fluctuations (similar to 50 MHz over 3 h). By measuring the ionization rate for different polytypes of divacancies, we found that the modified divacancies are more robust against resonant excitation. Furthermore, angle-resolved photoluminescence excitation spectra unveil two resonant-transition lines with orthogonal polarizations. Enhanced optical and spin characteristics were notably observed in these color centers compared to those generated through carbon-ion and shallow implantation methods, positioning modified divacancies as promising contenders for advancing quantum networking.
   Divacancy color centers in SiC are promising candidates for a spin-photon interface, but typically show charge-state instability under optical excitation. Here the authors show that modified divacancies created by a focused helium ion beam are robust against photoionization and have promising properties.

TI Information, Coding, and Biological Function: The Dynamics of Life
SO ARTIFICIAL LIFE
AB In the mid-20th century, two new scientific disciplines emerged forcefully: molecular biology and information-communication theory. At the beginning, cross-fertilization was so deep that the term genetic code was universally accepted for describing the meaning of triplets of mRNA (codons) as amino acids. However, today, such synergy has not taken advantage of the vertiginous advances in the two disciplines and presents more challenges than answers. These challenges not only are of great theoretical relevance but also represent unavoidable milestones for next-generation biology: from personalized genetic therapy and diagnosis to Artificial Life to the production of biologically active proteins. Moreover, the matter is intimately connected to a paradigm shift needed in theoretical biology, pioneered a long time ago, that requires combined contributions from disciplines well beyond the biological realm. The use of information as a conceptual metaphor needs to be turned into quantitative and predictive models that can be tested empirically and integrated in a unified view. Successfully achieving these tasks requires a wide multidisciplinary approach, including Artificial Life researchers, to address such an endeavour.

TI Improving Mechanical Oscillator Cooling in a Double-Coupled Cavity
   Optomechanical System with an Optical Parametric Amplifier
SO MATHEMATICS
AB We investigate the cooling phenomenon of a mechanical oscillator in a double-coupled cavity optomechanical system. Our model includes two single-mode optical cavities. The left cavity is an optomechanical system with an optical parametric amplifier, and the right cavity is a standard optical cavity. The two optical cavities couple with each other by exchanging photons. The optomechanical system is effectively driven by an input laser field. By solving the linear quantum Langevin equation of the system under a steady-state condition, we can obtain the position fluctuation spectrum and momentum fluctuation spectrum of the mechanical oscillator, and then, the expression of its effective temperature is obtained. Through numerical analysis, we find the change in the effective temperature of the mechanical oscillator under different physical parameters. The results show that the cooling of the mechanical oscillator can be significantly improved in the presence of optical parameter amplification and adjustment of optical cavity parameters. Our cooling solutions have potential applications for the preparation of nonclassical states of mechanical oscillators, high-precision measurements, and quantum information processing.

TI Small-scale (sub-organ and cellular level) alpha-particle dosimetry
   methods using an iQID digital autoradiography imaging system
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Targeted radiopharmaceutical therapy with alpha-particle emitters (alpha RPT) is advantageous in cancer treatment because the short range and high local energy deposition of alpha particles enable precise radiation delivery and efficient tumor cell killing. However, these properties create sub-organ dose deposition effects that are not easily characterized by direct gamma-ray imaging (PET or SPECT). We present a computational procedure to determine the spatial distribution of absorbed dose from alpha-emitting radionuclides in tissues using digital autoradiography activity images from an ionizing-radiation quantum imaging detector (iQID). Data from At-211-radioimmunotherapy studies for allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation in a canine model were used to develop these methods. Nine healthy canines were treated with 16.9-30.9 MBq At-211/mg monoclonal antibodies (mAb). Lymph node biopsies from early (2-5 h) and late (19-20 h) time points (16 total) were obtained, with 10-20 consecutive 12-mu m cryosections extracted from each and imaged with an iQID device. iQID spatial activity images were registered within a 3D volume for dose-point-kernel convolution, producing dose-rate maps. The accumulated absorbed doses for high- and low-rate regions were 9 +/- 4 Gy and 1.2 +/- 0.8 Gy from separate dose-rate curves, respectively. We further assess uptake uniformity, co-registration with histological pathology, and requisite slice numbers to improve microscale characterization of absorbed dose inhomogeneities in alpha RPT.

TI Fractional-statistics-induced entanglement from Andreev-like tunneling
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB The role of anyonic statistics stands as a cornerstone in the landscape of topological quantum techniques. While recent years have brought forth encouraging and persuasive strides in detecting anyons, a significant facet remains unexplored, especially in view of connecting anyonic physics to quantum information platforms-whether and how entanglement can be generated by anyonic braiding. Here, we demonstrate that even when two anyonic subsystems (represented by anyonic beams) are connected only by electron tunneling, entanglement between them, manifesting fractional statistics, is generated. To demonstrate this physics, we rely on a platform where fractional quantum Hall edges are bridged by a quantum point contact that allows only transmission of fermions (so-called Andreev-like tunneling). This invokes the physics of two-beam collisions in an anyonic Hong-Ou-Mandel collider, accompanied by a process that we dub anyon-quasihole braiding. We define an entanglement pointer-a current-noise-based function tailored to quantify entanglement associated with quasiparticle fractional statistics. Our work, which exposes, both in theory and in experiment, entanglement associated with anyonic statistics and braiding, prospectively paves the way to the exploration of entanglement induced by non-Abelian statistics.

TI Plasmonic-Strain Engineering of Quantum Emitters in Hexagonal Boron
   Nitride
SO ADVANCED MATERIALS INTERFACES
AB In the realm of quantum information and sensing, there has been substantial interest in the single-photon emission (SPE) associated with defects in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN). With the goal of producing deterministic emission centers, in this work, a platform is presented for engineering emission in hBN integrated with gold (Au) truncated nanocone structures. These findings highlight that, the emission in the hBN overlaps with the emission due to the truncated gold nanocones. Furthermore, the quantum characteristics of this emission are measured and found that while this system demonstrates support for SPE, the origin of this emission remains ambiguous. Specifically, it is unclear whether the emission arises from defects generated by the induced strain or from alternative defect mechanisms. This uncertainty stems from the fluorescence properties inherent to gold, complicating the definitive attribution of the quantum emission source. To provide a rigorous theoretical foundation, the effects of strain are elucidated via the Kirchhoff-Love theory. Additionally, the enhancements observed due to plasmonic effects are comprehensively explained through the resolution of Maxwell's equations. This study will be useful for the development of deterministic and tunable single photonic sources in 2D materials and their integration with plasmonic platforms.

TI Quantum dynamics in a single excitation subspace: deviations from
   eigenstate thermalization via long time correlations
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS A-MATHEMATICAL AND THEORETICAL
AB In this work we study a scenario where unitary quantum dynamics in a many-body interacting system is restricted to a single excitation subspace. We ask how dynamics within to such a subspace may in general differ from predictions of the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH). We show that for certain initial states and observables, if thermalization occurs, it will not fulfil other key predictions of the ETH; instead following differing generic behaviours. We show this by analysing long-time fluctuations, two-point correlation functions, and the out-of-time-ordered correlator; analytically detailing deviation from ETH predictions. We derive instead an ETH-like relation, with non-random off-diagonals for matrix elements of observables, with correlations which alter long-time behaviour and constrain dynamics. Further, we analytically compute the time-dependence of the decay to equilibrium, showing it is proportional to the survival probability of the initial state. We finally note the conditions studied are common in many physical scenarios, such as under the rotating-wave approximation. We show numerically our predictions are robust to perturbations which break this approximation.

TI Entangled two-plasmon generation in carbon nanotubes and graphene-coated
   wires
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB We investigate the two-plasmon spontaneous decay of a quantum emitter near single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) and graphene-coated wires (GCWs). We demonstrate efficient, enhanced generation of two-plasmon entangled states in SWCNTs due to the strong coupling between tunable guided plasmons and the quantum emitter. We predict two-plasmon emission rates more than twelve orders of magnitude higher than in free space, with average lifetimes of a few dozen nanoseconds. Given their low dimensionality, these systems could be more efficient for generating and detecting entangled plasmons in comparison to extended graphene. Indeed, we achieve a tunable spectrum of emission in GCWs, where sharp resonances occur precisely at the plasmons' minimum excitation frequencies. We show that by changing the material properties of the GCW's dielectric core, one could tailor the dominant modes and frequencies of the emitted entangled plasmons while keeping the decay rate ten orders of magnitude higher than in free space. By unveiling the unique properties of two-plasmon spontaneous emission processes in the presence of low-dimensional carbon-based nanomaterials, our findings set the basis for a novel material platform with applications to on-chip quantum information technologies.

TI Numerical study of holographic entanglement entropy and subregion
   complexity for a p-wave superconductor in massive gravity
SO NUCLEAR PHYSICS B
AB We invastigate numerically the holographic entanglement entropy (HEE) and holographic subregion complexity (HSC) for a p-wave superconductor with backreaction in the framework of dRGT massive gravity. We calculate the HEE and HSC as functions of subregion strip-width or temperature by following the RT formula and CV conjecture. It is shown that both the HEE and HSC exhibit a discontinuity in their slope at the critical temperature, hence the two physical quantities can be able to probe the p-wave superconducting phase transition. Both the HEE and HSC increase linearly at the large strip-widths, which is consistent with the "area law" of entanglement entropy and the definition of complexity in quantum information. We notice that the HEE in the superconducting phase is always lower than that in the normal phase. In contrast, the behavior of HSC shows a distinct and intriguing dependence on the strip-width. Through comparing the values of HEE and HSC for different massive coupling constants or backreaction, we find that increasing backreaction or introducing massive gravity term results in a notable increase in both HEE and HSC.

TI The Accelerated Topological Laser Induced by Non-Hermitian Topological
   Flat Band in The Dimerized Lattice
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB A method of inverse Fourier transform engineering is demonstrated for constructing the topological flat band both in Hermitian and non-Hermitian systems. In Hermitian dimerized lattice, the designed topological flat band is demonstrated to suppress the bulk diffusion of quantum walk. In non-Hermitian dimerized lattice, the intrinsic connection between the topological flat band and non-Hermitian phase transition is revealed, which is rarely mentioned in previous works. It is further shown that the non-Hermitian effect can induce a topological laser in the quantum walk, and significantly, it can be markedly accelerated by the non-Hermitian flat band. This accelerated transmission phenomenon is counterintuitive since the flat band usually means the localization in Hermitian system. This phenomenon is found to originate from the further destruction of orthogonality of quantum states induced by flat band in non-Hermitian system, which shows the interesting interplay between non-Hermitian effect and topological flat band. The investigations show the favorable effects of non-Hermitian topological flat band on quantum transmission, which may promote the applications of non-Hermitian topological system in quantum information processing.

TI Holographic View of Mixed-State Symmetry-Protected Topological Phases in
   Open Quantum Systems
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB We establish a holographic duality between d-dimensional mixed-state symmetry-protected topological (mSPT) phases and (d + 1)-dimensional subsystem symmetry-protected topological (SSPT) states. Specifically, we show that the reduced density matrix of the boundary layer of a (d+ 1)-dimensional SSPT state with subsystem symmetry S and global symmetry corresponds to a d-dimensional mSPT phase with strong S and weak symmetries. Conversely, we demonstrate that the wave function of an SSPT state can be constructed by replicating the density matrix of the corresponding lower-dimensional mSPT phase. This mapping links the density matrix in lower dimensions to the entanglement properties of higher-dimensional wave functions, providing an approach for analyzing nonlinear quantities and quantum information metrics in mixed-state systems. Our duality offers a new perspective for studying intrinsic mSPT phases that are unique to open quantum systems, without pure-state analogues. We show that strange correlators and twisted R & eacute;nyi-N correlators can diagnose these nontrivial phases and we explore their connection to strange correlators in pure-state SSPT phases. Furthermore, we discuss several implications of this holographic duality, including a method for preparing intrinsic mSPT phases through the duality.

TI Does entanglement enhance single-molecule pulsed biphoton spectroscopy?
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB It depends. For a single molecule interacting with one mode of a biphoton probe, we show that the spectroscopic information has three contributions, only one of which is a genuine two-photon contribution. When all the scattered light can be measured, solely this contribution exists and can be fully extracted using unentangled measurements. Furthermore, this two-photon contribution can, in principle, be matched by an optimised but unentangled single-photon probe. When the matter system spontaneously emits into inaccessible modes, an advantage due to entanglement can not be ruled out. In practice, time-frequency entanglement does enhance spectroscopic performance of the oft-studied weakly-pumped spontaneous parametric down conversion (PDC) probes. For two-level systems and coupled dimers, more entangled PDC probes yield more spectroscopic information, even in the presence of emission into inaccessible modes. Moreover, simple, unentangled measurements can capture between 60% and 90% of the spectroscopic information. We thus establish that biphoton spectroscopy using source-engineered PDC probes and unentangled measurements can provide tangible quantum enhancement. Our work underscores the intricate role of entanglement in single-molecule spectroscopy using quantum light.

TI Cavity-coupled telecom atomic source in silicon
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Novel T centers in silicon hold great promise for quantum networking applications due to their telecom band optical transitions and the long-lived ground state electronic spins. An open challenge for advancing the T center platform is to enhance its weak and slow zero phonon line (ZPL) emission. In this work, by integrating single T centers with a low-loss, small mode-volume silicon photonic crystal cavity, we demonstrate an enhancement of the fluorescence decay rate by a factor of F = 6.89. Efficient photon extraction enables the system to achieve an average ZPL photon outcoupling rate of 73.3 kHz under saturation, which is about two orders of magnitude larger than the previously reported value. The dynamics of the coupled system is well modeled by solving the Lindblad master equation. These results represent a significant step towards building efficient T center spin-photon interfaces for quantum information processing and networking applications.
   T centers in silicon are promising candidates for quantum applications yet suffer from weak optical transitions. Here, by integrating with a silicon nanocavity, the authors demonstrate an enhancement of the photon emission rate for a single T center.

TI Characterization and optimized engineering of bosonic quantum interfaces
   under single-mode operational constraints
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Controlling the quantum interface between two bosonic modes is essential in countless implementations of quantum information processing. However, full controllability is rarely achieved in most platforms due to specific physical limitations. In this work, we completely characterize the linear two-mode interfaces under the most pessimistic restriction that only single-mode operation is available. When arbitrary Gaussian single-mode operations can be applied to both modes, we find that every interface can be characterized by an invariant transmission strength. Moreover, in the practical situation that squeezing is restricted in one of the modes, we discover two additional quantities, irreducible squeezing and irreducible shearing, that are invariant under the allowable controls. By using this characterization, we develop systematic strategies to engineer an arbitrary linear interface through cascading multiple fixed component interfaces. Without squeezing restriction, our protocol is optimal and requires at most three component interfaces. Under the squeezing constraint, our protocol can be extended to engineer also the additional invariants by using no more than two more rounds of cascade. We also propose the remote squeezing scheme to tackle the squeezing restriction through interfacing with an active auxiliary mode.

TI Phase-dependent Andreev molecules and superconducting gap closing in
   coherently-coupled Josephson junctions
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB The Josephson junction (JJ) is an essential element of superconducting (SC) devices for both fundamental and applied physics. The short-range coherent coupling of two adjacent JJs forms Andreev molecule states (AMSs), which provide a new ingredient to engineer exotic SC phenomena such as topological SC states and Andreev qubits. Here we provide tunneling spectroscopy measurements on a device consisting of two electrically controllable planar JJs sharing a single SC electrode. We discover that Andreev spectra in the coupled JJ are highly modulated from those in the single JJs and possess phase-dependent AMS features reproduced in our numerical calculation. Notably, the SC gap closing due to the AMS formation is experimentally observed. Our results help in understanding SC transport derived from the AMS and promoting the use of AMS physics to engineer topological SC states and quantum information devices.
   S. Matsuo et al. report tunneling spectroscopy measurements on a device consisting of two Josephson junctions (JJ) sharing a single superconducting electrode. In isolation, each JJ would host an Andreev bound state (ABS). In their coherently-coupled JJs, the authors report the formation of an Andreev molecule due to hybridization of the two ABSs.

TI Influence of the Magnetic Tip on Heterodimers in Electron Spin Resonance
   Combined with Scanning Tunneling Microscopy
SO ACS NANO
AB Investigating the quantum properties of individual spins adsorbed on surfaces by electron spin resonance combined with scanning tunneling microscopy (ESR-STM) has shown great potential for the development of quantum information technology on the atomic scale. A magnetic tip exhibiting high spin polarization is critical for performing an ESR-STM experiment. While the tip has been conventionally treated as providing a static magnetic field in ESR-STM, it was found that the tip can exhibit bistability, influencing ESR spectra. Ideally, the ESR splitting caused by the magnetic interaction between two spins on a surface should be independent of the tip. However, we found that the measured ESR splitting of a metal atom-molecule heterodimer can be tip-dependent. Detailed theoretical analysis reveals that this tip-dependent ESR splitting is caused by a different interaction energy between the tip and each spin of the heterodimer. Our work provides a comprehensive reference for characterizing tip features in ESR-STM experiments and highlights the importance of employing a proper physical model when describing the ESR tip, in particular, for heterospin systems.

TI Precession-induced nonclassicality of the free induction decay of NV
   centers by a dynamical polarized nuclear spin bath
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS-CONDENSED MATTER
AB The ongoing exploration of the ambiguous boundary between the quantum and the classical worlds has spurred substantial developments in quantum science and technology. Recently, the nonclassicality of dynamical processes has been proposed from a quantum-information-theoretic perspective, in terms of witnessing nonclassical correlations with Hamiltonian ensemble simulations. To acquire insights into the quantum-dynamical mechanism of the process nonclassicality, here we propose to investigate the nonclassicality of the electron spin free-induction-decay process associated with an NV- center. By controlling the nuclear spin precession dynamics via an external magnetic field and nuclear spin polarization, it is possible to manipulate the dynamical behavior of the electron spin, showing a transition between classicality and nonclassicality. We propose an explanation of the classicality-nonclassicality transition in terms of the nuclear spin precession axis orientation and dynamics. We have also performed a series of numerical simulations supporting our findings. Consequently, we can attribute the nonclassical trait of the electron spin dynamics to the behavior of nuclear spin precession dynamics.

TI Single-Photon-Induced Electron Spin Polarization of Two Exchange-Coupled
   Stable Radicals
SO JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY
AB Transient electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy has been used to probe photoinduced electron spin polarization of a stable exchange-coupled organic biradical in a Pt(II) complex comprising 4,4 '-di-tert-butyl-2,2 '-bipyridine (bpy) and 3,6-bis(ethynyl-para-phenyl-nitronyl nitroxide)-o-catecholate (CAT(o-CC-Ph-NN)2). Photoexcitation results in four unpaired spins in excited states of this complex, with spins being localized on each of the two radicals, CAT center dot+ and bpy center dot-. The four spins are all exchange-coupled in these excited states, and an off-diagonal matrix element in the CAT center dot+-NN exchange allows for exchange-enhanced intersystem crossing to the 3T1a state, which possesses (bpy center dot-)Pt(CAT center dot+) chromophoric triplet character. Fast mixing between this 3T1a state and thermally accessible excited LL'CT state(s) followed by fast relaxation provides spin polarization of the exchange-coupled NN radicals in the 3S0 ground state of the complex. Our results demonstrate that well-defined quantum states of a ground-state biradical can be initialized with single-photon excitation and have the potential for further spin manipulation directed toward quantum information science applications.

TI Saturation of thermal complexity of purification
SO JOURNAL OF HIGH ENERGY PHYSICS
AB We purify the thermal density matrix of a free harmonic oscillator as a two-mode squeezed state, characterized by a squeezing parameter and squeezing angle. While the squeezing parameter is fixed by the temperature and frequency of the oscillator, the squeezing angle is otherwise undetermined, so that the complexity of purification is obtained by minimizing the complexity of the squeezed state over the squeezing angle. The resulting complexity of purification of the thermal state is minimized at non-zero values of the squeezing angle and saturates to an order one number at low frequencies, indicating that there is no additional operator cost required to build thermal mixed states when the oscillator probes length scales that are large compared to the thermal length scale. We also review applications in which thermal density matrices arise for quantum fields on curved spacetimes, including Hawking radiation and a simple model of decoherence of cosmological density perturbations in the early Universe. The complexity of purification for these mixed states also saturates as a function of the effective temperature, which may have interesting consequences for the quantum information stored in these systems.

TI Classical benchmarking for microwave quantum illumination
SO IET QUANTUM COMMUNICATION
AB Quantum illumination theoretically promises up to a 6 dB error-exponent advantage in target detection over the best classical protocol. The advantage is maximised by a regime that includes a very high background, which occurs naturally when one considers microwave operation. Such a regime has well-known practical limitations, though it is clear that, theoretically, knowledge of the associated classical benchmark in the microwave is lacking. The requirement of amplifiers for signal detection necessarily renders the optimal classical protocol here different to that which is traditionally used, and only applicable in the optical domain. This work outlines what is the true classical benchmark for the microwave Quantum illumination using coherent states, providing new bounds on error probability and closed formulae for the receiver operating characteristic, for both optimal (based on quantum relative entropy) and homodyne detection schemes. An alternative source generation procedure based on coherent states is also proposed, which demonstrates the potential to make classically optimal performances achievable in optical applications. The same bounds and measures for the performance of such a source are provided, and its potential utility in the future of room temperature quantum detection schemes in the microwave is discussed.

TI A mechanically stable and tunable cryogenic Fabry-Perot microcavity
SO REVIEW OF SCIENTIFIC INSTRUMENTS
AB High-finesse, open-geometry microcavities have recently emerged as a versatile tool for enhancing interactions between photons and material systems with a range of applications in quantum optics and quantum information science. However, mechanical vibrations pose a considerable challenge to their operation within a closed-cycle cryostat, particularly when spatial tunability and free-space optical access are required. Here, we present the design and characterization of a system that can achieve similar to 16 pm-rms passive mechanical stability between two high-finesse mirrors with 34% duty cycle while permitting both three-dimensional positioning of the cavity mode and free-space confocal imaging. The design relies on two cascaded vibration isolation stages connected by leaf springs that decouple axial and lateral motion and incorporates tuned-mass and magnetic damping. Furthermore, we present a technique for quantifying cavity length displacements similar to or larger than the cavity linewidth, allowing for the in situ measurement of vibrations with and without active feedback. Our results facilitate operation of a tunable, high-finesse cavity within a closed-cycle cryostat, representing an enabling technology for cavity coupling to a variety of solid-state systems.

TI Current-induced brightening of vacancy-related emitters in hexagonal
   boron nitride
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB We perform photoluminescence measurements on vacancy-related emitters in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) that are notorious for their low quantum yields. The gating of these emitters via few-layer graphene electrodes reveals a reproducible, gate-dependent brightening of the emitter, which coincides with a change in the direction of the simultaneously measured leakage current across the hBN layers. At the same time, we observe that the relative increase of the brightening effect scales linearly with the intensity of the excitation laser. Both observations can be explained in terms of a photo-assisted electroluminescence effect. Interestingly, emitters can also show the opposite behavior, i.e., a decrease in emitter intensity that depends on the gate leakage current. We explain these two opposing behaviors by different concentrations of donor and acceptor states in the hBN and show that precise control of the doping of hBN is necessary to gain control over the brightness of vacancy-related emitters by electrical means. Our findings contribute to a deeper understanding of vacancy-related defect emitters in hBN that is necessary to make use of their potential in quantum information processing.

TI Controllable valley magnetic response in phase-transformed tungsten
   diselenide
SO ADVANCED PHOTONICS NEXUS
AB Achieving valley pseudospin with large polarization is crucial in the implementation of quantum information applications. Transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDC) with different phase structures provide an ideal platform for valley modulation. The valley splitting has been achieved in hybrid phase WSe2, while its valley polarization remains unstudied. Magnetic field controllable valley polarization is explored in WSe2 with coexistence of H and T phases by an all-optical route. A record high valley polarization of 58.3% is acquired with a 19.9% T phase concentration under a 4-T magnetic field and nonresonant excitation. The enhanced valley polarization is dependent on the phase component and shows various increasing slopes, owing to the synergy between the T phase WSe2 and the magnetic field. The magnetic field controlled local magnetic momentums are revealed as the mechanism for the large valley polarization in H/T-WSe2. This speculation is also verified by theoretical simulations of the nonequilibrium spin density. These results display a considerable valley magnetic response in phase-engineered TMDC and provide a large-scale scheme for valley polarization applications.

TI Coherent momentum control of forbidden excitons
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB A double-edged sword in two-dimensional material science and technology is optically forbidden dark exciton. On the one hand, it is fascinating for condensed matter physics, quantum information processing, and optoelectronics due to its long lifetime. On the other hand, it is notorious for being optically inaccessible from both excitation and detection standpoints. Here, we provide an efficient and low-loss solution to the dilemma by reintroducing photonics bound states in the continuum (BICs) to manipulate dark excitons in the momentum space. In a monolayer tungsten diselenide under normal incidence, we demonstrated a giant enhancement (similar to 1400) for dark excitons enabled by transverse magnetic BICs with intrinsic out-of-plane electric fields. By further employing widely tunable Friedrich-Wintgen BICs, we demonstrated highly directional emission from the dark excitons with a divergence angle of merely 7 degrees. We found that the directional emission is coherent at room temperature, unambiguously shown in polarization analyses and interference measurements. Therefore, the BICs reintroduced as a momentum-space photonic environment could be an intriguing platform to reshape and redefine light-matter interactions in nearby quantum materials, such as low-dimensional materials, otherwise challenging or even impossible to achieve.

The hybrid quantum-plasmonic system consists of a three-level V-type quantum emitter and a two-dimensional plasmonic metasurface of gold nanoshells. The quantum emitter and the plasmonic metasurface are placed in close proximity to each other so that a strong quantum interference of spontaneous emission occurs, which enables the strong modification of optical-bistability/ multistability hysteresis curves. Along with this, the strong interaction between the emitter and the plasmonic metasurface allows for active control of the corresponding bistable threshold intensity. Furthermore, we show that by varying the metasurface-emitter separation, a transition from bistability to multistability of the hybrid system is observed. Lastly, by introducing an additional incoherent pumping in the system, we have the emergence of phenomena, such as probe absorption and gain, with or without population inversion. The results may find technological application in on-chip nanoscale photonic devices, optoelectronics and solid-state quantum information science.

TI Organic Spin-State Photoswitches
SO ANGEWANDTE CHEMIE-INTERNATIONAL EDITION
AB Organic spin-state photoswitches represent an emerging class of molecular systems capable of reversibly modulating electronic spin states using light. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the fundamental mechanisms underlying two principal switching modes: photoconformational and photochemical. Emphasis is placed on their structural design, magnetic behavior, and the methods used for their characterization, including electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and UV-vis spectroscopy. Selected examples illustrate the ability of these systems to control spin-polarized states, alter magnetic exchange interactions, or switch between singlet and triplet spin states upon photoirradiation. The review also discusses challenges related to thermal stability, bistability, and operation under ambient conditions. Emerging strategies for integrating photoswitches with persistent radicals or redox-active units are highlighted for their potential in molecular electronics and quantum information science. Notably, light-induced diradical species in such systems are gaining recognition as molecular qubits, offering long coherence times and spectroscopic addressability essential for quantum gate operations. By exploring design principles and technological implications, this review underscores the unique position of all-organic spin-state photoswitches at the intersection of photochemistry, magnetism, and quantum materials development.

TI Work extracting and second law-like inequalities from non-extensive
   small systems with feedback
SO TURKISH JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB The Gibbs-Boltzmann entropy effectively characterizes systems with a significant reliance on initial conditions. Nonetheless, the majority of materials generally exhibit behavior that is independent of their initial conditions. Conversely, Tsallis entropy-a nonextensive entropy that underpins nonextensive statistical mechanics-provides a comprehensive framework for modeling systems that engage with their environment. In this study, we derive the Tsallis formulation of the Clausius inequality in a quantum context and establish an upper limit for the work that can be extracted from a small system within the framework of nonextensive quantum statistical mechanics. Furthermore, by utilizing a principle from quantum information theory- which posits that erasing a single bit of information corresponds to the dissipation of a specific quantity of energy into the environment-we formulate an inequality for the erasure process in nonextensive systems. This principle aligns with the physical law that entropy can be transformed into heat. Additionally, we derive mutual information and integrate quantum feedback control to enhance Maxwell's demon. Ultimately, we extend the second law of thermodynamics to information processes through the application of Tsallis entropy.

TI A fixed phase tunable directional coupler based on coupling tuning
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB The field of photonic integrated circuits has witnessed significant progress in recent years, with a growing demand for devices that offer high-performance reconfigurability. Due to the inability of conventional tunable directional couplers (TDCs) to maintain a fixed phase while tuning the reflectivity, Mach-Zehnder interferometers (MZIs) are employed as the primary building blocks for reflectivity tuning in constructing large-scale circuits. However, MZIs are prone to fabrication errors due to the need for perfect balanced directional couplers to achieve 0-1 reflectivity, which hinders their scalability. In this study, we introduce a design of a TDC based on coupling constant tuning in the thin film Lithium Niobate platform and present an optimized design. Our optimized TDC design enables arbitrary reflectivity tuning while ensuring a consistent phase across a wide range of operating wavelengths. Furthermore, it exhibits fewer bending sections than MZIs and is inherently resilient to fabrication errors in waveguide geometry and coupling length compared to both MZIs and conventional TDCs. Our work contributes to developing high-performance photonic integrated circuits with implications for various fields, including optical communication systems and quantum information processing.

TI Visual explanations of machine learning model estimating charge states
   in quantum dots
SO APL MACHINE LEARNING
AB Charge state recognition in quantum dot devices is important in the preparation of quantum bits for quantum information processing. Toward auto-tuning of larger-scale quantum devices, automatic charge state recognition by machine learning has been demonstrated. For further development of this technology, an understanding of the operation of the machine learning model, which is usually a black box, will be useful. In this study, we analyze the explainability of the machine learning model estimating charge states in quantum dots by gradient weighted class activation mapping. This technique highlights the important regions in the image for predicting the class. The model predicts the state based on the change transition lines, indicating that human-like recognition is realized. We also demonstrate improvements of the model by utilizing feedback from the mapping results. Due to the simplicity of our simulation and pre-processing methods, our approach offers scalability without significant additional simulation costs, demonstrating its suitability for future quantum dot system expansions.

TI Single PbS colloidal quantum dot transistors
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Colloidal quantum dots are sub-10 nm semiconductors treated with liquid processes, rendering them attractive candidates for single-electron transistors operating at high temperatures. However, there have been few reports on single-electron transistors using colloidal quantum dots due to the difficulty in fabrication. In this work, we fabricated single-electron transistors using single oleic acid-capped PbS quantum dot coupled to nanogap metal electrodes and measured single-electron tunneling. We observed dot size-dependent carrier transport, orbital-dependent electron charging energy and conductance, electric field modulation of the electron confinement potential, and the Kondo effect, which provide nanoscopic insights into carrier transport through single colloidal quantum dots. Moreover, the large charging energy in small quantum dots enables single-electron transistor operation even at room temperature. These findings, as well as the commercial availability and high stability, make PbS quantum dots promising for the development of quantum information and optoelectronic devices, particularly room-temperature single-electron transistors with excellent optical properties.
   Colloidal quantum dots remain unexplored for applications in single-electron devices. Here, the authors demonstrate single-electron transistors using single PbS colloidal quantum dot, highlighting their room-temperature operation.

TI Quintet formation, exchange fluctuations, and the role of stochastic
   resonance in singlet fission
SO COMMUNICATIONS PHYSICS
AB Singlet fission describes the spin-conserving production of two triplet excitons from one singlet exciton. The existence of a spin-2 (quintet) triplet-pair state as a product of singlet fission is well established in the literature, and control of quintet formation is an important step towards applying singlet fission in photovoltaics and quantum information. However, a definitive mechanism for quintet formation is yet to be established, which makes it difficult to design materials for optimal quintet formation. Here we outline a mechanism in which inter-triplet exchange-coupling fluctuations drive fast and efficient quintet formation. We show that quintet formation is possible even in the strong-exchange regime, in accordance with recent experimental prediction. We evaluate the performance of this quintet formation mechanism in two regimes of conformational freedom, and relate quintet dynamics to material properties of singlet fission molecules.
   Quintet formation is a part of a photochemical energy conversion process, which could be exploited to help achieve higher efficiency values for photovoltaics. Here, the authors propose a stochastic and coherent resonance mechanism for formation of the quintet spin state in singlet fission materials, that is still viable in the strong-exchange regime.

TI Gauge-invariant and anyonic-symmetric autoregressive neural network for
   quantum lattice models
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Symmetries such as gauge invariance and anyonic symmetry play a crucial role in quantum many-body physics. We develop a general approach to constructing gauge-invariant or anyonic-symmetric autoregressive neural networks, including a wide range of architectures such as transformer and recurrent neural network, for quantum lattice models. These networks can be efficiently sampled and explicitly obey gauge symmetries or anyonic constraint. We prove that our methods can provide exact representation for the ground and excited states of the two-and three-dimensional toric codes, and the X-cube fracton model. We variationally optimize our symmetry-incorporated autoregressive neural networks for ground states as well as real-time dynamics for a variety of models. We simulate the dynamics and the ground states of the quantum link model of U(1) lattice gauge theory, obtain the phase diagram for the two-dimensional Z2 gauge theory, determine the phase transition and the central charge of the SU(2)3 anyonic chain, and also compute the ground-state energy of the SU(2) invariant Heisenberg spin chain. Our approach provides powerful tools for exploring condensed-matter physics, high-energy physics, and quantum information science.

TI Evolution on spatial patterns of structured laser beams: from

SO ADVANCED PHOTONICS NEXUS
AB Spatial patterns are a significant characteristic of lasers. The knowledge of spatial patterns of structured laser beams is rapidly expanding, along with the progress of studies on laser physics and technology. Particularly in the last decades, owing to the in-depth attention on structured light with multiple degrees of freedom, the research on spatial and spatiotemporal structures of laser beams has been promptly developed. Such beams have hatched various breakthroughs in many fields, including imaging, microscopy, metrology, communication, optical trapping, and quantum information processing. Here, we would like to provide an overview of the extensive research on several areas relevant to spatial patterns of structured laser beams, from spontaneous organization to multiple transformations. These include the early theory of beam pattern formation based on the Maxwell-Bloch equations, the recent eigenmodes superposition theory based on the time-averaged Helmholtz equations, the beam patterns extension of ultrafast lasers to the spatiotemporal beam structures, and the structural transformations in the nonlinear frequency conversion process of structured beams.

TI Terahertz Near-Field Vortex Beams with Variable Intensity Profiles Based
   on Geometric Metasurfaces
SO ADVANCED PHOTONICS RESEARCH
AB Electromagnetic waves possessing orbital angular momentum, namely, vortex beams, have attracted considerable attention in the fields ranging from optical communications to quantum science, due to their extraordinary information encoding capabilities. Vortex beams are traditionally exhibited with a doughnutshaped intensity distribution, where a null intensity center surrounded by a bright ring, caused by the phase singularity. Herein, geometric metasurface devices that can generate near-field vortex beams with variable intensity profiles are proposed and experimentally demonstrated. The generation of a vortex beam with tailored intensity profile is realized by integrating the azimuthal nonlinear phase and spiral phase into ring-shaped anisotropic air-slit arrays. As proof-of-principle examples, multiple geometric metasurfaces that generate vortex beams with C-N_fold rotational symmetric or asymmetric intensity profiles in the near-field are demonstrated in the terahertz domain. This unique capability for terahertz nearfield vortices with variable intensity distributions based on geometric metasurface approach opens an avenue to develop multifunctional integrated systems and system-on-chip devices, leading to potential applications in microscopy, integrated photonics, quantum information processing, and optical communication.

TI Effect of chaos on information gain in quantum tomography
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW E
AB Does chaos in the dynamics enable or impede information gain in quantum tomography? We address this question by considering continuous measurement tomography in which the measurement record is obtained as a sequence of expectation values of a Hermitian observable evolving under the repeated application of the Floquet map of the quantum kicked top. For a given dynamics and Hermitian observables, we observe completely opposite behavior in the tomography of well-localized spin coherent states compared to random states. As the chaos in the dynamics increases, the reconstruction fidelity of spin coherent states decreases. This contrasts with the previous results connecting information gain in tomography of random states with the degree of chaos in the dynamics that drives the system. The rate of information gain and hence the fidelity obtained in tomography depends not only on the degree of chaos in the dynamics and to what extent it causes the initial observable to spread in various directions of the operator space, but, more importantly, how well these directions are aligned with the density matrix to be estimated. Our study also gives an operational interpretation for operator spreading in terms of fidelity gain in an actual quantum information tomography protocol.

TI Bell correlations in a split two-mode-squeezed Bose-Einstein condensate
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We propose and analyze a protocol for observing a violation of the Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (CHSH) Bell inequality using two spatially separated Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs). To prepare the Bell correlated state, spin-changing collisions are used to first prepare a two-mode squeezed BEC. This is then split into two BECs by controlling the spatial wave function, e.g., by modifying the trapping potential. Finally, spin-changing collisions are also exploited locally, to compensate local squeezing terms. The correlators appearing in the inequality are evaluated using three different approaches. In the first approach, correlators are estimated using normalized expectation values of number operators, in a similar way to evaluating continuous-variable Bell inequalities. An improvement to this approach is developed using the sign binning of total spin measurements, which allows for the construction of two-outcome measurements and violations of the CHSH inequality without auxiliary assumptions. Finally, we show a third approach where maximal violations of the CH inequality can be obtained by assigning zero values to local vacua outcomes under a no-enhancement assumption. The effect of loss and imperfect detection efficiency is investigated, and the observed violations are found to be robust to noise.

TI Light-induced valleytronics in pristine graphene
SO OPTICA
AB Electrons in two-dimensional hexagonal materials have an extra degree of freedom, the valley pseudospin, that can be used to encode and process quantum information. Valley-selective excitations, governed by the circularly polarized light resonant with the material's bandgap, are the foundation of valleytronics. It is often assumed that achieving valley selective excitation in pristine graphene with all-optical means is not possible due to the inversion symmetry of the system. Here, we demonstrate that both valley-selective excitation and valley-selective high-harmonic generation can be achieved in pristine graphene by using a combination of two counter-rotating circularly polarized fields, the fundamental and its second harmonic. Controlling the relative phase between the two colors allows us to select the valleys where the electron-hole pairs and higher-order harmonics are generated. We also describe an all-optical method for measuring valley polarization in graphene with a weak probe pulse. This work offers a robust recipe to write and read valley-selective electron excitations in materials with zero bandgap and zero Berry curvature.

According to our classification, there is a one-to-one correspondence between these Floquet phases and rational functions pi(z) = a(z)/b(z), where a(z) and b(z) are polynomials obeying certain conditions and z is a formal parameter. The physical meaning of pi(z) involves the stroboscopic edge dynamics of the corresponding Floquet system: in the case of bosonic systems, pi(z) = p/q. (pi) over tilde (z), where p/q is a rational number that characterizes the flow of quantum information at the edge during each driving period and (pi) over tilde (z) is a rational function which characterizes the flow of U(1) charge at the edge. A similar decomposition exists in the fermionic case. We also show that (pi) over tilde (z) is directly related to the time-averaged U(1) current that flows in a particular geometry. This U(1) current is a generalization of the quantized current and quantized magnetization density found in previous studies of noninteracting fermionic Floquet phases.

TI Weak magnetic fields modulate superoxide to control planarian
   regeneration
SO FRONTIERS IN PHYSICS
AB Reactive oxygen species (ROS) signaling regulates cell behaviors and tissue growth in development, regeneration, and cancer. Commonly, ROS are modulated pharmacologically, which while effective comes with potential complications such as off-target effects and lack of drug tolerance. Thus, additional non-invasive therapeutic methods are necessary. Recent advances have highlighted the use of weak magnetic fields (WMFs, < 1 mT) as one promising approach. We previously showed that 200 mu T WMFs inhibit ROS formation and block planarian regeneration. However, WMF research in different model systems at various field strengths have produced a range of results that do not fit common dose response curves, making it unclear if WMF effects are predictable. Here, we test hypotheses based on spin state theory and the radical pair mechanism, which outlines how magnetic fields can alter the formation of radical pairs by changing electron spin states. This mechanism suggests that across a broad range of field strengths (0-900 mu T) some WMF exposures should be able to inhibit while others promote ROS formation in a binary fashion. Our data reveal that WMFs can be used for directed manipulation of stem cell proliferation, differentiation, and tissue growth in predictable ways for both loss and gain of function during regenerative growth. Furthermore, we examine two of the most common ROS signaling effectors, hydrogen peroxide and superoxide, to begin the identification and elucidation of the specific molecular targets by which WMFs affect tissue growth. Together, our data reveal that the cellular effects of WMF exposure are highly dependent on ROS, and we identify superoxide as a specific ROS being modulated. Altogether, these data highlight the possibilities of using WMF exposures to control ROS signaling in vivo and represent an exciting new area of research.

TI Nuclear quantum effects explain chemiosmosis: The power of the proton
SO BIOSYSTEMS
AB ATP is a universal bio-currency, with chemiosmosis the metabolic mint by which currency is printed. Chemiosmosis leverages a membrane potential and ion gradient, typically a proton gradient, to generate ATP. The current chemiosmotic hypothesis is both cannon and dogma. However, there are obstacles to the unqualified and uncritical acceptance of this model. Intriguingly the proton is sufficiently small to exhibit quantum phenomena of wave-particle duality, often thought the exclusive prerogative of smaller subcellular particles. Evidence shows that chemiosmosis is by necessity critically dependent upon these nuclear quantum effects (NQE) of hydrogen, most notably as a proton. It is well established scientific orthodoxy that protons in water and hydrogen atoms of water molecules exhibit quantum phenomena. The effect is amplified by the hydrogen bonding and juxta-membrane location of protons in mitochondria and chloroplasts. NQE explains the otherwise inexplicable features of chemiosmosis, including the paucity of protons, the rate of proton movement and ATP genesis in otherwise subliminal proton motive forces and thus functionality of alkaliphiles. It also accounts for the efficiencies of chemiosmosis reported at greater than 100% in certain contexts, which violates the second law of thermodynamics under the paradigm of classical physics. Mitochondria may have evolved to exploit quantum biology with notable features such as dimeric ATP synthases adumbrating the first double-slip experiment with the protons. The dramatic global deceleration of mitochondrial chemiosmosis and all cellular function following proton substitution with its heavier isotopes, deuterium and tritium: "deuteruction", is testimony to the primacy of nuclear quantum effects in this Quantum Chemiosmosis. Indeed the speed of evolution itself and its inexorable route to homeothermy may be due to the power of nuclear quantum effects of the smallest nucleus, the proton. The atom that is almost nothing was selected to bring about the most important processes and complex manifestations of life.

TI What Is life? Rethinking Biology in Light of Fundamental Parameters
SO LIFE-BASEL
AB Defining life is an arduous task that has puzzled philosophers and scientists for centuries. Yet biology suffers from a lack of clear definition, putting biologists in a paradoxical situation where one can describe at the atomic level complex objects that remain globally poorly defined. One could assume that such descriptions make it possible to perfectly characterize living systems. However, many cases of misinterpretation put this assumption into perspective. In this article, we focus on critical parameters such as time, water, entropy, space, quantum properties, and electrostatic potential to redefine the nature of living matter, with special emphasis on biological coding. Where does the DNA double helix come from, why cannot the reproduction of living organisms occur without mutations, what are the limitations of the genetic code, and why do not all proteins have a stable three-dimensional structure? There are so many questions that cannot be resolved without considering the aforementioned parameters. Indeed, (i) time and space constrain many biological mechanisms and impose drastic solutions on living beings (enzymes, transporters); (ii) water controls the fidelity of DNA replication and the structure/disorder balance of proteins; (iii) entropy is the driving force of many enzymatic reactions and molecular interactions; (iv) quantum mechanisms explain why a molecule as simple as hydrocyanic acid (HCN) foreshadows the helical structure of DNA, how DNA is stabilized, why mutations occur, and how the Earth magnetic field can influence the migration of birds; (v) electrostatic potential controls epigenetic mechanisms, lipid raft functions, and virus infections. We consider that raising awareness of these basic parameters is critical for better understanding what life is, and how it handles order and chaos through a combination of genetic and epigenetic mechanisms. Thus, we propose to incorporate these parameters into the definition of life.

TI Quantum Mechanical Aspects in the Pathophysiology of Neuropathic Pain
SO BRAIN SCIENCES
AB Neuropathic pain is a challenging complaint for patients and clinicians since there are no effective agents available to get satisfactory outcomes even though the pharmacological agents target reasonable pathophysiological mechanisms. This may indicate that other aspects in these mechanisms should be unveiled to comprehend the pathogenesis of neuropathic pain and thus find more effective treatments. Therefore, in the present study, several mechanisms are chosen to be reconsidered in the pathophysiology of neuropathic pain from a quantum mechanical perspective. The mathematical model of the ions quantum tunneling model is used to provide quantum aspects in the pathophysiology of neuropathic pain. Three major pathophysiological mechanisms are revisited in the context of the quantum tunneling model. These include: (1) the depolarized membrane potential of neurons; (2) the cross-talk or the ephaptic coupling between the neurons; and (3) the spontaneous neuronal activity and the emergence of ectopic action potentials. We will show mathematically that the quantum tunneling model can predict the occurrence of neuronal membrane depolarization attributed to the quantum tunneling current of sodium ions. Moreover, the probability of inducing an ectopic action potential in the axons of neurons will be calculated and will be shown to be significant and influential. These ectopic action potentials are generated due to the formation of quantum synapses which are assumed to be the mechanism behind the ephaptic transmission. Furthermore, the spontaneous neuronal activity and the emergence of ectopic action potentials independently from any adjacent stimulated neurons are predicted to occur according to the quantum tunneling model. All these quantum mechanical aspects contribute to the overall hyperexcitability of the neurons and to the pathogenesis of neuropathic pain. Additionally, providing a new perspective in the pathophysiology of neuropathic pain may improve our understanding of how the neuropathic pain is generated and maintained and may offer new effective agents that can improve the overall clinical outcomes of the patients.

TI Transport of electron hopping regulated by geometric configuration of
   quantum-dot arrays
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB Dopant-induced quantum dot arrays in silicon-based nanostructures have received much attention due to their great potential applications in fields such as quantum computing and quantum simulation. When quantum dots are arranged in different geometric configurations such as linear, annular, or grid shapes, the differences in their inherent topological properties will lead to significantly different spatial distributions of the Coulomb interaction potential. The potential field distribution directly affects the phase coherence of electron wavefunctions, thereby regulating the dynamic behaviors of electrons such as electron tunneling and hopping between quantum dots, and greatly influencing the electron transport properties in the system. Our study aims to establish a basic theoretical framework to clarify the regulation mechanism of quantum dot geometric configurations on electron hopping transport. Therefore, we construct a generalized Fermi-Hubbard model for silicon-based dopant-induced quantum dot arrays. The model defines the distance between quantum dots through an effective Euclidean distance matrix ( D ), which uniquely determines the geometric shape of the array, and defines the allowed electron hopping modes through an adjacency matrix ( A ). Using the framework and exact diagonalization method, we perform detailed numerical simulations on the electron transport properties in the traditional unit cell of two-dimensional ordered distribution dopant-induced quantum dot arrays. Generally, the primitive unit of a two-dimensional orderly distributed dopant-induced quantum dot array is a regular polygon that satisfies specific translational and rotational symmetries. We thereby refer to the quantum dot arrays distributed according to regular polygons as annular arrays. The geometric features of annular quantum dot arrays and the electron hopping modes including nearest-neighbor hopping (NNH), next-nearest-neighbor hopping (NNNH) and long-range hopping (LRH), exhibit significant regulation of the electron addition energy and quantum conductance. The regulation arises from interactions of key energy parameters, including coupling strength (t), on-site Coulomb repulsion (U) and inter-site Coulomb repulsion (W). In the electron addition energy spectrum, such a regulation is manifested in two aspects: energy band broadening and Coulomb gap size. Band broadening is co-regulated by t and W. Under weak coupling conditions, the broadening Delta(t) induced by coupling strength is proportional to t, with its proportional coefficient increasing with the number of hopping paths (LRH > NNNH > NNH). The broadening Delta(W) caused by inter-site Coulomb repulsion is proportional to W, with the proportional coefficient being beta, which is a geometry-dependent correlation broadening coefficient. In multi-site annular arrays, beta exhibits a logarithmic relationship with the site number N. The size of Coulomb gap is co-influenced by U, t and W. The competition between U and W determines the electron configuration mode (dominated by single-electron occupation of sites or double-electrons occupation of spaced sites), with a critical value alpha for electron configuration reconstruction that causes a change in electron configuration across the threshold. When U/W > alpha, single-electron occupation dominates, and the gap is determined by the competition between U and t; when U/W < alpha, double-electrons occupation dominates, the gap expands under the influence of W, accompanied by the formation of sub-bands.
   In the quantum conductance spectrum, regulation is reflected by the distribution of conductance peak intensity. Geometric configurations significantly affect peak intensity distribution. Linear arrays exhibit concentrated peak intensities due to edge states formed by open boundaries, while annular arrays with periodic boundaries and no edge states show more uniform peak distributions. Additionally, in annular arrays, the electron transport direction is non-collinear with the inter-site repulsion direction, endowing them with stronger robustness against transport inhibition induced by W. The influence of hopping modes is twofold. More hopping paths (LRH > NNNH > NNH) result in more non-zero hopping matrix elements, which causes higher average conductance. Meanwhile, hopping paths affect the phase coherence of wavefunctions, modulating the intensity of individual conductance peaks and forming distinct distribution. In conclusion, we establish a theoretical framework to clarify the physical mechanism, in which the geometric configurations and electron hopping modes of silicon-based dopant-induced quantum dot arrays regulate electron transport properties through synergistic interactions with key energy parameters (t, U, W). Electron addition energy spectra and quantum conductance spectra reveal the regulatory rules of these factors on electron transport behaviors, providing a theoretical guidance for optimally designing silicon-based quantum devices.

TI Gaps, guesswork, and ghosts lurking in technology integration: Laws and
   policies applicable to student privacy
SO BRITISH JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY
AB Technology integration and learning analytics offer insights to improve educational experiences and outcomes. In advancing these efforts, laws and policies govern these environments placing protections, standards, and developmental opportunities for higher education, students, faculty, and even the nation-state. Nonetheless, evidence of educational restrictions, encumbered actions, and archaic approaches pervades the legal literature and case law demonstrating that these laws and policies do not always function well in evolving and emerging technology spaces. To examine these laws and policies of student privacy, the author employs the combination of a critical policy analysis, which derives from critical social research as a means to explore discourse and policy through drawing out the policy contexts, texts, and consequences, and Flood's liberating systems theory, which directs the analysis to a problem-solving approach by examining the policy discourse from a systems-thinking lens. Based on a review of 184 court cases, 74 policies from a diversified representation of US states/territories, and seven developed nations or multi-nation consortia, this examination illuminates how context and text such as the type and setting of the privacy matter (eg, various freedom of information acts, educational records under the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act, and General Data Protection Regulation in the European Union) presents opportunities for protections and standardization efforts; however, they also illustrate significant protection gaps, guesswork and insufficiency around the type and degree of data subject consent, and ghosting effects of data subjects' protections. While the extant literature already supports aspects of these findings, it does not account for this holistic view of these three privacy vulnerabilities-especially in light of the principles to which these laws purport to achieve. Moreover, the three identified privacy vulnerabilities suggest overlooked inclusion of two overarching privacy concepts-transparency and equity. This study recommends that key actors in the policy construction realm (ie, university leaders, policymakers, and judges) should engage in analyses, dialogue, and consideration about transparency and equity by considering contemporary privacy problems in the contexts of artificial intelligence, quantum computing, and cybersecurity as a way to improve transparent and equitable policies in these areas rather than exacerbating the privacy dilemmas already in place.Practitioner notesWhat is already known about this topicIn the United States, the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 (FERPA) and the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) are well documented evidence of privacy protections for education and health records, but they fail to offer sufficient protections for students as data subjects with emerging technologies.Existing federal-level laws in the United States do not offer a systematic or uniform approach in the manner that data users obtain consent, so data subjects are largely unaware of what is being consented.Other than matters of consent, policy strategies based on student privacy laws (ie, voluntary consensus standards, basic practices to maintain privacy, an ethics review board, data/record retention and destruction, and data sanitation of equipment) are significant and informative largely from the university-perspective, not the students as data subjects.
   What this paper addsA new comprehensive examination of US laws including statutes, regulations, and cases as well as seven key nation-state or national consortia laws-especially the EU's General Data Protection Regulation and selected state laws in the United States, which offer consistent and greater student privacy protections.Insights about the principles designed among the laws, which centre around their application, essentiality, consent, and security.Attention to areas in which student privacy laws still present privacy concerns, but specifically identifying issues of significant gaps, guesswork and insufficiency around levels and types of consent, and ghosting effects of data subjects' protections.Implications for practice and/or policyData subject consent should be established and consistent- whether an opt-out provision, opt-in provision, or some extensive engagement.Student privacy policies should incorporate principles of transparency and equity for data subjects and data treatment.Policymakers should consider now how the intersections of data subject privacy matters shall be addressed in the context of artificial intelligence, quantum computing, and cybersecurity.

TI State polynomials: positivity, optimization and nonlinear Bell
   inequalities
SO MATHEMATICAL PROGRAMMING
AB This paper introduces state polynomials, i.e., polynomials in noncommuting variables and formal states of their products. A state analog of Artin's solution to Hilbert's 17th problem is proved showing that state polynomials, positive over all matrices and matricial states, are sums of squares with denominators. Somewhat surprisingly, it is also established that a Krivine-Stengle Positivstellensatz fails to hold in the state polynomial setting. Further, archimedean Positivstellensatze in the spirit of Putinar and Helton-McCullough are presented leading to a hierarchy of semidefinite relaxations converging monotonically to the optimum of a state polynomial subject to state constraints. This hierarchy can be seen as a state analog of the Lasserre hierarchy for optimization of polynomials, and the Navascues-Pironio-Acin scheme for optimization of noncommutative polynomials. The motivation behind this theory arises from the study of correlations in quantum networks. Determining the maximal quantum violation of a polynomial Bell inequality for an arbitrary network is reformulated as a state polynomial optimization problem. Several examples of quadratic Bell inequalities in the bipartite and the bilocal tripartite scenario are analyzed. To reduce the size of the constructed SDPs, sparsity, sign symmetry and conditional expectation of the observables' group structure are exploited. To obtain the above-mentioned results, techniques from noncommutative algebra, real algebraic geometry, operator theory, and convex optimization are employed.

TI Generation of arbitrary complex fields with high efficiency and high
   fidelity by cascaded phase-only modulation method
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Independent or joint control over the amplitude and phase of the complex field by phase-only modulation element is crucial in numerous applications. Existing modulation methods can realize high levels of accuracy but are accompanied by noticeable losses in light-usage efficiency. Here a cascaded modulation method is proposed for the generation of arbitrary complex fields with high efficiency and high fidelity. This approach is based on a gradient descent optimization algorithm that minimizes a customized cost function. The major advantage of our approach over existing modulation methods is that the efficiency is significantly enhanced while ensuring high modulation accuracy. For the generation of Laguer re-Gaussian mode (LG01), with similar high accuracy, the efficiency by our approach can reach 79.5%, which is enhanced by 192% compared with the theoretical maximum efficiency of 41.5% [Opt. Express 25, 11692 (2017)]. Furthermore, the efficiency of existing modulation methods deteriorates rapidly as the target field turns more intricate, whereas in our approach it maintains at a relatively high level. The field generation fidelity and energy efficiency of the proposed cascaded modulation method are compared with that of several different single-pass modulation methods in generating a series of typical Her mite-Gaussian and Laguer re-Gaussian modes and an amplitude-only "OSA" pattern. Our proposed method features both high efficiency and high accuracy in the simulation and experiment, which may be of growing interest to applications such as optical manipulation or quantum communication.

TI Regulation Mechanisms and Recent Progress of Optical Spin Angular
   Momentum ( Invited)
SO ACTA OPTICA SINICA
AB Significance To help humans explore and understand the world, researchers have been committed to exploring diverse techniques of optical field manipulation to accomplish a variety of applications since the inception of the field of optics, including imaging, detection, sensing, communications, and so on.
   With the rapid development of modern micro-nanofabrication techniques, there is increasing interest in manipulating multiple degrees of freedom of light flexibly. However, at the nanoscale, there are close couplings and interactions among classical degrees of freedom such as intensity, phase, and polarization, making it difficult to achieve flexible and independent control of these degrees of freedom. Whereas, momentum and angular momentum degrees of freedom of light, which are a fundamental dynamic physical quantity of elementary particles and class wave fields and play important roles in the light-matter interactions, offer extreme advantages in manipulating the light in the nanoscale. For example, through the spin- momentum equation, spin and orbit angular momentum can be individually controlled, allowing for more precise manipulation and utilization of the spin properties of photons individually. The numerous advantages of controlling the spin angular momentum of photons bring new opportunities for nanophotonics, particularly in the areas of optical manipulation, detection, information processing, chiral quantum optics, and quantum entanglement.
   Plenty of novel and interesting optical phenomena and applications have been proposed connecting to the interactions between optical spins and matters or nanostructures, and a new research field of spin optics has been born in recent years. Previously, most of the researchers mainly focused on the optical longitudinal spin parallel to the direction of the mean wave vector. In recent years, by studying the spin- orbit couplings of confined fields, such as focused fields, guided waves, and evanescent waves, researchers have discovered a new class of optical spins that are perpendicular to the direction of the mean wave vector, which are also known as optical transverse spins. Optical transverse spin possesses the properties of spin- momentum locking, so it has been widely studied by researchers since discovered. Moreover, the discovery of optical transverse spin expands the content of optical spin-orbit interactions, and it has potential in the applications of optical manipulation, ultrahigh-precision optical detection, chiral quantum optics, and optical spin topological states. Here, we introduce the recent progress of spin optics in detail from three aspects: theory, characterizations, and applications. These theoretical concepts and frameworks of spin optics can play a critical role in further developing applications based on optical spins in optical imaging, detection, communications, and quantum technology, and they can be flexibly expanded to other classical wave fields, such as fluid waves, sound waves, and gravitational waves.
   Progress In this paper, we provide a comprehensive overview and summary of the manipulating mechanisms of spin angular momentum and discuss the underlying relationship between the Abraham-Poynting momentum density, Minkowski canonical momentum density, Belinfante s spin momentum density, spin angular momentum density, and orbital angular momentum density in classical optical theory. Subsequently, starting from the longitudinal spin in the paraxial beams, we introduce the spin angular momentum in different optical fields, including transverse spin in evanescent fields and transverse spin in interference fields. Finally, to address the difficulty in simply defining transverse and longitudinal spins in structured light fields, we present a set of spin momentum equations, analogous to Maxwell s equations, to describe the dynamical properties of spin angular momentum density and momentum density. Furthermore, these spin-momentum equations extend the properties of optical spin- momentum locking from evanescent plane waves to general evanescent fields. We also comprehensively overview the measurement techniques for spin angular momentum in confined fields and free space, including scanning near-field optical microscopy, nano-particle-film structures, photoemission electron microscopy, and nonlinear optical effects. By utilizing these techniques, it is possible to effectively extract different electromagnetic field components to obtain the information of spin angular momentum carried by the optical field. The current application scenarios of spin angular momentum are also comprehensively summarized, including weak effect measurements, optical differentials, optical lateral forces, precision sensing, and magnetic domain detection.
   Conclusions and Prospects As a novel degree of freedom in the field of optics in addition to intensity, phase, and polarization, the spin angular momentum carried by the structured light can be applied in communication, imaging, precision detection, and other fields. In this paper, we introduce the concept, definition, classification, and physical origin of spin angular momentum and review the characterization methods of spin angular momentum developed in recent years, as well as its applications in weak effect detection, optical differentials, optical lateral forces, precision sensing, and magnetic domain detection. On the one hand, spin angular momentum is a fundamental dynamical physical quantity of basic particles such as photons and atoms, providing new perspectives for the interaction of small-scale light with matter. On the other hand, as a novel optical degree of freedom, spin angular momentum can provide new solutions for large- scale light field control, optical imaging, optical communication, and optical detection applications. In turn, it further serves to explore new mechanisms and phenomena in the interaction between light and matter, expanding the applications of spin photonics.

TI Enhanced detection techniques of orbital angular momentum states in the
   classical and quantum regimes
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB The orbital angular momentum (OAM) of light has been at the center of several classical and quantum applications for imaging, information processing and communication. However, the complex structure inherent in OAM states makes their detection and classification nontrivial in many circumstances. Most of the current detection schemes are based on models of the OAM states built upon the use of Laguerre-Gauss (LG) modes. However, this may not in general be sufficient to capture full information on the generated states. In this paper, we go beyond the LG assumption, and employ hypergeometric-Gaussian (HyGG) modes as the basis states of a refined model that can be used-in certain scenarios-to better tailor OAM detection techniques. We show that enhanced performances in OAM detection are obtained for holographic projection via spatial light modulators in combination with single-mode fibers (SMFs), and for classification techniques based on a machine learning approach. Furthermore, a three-fold enhancement in the SMF coupling efficiency is obtained for the holographic technique, when using the HyGG model with respect to the LG one. This improvement provides a significant boost in the overall efficiency of OAM-encoded single-photon detection systems. Given that most of the experimental works using OAM states are effectively based on the generation of HyGG modes, our findings thus represent a relevant addition to experimental toolboxes for OAM-based protocols in quantum communication, cryptography and simulation.

TI Compact and Fully Functional High-Frequency Sine Wave Gating InGaAs/InP
   Single-Photon Detector Module
SO IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN QUANTUM ELECTRONICS
AB High-frequency sine wave gating (SWG) InGaAs/InP single-photon detectors (SPDs) are widely used for synchronous near-infrared single-photon detection. For practical use, the size of SPD is one of the most concerning features for system integration. Here we present, to the best of our knowledge, the most compact and fully functional high-frequency SWG InGaAs/InP SPD. We develop a sine wave gating integrated circuit (SWGIC) using system-in-package technology that supports functions including large amplitude sine wave gate generation, coincidence gate generation, phase regulation, amplitude monitoring, and amplitude modulation. Moreover, we design and fabricate a high-performance multi-mode fiber coupled InGaAs/InP single-photon avalanche diode (SPAD) with a compact butterfly package. Furthermore, we implement a monolithically integrated readout circuit (MIRC) to extract the weak avalanche signal from large capacitance response of SWG. Finally, the SWGIC, SPAD, MIRC, and the affiliated circuits are integrated into a single module with a size of 6 cm x 5.7 cm x 1.7 cm. After characterization, the SPD module exhibits a photon detection efficiency of 40%, a dark count rate of 9 kcps, and an afterpulse probability of 4.6% at an operation temperature of 238 K and a hold-off time of 160 ns. Our work provides a practical solution for applications necessitating highly integrated near-infrared single-photon detection.

TI Unbounded quantum advantage in communication with minimal input scaling
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB In communication complexity-like problems, previous studies have shown either an exponential quantum advantage or an unbounded quantum advantage with an exponentially large input set e(2n) bit with respect to classical communication e(n) bit. In the former, the quantum and classical separation grows exponentially in input while the latter's quantum communication resource is a constant. Remarkably, it was still open whether an unbounded quantum advantage exists while the inputs do not scale exponentially. Here we answer this question affirmatively using an input size of optimal order. Considering two variants as tasks: (1) distributed computation of relation and (2) relation reconstruction, we study the one-way zero-error communication complexity of a relation induced by a distributed clique labeling problem for orthogonality graphs. While we prove no quantum advantage in the first task, we show an unbounded quantum advantage in relation reconstruction without public coins. Specifically, for a class of graphs with order m, the quantum complexity is O(1) while the classical complexity is O(log2 m). Remarkably, the input size is O(log2 m) bit and the order of its scaling with respect to classical communication is minimal. This is exponentially better compared to previous works. Additionally, we prove a lower bound (linear in the number of maximum cliques) on the amount of classical public coin necessary to overcome the separation in the scenario of restricted communication and connect this to the existence of orthogonal arrays. Finally, we highlight some applications of this task to semi-device-independent dimension witnessing as well as to the detection of mutually unbiased bases.

TI Integration of Self-Quenched Active-Recovery SPADs in Standard CMOS
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Single-photon avalanche diodes (SPADs) are used in applications such as quantum communication, LiDAR, low-light imaging, and biosensing. However, conventional CMOS SPADs face a fundamental trade-off: passive quenching results in long RC recovery times, while active quenching leads to a reduced fill factor and increased complexity. We presented a self-quenched SPAD with an active self-recovery mechanism that can substantially accelerate the self-recovery process following self-quenching, making it a self-quenched, actively recovered (SQUARE) SPAD. Fabricated in a standard CMOS process, the SQUARE detector integrates a carbon-incorporated amorphous silicon (a-Si) layer above a crystalline silicon p/n junction, attaining Geiger-mode gains exceeding 10(5) with self-recovery below 30 ns. In comparison, the self-quenched, passively recovered SPAD of a similar structure but using a defected a-Si shows the same Geiger-mode gain but a self-recovery time of > 1 mu s. The result demonstrates 50 times faster active recovery due to the gain of a-Si layer during the recovery cycle. To facilitate adoption of the device in applications using commercial CMOS process, we developed a theoretical framework and a Verilog-A circuit model that accurately capture avalanche dynamics and practical foundry constraints. Single-photon imaging demonstrations under low-light conditions confirm the advantage of enhanced speed and sensitivity of the SQUARE detector, positioning it as a scalable, cost-effective solution for single-photon imaging and sensing applications.

TI Is high-dimensional photonic entanglement robust to noise?
SO AVS QUANTUM SCIENCE
AB High-dimensional entangled states are of significant interest in quantum science as they increase the information content per photon and can remain entangled in the presence of significant noise. The authors develop the analytical theory and show experimentally that the noise tolerance of high-dimensional entanglement can be significantly increased by a modest increase in the size of the Hilbert space. For example, doubling the size of a Hilbert space with a local dimension of d = 300 leads to a reduction in the threshold detector efficiencies required for entanglement certification by two orders of magnitude. This work is developed in the context of spatial entanglement in the few-photon limit, but it can easily be translated to photonic states entangled in different degrees of freedom. The authors also demonstrate that knowledge of a single parameter, the signal-to-noise ratio, precisely links measures of entanglement to a range of experimental parameters quantifying noise in a quantum communication system, enabling accurate predictions of its performance. This work serves to answer a simple question: "Is high-dimensional photonic entanglement robust to noise?" Here, the authors show that the answer is more nuanced than a simple "yes" or "no" and involves a complex interplay between the noise characteristics of the state, channel, and detection system.(c) 2021 Author(s).

TI High-performance waveguide coupled Germanium-on-silicon single-photon
   avalanche diode with independently controllable absorption and
   multiplication
SO NANOPHOTONICS
AB Germanium-on-silicon (Ge-on-Si) single photon avalanche diodes (SPADs) have received wide attention in recent years due to their potential to be integrated with Si photonics. In this work, we propose and demonstrate a high-performance waveguide coupled Ge-on-Si separate-absorption-charge-multiplication SPAD with three electric terminals. By providing two separate voltage drops on the light absorption and multiplication regions, the drift and multiplication of carriers can be optimized separately. This indeed improves the freedom of voltage regulation for both areas. Moreover, thanks to the separate controlling, doping profile of the charge layer is greatly released compared to that of the conventional device because of the flexible carrier injection. In this scenario, the dark counts of the detector can be largely reduced through decreasing the electric field on the sidewalls of the Ge absorption region without affecting the detection efficiency. The proposed SPAD exhibits a high on-chip single photon detection efficiency of 34.62% and low dark count rates of 279 kHz at 1310 nm with the temperature of 78 K. The noise equivalent power is as low as 3.27 x 10(-16) WHz(-1/2), which is, to the best of our knowledge, the lowest of that of the reported waveguide coupled Ge-on-Si SPADs. This three-terminal SPAD enables high-yield fabrication and provides robust performance in operation, showing a wide application prospect in applications such as on-chip quantum communication and lidar.

TI Hybrid computing framework security in dynamic offloading for
   IoT-enabled smart home system
SO PEERJ COMPUTER SCIENCE
AB In the distributed computing era, cloud computing has completely changed organizational operations by facilitating simple access to resources. However, the rapid development of the IoT has led to collaborative computing, which raises scalability and security challenges. To fully realize the potential of the Internet of Things (IoT) in smart home technologies, there is still a need for strong data security solutions, which are essential in dynamic offloading in conjunction with edge, fog, and cloud computing. This research on smart home challenges covers in-depth examinations of data security, privacy, processing speed, storage capacity restrictions, and analytics inside networked IoT devices. We introduce the Trusted IoT Big Data Analytics (TIBDA) framework as a comprehensive solution to reshape smart living. Our primary focus is mitigating pervasive data security and privacy issues. TIBDA incorporates robust trust mechanisms, prioritizing data privacy and reliability for secure processing and user information confidentiality within the smart home environment. We achieve this by employing a hybrid cryptosystem that combines Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC), Post Quantum Cryptography (PQC), and Blockchain technology (BCT) to protect user privacy and confidentiality. Additionally, we comprehensively compared four prominent Artificial Intelligence anomaly detection algorithms (Isolation Forest, Local Outlier Factor, One-Class SVM, and Elliptic Envelope). We utilized machine learning classification algorithms (random forest, k-nearest neighbors, support vector machines, linear discriminant analysis, and quadratic discriminant analysis) for detecting malicious and non-malicious activities in smart home systems. Furthermore, the main part of the research is with the help of an artificial neural network (ANN) dynamic algorithm; the TIBDA framework designs a hybrid computing system that integrates edge, fog, and cloud architecture and efficiently supports numerous users while processing data from IoT devices in real-time. The analysis shows that TIBDA outperforms these systems significantly across various metrics. In terms of response time, TIBDA demonstrated a reduction of 10-20% compared to the other systems under varying user loads, device counts, and transaction volumes. Regarding security, TIBDA's AUC values were consistently higher by 5-15%, indicating superior protection against threats. Additionally, TIBDA exhibited the highest trustworthiness with an uptime percentage 10-12% greater than its competitors. TIBDA's Isolation Forest algorithm achieved an accuracy of 99.30%, and the random forest algorithm achieved an accuracy of 94.70%, outperforming other methods by 8-11%. Furthermore, our ANN- based offloading decision-making model achieved a validation accuracy of 99% and reduced loss to 0.11, demonstrating significant improvements in resource utilization and system performance.

TI Influence of the Etching Material Deposition Rate and Annealing Time on
   Nanohole Morphology Etched into InP/In0.52Al0.48As
   Layers via Local Droplet Epitaxy
SO CRYSTALS
AB Local droplet etching and subsequent refilling enables the fabrication of highly symmetric quantum dots with low fine structure splitting, suitable for generating polarization entangled photons. While well established in GaAs/AlxGa1-xAs, this approach does not yield emission in the telecom bands required for low loss fiber-based quantum communication. To achieve emission at 1.55 mu m, local droplet etching must be adapted to alternative material platforms such as InP. Here, we systematically investigate how the etching material deposition rate and etching time influence nanohole morphology in In0.52Al0.48As layers lattice-matched to InP. In the first experiment, InAl was deposited at fluxes of 0.2-4.0 & Aring; s-1 at Tetch = 350 degrees C and 460 degrees C. Lower fluxes produced nanoholes with lower density and larger ring diameters, indicating fewer and larger initial droplets, consistent with scaling theory. The average nanohole diameter decreased monotonically with increasing flux, whereas the average depth showed no clear dependence on flux. In the second experiment, etching times of 30-600 s were tested for InAl, In, and Al droplets. Average nanohole diameters remained constant for Al across all etching times, but decreased for In and InAl with increasing etching time, suggesting sidewall redeposition during etching. For all droplet types, depths peaked at intermediate times and decreased for prolonged etching, consistent with material diffusion into the nanohole after droplet consumption.

TI A novel framework for secure cryptocurrency transactions using quantum
   crypto guard
SO PEERJ COMPUTER SCIENCE
AB In today's digital world, cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin can secure transactions without banks. However, the rise of quantum computing poses significant threats to their security, as traditional cryptographic methods may be easily compromised. In addition, the existing algorithms face difficulties like slow transaction speeds, interoperability issues between different cryptocurrencies, and privacy concerns. Hence, Quantum Crypto Guard for Secure Transactions (QCG-ST), a novel blockchain framework, is introduced, offering enhanced security and efficiency for cryptocurrency transactions. The QCG-ST employs lattice-based cryptography to provide robust protection against quantum threats and incorporates a new consensus mechanism to increase the transaction speed and reduce energy consumption. The QCG-ST system uses lattice-based encryption that is based on the Ring Learning With Errors (Ring-LWE) issue to protect itself from quantum assaults. It uses sharding, a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus method, and a threshold signature scheme (TSS) to make the system more scalable and use less energy. Zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) are used to check transactions without giving out private information. We offer a cross-chain atomic swap protocol that uses hashed time-lock contracts to make sure that it works on all platforms. Blockchain transaction data utilized in testing originated from the Bitcoin Historical Dataset available on Kaggle, and quantum resistance has been assessed using the Qiskit Aer simulator. It evaluated the framework's performance to that of traditional methods like Payment Channel-Lightning Network (PC-LN), Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE), and Cross-Chain Transaction with Hyperledger (CCT-H). Results show that QCG-ST does far better than traditional systems in terms of transaction success rate (up to 98.5%), speed, energy efficiency, latency, and throughput, especially when tested in a quantum-simulated environment. This study completes in an essential vacuum in blockchain technology by suggesting a strong, quantum-resistant, privacy-protecting architecture that can handle the problems that could arise up in decentralized digital banking in the future.

TI Dual Dirac Nodal Line in Nearly Freestanding Electronic Structure of
   β-Sn Monolayer
SO ACS NANO
AB Two-dimensional topological insulators (2D TIs) have distinct electronic properties that make them attractive for various applications, especially in spintronics. The conductive edge states in 2D TIs are protected from disorder and perturbations and are spin-polarized, which restrict current flow to a single spin orientation. In contrast, topological nodal line semimetals (TNLSM) are distinct from TIs because of the presence of a 1D ring of degeneracy formed from two bands that cross each other along a line in the Brillouin zone. These nodal lines are protected by topology and can be destroyed only by breaking certain symmetry conditions, making them highly resilient to disorder and defects. However, 2D TNLSMs do not possess protected boundary modes, which makes their investigation challenging. There have been several theoretical predictions of 2D TNLSMs, however, experimental realizations are rare. beta-Sn, a metallic allotrope of tin with a superconducting temperature of 3.72 K, may be a candidate for a topological superconductor that can host Majorana Fermions for quantum computing. In this work, single layers of alpha-Sn and beta-Sn on a Cu(111) substrate are successfully prepared and studied using scanning tunneling microscopy, angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, and density functional theory calculations. The lattice and electronic structure undergo a topological transition from 2D topological insulator alpha-Sn to 2D TNLSM beta-Sn, with two types of nodal lines coexisting in monolayer beta-Sn. Such a realization of two types of nodal lines in one 2D material has not been reported to date. Moreover, we also observed an unexpected phenomenon of freestanding-like electronic structures of beta-Sn/Cu(111), highlighting the potential of ultrathin beta-Sn films as a platform for exploring the electronic properties of 2D TNLSM and topological superconductors, such as few-layer superconducting beta-Sn in lateral contact with topological nodal line single-layer beta-Sn.

TI Efficient DNA-Based Logistic Mapping Algorithm for Color Image
   Encryption
SO EAI ENDORSED TRANSACTIONS ON SCALABLE INFORMATION SYSTEMS
AB INTRODUCTION: Color images hold significant information and are widely used in diverse domains. The protection of these images against unauthorized access over the internet is a necessity that relies on encryption techniques. However, traditional encryption methods face challenges with the increasing capability and efficiency of quantum computing to solve complex problems. DNA cryptography is a promising field in information security, utilizing DNA molecules with massive parallelism and vast storage capacity to encode and decode information. While chaotic systems have been widely used in encryption due to their sensitivity to initial conditions and parameter values, resulting in unpredictability and significant variation. Exploiting the characteristics of DNA cryptography and chaotic systems is a promising alternative for securing data. Nevertheless, current methodologies exhibit limitations such as a small key space and weak resistance to differential attacks. OBJECTIVES: This paper addresses these gaps by proposing an RGB image encryption algorithm based on DNA cryptography and a 1D logistic map. METHODS: The proposed method randomly generates a DNA encoding/decoding table to generate the row- column permutation of the image. After the permutation of the image, the logistic map is used to generate three keys for RGB channels and seven DNA encoding-decoding rules, three are used to encode the keys into DNA sequence, the second three to encode the image RGB channel, and the last to perform the DNA-XOR operation. Finally, decode the result into integers using the DNA encoding/decoding table and generate the encrypted image. RESULTS: The analysis of the proposed technique demonstrates significant robustness against various attacks, as evidenced by metrics such as a key space exceeding 2100, an average NPCR of 99.613667%, an average UACI of 50.273742%, an entropy value approaching 8, and a strong key sensitivity. CONCLUSION: These results validate its capacity to effectively resist differential, brute-force, and statistical attacks.

TI Metaverse and its impact on medical education and health care system: A
   narrative review
SO HEALTH SCIENCE REPORTS
AB Background and Aims: The metaverse has enormous potential in health care, continuously developing and offering innovative solutions by combining artificial intelligence (AI), augmented reality (AR)/virtual reality (VR), Internet of Medical Devices, and quantum computing technologies. In addition to using virtual platforms to help and boost medical education, familiarity with this platform is necessary to strengthen medical skills and communication with patients in medical sciences in the future. Methods: We conducted a comprehensive search using keywords and their MeSH synonyms, including "metaverse," "medical education," and "health care," across PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science. After screening the results, relevant articles were selected to inform the writing of this manuscript. Results: The metaverse is shaping the future of medical sciences, offering new opportunities for health education, advocacy training, and patient outcome improvement. The combination of real and virtual worlds may advance international relations, facilitate data sharing, increase medical care speed, and reduce infectious diseases. The metaverse, despite its benefits, has some limitations. Only 37% of 15-24-year-olds have internet access, and AR/VR glasses are expensive and may cause eye discomfort. It is also a potential risk for medical students, who may need help understanding the limitations of simulations and develop unrealistic expectations. Considering the metaverse as a supplement to clinical practice, not a replacement for supervised training, is crucial. Ethical concerns, data security, privacy, and lack of instructions for education are also issues. However, providing information about the metaverse can increase health care workers' attribution to use it for patient examinations, students' education, and tests. Conclusion: This paper explores the impact of the metaverse on medical science education and underscores the need to integrate the metaverse into all areas of medical sciences as a supplement to existing evidence.

TI Quantum-inspired seagull optimised deep belief network approach for
   cardiovascular disease prediction
SO PEERJ COMPUTER SCIENCE
AB The early detection and accurate diagnosis of cardiovascular diseases is vital to reduce global morbidity and death rates. In this work, the quantum-inspired seagull optimization algorithm (QISOA) combined with a deep belief network (DBN) is proposed to improve the identification of cardiovascular disorders. As part of preprocessing, cleaning, transformation, and standardization are performed to eliminate noise, inconsistencies, and scaling issues in the data. QISOA is used to optimize the weights and biases of the DBN model, enhancing its prediction efficiency. The algorithm incorporates quantum mechanics concepts to develop its exploration potential further, leading to faster convergence and increased global search efficiency. Optimized DBN provides efficient acquisition of hierarchical representations of the data, which results in improved feature learning and classification accuracy. The publicly accessible Cleveland Heart Disease dataset is used to assess the performance of the suggested model. Extensive experiments are conducted to demonstrate the superior performance of the QISOA-optimized DBN model compared to traditional machine learning and other metaheuristic-based models. Initially, machine learning models such as support vector machines, decision trees, Random Forests, multi-layer perceptrons, and fully connected networks were considered for comparison with the cardiovascular predictive performance of the DBN model. Further, meta-heuristic optimization algorithms such as particle swarm optimization, genetic algorithm, grey wolf optimization, cuckoo search optimization and crow search algorithm are combined with the machine learning models and the classification efficiency is evaluated. Additionally, few state-of-the-art techniques proposed in the existing literature are investigated and compared against the proposed model. It was evident from the comprehensive performance assessment of the proposed model that it yields a higher accuracy of 98.6% with precision, recall, and F1-scores of 97.6%, 96.8%, and 97.1%, respectively, compared to other traditional and existing models for cardiovascular disease prediction.

TI Joule Heating-Driven Transformation of Hard-Carbons to Onion-like Carbon
   Monoliths for Efficient Capture of Volatile Organic Compounds
SO ACS MATERIALS AU
AB Soft graphitizable carbon-based multifunctional nanomaterials have found versatile applications ranging from energy storage to quantum computing. In contrast, their hard-carbon analogues have been poorly investigated from both fundamental and application-oriented perspectives. The predominant challenges have been (a) the lack of approaches to fabricate porous hard-carbons and (b) their thermally nongraphitizable nature, leading to inaccessibility for several potential applications. In this direction, we present design principles for fabrication of porous hard-carbon-based nanostructured carbon florets (NCFs) with a highly accessible surface area (similar to 936 m(2)/ g), rivalling their soft-carbon counterparts. Subjecting such thermally stable hard-carbons to a synergistic combination of an electric field and Joule heating drives their transformation to free-standing macroscopic monoliths composed of onion-like carbons (OLCMs). This represents the first such structural transformation observed in sp(2)-based hard-carbon NCFs to sp(2)-networked OLCMs. Micro-Raman spectroscopy establishes the simultaneous increase in the intensity of D-, 2D-, and D + G-bands at 1341, 2712, and 2936 cm(-1) and is correlated to the reorganization in the disordered graphitic domains of NCFs to curved concentric nested spheres in OLCMs. This therefore completely precludes the formation of a nanodiamond core that has been consistently observed in all previously reported OLCs. The Joule heating-driven formation of OLCMs is accompanied by similar to 5700% enhancement in electrical conductivity that is brought about by the fusion of outermost graphitic shells of OLCs to result in monolithic OLC structures (OLCMs). The porous and inter-networked OLCMs exhibit an excellent adsorption-based capture of volatile organic compounds such as toluene at high efficiencies (similar to 99%) over a concentration range (0.22-1.86 ppm) that is relevant for direct applications such as smoke filters in cigarettes.

TI AI-Driven Cryptographic Framework for Secure Wireless Communication: A
   Self-Evolving Approach Against Adversarial Threats
SO KSII TRANSACTIONS ON INTERNET AND INFORMATION SYSTEMS
AB The increasing reliance on wireless communication networks has escalated the need for highly secure and efficient cryptographic techniques to mitigate evolving cyber threats. Traditional encryption schemes suffer from computational inefficiencies, lack of adaptability, and vulnerability to attacks, quantum computing, and deep-learning-based decryption attacks. Although Diffie-Hellman key agreement protocols are common key exchange mechanisms, they are susceptible to MITM and quantum threats. Most existing security protocols have tried to address the problem of achieving good encryption strength with processing time limits; However, existing protocols fall short of delivering comprehensive solutions that balance encryption strength with computational efficiency sets. An ML-driven cryptographic model integrating advanced ML techniques is proposed to enhance security, efficiency, and adaptability in process. Adaptive Regularized Neural Cryptosystem (ARNC), guarantees high-entropy encryption and evolves to withstand deep-learning-based attacks. Transformer-based secure Key Exchange (TB-SKE) replaces old key exchange protocols with state-of-the-art session-key generation for quantum and adversarial threats using attention mechanisms. Therefore, Federated Homomorphic Encryption (FedHomE) allows secure computation on encrypted data to improve privacy and bandwidth efficiency. Similarly, Graph Neural Network for Adaptive Cryptographic Strength (GNN-ACS) adopts network topology analysis to modify encryption difficulty concerning real-time threats to safety, optimizing computational overhead. Lastly, Reinforcement Learning-Based Self-Evolving Encryption (RL-SEE) autonomously modifies encryption strategies to adapt continually to new cyber threats. The first results indicate that encryption performance is improved at lower processing time with various threat models. It shows an average capture of 25.2% in encryption efficiency, a maximum key exchange latency of less than 0.002 seconds, and a high level of entropy (approximately 8.0 bits per character) even under adversarial threats. In addition, the system shows fast cryptographic adaptation with an average time of 4.7 milliseconds for policy updates; thus proving its viability for practical applications in real-time wireless communication environments.

TI Multi-Unit Serial Polynomial Multiplier to Accelerate NTRU-Based
   Cryptographic Schemes in IoT Embedded Systems
SO SENSORS
AB Concern for the security of embedded systems that implement IoT devices has become a crucial issue, as these devices today support an increasing number of applications and services that store and exchange information whose integrity, privacy, and authenticity must be adequately guaranteed. Modern lattice-based cryptographic schemes have proven to be a good alternative, both to face the security threats that arise as a consequence of the development of quantum computing and to allow efficient implementations of cryptographic primitives in resource-limited embedded systems, such as those used in consumer and industrial applications of the IoT. This article describes the hardware implementation of parameterized multi-unit serial polynomial multipliers to speed up time-consuming operations in NTRU-based cryptographic schemes. The flexibility in selecting the design parameters and the interconnection protocol with a general-purpose processor allow them to be applied both to the standardized variants of NTRU and to the new proposals that are being considered in the post-quantum contest currently held by the National Institute of Standards and Technology, as well as to obtain an adequate cost/performance/security-level trade-off for a target application. The designs are provided as AXI4 bus-compliant intellectual property modules that can be easily incorporated into embedded systems developed with the Vivado design tools. The work provides an extensive set of implementation and characterization results in devices of the Xilinx Zynq-7000 and Zynq UltraScale+ families for the different sets of parameters defined in the NTRUEncrypt standard. It also includes details of their plug and play inclusion as hardware accelerators in the C implementation of this public-key encryption scheme codified in the LibNTRU library, showing that acceleration factors of up to 3.1 are achieved when compared to pure software implementations running on the processing systems included in the programmable devices.

TI Limitations of Linear Cross-Entropy as a Measure for Quantum Advantage
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Demonstrating quantum advantage requires experimental implementation of a computational task that is hard to achieve using state-of-the-art classical systems. One approach is to perform sampling from a probability distribution associated with a certain class of highly entangled many-body wave functions. It has been suggested that such a quantum advantage can be certified with the linear cross-entropy benchmark (XEB). We critically examine this notion. First, we consider a "benign" setting, where an honest implementation of a noisy quantum circuit is assumed, and characterize the conditions under which the XEB approximates the fidelity of quantum dynamics. Second, we assume an "adversarial" setting, where all possible classical algorithms are considered for comparisons, and show that achieving relatively high XEB values does not imply faithful simulation of quantum dynamics. Specifically, we present an efficient classical algorithm that achieves high XEB values, namely 5-12% of those obtained in the state-of-the-art experiments, within just a few seconds using a single GPU machine. This is made possible by identifying and exploiting several vulnerabilities of the XEB, which allows us to achieve high XEB values without simulating a full quantum circuit. Remarkably, our algorithm features better scaling with the system size than a noisy quantum device for commonly studied random circuit ensembles in various architecture. We quantitatively explain the success of our algorithm and the limitations of the XEB by using a theoretical framework, in which the dynamics of the average XEB and fidelity are mapped to classical statistical mechanics models. Using this framework, we illustrate the relation between the XEB and the fidelity for quantum circuits in various architectures, with different choices of gate sets, and in the presence of noise. Taken together, our results demonstrate that XEB's utility as a proxy for fidelity hinges on several conditions, which should be independently checked in the benign setting, but cannot be assumed in the general adversarial setting. Therefore, the XEB on its own has a limited utility as a benchmark for quantum advantage. We briefly discuss potential ways to overcome these limitations.

TI Classical Communication Coset State (t,n) Threshold Quantum Digital
   Signature
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB In the field of quantum communication, classical communication processes have become a central open problem, especially in quantum threshold signature schemes. However, the existing quantum threshold signature schemes do not solve this problem well, and the signature verification process is relatively complicated. Therefore, the aim of this study is to propose a novel quantum threshold digital signature scheme that aims to realize classical communication and simplify the quantum threshold digital signature communication model while ensuring the security of the signature. Our approach constructs a binary linear secret-sharing matrix based on the properties of the coset states in the quantum state to share the master secret value and distribute the quantum tokens of the members. Unlike traditional schemes, our verification operation does not require the intervention of an arbitrator, thus simplifying the signature-verification process. In addition, we propose a novel reuse quantum-token protocol based on the length of the hash message to-be-signed to enable single-member signatures over multiple bits. This scheme has other potential applications, including eavesdropper identification, quantum threshold proxy signatures, and more flexible quantum threshold schemes. In addition, complex measurement operations are not required to verify the signatures, thus fulfilling the requirements of practical applications. In this paper, we present an innovative approach for solving the classical communication problem in quantum threshold signature schemes, which successfully solves the central open problem in this field by transforming the measurements of quantum states into classical communication. We believe that this approach will provide a more feasible solution for secure communication.

TI Cryogenic Hyperdimensional In-Memory Computing Using Ferroelectric TCAM
SO IEEE JOURNAL ON EXPLORATORY SOLID-STATE COMPUTATIONAL DEVICES AND
   CIRCUITS
AB Cryogenic operations of electronics present a significant step forward to achieve huge demand of in-memory computing (IMC) for high-performance computing, quantum computing, and military applications. Ferroelectric (FE) is a promising candidate to develop the complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS)-compatible nonvolatile memories. Hence, in this work, we investigate the effectiveness of IMC using emerging FE technology at the 5-nm technology node. To achieve that, we begin by characterizing commercial 5-nm fin field-effect transistors (FinFETs) from room temperature (300 K) down to cryogenic temperature (10 K). Then, we carefully calibrate the first industry-standard cryogenic-aware compact model [Berkeley Short-channel IGFET Model-Common Multi-Gate (BSIM-CMG)] to accurately reproduce the measurements. Afterward, we use the Preisach-model-based approach to incorporate the impact of FE within the BSIM-CMG model framework using the measurements from FE capacitor to realize ferroelectric fin field-effect transistors (Fe-FinFETs) operating from 300 down to 10 K. Then, as proof of concept, we focus on $1\times 8$ ternary content addressable memory (TCAM) array that is used to perform language classification and voice recognition using brain-inspired hyperdimensional IMC. Our comprehensive analysis spans from investigating the delay, power, and energy efficiency of TCAM-based IMC all the way up to calculating error probabilities in which we compare the figure of merits obtained from the emerging Fe-FinFET against classical FinFET-based IMC. We reveal that cryogenic temperatures lead to the worst performance in Fe-FinFET-based TCAM. Hence, we have also proposed solutions to improve the cryogenic performance of Fe-FinFET-based TCAM.

TI Abnormal Electricity Consumption Detection Method for Smart Grid Using
   Fusion Matrix Completion and Improved Clustering Algorithm
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB With the application and development of new technologies such as the Internet of Things and big data in the energy field, smart grids have gradually become the main trend for the future development of the power system. However, frequent communication between various participants in the smart grid can lead to higher privacy leakage risks, and malicious attackers can cause economic losses and security accidents to the smart grid by injecting abnormal power data. To address the issues of data privacy protection and anomaly detection in smart grids, this study proposed a matrix completion based smart grid data privacy protection scheme and an unsupervised learning based smart grid anomaly data detection scheme. A matrix completion based smart grid data privacy protection scheme was proposed to address the issue of data privacy protection between different trust domains in the smart grid. This scheme repaired missing elements in the relevant matrix through matrix completion, and increased random perturbations by adding noise with the same statistical characteristics as the original data to achieve data privacy protection. To address the issue of missing power data labels and inaccurate principal component analysis caused by abnormal data, an improved K-means clustering algorithm was used to remove outliers and optimize the results, to achieve accurate detection of abnormal data. The experimental results showed that the proposed algorithm has an accuracy of 0.9, an F1 value of 0.7, and a Bayesian detection rate of 0.61, all of which are higher than other algorithms. The AUC value of the proposed method was 0.79, indicating that the scheme established in this chapter has certain advantages in detecting abnormal electricity consumption.

TI Influence of surface and intermolecular interactions on the properties
   of supported polyoxometalates
SO NANOSCALE
AB Polyoxometalates (POMs) with localized radical or open-shell metal sites have the potential to be used as transformative electronic spin based molecular qubits (MQs) for quantum computing (QC). For practical applications, MQs have to be immobilized in electronically or optically addressable arrays which introduces interactions with supports as well as neighboring POMs. Herein, we synthesized Keggin POMs with both tungsten (W) and vanadium (V) addenda atoms. Ion soft landing, a highly-controlled surface modification technique, was used to deliver mass-selected V-doped POMs to different self-assembled monolayer surfaces on gold (SAMs) without the solvent, counterions, and contaminants that normally accompany deposition from solution. Alkylthiol, perfluorinated, and carboxylic-acid terminated monolayers were employed as representative model supports on which different POM-surface and POM-POM interactions were characterized. We obtained insights into the vibrational properties of supported V-doped POMs and how they are perturbed by interactions with specific surface functional groups using infrared reflection absorption and scattering-type scanning near-field optical microscopy, as well as tip enhanced Raman spectroscopy. Different functional groups on SAMs and nanoscale heterogeneity are both shown to modulate the observed spectroscopic signatures. Spectral shifts are also found to be dependent on POM-POM interactions. The electronic structure of the V-doped POMs was determined in the gas phase using negative ion photoelectron spectroscopy and on surfaces with scanning Kelvin probe microscopy. The chemical functionality and charge transfer properties of the SAMs are demonstrated to exert an influence on the charge state and electronic configuration of supported V-doped POMs. The geometric and electronic structure of the POMs were also calculated using density functional theory. Our joint experimental and theoretical findings provide insight into how V substitution as well as POM-surface and POM-POM interactions influence the vibrational properties of POMs.

TI Digitalization as a problem or solution? Charting the path for research
   on sustainable information systems
SO JOURNAL OF BUSINESS ECONOMICS
AB Digitalization has permeated all aspects of human lives, economies, and societies. This transformation has been driven by the rapid growth in computing power, storage capabilities, and data transmission infrastructures. These changes have enabled innovations, such as cloud computing, artificial intelligence, smartphones, digitalized homes, (semi) autonomous vehicles, quantum computing, and more. Digitalization has further resulted in faster, more effective service delivery by many organizations. The phenomenon of digitalization relies on an increasingly finite supply of resources, such as crude oil, silicon, and energy. Over the past 150 years, humans have consumed as many natural resources as they have consumed in the past 20,000 years. In part, this increasing clip of consumption has been driven by digitalization, as novel, technology-based solutions, such as blockchain, supplant older, slower low-tech solutions, such as books and ledgers, to process data and create value. Digitalization's demand for resources may be leading us to an environmental abyss. Consider cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, whose electricity consumption is approximately equal to the energy needs of small nations such as Malaysia or Sweden. Such consumption evokes the question, is, "is more digitalization really better, or given the harm to the planet, is this one context where less is more?". In this paper, we develop a research agenda for understanding the full cost of digitalization and its impact on sustainability. We do so in three parts; first, we offer a crisp definition of sustainability; second, we offer a concise review of the digitalization and sustainability literature; and third, we offer suggestions for research that advances our understanding of how digitalization impacts sustainability.

TI High-entropy and parallel quantum random number generation on the
   strength of chaos amplification
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Continuous variable quantum random number generator (CV-QRNG) has become one of the most actively developing QRNG schemes due to its excellent application prospects. Whether it is device-trusted or device-independent, the improvement of the quantum entropy relative to side information is a key bottleneck to be broken through in the CV-QRNG scheme, particularly against metrological-grade entropy evaluation. In this work, initial value hypersensitivity chaotic amplification of quantum shot noise is proposed to enhance quantum noise entropy content in CV-QRNG. A noise-added Lang-Kobayashi model is established to simulate, and multiple indexes to quantitatively evaluate, the divergence, convergence, and entropy increase in the dynamic process from quantum shot noise to a chaos-steady state in a chaotic laser. Based on homodyne detection of quadrature fluctuations of four independent quantum sideband modes of a chaotic laser, an extract ratio of 89% and a real-time yield of QRN of 21.28 Gbps are attained on the strength of chaos amplification of vacuum noise. The quantum classical noise ratio (QCNR) and the flatness of the entropy source are significantly enhanced and the relief of the RF amplifier and logic resource in post-processing supports high robustness, integrability, and scalability. The amplification effect of chaos on quantum fluctuations is similar to a passive and uncontrollable Gaussian modulation, which may play a role in CV quantum communication.

TI Telecom-band multiwavelength vertical emitting quantum well nanowire
   laser arrays
SO LIGHT-SCIENCE & APPLICATIONS
AB Highly integrated optoelectronic and photonic systems underpin the development of next-generation advanced optical and quantum communication technologies, which require compact, multiwavelength laser sources at the telecom band. Here, we report on-substrate vertical emitting lasing from ordered InGaAs/InP multi-quantum well core-shell nanowire array epitaxially grown on InP substrate by selective area epitaxy. To reduce optical loss and tailor the cavity mode, a new nanowire facet engineering approach has been developed to achieve controlled quantum well nanowire dimensions with uniform morphology and high crystal quality. Owing to the strong quantum confinement effect of InGaAs quantum wells and the successful formation of a vertical Fabry-Perot cavity between the top nanowire facet and bottom nanowire/SiO2 mask interface, stimulated emissions of the EH11a/b mode from single vertical nanowires from an on-substrate nanowire array have been demonstrated with a lasing threshold of similar to 28.2 mu J cm(-2) per pulse and a high characteristic temperature of similar to 128 K. By fine-tuning the In composition of the quantum wells, room temperature, single-mode lasing is achieved in the vertical direction across a broad near-infrared spectral range, spanning from 940 nm to the telecommunication O and C bands. Our research indicates that through a carefully designed facet engineering strategy, highly ordered, uniform nanowire arrays with precise dimension control can be achieved to simultaneously deliver thousands of nanolasers with multiple wavelengths on the same substrate, paving a promising and scalable pathway towards future advanced optoelectronic and photonic systems.

TI QAmplifyNet: pushing the boundaries of supply chain backorder prediction
   using interpretable hybrid quantum-classical neural network
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Supply chain management relies on accurate backorder prediction for optimizing inventory control, reducing costs, and enhancing customer satisfaction. Traditional machine-learning models struggle with large-scale datasets and complex relationships. This research introduces a novel methodological framework for supply chain backorder prediction, addressing the challenge of collecting large real-world datasets with 90% accuracy. Our proposed model demonstrates remarkable accuracy in predicting backorders on short and imbalanced datasets. We capture intricate patterns and dependencies by leveraging quantum-inspired techniques within the quantum-classical neural network QAmplifyNet. Experimental evaluations on a benchmark dataset establish QAmplifyNet's superiority over eight classical models, three classically stacked quantum ensembles, five quantum neural networks, and a deep reinforcement learning model. Its ability to handle short, imbalanced datasets makes it ideal for supply chain management. We evaluate seven preprocessing techniques, selecting the best one based on logistic regression's performance on each preprocessed dataset. The model's interpretability is enhanced using Explainable artificial intelligence techniques. Practical implications include improved inventory control, reduced backorders, and enhanced operational efficiency. QAmplifyNet also achieved the highest F1-score of 94% for predicting "Not Backorder" and 75% for predicting "backorder," outperforming all other models. It also exhibited the highest AUC-ROC score of 79.85%, further validating its superior predictive capabilities. QAmplifyNet seamlessly integrates into real-world supply chain management systems, empowering proactive decision-making and efficient resource allocation. Future work involves exploring additional quantum-inspired techniques, expanding the dataset, and investigating other supply chain applications. This research unlocks the potential of quantum computing in supply chain optimization and paves the way for further exploration of quantum-inspired machine learning models in supply chain management. Our framework and QAmplifyNet model offer a breakthrough approach to supply chain backorder prediction, offering superior performance and opening new avenues for leveraging quantum-inspired techniques in supply chain management.

TI A Survey on Industry 4.0 for the Oil and Gas Industry: Upstream Sector
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB The market volatility in the oil and gas (O&G) sector, the dwindling demand for oil due to the impact of COVID-19, and the push for alternative greener energy are driving the need for innovation and digitization in the O&G industry. This has attracted research interest from academia and the industry in the application of industry 4.0 (I4.0) technologies in the O&G sector. The application of some of these I4.0 technologies has been presented in the literature, but the domain still lacks a comprehensive survey of the application of I4.0 in the O&G upstream sector. This paper investigates the state-of-the-art efforts directed toward I4.0 technologies in the O&G upstream sector. To achieve this, first, an overview of the I4.0 is discussed followed by a systematic literature review from an integrative perspective for publications between 2012-2021 with 223 analyzed documents. The benefits and challenges of the adoption of I4.0 have been identified. Moreover, the paper adds value by proposing a framework for the implementation of I4.0 in the O&G upstream sector. Finally, future directions and research opportunities such as framework, edge computing, quantum computing, communication technologies, standardization, and innovative areas related to the implementation of I4.0 in the upstream sector are presented. The findings from this review show that I4.0 technologies are currently being explored and deployed for various aspects of the upstream sector. However, some of the I4.0 technologies like additive manufacturing and virtual reality are least explored.

TI Plasmonic Radiation from Spin-Momentum Locking
SO ADVANCED SCIENCE
AB Chiral light emission plays a key role in sensing, tomography, quantum communication, among others. Whereas, achieving highly pure, tunable chirality emission across a broad spectrum currently presents significant challenges. Free-electron radiation emerges as a promising solution to surpass these barriers, especially in hard-to-reach regimes. Here, chiral free-electron radiation is presented by exploiting the spin-momentum locking (SML) property of spoof surface plasmons (SSPs). When the phase velocity of free electrons matches that of the SSPs, the SSPs can be excited. By implementing wavenumber compensation through perturbations, the confined SSPs are transformed into free-space free-electron radiation. Owing to the law of angular momentum conservation, this process converts the transverse spin angular momentum of SSPs into the longitudinal spin angular momentum of free-electron radiation during the process, producing pure, tunable, and chiral free-electron radiation across a broad spectrum. This method achieves an optimal degree of circular polarization approaching -1. The innovative methodology can be adapted to SML-enabled guided states or silicon photonics platforms, offering new avenues for achieving chiral emission.
   This study presents a novel method for chiral free-electron radiation by leveraging spin-momentum locking (SML) in spoof surface plasmons (SSPs). Through phase-matching, moving electrons excite SSPs along the modified structure, thus diffracted into Smith-Purcell radiation (SPR). This approach yields tunable chiral SPR with extensive polarization control and frequency tunability, representing a significant advancement toward achieving near-unity chiral radiation. image

AB In the present work, we focus on the development and optimization of the photonic structures fabrication with (In,Ga)As/GaAs quantum dots as an active part. Such structures offer the emission in the application-relevant range of the 2nd telecommunication window in view of obtaining efficient light collection, which is a critical requirement of practical, truly nonclassical sources for quantum communication schemes in fiber networks. We fabricated pillar-like photonic structures as a function of the sample and technological process parameters, which were then characterized by low-temperature micro-photoluminescence in order to optimize the emission intensity. We tested two different ion sources (Ga and Xe) also using an additional protection layer of carbon sputtered by the gas injection system. For each source, we have prepared a set of pillars with varying diameters and heights of the order of single micrometers, with fine-tuning of the beam currents and energy, and hence of the ion doses. We concluded that the optimized method should employ the xenon plasma focused ion beam technique, which takes advantage of high milling rate and high quality of etching of small structures, even micrometer in size, on the semiconductor material. For an optimized process, we obtained bright photoluminescence from single quantum dots. Our results indicate the potential of this technological approach employing xenon plasma focused ion beam technique to be suitable for the creation of photonic structures of good crystalline and optical quality, exhibiting efficient emission from embedded quantum dots in the telecommunication spectral range.

TI Artificial intelligence methods for applied superconductivity: material,
   design, manufacturing, testing, operation, and condition monitoring
SO SUPERCONDUCTOR SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY
AB More than a century after the discovery of superconductors (SCs), numerous studies have been accomplished to take advantage of SCs in physics, power engineering, quantum computing, electronics, communications, aviation, healthcare, and defence-related applications. However, there are still challenges that hinder the full-scale commercialization of SCs, such as the high cost of superconducting wires/tapes, technical issues related to AC losses, the structure of superconducting devices, the complexity and high cost of the cooling systems, the critical temperature, and manufacturing-related issues. In the current century, massive advancements have been achieved in artificial intelligence (AI) techniques by offering disruptive solutions to handle engineering problems. Consequently, AI techniques can be implemented to tackle those challenges facing superconductivity and act as a shortcut towards the full commercialization of SCs and their applications. AI approaches are capable of providing fast, efficient, and accurate solutions for technical, manufacturing, and economic problems with a high level of complexity and nonlinearity in the field of superconductivity. In this paper, the concept of AI and the widely used algorithms are first given. Then a critical topical review is presented for those conducted studies that used AI methods for improvement, design, condition monitoring, fault detection and location of superconducting apparatuses in large-scale power applications, as well as the prediction of critical temperature and the structure of new SCs, and any other related applications. This topical review is presented in three main categories: AI for large-scale superconducting applications, AI for superconducting materials, and AI for the physics of SCs. In addition, the challenges of applying AI techniques to the superconductivity and its applications are given. Finally, future trends on how to integrate AI techniques with superconductivity towards commercialization are discussed.

TI CUORE opens the door to tonne-scale cryogenics experiments
SO PROGRESS IN PARTICLE AND NUCLEAR PHYSICS
AB The past few decades have seen major developments in the design and operation of cryogenic particle detectors. This technology offers an extremely good energy resolution - comparable to semiconductor detectors - and a wide choice of target materials, making low temperature calorimetric detectors ideal for a variety of particle physics applications. Rare event searches have continued to require ever greater exposures, which has driven them to ever larger cryogenic detectors, with the CUORE experiment being the first to reach a tonne-scale, mK-cooled, experimental mass. CUORE, designed to search for neu-trinoless double beta decay, has been operational since 2017 at a temperature of about 10 mK. This result has been attained by the use of an unprecedentedly large cryogenic infrastructure called the CUORE cryostat: conceived, designed and commissioned for this purpose.
   In this article the main characteristics and features of the cryogenic facility developed for the CUORE experiment are highlighted. A brief introduction of the evolution of the field and of the past cryogenic facilities are given. The motivation behind the design and development of the CUORE cryogenic facility is detailed as are the steps taken toward realization, commissioning, and operation of the CUORE cryostat. The major challenges overcome by the collaboration and the solutions implemented throughout the building of the cryogenic facility will be discussed along with the potential improvements for future facilities.
   The success of CUORE has opened the door to a new generation of large-scale cryogenic facilities in numerous fields of science. Broader implications of the incredible feat achieved by the CUORE collaboration on the future cryogenic facilities in various fields ranging from neutrino and dark matter experiments to quantum computing will be examined.

TI A Cryo-CMOS Wideband Mode-Switching Class-F VCO With Harmonic-Resonance
   Self-Alignment
SO IEEE JOURNAL OF SOLID-STATE CIRCUITS
AB This article presents a cryogenic mode-switching class-F voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO) aimed at addressing the demand for wideband, low phase noise (PN) local oscillator signals in cryo-CMOS quantum controllers. First, to resolve the issues of manual alignment of harmonics and resonances, and excessive drain-to-gate gain leading to reliability concerns in transformer (XFMR)-based class-F VCOs, a single-core class-F VCO architecture with harmonic-resonance self-alignment property was constructed by utilizing a symmetrical and XFMR-less dual-mode resonator (DMR), which features a pair of concurrently tunable and fixed-ratio (3:1) resonant frequencies. Since the pseudo-square oscillating voltage waveforms are directly fed back to the gates, a sharper class-F oscillation is achieved to reduce the impulse sensitivity function (ISF) even without the drain-to-gate gain. Then, the lossless mode-switching technique is introduced into two coupled single-core class-F VCOs to extend the frequency tuning range (FTR) and gain about 3-dB PN reduction. The coupling realized by inductive and small magnetic elements does not disrupt the self-alignment characteristics for under mode-switching operation. Large-dimension transistors were employed to design the negative transconductance cells to suppress flicker noise and channel shot noise at cryogenic temperatures (CTs). Furthermore, the worsened nonlinearity in MOSFETs at CTs is exploited to enhance the waveform shape of class-F oscillations. The designed and fabricated VCO prototype achieves 5.3-to 10.6-GHz FTR with a best PN of -153.1 dBc/Hz at 10-MHz offset at 3.7 K, corresponding to a best figure of merit (FoM) and FoM for FTR (FoM(T)) of 203.8 and 220.3 dBc/Hz, respectively.

TI Exploiting Hardware and Software Advances for Quadratic Models of Wind
   Farm Layout Optimization
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB A key aspect of the design of a wind farm is the wind farm layout optimization (WFLO) problem: given a wind farm site and information about the wind patterns, the problem is to decide the location of individual wind turbines to maximize energy production subject to proximity restrictions and wake-based interference between turbines. Given the pairwise wake interactions, it is natural to model the energy objective as a quadratic function as, indeed, has been done in some existing optimization approaches. However, state-of-the-art solutions often trade-off between speed in producing designs and quality in terms of finding and proving optimal solutions. In this work, we aim to find a balanced approach to obtain WFLO solutions quickly for interactive design and solve the problem to optimality when quality is more important. To this end, we exploit recent advances in optimization hardware and software that target quadratic constraints: commercial mixed integer linear solvers have been extended to address some quadratic problems and nascent specialized hardware, including quantum computing systems, have focused on solving quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) problems. We introduce two novel quadratic programming models for WFLO: a quadratic constrained optimization problem (QCOP) with binary decision variables and a QUBO. A thorough numerical evaluation using a commercial solver and specialized QUBO hardware show that our quadratic framework achieves fast, high-quality solutions that improve the state of the art and strike a balance between speed and quality. In particular, the QUBO model delivers high quality solutions in a few seconds while the QCOP model can be used to find better solutions and provide quality guarantees over a longer run-time.

AB Computational thinking is a discipline that fosters problem-solving by using tools, concepts and practices that are common in computer science. It was defined back in the 1980s, but has gained more and more popularity since Wing's 2006 Viewpoint paper. The computational thinking movement promotes the learning of skills at any age and in any application domain, not only in computer science. The discipline has evolved incorporating new dimensions such as the one linked with artificial intelligence or quantum computing, just to mention a few. However, very little attention, if any, has been paid to software variability. In this paper, we propose including variability as a new dimension of computational thinking that complements existing ones. This dimension could be defined as the ability to think about a set of related solutions when solving a problem inspired by the way software product line engineering addresses the development of systems. We provide a first solution that extends existing tools to introduce students with variability thinking skills. Concretely, we use Snap! 8 metaprogramming capabilities to make it possible to learn about variability engineering by implementing a tangible solution of a computer game product line. We have validated our solution in a workshop with 19 students in the fourth year of a software engineering degree, and also with 15 experts in variability from 13 different universities. The results are promising according to the two surveys that we used with both students and experts, which show the feasibility of our proposal. We propose a path for the research needed to include the variability dimension in computational thinking, connecting both lines of research. Developing software variability as a new dimension of computational thinking paves the way for teaching it in a practical way in undergraduate courses and even in high school, democratizing its impact and understanding.

TI Mapping the Machine Learning Landscape in Autonomous Vehicles: A
   Scientometric Review of Research Trends, Applications, Challenges, and
   Future Directions
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB In recent years, Machine Learning (ML) has emerged as a transformative technology in the field of Autonomous Vehicles and Autonomous Driving, fundamentally reshaping vehicle perception, decision-making, and control mechanisms. The integration of ML techniques is pivotal to advancing the safety, efficiency, and adaptability of AV systems, driving significant academic and industrial interest. Over the past decade, there has been an unprecedented surge in research output exploring diverse ML methodologies tailored to AV applications. However, despite this exponential growth, there remains a critical gap in systematically understanding the evolution, intellectual landscape, research hotspots, and collaborative dynamics of this rapidly expanding domain, limiting scholars' and practitioners' ability to grasp the current state of knowledge and identify emerging trends. To fill this gap, this study presents an extensive bibliometric and conceptual structure analysis, offering a consolidated view of the field's development from 2011 to 2025. The results uncover exponential growth in scholarly output, largely driven by the proliferation of deep learning, reinforcement learning, and federated learning approaches. The intellectual landscape of ML in AVs is organized around five dominant thematic clusters: perception, planning and decision-making, control systems, safety and robustness, and connected or federated systems. Additionally, an in-depth qualitative review of the most influential publications highlights critical methodological contributions while exposing persistent challenges related to model generalization, safety validation, and interpretability. It concludes with a forward-looking agenda, emphasizing interdisciplinary research, robust validation frameworks, and the integration of emerging technologies such as Digital Twins, Edge AI, Quantum Computing, and Large Language Models (LLMs) to enhance intelligence, scalability, reasoning, adaptability, and human-machine collaboration in future AV systems.

TI Monolithically Integrated C-Band Low-Noise Amplifiers for Use in
   Cryogenic Large-Scale RF Systems
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON MICROWAVE THEORY AND TECHNIQUES
AB This article reports on the design of C -band (4-8 GHz) monolithically integrated low-noise amplifiers (LNAs) in a 50-nm metamorphic high-electron-mobility transistor (mHEMT) technology with low-dc-power consumption dedicated to cryogenic operation in large receiver arrays. Two LNA monolithic microwave-integrated circuits (MMICs) are investigated: one two-stage design (LNA 1) targeting the C -band, which has been designed as a stand-alone and as a four-channel MMIC to demonstrate the ability to achieve higher integration levels. The second amplifier (LNA 2) is a three-stage design focusing on 6-9 GHz, but it can also be used from 4-9 GHz with only minor performance degradation. LNA 1 achieves an average in-band noise temperature of 2.7 K with 31 dB of gain when operated at 10 K with optimal noise bias (7.78-mW dc-power consumption). The power consumption of LNA 1 can be reduced to 0.77 mW with an average noise of 3.8 K and 23.7 dB of gain. LNA 2 provides 44.5 dB of small-signal gain and 3.3-K average noise temperature between 4 and 9 GHz (2.9 K between 6 and 9 GHz) at 10 K and optimal noise bias (5.57 mW). When the dc-power consumption of LNA 2 is reduced to 1.34 mW, 35.4 dB of small-signal gain and 4.4 K of average noise temperature are preserved. To the best of the authors' knowledge, LNA 1 demonstrates both the lowest noise temperature and dc-power consumption among monolithically integrated C -band LNAs at cryogenic temperatures.

TI Beneath Thy Protection: Portrait of the Holy Virgin as a semantic
   operator
SO SIGN SYSTEMS STUDIES
AB Starting from the third century, many songs, prayers, and icons testify to the way the Virgin Mary - Mother of God - has been attributed the role of protecting the community. Examples include the Akhathist hymn traditionally dated to the siege of Constantinople (626), the Polish anthem "Bogurodzica", associated with the battle of Grunwald (1410), the icon of Czestochowa that protected Poland from the Swedish invasion (1655), and numerous others. The role of menace is embodied by different enemies: infidels, heretics, or atheists. The Virgin watches over the frontier between two cultural spaces: the inside and the outside of the semiosphere. A case study will provide insight into the function played by the Madonna at the border: the Madonna of the Rocciamelone, the highest sanctuary in Europe, founded by the crusader knight Rotharius (1358). A bronze statue of the Virgin was placed in the sanctuary in 1899. A small corpus of pastoral letters written by blessed Edoardo Rosaz, bishop of Susa (Piedmont), expresses the hope that the Virgin will protect Catholics from liberal heresy. Plastic oppositions such as top/bottom, resulting from the relationship between the Virgin and the landscape, are used to manifest abstract oppositions such as reason/passion, order/disorder, and Church/revolution. This homologation helps us understand how the Virgin, placed in upper space, embodies knowledge and cognition: she becomes a lookout, allowing a transfer of values from the semantic field of war to the religious one. The Virgin guards the border of the semiosphere, the border dividing the self from the other. Her function is the semiotization of incoming materials, transforming external non-communication into information and meaning. This article thus considers the Virgin as a semantic operator inverting the values of liberal discourse into information stored in Catholic cultural space. A mathematical model of the function played by the Virgin will be presented in the terms of quantum computing.

TI Variational Approaches for Drug-Disease-Gene Links in Periodontal
   Inflammation
SO INTERNATIONAL DENTAL JOURNAL
AB Introduction and Objectives: Oral diseases, including gingivitis and periodontitis, are linked to the Wnt signaling pathway, vital for bone metabolism, cementum homeostasis, and mesenchymal stem cell differentiation. Advances in generative AI techniques, such as variational autoencoders (VAEs) and quantum variational classifiers (QVCs), offer promising tools for predicting gene associations between drugs and diseases. This study aims to compare the predictive performance of VAEs and QVCs in modeling drug-disease gene networks within the Wnt signaling pathway in periodontal inflammation. Methods: Genes associated with Wnt-related periodontal inflammation were identified through comprehensive literature reviews and genomic databases. Their roles in various biological processes were evaluated using gene set enrichment analysis, employing tools like Enrichr, which integrates diverse gene sets from sources such as DSigDB, DisGeNET, and Lincs_l1000.drug. The study then applied VAEs and QVCs to predict gene-disease associations related to the Wnt signaling pathway. Results: The analysis revealed an extensive network comprising 1738 nodes and 1498 edges, averaging 1.992 neighbors per node. The network exhibited a diameter of 2, a radius of 1, and a characteristic path length of 1.992, indicating limited interconnectivity. The VQA model demonstrated a high accuracy rate of 97.5%, although it only detected 50% of anomalies. The VQC model achieved a precision of 78%, with Class 1 samples showing improved recall and a balanced F1 score. Conclusion: VQC and VAE models exhibit strong potential for discovering FDA-approved drugs by predicting gene-drug associations in periodontitis based on the Wnt signaling pathway. Clinical Relevance: This study highlights the potential of VAEs and QVCs in predicting genedrug associations for periodontal inflammation. This could lead to more targeted therapies for oral diseases like periodontitis, improving patient outcomes and advancing personalized treatment strategies in clinical practice. (c) 2024 The Authors.

TI Designing quantum multi-category classifier from the perspective of
   brain processing information
SO MACHINE LEARNING-SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB In the field of machine learning, the multi-category classification problem plays a crucial role. Solving the problem has a profound impact on driving the innovation and development of machine learning techniques and addressing complex problems in the real world. In recent years, researchers have begun to focus on utilizing quantum computing to solve the multi-category classification problem. Some studies have shown that the process of processing information in the brain may be related to quantum phenomena, with different brain regions having neurons with different structures. Inspired by this, we design a quantum multi-category classifier model from this perspective for the first time. The model employs a heterogeneous population of quantum neural networks (QNNs) to simulate the cooperative work of multiple different brain regions. When processing information, these heterogeneous clusters of QNNs allow for simultaneous execution on different quantum computers, thus simulating the brain's ability to utilize multiple brain regions working in concert to maintain the robustness of the model. By setting the number of heterogeneous QNN clusters and parameterizing the number of stacks of unit layers in the quantum circuit, the model demonstrates excellent scalability in dealing with different types of data and different numbers of classes in the classification problem. Based on the attention mechanism of the brain, we integrate the processing results of heterogeneous QNN clusters to achieve high accuracy in classification. Finally, we conducted classification simulation experiments on different datasets. The results show that our method exhibits strong robustness and scalability. Among them, on different subsets of the MNIST dataset, its classification accuracy improves by up to about 5% compared to other quantum multiclassification algorithms. This result becomes the state-of-the-art simulation result for quantum classification models and exceeds the performance of classical classifiers with a considerable number of trainable parameters on some subsets of the MNIST dataset.

AB Thresholding is the primitive step in the process of image segmentation. Finding the optimal threshold for satellite images with reduced computation time and resources is still a challenging task. In this paper, we propose a Grey-Level Co-occurrence Matrix based Quantum Inspired Genetic Algorithm (QGA-GLCM) for bi-level thresholding of gray-scale images (natural and satellite). In this paper, QGA was used to find the optimal threshold. The results are compared with four different variants of Differential Evolution (DE) meta-heuristic algorithms, namely- DE-Otsu, DE-Kapur, DE-Tsali's, DE-GLCM, and three different variants of QGA, namely- QGAOtsu, QGA-Kapur, QGA-Tsali's. Intensity value from image pixel is the only information used by Otsu, Tsali's and Kapur for thresholding and are highly affected by noise. The main objective of this paper was a) To have a binary threshold for images corrupted with noise by bringing in spatial context b) To reduce the computational complexity and time for generating a threshold. Performance evaluators viz., CPU time, Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR), Mean Square Error (MSE), and Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) were used for quantitative assessment of partitioned images. From this study we observed that our proposed technique, QGA-GLCM is a) very good at producing a diverse population b) ten times faster than its classical counterparts c) generates better threshold for images corrupted by noise. In general, the threshold values generated by QGA and its variants are better than its classical counterparts. The results clearly show that exploration and exploitation capability of QGA is superior to DE for all variants. QGA-GLCM can be an effective technique to generate thresholds both in terms of computational speed and time.

TI Quantum support vector machine for forecasting house energy consumption:
   a comparative study with deep learning models
SO JOURNAL OF CLOUD COMPUTING-ADVANCES SYSTEMS AND APPLICATIONS
AB The Smart Grid operates autonomously, facilitating the smooth integration of diverse power generation sources into the grid, thereby ensuring a continuous, reliable, and high-quality supply of electricity to end users. One key focus within the realm of smart grid applications is the Home Energy Management System (HEMS), which holds significant importance given the fluctuating availability of generation and the dynamic nature of loading conditions. This paper presents an overview of HEMS and the methodologies utilized for load forecasting. It introduces a novel approach employing Quantum Support Vector Machine (QSVM) for predicting periodic power consumption, leveraging the AMPD2 dataset. In the establishment of a microgrid, various factors such as energy consumption patterns of household appliances, solar irradiance, and overall load are taken into account in dataset creation. In the realm of load forecasting in Home Energy Management Systems (HEMS), the Quantum Support Vector Machine (QSVM) stands out from other methods due to its unique approach and capabilities. Unlike traditional forecasting methods, QSVM leverages quantum computing principles to handle complex and nonlinear electricity consumption patterns. QSVM demonstrates superior accuracy by effectively capturing intricate relationships within the data, leading to more precise predictions. Its ability to adapt to diverse datasets and produce significantly low error values, such as RMSE and MAE, showcases its efficiency in forecasting electricity load consumption in smart grids. Moreover, the QSVM model's exceptional flexibility and performance, as evidenced by achieving an accuracy of 97.3% on challenging datasets like AMpds2, highlight its distinctive edge over conventional forecasting techniques, making it a promising solution for enhancing forecasting accuracy in HEMS.The article provides a brief summary of HEMS and load forecasting techniques, demonstrating and comparing them with deep learning models to showcase the efficacy of the proposed algorithms.

TI Cryogenic In-Memory Computing for Quantum Processors Using Commercial
   5-nm FinFETs
SO IEEE OPEN JOURNAL OF CIRCUITS AND SYSTEMS
AB Cryogenic CMOS circuits that efficiently connect the classical domain with the quantum world are the cornerstone in bringing large-scale quantum processors to reality. The major challenges are, however, the tight power budget (in the order of milliwatts) and small latency (in the order of microseconds) requirements that such circuits inevitably must fulfill when operating at cryogenic temperatures. In-memory computing (IMC) is rapidly emerging as an attractive paradigm that holds the promise of performing computations efficiently where the data does not need to move back and forth between the CPU and the memory. Hence, it overcomes the fundamental bottleneck in classical von Neumann architectures, which provides considerable savings in power and latency. In this work, for the first time, we propose and implement an end-to-end approach that investigates SRAM-based IMC for cryogenic CMOS. To achieve that, we first characterize commercial 5 nm FinFETs from 300 K down to 10 K. Then, we employ the first cryogenic-aware industry-standard compact model for the FinFET technology (BSIM-CMG) to empower SPICE to accurately capture how cryogenic temperatures alter the electrical characteristics of transistors (e.g., threshold voltage, carrier mobility, sub-threshold slope, etc.). Our key contributions span from (1) carefully calibrating the cryogenic-aware BSIM-CMG against commercial 5 nm FinFET measurements in which SPICE simulations come with an excellent agreement with the experimental data, (2) exploring how the robustness of SRAM cells against noise (during the hold, read, and write operations) changes at extremely low temperatures, (3) investigating how the behavior of SRAM-based IMC circuits changes at 10 K compared to 300 K, and (4) modeling the error probabilities of IMC circuits that are used to calculate the Hamming distance, which is one of the essential similarity calculations to perform classifications.

   directions
SO SOFTWARE-PRACTICE & EXPERIENCE
AB Recent developments in the Internet of Things (IoT) and real-time applications, have led to the unprecedented growth in the connected devices and their generated data. Traditionally, this sensor data is transferred and processed at the cloud, and the control signals are sent back to the relevant actuators, as part of the IoT applications. This cloud-centric IoT model, resulted in increased latencies and network load, and compromised privacy. To address these problems, Fog Computing was coined by Cisco in 2012, a decade ago, which utilizes proximal computational resources for processing the sensor data. Ever since its proposal, fog computing has attracted significant attention and the research fraternity focused at addressing different challenges such as fog frameworks, simulators, resource management, placement strategies, quality of service aspects, fog economics and so forth. However, after a decade of research, we still do not see large-scale deployments of public/private fog networks, which can be utilized in realizing interesting IoT applications. In the literature, we only see pilot case studies and small-scale testbeds, and utilization of simulators for demonstrating scale of the specified models addressing the respective technical challenges. There are several reasons for this, and most importantly, fog computing did not present a clear business case for the companies and participating individuals yet. This article summarizes the technical, non-functional, and economic challenges, which have been posing hurdles in adopting fog computing, by consolidating them across different clusters. The article also summarizes the relevant academic and industrial contributions in addressing these challenges and provides future research directions in realizing real-time fog computing applications, also considering the emerging trends such as federated learning and quantum computing.

TI On-chip electro-optic frequency shifters and beam splitters
SO NATURE
AB Efficient frequency shifting and beam splitting are important for a wide range of applications, including atomic physics(1,2), microwave photonics(3-6), optical communication(7,8) and photonic quantum computing(9-14). However, realizing gigahertz-scale frequency shifts with high efficiency, low loss and tunability-in particular using a miniature and scalable device-is challenging because it requires efficient and controllable nonlinear processes. Existing approaches based on acousto-optics(6,15-17), all-optical wave mixing(10,13,18-22) and electro-optics(23-27) are either limited to low efficiencies or frequencies, or are bulky. Furthermore, most approaches are not bi-directional, which renders them unsuitable for frequency beam splitters. Here we demonstrate electro-optic frequency shifters that are controlled using only continuous and single-tone microwaves. This is accomplished by engineering the density of states of, and coupling between, optical modes in ultralow-loss waveguides and resonators in lithium niobate nanophotonics(28). Our devices, consisting of two coupled ring-resonators, provide frequency shifts as high as 28 gigahertz with an on-chip conversion efficiency of approximately 90 per cent. Importantly, the devices can be reconfigured as tunable frequency-domain beam splitters. We also demonstrate a non-blocking and efficient swap of information between two frequency channels with one of the devices. Finally, we propose and demonstrate a scheme for cascaded frequency shifting that allows shifts of 119.2 gigahertz using a 29.8 gigahertz continuous and single-tone microwave signal. Our devices could become building blocks for future high-speed and large-scale classical information processors(7,29) as well as emerging frequency-domain photonic quantum computers(9,11,14).
   Engineering of the coupling between optical modes in a lithium niobate chip enables the realization of tunable, bi-directional and low-loss electro-optic frequency shifters controlled using only continuous and single-tone microwaves.

TI The Compression Optimality of Asymmetric Numeral Systems
SO ENTROPY
AB Source coding has a rich and long history. However, a recent explosion of multimedia Internet applications (such as teleconferencing and video streaming, for instance) renews interest in fast compression that also squeezes out as much redundancy as possible. In 2009 Jarek Duda invented his asymmetric numeral system (ANS). Apart from having a beautiful mathematical structure, it is very efficient and offers compression with a very low coding redundancy. ANS works well for any symbol source statistics, and it has become a preferred compression algorithm in the IT industry. However, designing an ANS instance requires a random selection of its symbol spread function. Consequently, each ANS instance offers compression with a slightly different compression ratio. The paper investigates the compression optimality of ANS. It shows that ANS is optimal for any symbol sources whose probability distribution is described by natural powers of 1/2. We use Markov chains to calculate ANS state probabilities. This allows us to precisely determine the ANS compression rate. We present two algorithms for finding ANS instances with a high compression ratio. The first explores state probability approximations in order to choose ANS instances with better compression ratios. The second algorithm is a probabilistic one. It finds ANS instances whose compression ratios can be made as close to the best ratio as required. This is done at the expense of the number ? of internal random "coin" tosses. The algorithm complexity is O(?L3), where L is the number of ANS states. The complexity can be reduced to O(?Llog2L) if we use a fast matrix inversion. If the algorithm is implemented on a quantum computer, its complexity becomes O(?(log2L)3).

TI Solving the capacitated vehicle routing problem with time windows via
   graph convolutional network assisted tree search and quantum-inspired
   computing
SO FRONTIERS IN APPLIED MATHEMATICS AND STATISTICS
AB Vehicle routing problems are a class of NP-hard combinatorial optimization problems which attract a lot of attention, as they have many practical applications. In recent years there have been new developments solving vehicle routing problems with the help of machine learning, since learning how to automatically solve optimization problems has the potential to provide a big leap in optimization technology. Prior work on solving vehicle routing problems using machine learning has mainly focused on auto-regressive models, which are connected to high computational costs when combined with classical exact search methods as the model has to be evaluated in every search step. This paper proposes a new method for approximately solving the capacitated vehicle routing problem with time windows (CVRPTW) via a supervised deep learning-based approach in a non-autoregressive manner. The model uses a deep neural network to assist finding solutions by providing a probability distribution which is used to guide a tree search, resulting in a machine learning assisted heuristic. The model is built upon a new neural network architecture, called graph convolutional network, which is particularly suited for deep learning tasks. Furthermore, a new formulation for the CVRPTW in form of a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) problem is presented and solved via quantum-inspired computing in cooperation with Fujitsu, where a learned problem reduction based upon the proposed neural network is applied to circumvent limitations concerning the usage of quantum computing for large problem instances. Computational results show that the proposed models perform very well on small and medium sized instances compared to state-of-the-art solution methods in terms of computational costs and solution quality, and outperform commercial solvers for large instances.

Currently, secure and reliable data communication in IoT is based on public-key cryptosystems such as the elliptic curve cryptosystem (ECC). Nevertheless, the reliance on the security of de-facto cryptographic primitives is at risk of being broken by the impending quantum computers. Therefore, the transition from classical primitives to quantum-safe primitives is indispensable to ensure the overall security of data en route. In this article, we investigate applications of one of the postquantum signatures called hash-based signature (HBS) schemes for the security of IoT devices in the quantum era. We give a succinct overview of the evolution of HBS schemes with an emphasis on their construction parameters and associated strengths and weaknesses. Then, we outline the striking features of HBS schemes and their significance for IoT security in the quantum era. We also investigate the optimal selection of HBS in the IoT networks with respect to their performance-constrained requirements, resource-constrained nature, and design optimization objectives. In addition to ongoing standardization efforts, we also highlight current and future research and deployment challenges along with possible solutions. Finally, we outline the essential measures and recommendations that must be adopted by the IoT ecosystem while preparing for the quantum world.

TI Exciton dynamics in 2D organic semiconductors
SO MATERIALS FUTURES
AB Two-dimensional (2D) semiconducting materials have been studied extensively for their interesting excitonic and optoelectronic properties arising from strong many-body interactions and quantum confinement at 2D limit. Most of these materials have been inorganic, such as transition metal dichalcogenides, phosphorene, etc. Organic semiconductor materials, on the other hand been investigated for their excellent electrical conductivity and low dielectric coefficients for similar applications in the thin film or bulk material phase. The lack of crystallinity in the thin film and bulk phases has led to ambiguity over the excitonic and electronic/optical band gap characteristics. The recent emergence of 2D organic materials has opened a new domain of high crystallinity and controlled morphology, allowing for the study of low-lying excitonic states and optoelectronic properties. They have been demonstrated to have different excitonic properties compared with the Wannier-Mott excitons in inorganic 2D materials. Here we present our recent experimental observations and analysis of 2D organic semiconductor materials. We discuss the role of high-crystalline and morphology-controlled growth of single-crystalline materials and their optoelectronic properties. The report explains the Frenkel (FR) and charge-transfer (CT) excitons and subsequent light emission and absorption properties in organic materials. The true nature of low-lying excitonic states, which arises from the interaction between CT and FR excitons, is experimentally studied and discussed to reveal the electronic band structure. We then discuss the pure FR behaviour we observed in J-type aggregated organic materials leading to coherent superradiant excitonic emissions. The supertransport of excitons within the organic materials, facilitated by their pure FR nature, and the delocalization of excitons over a large number of molecules are also demonstrated. Finally, we discuss the applications and our vision for these organic 2D materials in fast organic light-emitting diodes, high-speed excitonic circuits, quantum computing devices, and other optoelectronic devices.

TI Feedback search algorithm for multi-particle quantum walks over a ring
   based on permutation groups
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB In quantum computing science, much attention has been paid to how to construct quantum search algorithms better, moreover, searching for new search algorithms based on quantum walk is still attracting scholars' continuous in-depth research and exploration. In this paper, a multi-particle quantum walk search algorithm based on permutation group is proposed by considering many aspects, such as reducing time consumption and increasing the accuracy and controllability of algorithm search. Firstly, the permutation group can be regarded as a closed loop in space, and the permutation set is defined. The data set of data points is mapped to the defined permutation set by isomorphism mapping, which makes the element data points in the permutation set form a one-to-one correspondence. Secondly, according to the given initial state and coin operator, the target data search is carried out on the ring by using the quantum walk of multiple particles in the search space of the data point set and the permutation set. Finally, the target data is found according to the function Phi(w) = 1, and the value is stored by the quantum state, which is used to form the feedback control of the search algorithm. At the same time, the direction of quantum walking on the ring is controlled by controlling the coin operator, thus increasing the operability and accuracy of the search. In this paper, the quantum walk of multiple particles is used to search, and the analysis shows that the particle number parameter j is negatively correlated with the time complexity, but not negatively linear. The proposed quantum walk search algorithm conforms to the zero condition and the lower bound condition, and is not affected by the variable parameter j. Through numerical analysis, it is found that the time complexity of the quantum walk search algorithm is equivalent to O((3)root N), which improves the search efficiency compared with the Grover search algorithm.

TI Monolithic piezoelectrically tunable hybrid integrated laser with
   sub-fiber laser coherence
SO OPTICA
AB Ultra-low noise lasers are essential tools in various applications, including data communication, light detection and ranging (LiDAR), quantum computing and sensing, and optical metrology. Recent advances in integrated photonics, specifically the development of the ultra-low loss silicon nitride (Si3N4) platform, have allowed attaining performance that exceeds conventional legacy laser systems, including the phase noise of fiber lasers. This platform can be combined with the monolithic integration of piezoelectric materials, enabling frequency-agile low-noise lasers. However, this approach has not yet surpassed the trade-off between ultra-low frequency noise and frequency agility. Here, we overcome this challenge and demonstrate a fully integrated laser based on the Si3N4 platform with frequency noise lower than that of a fiber laser while maintaining the capability for high-speed modulation of the laser frequency. The laser achieves an output power of 30 mW with an integrated linewidth of 4.3 kHz and an intrinsic linewidth of 3 Hz, demonstrating phase noise performance that is on par with or lower than commercial fiber lasers. Frequency agility is accomplished via a monolithically integrated piezoelectric aluminum nitride micro-electro-mechanical system (MEMS) actuator, which enables a flat frequency actuation bandwidth extending up to 400 kHz. Such a MEMS device is one of the largest fabricated structures, featuring MHz-level bandwidth, which is significantly higher than the typical kHz-level bandwidth of similarly sized mm-scale MEMS devices. The chirp nonlinearity of the frequency-modulated output reaches 0.08% without any linearization or pre-distortion, making it compliant with the requirement for long-range FMCW LiDAR. This ultra-low noise and frequency-agility combination is a useful feature enabling tight laser locking for frequency metrology, fiber sensing, and coherent sensing applications. Our results demonstrate the ability of "next generation" integrated photonic circuits (beyond silicon) to exceed the performance of legacy laser systems in terms of coherence and frequency actuation.

TI Facilitating usage of quantum-classical optimization software with
   QHyper library
SO INFORMATION AND SOFTWARE TECHNOLOGY
AB Context: Quantum computing offers promising approaches to solving combinatorial optimization problems. While there are many software frameworks for these approaches, they are developed by different providers, requiring users to reimplement their problems separately in each environment to facilitate comparisons. Additionally, due to the current limitations of quantum hardware, classical solvers are often used as reference methods, further increasing implementation overhead. This lack of integration highlights the need for a unified API that seamlessly connects all approaches, enabling efficient problem formulation and comparison of different methods. Objective: This work aims to provide a research tool with a unified interface for specifying combinatorial optimization problems, selecting different solvers, managing problem hyperparameters, and standardizing the output for effortless analysis and comparison. Methods: We have developed an open-source research tool with a modular architecture that fulfills the aforementioned objective. QHyper's design provides an independent representation of the problem along with a converter that supports various formulations compatible with available solvers. Among them are the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm implemented in PennyLane, the D-Wave Advantage solver, and the Gurobi optimizer. For optimization, QHyper offers various methods, from local techniques based on gradient descent to custom global Monte Carlo methods for hyperparameter optimization. Results: QHyper's overhead is within the statistical margin of error compared to the stand-alone use of solvers. The included illustrative example shows how to create a custom problem and easily switch between the chosen solvers. The paper also contains references to real-life scientific use cases for the presented tool. Conclusion: QHyper's design ensures easy extensibility to new problems, solvers, and optimizers, and has proven its usefulness for several scientific use cases mentioned in the paper. With simple configuration options and easy management, such as through Jupyter Notebooks, this library can be useful for practitioners, engineers, and academics working on combinatorial optimization research.

TI Lateral Quantum-Confined Stark Effect for Integrated Quantum Dot
   Electroabsorption Modulators
SO IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN QUANTUM ELECTRONICS
AB Advances in III-V on Si quantum dot (QD) growth have enabled monolithic integration of high-performance electrically-pumped lasers on Si, as an enabling component for Si photonics. Another critical component is the electroabsorption modulator (EAM), which exploits the quantum-confined Stark effect (QCSE) to achieve high-speed modulation of laser signals. Conventional quantum well (QW) EAMs exploit a "vertical" QCSE via top and bottom electrical contacts. Rapid advancements in planar photonic integrated circuit technology motivate development of laterally-contacted EAMs, which offer benefits including reduced parasitic capacitance. The QCSE cannot be achieved via a lateral field in a QW, but can in a QD due to the three-dimensional carrier confinement. Here, theoretical analysis of the lateral-field QCSE in 1.3 mu mIn(x)Ga(1-x)As/GaAs QDs is undertaken. Comparing the QCSE produced by vertical and lateral electric fields for realistic QD morphology a robust lateral-field QCSE is demonstrated, with the optical absorption edge redshifting more rapidly vs. field strength than in a conventional QW-EAM. It is shown that lateral-field QD-EAM performance is expected to be strongly sensitive to the spectral linewidth of the band edge absorption, and can also depend upon the in-plane orientation of the lateral electric field. The impact of QD morphology - the base shape, aspect ratio and composition profile - is also quantified. It is demonstrated that InxGa1-xAs/GaAs QDs possessing high aspect ratios and low absorption linewidths are well-suited to develop lateral-field QD-EAMs. This suggests leveraging III-V on Si epitaxy to integrate EAMs with lasers or single-photon sources to realize high-speed Si photonic integrated circuits for applications in datacomms and linear optical quantum computing

TI Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm applied to multi-objective
   routing for large scale 6G networks
SO COMPUTER NETWORKS
AB A multi-objective optimization problem involves optimizing two or more conflicting objectives simultaneously. This type of problem arises in many scientific and industrial areas and it is classified as NP-Hard. Network routing optimization with multiple objectives falls into this category. In the context of 6G networks, solving this problem will become even more challenging due to the exponential growth of Internet of Things devices and the high quality of service requirements. Finding good quality solutions for large-scale networks will be increasingly difficult. In this paper, we introduce a quantum-inspired routing optimization scheme in which noisy-intermediate scale quantum computers (NISQ) can be used to solve the Multi-Objective Routing Problem (MORP). We evaluate the application of the proposed scheme in detail by first developing the mathematical formulas for both single-objective and multi-objective routing and mapping the problem onto gate-based models by using the quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) approach. To validate the proposed scheme, we use the quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA), the go-to approach for solving combinatorial optimization problems that are classically intractable. For the simulation, we use the IBM-Qasm simulator and Qiskit framework. Additionally, we use the Chernoff Bound as a standard technique to estimate the sample complexity of QAOA. Finally, we provide a detailed numerical and theoretical analysis of the proposed scheme, including its time complexity, resource requirements, and the challenges associated with it. Our results demonstrate that the proposed approach operates with a time complexity of O(E2) per iteration in both single and multi-objective scenarios, with an overall runtime of (niteration + nCB) & sdot;O(E2) influenced by the sampling overhead, significantly outperforming Dijkstra's algorithm in the multi-objective case, where the complexity increases to O(2k(N(k + log N) + 2kE)).

TI A revised double-slit experiment to explore the mechanism of photon
   wavefunction collapse by numerical design
SO AIP ADVANCES
AB The double-slit experiment has long been pivotal in understanding matter's wave-particle duality. A central question revolves around Born's interpretation of wavefunction whether a single photon demonstrates a 50% probability of passing through each slit individually as particles or simultaneously traverses both as waves. Experimentally, once the photon's path is detected, the observer effect causes its wavefunction to collapse, rendering the results inconclusive. Designing an experiment to minimize instrumental involvement during the wavefunction collapse of photons, while aiming to gain insight into its collapse mechanism, becomes necessary. We propose a revised experiment that replaces the traditional setup with two Au nanoparticles acting as observers, triggering photon collapse before spectrum collection. In single-photon scenarios, we consider two assumptions: first, the photon wavefunctions collapse into a particle and transfer energy to one of the nanoparticles exclusively, and second, the photon acts as a wave, splitting and transferring its energy to two nanoparticles simultaneously, which does not align well with Born's interpretation of wavefunction as spatial probabilities. These two assumptions would generate distinctly different spectra. Conversely, in high-intensity experiments, both nanoparticles collectively undergo excitation, regardless of the collapse mechanism. A comparative analysis of scattering spectra under the two conditions reveals crucial insights into the genuine nature of photon collapse. We also proposed using two molecules attached to a metal nanoparticle as an alternative design. Whether affirming or refuting the observer effect, this research holds promise for resolving the theoretical debate surrounding the collapse of wavefunctions and advancing quantum computing and communication fields.

TI (How) Do Pre-service Teachers Use YouTube Features in the Selection of
   Instructional Videos for Physics Teaching?
SO RESEARCH IN SCIENCE EDUCATION
AB This mixed-methods study examines how pre-service teachers select instructional videos on YouTube for physics teaching. The study focuses on the role of surface features that YouTube provides (e.g., likes, views, thumbnails) and the comments underneath the videos in the decision-making process using videos on quantum physics topics as an example. The study consists of two phases: In phase 1, N = 24 (pre-service) physics teachers were randomly assigned to one of three groups, each covering a different quantum topic (entanglement, quantum tunneling, or quantum computing, respectively). From eight options provided, they selected a suitable video for teaching while their eye movements were tracked using a stationary eye tracker in a laboratory setting, and think-aloud data was collected. In the subsequent phase 2, participants were allowed to freely choose one YouTube video on a second topic of the above-mentioned ones while thinking aloud. The results reveal a significant emphasis on video thumbnails during selection, with over one-third of the fixation time directed towards them. Think-aloud data confirms the importance of thumbnails in decision-making, e.g., as evidenced by a categorization of the study participants' arguments and thoughts voiced. A detailed analysis identifies that participants did not rely on (content-related) comments despite they have been found to be significantly correlated with the videos' explaining quality. Instead, decisions were influenced by surface features and pragmatic factors such as channel familiarity. Retrospective reflections through a questionnaire including rating scale items support these observations. Building on the existing empirical evidence, a decision tree is proposed to help teachers identify high-quality videos considering duration, likes, comments, and interactions. The decision tree can serve as a hypothesis for future research and needs to be evaluated in terms of how it can help systematize the process of selecting high-quality YouTube videos for science teaching.

TI Cost-sensitive classification algorithm combining the Bayesian algorithm
   and quantum decision tree
SO FRONTIERS IN PHYSICS
AB This study highlights the drawbacks of current quantum classifiers that limit their efficiency and data processing capabilities in big data environments. The paper proposes a global decision tree paradigm to address these issues, focusing on designing a complete quantum decision tree classification algorithm that is accurate and efficient while also considering classification costs. The proposed method integrates the Bayesian algorithm and the quantum decision tree classification algorithm to handle incremental data. The proposed approach generates a suitable decision tree dynamically based on data objects and cost constraints. To handle incremental data, the Bayesian algorithm and quantum decision tree classification algorithm are integrated, and kernel functions obtained from quantum kernel estimation are added to a linear quantum support vector machine to construct a decision tree classifier using decision directed acyclic networks of quantum support vector machine nodes (QKE). The experimental findings demonstrate the effectiveness and adaptability of the suggested quantum classification technique. In terms of classification accuracy, speed, and practical application impact, the proposed classification approach outperforms the competition, with an accuracy difference from conventional classification algorithms being less than 1%. With improved accuracy and reduced expense as the incremental data increases, the efficiency of the suggested algorithm for incremental data classification is comparable to previous quantum classification algorithms. The proposed global decision tree paradigm addresses the critical issues that need to be resolved by quantum classification methods, such as the inability to process incremental data and the failure to take the cost of categorization into account. By integrating the Bayesian algorithm and the quantum decision tree classification algorithm and using QKE, the proposed method achieves high accuracy and efficiency while maintaining high performance when processing incremental sequences and considering classification costs. Overall, the theoretical and experimental findings demonstrate the effectiveness of the suggested quantum classification technique, which offers a promising solution for handling big data classification tasks that require high accuracy and efficiency.

   government readiness in artificial intelligence (AI)
SO KYBERNETES
AB PurposeThis study aims to investigate the impact of brain drain on government AI readiness in EU member countries, considering the distinctive governance characteristics, macroeconomic conditions and varying levels of ICT specialists.Design/methodology/approachThe research employs a dynamic panel data model using the System Generalized Method of Moments (GMM) to analyze the relationship between brain drain and government AI readiness from 2018 to 2022. The study incorporates various control variables such as GDP per capita growth, government expenditure growth, employed ICT specialists and several governance indicators.FindingsThe results indicate that brain drain negatively affects government AI readiness. Additionally, the presence of ICT specialists, robust governance structures and positive macroeconomic indicators such as GDP per capita growth and government expenditure growth positively influence AI readiness.Research limitations/implicationsMajor limitations include the focus on a specific region of countries and the relatively short period analyzed. Future research could extend the analysis with more comprehensive datasets and consider additional variables that might influence AI readiness, such as the integration of AI with emerging quantum computing technologies and the impact of governance reforms and international collaborations on AI readiness.Practical implicationsThe theoretical value of this study lies in providing a nuanced understanding of how brain drain impacts government AI readiness, emphasizing the critical roles of skilled human capital, effective governance and macroeconomic factors in enhancing AI capabilities, thereby filling a significant gap in the existing literature.Originality/valueThis research fills a significant gap in the existing literature by providing a comprehensive analysis of the interaction between brain drain and government AI readiness. It uses control variables such as ICT specialists, governance structures and macroeconomic factors within the context of the European Union. It offers novel insights for policymakers to enhance AI readiness through targeted interventions addressing brain drain and fostering a supportive environment for AI innovation.

TI Exciton delocalization in a fully synthetic DNA-templated
   bacteriochlorin dimer
SO PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY CHEMICAL PHYSICS
AB A bacteriochlorophyll a (Bchla) dimer is a basic functional unit in the LH1 and LH2 photosynthetic pigment-protein antenna complexes of purple bacteria, where an ordered, close arrangement of Bchla pigments-secured by noncovalent bonding to a protein template-enables exciton delocalization at room temperature. Stable and tunable synthetic analogs of this key photosynthetic subunit could lead to facile engineering of exciton-based systems such as in artificial photosynthesis, organic optoelectronics, and molecular quantum computing. Here, using a combination of synthesis and theory, we demonstrate that exciton delocalization can be achieved in a dimer of a synthetic bacteriochlorin (BC) featuring stability, high structural modularity, and spectral properties advantageous for exciton-based devices. The BC dimer was covalently templated by DNA, a stable and highly programmable scaffold. To achieve exciton delocalization in the absence of pigment-protein interactions critical for the Bchla dimer, we relied on the strong transition dipole moment in BC enabled by two auxochromes along the Qy transition, and omitting the central metal and isocyclic ring. The spectral properties of the synthetic "free" BC closely resembled those of Bchla in an organic solvent. Applying spectroscopic modeling, the exciton delocalization in the DNA-templated BC dimer was evaluated by extracting the excitonic hopping parameter, J to be 214 cm-1 (26.6 meV). For comparison, the same method applied to the natural protein-templated Bchla dimer yielded J of 286 cm-1 (35.5 meV). The smaller value of J in the BC dimer likely arose from the partial bacteriochlorin intercalation and the difference in medium effect between DNA and protein.
   We synthesized a de novo bacteriochlorin and created its dimer covalently attached to DNA. According to the spectral properties evaluated by modeling, the bacteriochlorin dimer showed exciton delocalization comparable to the natural Bchla dimer.

TI Deep Learning-Based Variational Autoencoder for Classification of
   Quantum and Classical States of Light
SO ADVANCED PHYSICS RESEARCH
AB Advancements in optical quantum technologies have been enabled by the generation, manipulation, and characterization of light, with identification based on its photon statistics. However, characterizing light and its sources through single photon measurements requires efficient detectors and longer measurement times to obtain high-quality photon statistics. Here, a deep learning-based variational autoencoder (VAE) method is introduced for classifying single photon added coherent state (SPACS), single photon added thermal state (SPATS), and mixed states between coherent and SPACS as well as between thermal and SPATS of light. The semi-supervised learning-based VAE efficiently maps the photon statistics features of light to a lower dimension, enabling quasi-instantaneous classification with low average photon counts. The proposed VAE method is robust and maintains classification accuracy in the presence of losses inherent in an experiment, such as finite collection efficiency, non-unity quantum efficiency, finite number of detectors, etc. Additionally, leveraging the transfer learning capabilities of VAE enables successful classification of data of any quality using a single trained model. It is envisioned that such a deep learning methodology will enable better classification of quantum light and light sources even in poor detection.
   A deep learning-assisted variational autoencoder (VAE) is used to classify quantum and classical states of light, such as single photon-added coherent source (SPACS), single photon-added thermal source (SPATS), and their mixtures. The semi-supervised VAE efficiently maps photon statistics to a low-dimensional latent space, allowing for rapid and accurate classification even with minimal photon counts and experimental losses. Transfer learning improves robustness and adaptability to varying data quality. image

TI Nanomaterial Analysis-Based Bioimaging for Gene Cell Structure Modeling
   Using Quantum-Inspired Deep Learning Techniques
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGIES AND SYSTEMS APPROACH
AB From the experimental results, quantum convolutional regression against neural network combined with incremental feature selection method shows significant advantages in gene cell structure detection. In terms of random accuracy, the recognition accuracy of this method for multiple gene image data sets is significantly higher than that of traditional methods, indicating that it can capture the characteristic information of gene cell structure more accurately.Gene expression is the process by which the proteins necessary to determine an organism's physical traits are produced, encompassing two main stages: transcription, in which enzymes transfer genetic information from DNA to RNA, and translation, in which RNA is converted into proteins and other essential biomolecules. While various methods can extract gene expression data from DNA or RNA, traditional extraction and analysis techniques often suffer from low accuracy and inefficiency in detecting nanoscale gene cell structures, limiting their usefulness in advanced biological imaging research. To address this challenge, we propose a quantum deep learning approach for bioimaging-based gene cell structure detection integrated with nanomaterial analysis. Gene images are collected and analyzed to simulate nanomaterial structures, and a quantum convolutional regression adversarial neural network is employed to accurately capture subtle nanoscale features-such as cell edge contours, internal textures, and unique morphologies resulting from interactions with nanomaterials-through quantum computing. The incorporation of an adversarial learning mechanism further reduces detection errors and enhances recognition accuracy for complex cell structures. A ranked feature list was compiled, key features were selected using an incremental feature selection strategy, and performance was evaluated across multiple gene image datasets using metrics such as random accuracy, sensitivity, AUC, F-measure, Dice coefficient, and NSE. Experimental results show that our method significantly outperforms conventional approaches, achieving higher recognition accuracy and more precise characterization of gene cell structures.

TI Recent advances in integrated hydrologic models: Integration of new
   domains
SO JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
AB Over the past several decades, hydrologic models have advanced from independent models of the surface and subsurface to integrated models that can capture the terrestrial hydrologic cycle within one framework. In recent years, these coupled frameworks have seen the inclusion of biogeochemical processes, ecohydrology, sedimentation and erosion, cold region hydrology, anthropogenic activities, and atmospheric processes. This expansion is the result of increased computational, data, and modeling capabilities and capacities, as well as improved understanding of the processes that drive these integrated systems. Here, we review these recent advances to integrate new processes and systems into existing terrestrial hydrologic models and highlight the significant challenges and opportunities that remain. We identify that with so many models currently available and in development, selecting the most appropriate model is difficult, and we suggest a path for new or novice modelers to find the most appropriate code based on their needs. In addition, data required to parameterize and calibrate these models can often constrain their applicability and usefulness. However, advances in environmental sensors and measurement technology, in addition to data assimilation of non-traditional data (e.g. remote sensing, qualitative data) are providing new ways of addressing this issue. As we expand hydrologic models to integrate more processes and systems, our computational demands also increase. Recent and emerging advances in computational platforms, including cloud and quantum computing, in addition to the use of machine learning to capture some processes, will continue to support the use of increasingly larger and more complex, process-based models. Finally, we highlight that it is critical to develop state-of-the-science models that are accessible to all model users, not just those applied for research and development. We encourage continued development of diverse modeling platforms, considering the user needs, data availability, and computational resources.

TI Advancements and challenges in bioinformatics tools for microbial
   genomics in the last decade: Toward the smart integration of
   bioinformatics tools, digital resources, and emerging technologies for
   the analysis of complex biological data
SO INFECTION GENETICS AND EVOLUTION
AB Over the past decade, microbial genomics has been transformed by advances in sequencing technologies and bioinformatics, enabling the transition from targeted gene markers to complete genome assemblies and ecological scale metagenomic surveys. This review presents a comprehensive overview of the bioinformatics pipelines that structure this field, from sample preparation, PCR amplification, and next-generation sequencing (NGS) to read preprocessing, genome assembly, polishing, structural and functional annotation, and submission to public databases. We highlight the major tools that have become standards at each stage, including FastQC, SPAdes, Prokka, Bakta, CARD, GTDB-Tk, QIIME 2, and Kraken2, while also emphasizing recent innovations such as hybrid assemblers, ontology-driven annotation frameworks, and automated workflows (nf-core, Bactopia). Applications extend across microbiology, from antimicrobial resistance surveillance and phylogenetic classification to ecological studies, exemplified here by three case studies: termite gut microbiota profiling by 16S metabarcoding, the description of new Bartonella species from bats, and the genomic characterization of rare Salmonella enterica serovars from primates. Despite these advances, persistent challenges remain, including incomplete and biased reference databases, computational bottlenecks, and economic disparities in sequencing and storage capacities. In response, international initiatives increasingly promote open, interoperable, and reusable bioinformatics infrastructures. Conforming to the Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable (FAIR) principles and global frameworks such as Global Alliance for Genomics and Health (GA4GH), these efforts are driving greater standardization, transparency, and data sharing across the microbial genomics community. Future perspectives point toward the integration of artificial intelligence, long-read and telomere-to-telomere (T2T) sequencing, cloud-native infrastructures, and even quantum computing, paving the way for a predictive, reproducible, and globally inclusive microbial genomics.

TI Direct measurement of the 3P0 clock state natural lifetime in
   87Sr
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Optical lattice clocks based on the narrow (5s2)1S0-(5s5p)3P0 transition in neutral strontium (Sr) are among the most precise and accurate measurement devices in existence. Although this transition is completely forbidden by selection rules, state mixing from the hyperfine interaction in 87Sr provides a weakly allowed transition that can be coherently driven with practical clock laser intensities. While the coherent interrogation times of optical clocks are typically set by the linewidth of the probe laser, this limitation can be overcome in synchronous differential comparisons between ensembles. In such measurements the natural lifetime of the 1S0-3P0 clock transition becomes the fundamental limiting factor to the duration of a single run of the experiment. However, a direct measurement of the decay rate of the clock excited state is quite challenging due to the competing effects of other loss channels such as Raman scattering, inelastic collisions, and atom loss due to background gas. In this work, we monitor the decay of Sr atoms trapped in an optical lattice and initialized in the 3P0 state. By making measurements of high and low density ensembles of both 87Sr and 88Sr across varying lattice trap depths, we isolate radiative decay, which accounts for a significant fraction of the observed decays at low depths. We obtain a natural radiative decay lifetime of 167+79-40 s for the 3P0 clock state in 87Sr, a value that is consistent with previously reported measurements and theoretical predictions. We also introduce an additional measurement scheme that involves repeated measurements of the ground-state population within a single experimental sequence, validating our model and the consistency of the measured rates. We expect that the techniques introduced in this work are applicable to lifetime measurements of long-lived metastable states in other atoms and ions used for clocks and quantum computing. The results presented in this work inform performance estimates of proposed gravitational wave detectors and long-baseline atom interferometers making use of 87Sr.

TI Strong error bounds for Trotter and strang-splittings and their
   implications for quantum chemistry
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Efficient error estimates for the Trotter product formula are central in quantum computing, mathematical physics, and numerical simulations. However, the Trotter error's dependency on the input state and its application to unbounded operators remains unclear. Here, we present a general theory for error estimation, including higher- order product formulas, with explicit input state dependency. Our approach overcomes two limitations of the existing operator-norm estimates in the literature. First, previous bounds are too pessimistic as they quantify the worst-case scenario. Second, previous bounds become trivial for unbounded operators and cannot be applied to a wide class of Trotter scenarios, including atomic and molecular Hamiltonians. Our method enables analytical treatment of Trotter errors in chemistry simulations, illustrated through a case study on the hydrogen atom. Our findings reveal the following: (i) for states with fat-tailed energy distribution, such as low-angular-momentum states of the hydrogen atom, the Trotter error scales worse than expected (sublinearly) in the number of Trotter steps; (ii) certain states do not admit an advantage in the scaling from higher-order Trotterization and, thus, the higher-order Trotter hierarchy breaks down for these states, including the hydrogen atom's ground state; (iii) the scaling of higher-order Trotter bounds might depend on the order of the Hamiltonians in the Trotter product for states with fat-tailed energy distribution. Physically, the enlarged Trotter error is caused by the atom's ionization due to the Trotter dynamics. Mathematically, we find that certain domain conditions are not satisfied by some states so higher moments of the potential and kinetic energies diverge. Our analytical error analysis agrees with numerical simulations, indicating that we can estimate the state-dependent Trotter error scaling genuinely.

TI A Lightweight Secure Scheme for Underwater Wireless Acoustic Network
SO JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING
AB Due to the open underwater channels and untransparent network deployment environments, underwater acoustic networks (UANs) are more vulnerable to hostile environments. Security research is also being conducted in cryptography, including authentication based on asymmetric algorithms and key distribution based on symmetric algorithms. In recent years, the advancement of quantum computing has made anti-quantum attacks an important issue in the field of security. Algorithms such as lattice and SPHINCS+ have become a research topic of interest in the field of security. However, within the past five years, few papers have discussed security algorithms for UANs to resist quantum attacks, especially through classical algorithms. Some existing classical asymmetric and symmetric algorithms are considered to have no prospects. From the perspective of easy deployment in engineering and anti-quantum attacks, our research focuses on a comprehensive lightweight security framework for data protection, authentication, and malicious node detection through the Elliptic Curve and Hash algorithms. Our mechanism is suitable for ad hoc scenarios with limited underwater resources. Meanwhile, we have designed a multi-party bit commitment to build a security framework for the system. A management scheme is designed by combining self-certifying with the threshold sharing algorithm. All schemes are designed based on certificate-less and ad hoc features. The proposed scheme ensures that the confidentiality, integrity, and authentication of the system are well considered. Moreover, the scheme is proven to be of unconditional security and immune to channel eavesdropping. The resource and delay issues are also taken into consideration. The simulations considered multiple variables like number of nodes, attackers, and message length to calculate proper values that can increase the efficiency of this scheme. The results in terms of delay, delivery ratio, and consumption demonstrate the suitability of the proposal in terms of security, especially for malicious node detection. Meanwhile, the computational cost has also been controlled at the millisecond level.

TI Exact master equation for generalized quantum Brownian motion with
   momentum-dependent system-environment couplings
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB In this paper we generalize the quantum Brownian motion (QBM) to include the momentum-dependent system-environment couplings. The resulting Hamiltonian in the particle number representation is given by Htot = h over bar omega Sa dagger a + Ek h over bar omega kb dagger kbk + Ek h over bar (Vka dagger bk +Vk* b dagger ka) + Ek h over bar (Wka dagger b dagger k +Wk* bka). The conventional QBM model corresponds to the special case Wk = Vk. The generalized QBM can capture more physical applications because the single-particle transition and the two-particle pair production between the system and the environment represent two very different physical processes that usually do not have the same coupling strengths. We discuss the physical realizations of the generalized QBM in different physical systems, and derive its exact master equation for both the initial decoupled states and initial correlated states. The Hu-Paz-Zhang master equation of the conventional QBM model is reproduced as a special case. We find that the renormalized system Hamiltonian after tracing out all the environmental states induced naturally a momentum-dependent potential, which shows the consistency of including the momentum-dependent coupling in the QBM Hamiltonian. In the Hu-Paz-Zhang master equation, such a renormalized potential is misplaced so that the correct renormalization Hamiltonian has not been found. With the exact master equation for both the initial decoupled and initial correlated states, the issues about the initial jolt are also reexamined. We find that the so-called "initial jolt," which has been thought to be an artificial effect due to the use of the initial decoupled system-environment states, has nothing to do with the initial decoupled state. The exact master equation for the generalized QBM also has potential applications to photonics quantum computing.

TI Single-molecule detection of a terrylenediimide-based near-infrared
   emitter
SO CHEMICAL SCIENCE
AB Environment-sensitive fluorescent agents with near-infrared (NIR) emission are in great demand owing to their applications in biomedical and quantum technologies. We report a novel NIR absorbing (lambda Absmax = 734 nm) and emitting (lambda Flmax = 814 nm) terrylenediimide (TDI) based donor-acceptor chromophore (TDI-TPA4), exhibiting polarity-sensitive single-photon emission. By virtue of the charge transfer (CT) character, ensemble level measurements revealed solvatochromism and NIR emission (phi Fl = 26.2%), overcoming the energy gap law. The CT nature of the excited states is further validated by state-of-the-art fragment-based excited state theoretical analysis. To mimic the polarity conditions at the single-molecule level, TDI-TPA4 was immobilized in polystyrene (PS; low polar) and poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA; high polar) matrices, which enables tuning of the energy levels of the locally excited state and charge-separated (CS) state. Minimal blinking and prolonged survival time of the TDI-TPA4 molecule in the PS matrix, in contrast to the PVA matrix, possibly confirms the implication of the energy gap law and polarity sensitivity of TDI-TPA4. The existence of the CT state in nonpolar and CS state in polar solvents was confirmed by transient absorption measurements in the femtosecond regime. The current work sheds light on the design principle for NIR single-photon emitting organic chromophores for deep tissue imaging and probing the nanoscale heterogeneity.
   Design and single-molecule level scrutiny of a novel NIR absorbing and emitting terrylenediimide-based chromophore, TDI-TPA4, is reported. The energy gap law and dielectric dependence of TDI-TPA4 are validated at single-molecule and ensemble domains.

TI Quantum Simulators: Architectures and Opportunities
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Quantum simulators are a promising technology on the spectrum of quantum devices from specialized quantum experiments to universal quantum computers. These quantum devices utilize entanglement and many-particle behavior to explore and solve hard scientific, engineering, and computational problems. Rapid development over the last two decades has produced more than 300 quantum simulators in operation worldwide using a wide variety of experimental platforms. Recent advances in several physical architectures promise a golden age of quantum simulators ranging from highly optimized special purpose simulators to flexible programmable devices. These developments have enabled a convergence of ideas drawn from fundamental physics, computer science, and device engineering. They have strong potential to address problems of societal importance, ranging from understanding vital chemical processes, to enabling the design of new materials with enhanced performance, to solving complex computational problems. It is the position of the community, as represented by participants of the National Science Foundation workshop on "Programmable Quantum Simulators," that investment in a national quantum simulator program is a high priority in order to accelerate the progress in this field and to result in the first practical applications of quantum machines. Such a program should address two areas of emphasis: (1) support for creating quantum simulator prototypes usable by the broader scientific community, complementary to the present universal quantum computer effort in industry; and (2) support for fundamental research carried out by a blend of multi-investigator, multidisciplinary collaborations with resources for quantum simulator software, hardware, and education.
   This document is a summary from a U.S. National Science Foundation supported workshop held on 16-17 September 2019 in Alexandria, VA. Attendees were charged to identify the scientific and community needs, opportunities, and significant challenges for quantum simulators over the next 2-5 years.

TI Automatic Generation of Density-Fitting Auxiliary Basis Sets for
   All-Electron Dirac-Kohn-Sham Calculations
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY A
AB In this study, we present a general workflow that enables the automatic generation of auxiliary density basis sets for all elements of the periodic table (from H to Og) to facilitate the general applicability of relativistic Dirac-Kohn-Sham calculations. It is an important tool for the accurate description of relativistic effects, including spin-orbit coupling, in molecules containing heavy elements. The latter are very important in various fields, ranging from catalysis to quantum technologies. The automatic generation algorithm is based on an even-tempered scheme inspired by a previous work by P. Calaminici et al. J. Chem. Phys. 2007, 126, 044108, in which the auxiliary basis sets were generated for nonrelativistic DFT calculations within the GGA approximation. Here, the algorithm uses basic information from the principal relativistic spinor basis set (exponents and angular momentum values) and includes a simple strategy to account for the high angular momentum of electrons in heavy and superheavy elements. The workflow developed here allows us to perform extensive automated tests aimed at verifying the accuracy of the auxiliary basis sets in a large molecular data set of about 300 molecules representing all groups and periods of the periodic table. The results show that our auxiliary basis sets achieve high accuracy, with errors in the Coulomb energies of a few mu-hartree, which are of the same order of magnitude as in the nonrelativistic density fitting. The automatic workflow developed here is general and will be applied in the future for the optimization of auxiliary basis sets to include exact exchange in relativistic approaches. The latter will be a crucial step for the accurate description of spectroscopic properties and spin dynamics in molecular systems containing heavy elements.

TI Ultrafast electro-optic time-frequency fractional Fourier imaging at the
   single-photon level
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB The Fractional Fourier Transform (FRT) corresponds to an arbitrary-angle rotation in the phase space, e.g., the time-frequency (TF) space, and generalizes the fundamentally important Fourier Transform. FRT applications range from classical signal processing (e.g., time-correlated noise optimal filtering) to emerging quantum technologies (e.g., super-resolution TF sensing) which rely on or benefit from coherent low-noise TF operations. Here a versatile low-noise single-photon-compatible implementation of the FRT is presented. Optical TF FRT can be synthesized as a series of a spectral disperser, a time-lens, and another spectral disperser. Relying on the state-of-the-art electro-optic modulators (EOM) for the time-lens, our method avoids added noise inherent to the alternatives based on non-linear optical interactions (such as wave-mixing, cross-phase modulation, or parametric processes). Precise control of the EOM-driving radio-frequency signal enables fast all-electronic control of the FRT angle. In the experiment, we demonstrate FRT angles of up to 1.63 rad for pairs of coherent temporally separated 11.5 ps-wide pulses in the near-infrared (800 nm). We observe a good agreement between the simulated and measured output spectra in the bright-light and single-photon-level regimes, and for a range of pulse separations (20 ps to 26.7 ps). Furthermore, a tradeoff is established between the maximal FRT angle and optical bandwidth, with the current setup accommodating up to 248 GHz of bandwidth. With the ongoing progress in EOM on-chip integration, we envisage excellent scalability and vast applications in all-optical TF processing both in the classical and quantum regimes.

TI Hybrid Graphene-Supported Aluminum Plasmonics
SO ACS NANO
AB Controlled fabrication of devices for plasmonics on suspended graphene enables obtaining tunable localized surface plasmon resonances (LSPRs), reducing the red-shift of LSPRs, and creating hybrid 3D-2D systems promising for adjustable dipole-dipole coupling and plasmon-mediated catalysis. Here, we apply a low-cost fabrication methodology to produce patterned aluminum nanostructures (bowties and tetramers) on graphene monolayers via electron-beam lithography and trap platinum (Pt) nanoclusters (NCs) within their hotspots by thermal annealing. We reveal the LSPRs of aluminum plasmonics on graphene using electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS) and energy-filtered transmission electron microscopy (EFTEM) in a monochromated scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM). The LSPRs of these nanostructures are measured to be between visible and ultraviolet regions of the spectrum and are confirmed by electromagnetic simulations. The antibonding dipole and bonding dipole modes of both structures are tuned by controlling their gap size. The tetramers enable the simultaneous excitation of both antibonding and bonding dipole modes at the poles of nanoprisms, while bowties allow us to excite these modes separately either at the poles or within the hotspot. We further show that the hybrid nanocavity-NC systems are in the intermediate coupling regime providing an enhanced plasmon absorption in the Pt NCs via the energy transfer from the antibonding dipole mode to the Pt NCs. The dipole LSPR of Pt NCs also couples to the bonding-type breathing mode in bowties. Our findings suggest that these hybrid nanocavity-graphene systems are of high application potential for plasmon-mediated catalysis, surface-enhanced fluorescence, and quantum technologies.

TI Optical Spin Angular Momentum: Properties, Topologies, Detection and
   Applications
SO NANOMATERIALS
AB Spin angular momentum is a fundamental dynamical property of elementary particles and fields, playing a critical role in light-matter interactions. In optical studies, the optical spin angular momentum is closely linked to circular polarization. Research on the interaction between optical spin and matter or structures has led to numerous novel optical phenomena and applications, giving rise to the emerging field of spin optics. Historically, researchers primarily focused on longitudinal optical spin aligned parallel to the mean wavevector. In recent years, investigations into the spin-orbit coupling properties of confined fields-such as focused beams, guided waves, and evanescent waves-have revealed a new class of optical spin oriented perpendicular to the mean wavevector, referred to as optical transverse spin. In the optical near-field, such transverse spins arise from spatial variations in the momentum density of confined electromagnetic waves, where strong coupling between spin and orbital angular momenta leads to various topological spin structures and properties. Several reviews on optical transverse spin have been published in recent years, systematically introducing its fundamental concepts and the configurations that generate it. In this review, we detail recent advances in spin optics from three perspectives: theory, experimental techniques, and applications, with a particular emphasis on the fundamental physics of transverse spin and the resulting topological structures and characteristics. The conceptual and theoretical framework of spin optics is expected to significantly support further exploration of optical spin-based applications in fields such as optics imaging, topological photonics, metrology, and quantum technologies. Furthermore, these principles can be extended to general classical wave systems, including fluidic, acoustic, and gravitational waves.

TI Influence of Different Hydrocarbons on Chemical Vapor Deposition Growth
   and Surface Morphological Defects in 4H-SiC Epitaxial Layers
SO PHYSICA STATUS SOLIDI B-BASIC SOLID STATE PHYSICS
AB Controlled epitaxial growth of 4H-SiC is essential for advancing both power electronics and quantum technologies. This study explores how different carbon sources-methane and propane-affect the surface morphology of these epitaxial layers. By varying C/Si ratios and using the two mentioned hydrocarbons as the carbon source in chloride-based epitaxial growth of 4H-SiC layers, it is unveiled that methane results in an exceptionally smooth surface. However, it pronounces surface irregularities such as short step bunching and dislocation-related etch pits. Moreover, methane amplifies the overgrowth of triangular defects with the 4H polytype. In contrast, the introduction of propane causes a step-bunched surface together with inclined line-like surface morphological defects. Notably, a majority of the triangular defects exhibit a pure 3C character without an overgrown 4H polytype. It is shown that these outcomes could be attributed to different sticking coefficients and diffusivity of the molecular species resulting from different carbon sources on the 4H-SiC surface during the epitaxial growth. This research also uncovers the underlying origins and mechanisms responsible for various surface morphological defects.
   The article uncovers the impact of choosing different hydrocarbons for the epitaxial growth of 4H-SiC by chloride-based chemical vapor deposition process. It reveals distinctive surface patterns and defects when either of the hydrocarbons is introduced as the carbon source and unravels the intricacies of surface structure, offering insights into customizing 4H-SiC surface for diverse applications.image (c) 2024 WILEY-VCH GmbH

TI Dielectric and Wavefunction Engineering of Electron Spin Lifetime in
   Colloidal Nanoplatelet Heterostructures
SO ADVANCED SCIENCE
AB Colloidal semiconductor nanoplatelets (NPLs) have emerged as low-cost and free-standing alternates of traditional quantum wells. The giant heavy- and light-hole splitting in NPLs allows for efficient optical spin injection. However, the electron spin lifetimes for prototypical CdSe NPLs are within a few picoseconds, likely limited by strong electron-hole exchange in these quantum- and dielectric-confined materials. Here how this hurdle can be overcome with engineered NPL-heterostructures is demonstrated. By constructing type-I CdSe/ZnS core/shell NPLs, dielectric screening inside the core is strongly enhanced, prolonging the electron spin polarization time (tau esp) to over 30 ps (or 60 ps electron spin-flip time). Alternatively, by growing type-II CdSe/CdTe core/crown NPLs to spatially separate electron and hole wavefunctions, the electron-hole exchange is strongly suppressed, resulting in tau esp as long as 300 ps at room temperature. This study not only exemplifies how the well-established synthetic chemistry of colloidal heterostructures can aid in spin dynamics control but also establishes the feasibility of room-temperature coherent spin manipulation in colloidal NPLs.
   Colloidal nanoplatelets are low-cost analogs of quantum wells holding promise for spin-based quantum technologies. The electron spin lifetimes for typical nanoplatelets are limited to a few picoseconds due to strong electron-hole exchange interaction. Here through constructing type-I CdSe/ZnS core/shell and type-II CdSe/CdTe core/crown nanoplatelets to suppress the exchange interaction, an electron spin lifetime as long as 300 picoseconds is achieved at room temperature.image

TI Perspective: Nanophotonic electro-optics enabling THz bandwidths,
   exceptional modulation and energy efficiencies, and compact device
   footprints
SO APL MATERIALS
AB The growth of integrated photonics has driven the need for efficient, high-bandwidth electrical-to-optical (EO) signal conversion over a broad range of frequencies (MHz-THz), together with efficient, high bandwidth photodetection. Efficient signal conversion is needed for applications including fiber/wireless telecom, data centers, sensing/imaging, metrology/spectroscopy, autonomous vehicle platforms, etc., as well as cryogenic supercomputing/quantum computing. Diverse applications require the ability to function over a wide range of environmental conditions (e.g., temperatures from 400 K). Active photonic device footprints are being scaled toward nanoscopic dimensions for size compatibility with electronic elements. Nanophotonic devices increase optical and RF field confinement via small feature sizes, increasing field intensities by many orders of magnitude, enabling high-performance Pockels effect materials to be ultimately utilized to their maximum potential (e.g., in-device voltage-length performance =0.005 V mm). Organic materials have recently exhibited significant improvements in performance driven by theory-guided design, with realized macroscopic electro-optic activity (r(33)) exceeding 1000 pm/V at telecom wavelengths. Hybrid organic/semiconductor nanophotonic integration has propelled the development of new organic synthesis, processing, and design methodologies to capture this high performance and has improved understanding of the spatial distribution of the order of poled materials under confinement and the effects of metal/semiconductor-organic interfaces on device performance. Covalent coupling, whether from in situ crosslinking or sequential synthesis, also provides a thermally and photochemically stable alternative to thermoplastic EO polymers. The alternative processing techniques will reduce the attenuation of r(33) values observed in silicon organic hybrid and plasmonic organic hybrid devices arising from chromophore-electrode electrostatic interactions and material conductance at poling temperatures. The focus of this perspective is on materials, with an emphasis on the need to consider the interrelationship between hybrid device architectures and materials.

TI Efficient Quantum State Preparation for the Cauchy Distribution Based on
   Piecewise Arithmetic
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM ENGINEERING
AB The benefits of the quantum Monte Carlo algorithm heavily rely on the efficiency of the superposition state preparation. So far, most reported Monte Carlo algorithms use the Grover-Rudolph state preparation method, which is suitable for efficiently integrable distribution functions. Consequently, most reported works are based on log-concave distributions, such as normal distributions. However, non-log-concave distributions still have many uses, such as in financial modeling. Recently, a new method was proposed that does not need integration to calculate the rotation angle for state preparation. However, performing efficient state preparation is still difficult due to the high cost associated with high precision and low error in the calculation for the rotation angle. Many methods of quantum state preparation use polynomial Taylor approximations to reduce the computation cost. However, Taylor approximations do not work well with heavy-tailed distribution functions that are not bounded exponentially. In this article, we present a method of efficient state preparation for heavy-tailed distribution functions. Specifically, we present a quantum gate-level algorithm to prepare quantum superposition states based on the Cauchy distribution, which is a non-log-concave heavy-tailed distribution. Our procedure relies on a piecewise polynomial function instead of a single Taylor approximation to reduce computational cost and increase accuracy. The Cauchy distribution is an even function, so the proposed piecewise polynomial contains only a quadratic term and a constant term to maintain the simplest approximation of an even function. Numerical analysis shows that the required number of subdomains increases linearly as the approximation error decreases exponentially. Furthermore, the computation complexity of the proposed algorithm is independent of the number of subdomains in the quantum implementation of the piecewise function due to quantum parallelism. An example of the proposed algorithm based on a simulation conducted in Qiskit is presented to demonstrate its capability to perform state preparation based on the Cauchy distribution.

SO EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL PLUS
AB We have theoretically investigated an optomechanical system and presented the scenario of significantly enhanced bipartite photon-phonon entanglement for two qubits coupled to the single mode of the cavity. The results are compared with the one qubit case for reference. The tripartite atom-photon-phonon interaction is considered as only three-body resonant interaction, while the two-body actions are ignored under some potential approximations. Furthermore, we have studied the phenomenon of hyperradiance in which the well-known Dicke superradiant (N2\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$N<^>2$$\end{document} scaling law) can be surpassed due to the inter-atomic correlations. Jointly, a parameter regime is explored to observe the entanglement of photon-phonon pairs and their hyperradiance simultaneously. As it is important to show that the generation of photons and phonons is antibunched, the equal time second-order correlation function g(2)(0)\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$g<^>{(2)}(0)$$\end{document} is characterized as witness. This system can be realized in Circuit Cavity Quantum Electrodynamics (CCQED) in which the direct coupling of the atom and mechanical resonator is possible.

TI Shared permutation for syndrome decoding: new zero-knowledge protocol
   and code-based signature
SO DESIGNS CODES AND CRYPTOGRAPHY
AB The threat of a coming quantum computer motivates the research for new zero-knowledge proof techniques for (or based on) post-quantum cryptographic problems. One of the few directions is code-based cryptography for which the strongest problem is the syndrome decoding (SD) of random linear codes. This problem is known to be NP-hard and the cryptanalysis state of affairs has been stable for many years. A zero-knowledge protocol for this problem was pioneered by Stern in 1993. As a simple public-coin three-round protocol, it can be converted to a post-quantum signature scheme through the famous Fiat-Shamir transform. The main drawback of this protocol is its high soundness error of 2/3, meaning that it should be repeated approximate to 1.7 lambda times to reach a lambda-bit security. In this paper, we improve this three- decade-old state of affairs by introducing a new zero-knowledge proof for the syndrome decoding problem on random linear codes. Our protocol achieves a soundness error of 1/n for an arbitrary n in complexity O(n). Our construction requires the verifier to trust some of the variables sent by the prover which can be ensured through a cut-and-choose approach. We provide an optimized version of our zero-knowledge protocol which achieves arbitrary soundness through parallel repetitions and merged cut-and-choose phase. While turning this protocol into a signature scheme, we achieve a signature size of 17 KB for a 128-bit security. This represents a significant improvement over previous constructions based on the syndrome decoding problem for random linear codes.

AB Zero-knowledge proofs of knowledge are useful tools to design signature schemes. The ongoing effort to build a quantum computer urges the cryptography community to develop new secure cryptographic protocols based on quantum-hard cryptographic problems. One of the few directions is code-based cryptography for which the strongest problem is the syndrome decoding (SD) for random linear codes. This problem is known to be NP-hard and the crypt analysis state of the art has been stable for many years. A zero-knowledge protocol for this problem was pioneered by Stern in 1993. Since its publication, many articles proposed optimizations, implementation, or variants.
   In this paper, we introduce a new zero-knowledge proof for the syndrome decoding problem on random linear codes. Instead of using permutations like most of the existing protocols, we rely on the MPC-in-the-head paradigm in which we reduce the task of proving the low Hamming weight of the SD solution to proving some relations between specific polynomials. Specifically, we propose a 5-round zero-knowledge protocol that proves the knowledge of a vector x such that y = Hx and wt(x) <= w and which achieves a soundness error closed to 1/N for an arbitrary N.
   While turning this protocol into a signature scheme, we achieve a signature size of 11-12 KB for 128-bit security when relying on the hardness of the SD problem on binary fields. Using larger fields (like F(2)s), we can produce fast signatures of around 8 KB. This allows us to outperform Picnic3 and to be competitive with SPHINCS+ , both post-quantum signature candidates in the ongoing NIST standardization effort. Moreover, our scheme outperforms all the existing code-based signature schemes for the common "signature size + public key size" metric.

TI Transactional Interpretation for the Principle of Minimum Fisher
   Information
SO ENTROPY
AB The principle of minimum Fisher information states that in the set of acceptable probability distributions characterizing the given system, it is best done by the one that minimizes the corresponding Fisher information. This principle can be applied to transaction processes, the dynamics of which can be interpreted as the market tendency to minimize the information revealed about itself. More information involves higher costs (information is physical). The starting point for our considerations is a description of the market derived from the assumption of minimum Fisher information for a strategy with a fixed financial risk. Strategies of this type that minimize Fisher information overlap with the well-known eigenstates of a the quantum harmonic oscillator. The analytical extension of this field of strategy to the complex vector space (traditional for quantum mechanics) suggests the study of the interference of the oscillator eigenstates in terms of their minimization of Fisher information. It is revealed that the minimum value of Fisher information of the superposition of the two strategies being the ground state and the second excited state of the oscillator, has Fisher information less than the ground state of the oscillator. Similarly, less information is obtained for the system of strategies (the oscillator eigenstates) randomized by the Gibbs distribution. We distinguish two different views on the description of Fisher information. One of them, the classical, is based on the value of Fisher information. The second, we call it transactional, expresses Fisher information from the perspective of the constant risk of market strategies. The orders of the market strategies derived from these two descriptions are different. From a market standpoint, minimizing Fisher information is equivalent to minimizing risk.

For example, devices such as atomic clocks and magnetometers are essential for precision time-keeping, navigation, and sensing. However, many of these demonstrations remain confined to laboratory settings due to their reliance on bulky equipment and centimeter-scale atomic vapor cells. In recent years, significant efforts have been made to miniaturize these vapor cells to enable field-deployable systems. Yet, integrating these cells with the necessary photonic components remains a complex and non-scalable process. To address this challenge, we have introduced the atomic-cladded waveguide (ACWG) architecture, which enables the integration of atomic and photonic functions on the same chip. While the ACWG concept provides a significant step forward toward integration, there is still a significant gap related to wafer scale manufacturability. In particular, previous demonstrations of atomic-photonic integration have relied on manual assembly of vapor cells onto single chips, restricting miniaturization, manufacturability, and thermal robustness. To revolutionize manufacturability of these devices, we hereby demonstrate our new generation of ACWG devices that overcomes these constraints. The approach is based on wafer bonding of a silicon wafer - consisting of multiple photonic chips to a glass wafer with pre-etched atomic chambers. This wafer-scale process yields multiple miniaturized integrated photonic-atomic chips in a single batch. The bonded devices operate reliably at elevated temperatures over an extended period of time, allowing higher atomic densities to be used. The fabrication method consists of well-defined, repeatable steps, paving the way for scalable production of mature integrated photonic-atomic systems for next-generation sensing, metrology, and quantum technologies, inspired by commercial complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor-based processes.

TI Mode manipulation in a ring-core fiber for OAM monitoring and conversion
SO NANOPHOTONICS
AB The monitoring and conversion of photonic orbital angular momentum (OAM) play fundamental and important roles for both classic and quantum technologies, especially in low-loss transmission media such as ring-core fibers (RCFs), which make many OAM applications practical or vastly more flexible. However, in a RCF, the modes associated with different OAM states are highly overlapping due to the circular refractive index distribution structure, which makes it difficult to distinguish and monitor the OAM modes and in turn limits its inline conversion. Here, we report the first experimental realization of mode monitoring in a RCF using mode filters (MFs), which takes advantage of the difference in the mode adiabatic evolution and the higher-order mode cutoff conditions in tapered RCFs. Different-order OAM can be filtered using MFs with different geometric parameters, as demonstrated by the linearly polarized mode intensity. Combined the mode manipulations in RCF and single-mode fiber, the fundamental mode coupling efficiency can reach 90%, the RCF mode conversion monitoring through inline transmission spectrum evolution can be realized, and the inline fabrication of RCF grating, which couples one mode to a desired mode, can be demonstrated by the fabricating process of three long-period fiber gratings. The mode conversion efficiency between 0-order and 1, 2- or 3-order OAM modes exceeds 96%. Our work provides an efficient approach to monitor and convert OAM modes in higher-order mode supporting RCFs and even other special fibers and further promotes the improvement of the capacity of OAM transmission in RCFs.

TI Driving a low critical current Josephson junction array with a
   mode-locked laser
SO APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS
AB We report proof-of-concept experiments on an optically driven Josephson voltage standard based on a mode-locked laser (MLL), a time-division multiplexer, and a cryogenic ultrafast photodiode driving an overdamped Josephson junction array (JJA). Our optical pulse pattern generator (PPG) concept builds on the capability of MLLs to produce trains of picosecond-wide optical pulses with little amplitude and temporal spread. Our present setup enables multiplication of the original 2.3GHz pulse repetition frequency by a factor of 8. A commercial photodiode converts the optical pulses into about 25 ps wide electrical pulses in liquid helium several cm from the JJA. Using a custom-made MLL, we can drive a JJA with a low critical current of 360 mu A at multiple Shapiro steps. We have performed experiments with pulse pairs whose time interval can be set freely without distorting the shapes of individual pulses. Experimental results are in qualitative agreement with theoretical simulations, and they demonstrate, e.g., crossover in the Shapiro step pattern when the time interval between the pulses is approximately equal to the inverse of the characteristic frequency of the JJA. However, there are quantitative discrepancies, which motivate an improved integration of photodiodes and JJAs to improve both the understanding and fidelity of Josephson Arbitrary Waveform Synthesizers. Considering future quantum technologies in a wider perspective, our optical approach is a potential enabler for fast and energy-efficient pulse drive without an expensive high-bandwidth electrical PPG and without high-bandwidth electrical cables that yield too high thermal conductance between cryogenic and room temperatures.

TI Automated detection of symmetry-protected subspaces in quantum
   simulations
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB The analysis of symmetry in quantum systems is of utmost theoretical importance, useful in a variety of applications and experimental settings, and difficult to accomplish in general. Symmetries imply conservation laws, which partition Hilbert space into invariant subspaces of the time-evolution operator, each of which is demarcated according to its conserved quantity. We show that, starting from a chosen basis, any invariant, symmetry-protected subspaces which are diagonal in that basis are discoverable using transitive closure on graphs representing state-to-state transitions under k-local unitary operations. Importantly, the discovery of these subspaces relies neither upon the explicit identification of a symmetry operator or its eigenvalues nor upon the construction of matrices of the full Hilbert space dimension. We introduce two classical algorithms, which efficiently compute and elucidate features of these subspaces. The first algorithm explores the entire symmetry-protected subspace of an initial state in time complexity linear to the size of the subspace by closing local basis state-to-basis state transitions. The second algorithm determines, with bounded error, if a given measurement outcome of a dynamically generated state is within the symmetry-protected subspace of the state in which the dynamical system is initialized. We demonstrate the applicability of these algorithms by performing postselection on data generated from emulated noisy quantum simulations of three different dynamical systems: the Heisenberg-XXX model and the T6 and F4 quantum cellular automata. Due to their efficient computability and indifference to identifying the underlying symmetry, these algorithms lend themselves to the postselection of quantum computer data, optimized classical simulation of quantum systems, and discovery of previously hidden symmetries in quantum mechanical systems.

TI Skeleton of matrix-product-state-solvable models connecting topological
   phases of matter
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Models whose ground states can be written as an exact matrix-product state (MPS) provide valuable insights into phases of matter. While MPS-solvable models are typically studied as isolated points in a phase diagram, they can belong to a connected network of MPS-solvable models, which we call the MPS skeleton. As a case study where we can completely unearth this skeleton, we focus on the one-dimensional BDI class-noninteracting spinless fermions with time-reversal symmetry. This class, labeled by a topological winding number, contains the Kitaev chain and is Jordan-Wigner-dual to various symmetry-breaking and symmetry-protected topological (SPT) spin chains. We show that one can read off from the Hamiltonian whether its ground state is an MPS: defining a polynomial whose coefficients are the Hamiltonian parameters, MPS-solvability corresponds to this polynomial being a perfect square. We provide an explicit construction of the ground state MPS, its bond dimension growing exponentially with the range of the Hamiltonian. This complete characterization of the MPS skeleton in parameter space has three significant consequences: (i) any two topologically distinct phases in this class admit a path of MPS-solvable models between them, including the phase transition which obeys an area law for its entanglement entropy; (ii) we illustrate that the subset of MPS-solvable models is dense in this class by constructing a sequence of MPS-solvable models which converge to the Kitaev chain (equivalently, the quantum Ising chain in a transverse field); (iii) a subset of these MPS states can be particularly efficiently processed on a noisy intermediate-scale quantum computer.

TI Features of quantum thermodynamics induced by common environments based
   on collision model
SO EPJ QUANTUM TECHNOLOGY
AB The common reservoir can cause some unique effects, such as dark state and steady-state coherence, which are extensively studied in the dynamics of open quantum system. In this work, by means of collision model, we explore features of quantum thermodynamics induced by common reservoirs. We first construct general formulations of thermodynamic quantities for the system consisting of N coupling subsystems embedded in M common thermal reservoirs. We confirm the existence of nonlocal work due to simultaneous interactions of subsystems with the common reservoirs resembling what is found for nonlocal heat. With a system of two coupled qubits in a common reservoir, we show that steady-state currents could emerge even when interactions of individual subsystems and the reservoir fulfill strict energy conservation. We also exhibit the effect of dark state on the steady-state currents. We then examine relations between the work cost, the system's nonequilibrium steady-state and the extractable work. In particular, we find that in the presence of dark state, the work cost is only related to the coherence generated in the dynamical evolution but not to the one contributed by the initial dark state of the system. We also show the possible transformation of coherence into useful work in terms of ergotropy. We finally examine the scale effect of reservoirs and show that the increase of the number of involved reservoirs need more work to be costed and meanwhile can produce more coherence so that more ergotropy can be extracted. The obtained features contribute to the understanding of thermodynamics in common reservoirs and would be useful in quantum technologies when common reservoirs are necessary.

TI Quantum embedding methods for correlated excited states of point
   defects: Case studies and challenges
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB A quantitative description of the excited electronic states of point defects and impurities is crucial for understanding materials properties, and possible applications of defects in quantum technologies. This is a considerable challenge for computational methods, since Kohn-Sham density functional theory (DFT) is inherently a ground-state theory, while higher-level methods are often too computationally expensive for defect systems. Recently, embedding approaches have been applied that treat defect states with many-body methods, while using DFT to describe the bulk host material. We implement such an embedding method, based on Wannierization of defect orbitals and the constrained random-phase approximation approach, and perform systematic characterization of the method for three distinct systems with current technological relevance: a carbon dimer replacing a B and N pair in bulk hexagonal BN (CBCN), the negatively charged nitrogen-vacancy center in diamond (NV???), and an Fe impurity on the Al site in wurtzite AlN (FeAl). In the context of these test-case defects, we demonstrate that crucial considerations of the methodology include convergence of the bulk screening of the active-space Coulomb interaction, the choice of exchange-correlation functional for the initial DFT calculation, and the treatment of the ???double-counting??? correction. For CBCN we show that the embedding approach gives many-body states in agreement with analytical results on the Hubbard dimer model, which allows us to elucidate the effects of the DFT functional and double-counting correction. For the NV??? center, our method demonstrates good quantitative agreement with experiments for the zero-phonon line of the triplet-triplet transition. Finally, we illustrate challenges associated with this method for determining the energies and orderings of the complex spin multiplets in FeAl.

TI Creation of Negatively Charged Boron Vacancies in Hexagonal Boron
   Nitride Crystal by Electron Irradiation and Mechanism of Inhomogeneous
   Broadening of Boron Vacancy-Related Spin Resonance Lines
SO NANOMATERIALS
AB Optically addressable high-spin states (S >= 1) of defects in semiconductors are the basis for the development of solid-state quantum technologies. Recently, one such defect has been found in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) and identified as a negatively charged boron vacancy (VB-). To explore and utilize the properties of this defect, one needs to design a robust way for its creation in an hBN crystal. We investigate the possibility of creating VB- centers in an hBN single crystal by means of irradiation with a high-energy (E = 2 MeV) electron flux. Optical excitation of the irradiated sample induces fluorescence in the near-infrared range together with the electron spin resonance (ESR) spectrum of the triplet centers with a zero-field splitting value of D = 3.6 GHz, manifesting an optically induced population inversion of the ground state spin sublevels. These observations are the signatures of the VB- centers and demonstrate that electron irradiation can be reliably used to create these centers in hBN. Exploration of the VB- spin resonance line shape allowed us to establish the source of the line broadening, which occurs due to the slight deviation in orientation of the two-dimensional B-N atomic plains being exactly parallel relative to each other. The results of the analysis of the broadening mechanism can be used for the crystalline quality control of the 2D materials, using the VB- spin embedded in the hBN as a probe.

TI Selective area epitaxy of in-plane HgTe nanostructures on CdTe(001)
   substrate
SO NANOTECHNOLOGY
AB Semiconductor nanowires (NWs) are believed to play a crucial role for future applications in electronics, spintronics and quantum technologies. A potential candidate is HgTe but its sensitivity to nanofabrication processes restrain its development. A way to circumvent this obstacle is the selective area growth technique. Here, in-plane HgTe nanostructures are grown thanks to selective area molecular beam epitaxy on a semi-insulating CdTe substrate covered with a patterned SiO2 mask. The shape of these nanostructures is defined by the in-plane orientation of the mask aperture along the <110>, <1 1<overline>0>, or <100> direction, the deposited thickness, and the growth temperature (GT). Several micron long in-plane NWs can be achieved as well as more complex nanostructures such as networks, diamond structures or rings. A good selectivity is achieved with very little parasitic growth on the mask even for a GT as low as 140 degrees C and growth rate up to 0.5 monolayer per second. For <110> oriented NWs, the center of the nanostructure exhibits a trapezoidal shape with {111}B facets and two grains on the sides, while <1 1<overline>0> oriented NWs show {111}A facets with adatoms accumulation on the sides of the top surface. Transmission electron microscopy observations reveal a continuous epitaxial relation between the CdTe substrate and the HgTe NW. Measurements of the resistance with four-point scanning tunneling microscopy indicates a good electrical homogeneity along the main NW axis and a thermally activated transport. This growth method paves the way toward the fabrication of complex HgTe-based nanostructures for electronic transport measurements.

TI Optical Quality of InAs/InP Quantum Dots on Distributed Bragg Reflector
   Emitting at 3rd Telecom Window Grown by Molecular Beam Epitaxy
SO MATERIALS
AB We present an experimental study on the optical quality of InAs/InP quantum dots (QDs). Investigated structures have application relevance due to emission in the 3rd telecommunication window. The nanostructures are grown by ripening-assisted molecular beam epitaxy. This leads to their unique properties, i.e., low spatial density and in-plane shape symmetry. These are advantageous for non-classical light generation for quantum technologies applications. As a measure of the internal quantum efficiency, the discrepancy between calculated and experimentally determined photon extraction efficiency is used. The investigated nanostructures exhibit close to ideal emission efficiency proving their high structural quality. The thermal stability of emission is investigated by means of microphotoluminescence. This allows to determine the maximal operation temperature of the device and reveal the main emission quenching channels. Emission quenching is predominantly caused by the transition of holes and electrons to higher QD's levels. Additionally, these carriers could further leave the confinement potential via the dense ladder of QD states. Single QD emission is observed up to temperatures of about 100 K, comparable to the best results obtained for epitaxial QDs in this spectral range. The fundamental limit for the emission rate is the excitation radiative lifetime, which spreads from below 0.5 to almost 1.9 ns (GHz operation) without any clear spectral dispersion. Furthermore, carrier dynamics is also determined using time-correlated single-photon counting.

AB Even though sunlight is by far the most abundant renewable energy source available to humanity, its dilute and variable nature has kept efficient ways to collect, store, and distribute this energy tantalisingly out of reach. Turning the incoherent energy supply provided by the Sun into a coherent laser beam would overcome several of the practical limitations inherent in using sunlight as a source of clean energy: laser beams travel nearly losslessly over large distances, and they are effective at driving chemical reactions which convert sunlight into chemical energy. Here we propose a bio-inspired blueprint for a novel type of laser with the aim of upgrading unconcentrated natural sunlight into a coherent laser beam. Our proposed design constitutes a novel and different path towards sunlight-pumped lasers. In order to achieve lasing with the extremely dilute power provided by natural sunlight, we here propose a laser medium comprised of molecular aggregates inspired by the architecture of natural photosynthetic complexes. Such complexes exhibit a very large internal efficiency in harvesting photons from a power source as dilute as natural sunlight. Specifically, we consider a hybrid structure, where photosynthetic complexes in purple bacteria (Rhodobacter sphaeroides) surround a suitably engineered molecular dimer composed of two strongly coupled chromophores. We show that if pumped by the surrounding photosynthetic complex, which efficiently collects and concentrates solar energy, the core dimer structure can reach population inversion, and reach the lasing threshold under natural sunlight. The design principles proposed here will also pave the way for developing other bio-inspired quantum devices.

TI Chirped Pulses Meet Quantum Dots: Innovations, Challenges, and Future
   Perspectives
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB Shaped laser pulses have been remarkably effective in investigating various aspects of light-matter interactions spanning a broad range of research. Chirped laser pulses exhibiting a time-varying frequency, or quadratic spectral phase, form a crucial category in the group of shaped laser pulses. This type of pulses have made a ubiquitous presence from spectroscopic applications to developments in high-power laser technology, and from nanophotonics to quantum optical communication, ever since their introduction. In the case of quantum technologies recently, substantial efforts are being invested toward achieving a truly scalable architecture. Concurrently, it is important to develop methods to produce robust photon sources. In this context, semiconductor quantum dots hold great potential, due to their exceptional photophysical properties and on-demand operating nature. Concerning the scalability aspect of semiconductor quantum dots, it is advantageous to develop a simple, yet robust method to generate photon states from it. Chirped pulse excitation has been widely demonstrated as a robust and efficient state preparation scheme in quantum dots, thereby boosting its applicability as a stable photon source in a real-world scenario. Despite the rapid growth and advancements in laser technologies, the generation and control of chirped laser pulses can be demanding. Here, an overview of a selected few approaches is presented to tailor and characterize chirped pulses for the efficient excitation of a quantum dot source. By taking the chirped-pulse-induced adiabatic rapid passage process in quantum dot as an example, numerical design examples are presented along with experimental advantages and challenges in each method and conclude with an outlook on future perspectives.

TI Thermally Driven Formation of Multiphase, Mixed-Dimensional
   Architectures from TaSe3 Nanoribbons
SO ACS NANO
AB Tantalum-selenium compounds, particularly TaSe2 and TaSe3, are promising materials for electronics and quantum technologies due to their charge density wave and topological properties, and they are also candidates for energy storage and electrocatalysis applications. In this study, we investigate the thermally driven structural evolution of TaSe3 nanoribbons using in situ scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM). Low-kV STEM experiments reveal a complex nanoscale transformation pathway in which TaSe3 nanoribbons convert into multiphase, mixed-dimensional (0D-1D) tantalum-selenium architectures. Aberration-corrected STEM enables direct visualization of the underlying atomic rearrangements, while electron energy loss spectroscopy and DFT calculations corroborate the identity and stability of the product phases. Our results uncover a detailed mechanism: selenium loss from TaSe3 nanoribbons initiates surface conversion to TaSe2, which, as temperature increases, progressively continues into the nanoribbon interior. Thicker regions of TaSe2 delaminate and detach from the core material, forming a porous TaSe2 shell. At 1200 degrees C, the core restructures into discrete similar to 20 nm Ta-self-intercalated TaSe2 nanoparticles. This core-shell transformation, driven by nanoscale confinement effects, differs markedly from the bulk decomposition pathway of TaSe3 and highlights the impact of modulating selenium loss, tantalum intercalation, and the stability of intermediate structures through confinement effects. The resulting 0D-1D heterostructure of Ta-rich nanoparticles encapsulated within porous TaSe2 tubes represents surprising and emergent complexity in a binary system. These mechanistic insights demonstrate how the controlled thermolysis of a readily accessible metal trichalcogenide precursor can yield complex, low-dimensional chalcogenide architectures.

TI Engineering Clock Transitions in Molecular Lanthanide Complexes
SO JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY
AB Molecular lanthanide (Ln) complexes are promising candidates for the development of next-generation quantum technologies. High-symmetry structures incorporating integer spin Ln ions can give rise to well-isolated crystal field quasi-doublet ground states, i.e., quantum two-level systems that may serve as the basis for magnetic qubits. Recent work has shown that symmetry lowering of the coordination environment around the Ln ion can produce an avoided crossing or clock transition within the ground doublet, leading to significantly enhanced coherence. Here, we employ single-crystal high-frequency electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy and high-level ab initio calculations to carry out a detailed investigation of the nine-coordinate complexes, [(HoL1L2)-L-III], where L-1 = 1,4,7,10-tetrakis(2-pyridylmethyl)-1,4,7,10-tetraaza-cyclododecane and L-2 = F- (1) or [MeCN](0) (2). The pseudo-4-fold symmetry imposed by the neutral organic ligand scaffold (L-1) and the apical anionic fluoride ion generates a strong axial anisotropy with an m(J) = +/- 8 ground-state quasi-doublet in 1, where m J denotes the projection of the J = 8 spin-orbital moment onto the similar to C-4 axis. Meanwhile, off-diagonal crystal field interactions give rise to a giant 116.4 +/- 1.0 GHz clock transition within this doublet. We then demonstrate targeted crystal field engineering of the clock transition by replacing F- with neutral MeCN (2), resulting in an increase in the clock transition frequency by a factor of 2.2. The experimental results are in broad agreement with quantum chemical calculations. This tunability is highly desirable because decoherence caused by second-order sensitivity to magnetic noise scales inversely with the clock transition frequency.

TI Double-coupled slotted photonic crystal slab cavities through a
   high-frequency mechanical oscillator
SO OPTICAL MATERIALS EXPRESS
AB Scalability is a critical research direction at the current stage of optomechanics for on-chip-integrated telecommunications and fundamental research, such as topological physics. Achieving scalability requires the coupling of multiple cavities via mechanical oscillators or the coupling of multiple oscillators via optical cavities. The optomechanical system proposed in this paper consists of two slotted silicon photonic crystal (PhC) slab cavities, where the optical barrier between the two cavities acts as a silicon mechanical oscillator, facilitating their coupling. This is the first two-dimensional (slab) PhC configuration featuring distant cavities coupled via a high-frequency (up to gigahertz) mechanical oscillator. This system offers two advantages over previous localized multimode optomechanical cavities. First, it allows for the independent design of the two cavities at desired resonance wavelengths. Second, the optical signals from the two cavities are coupled to different optical channels, simplifying post-processing tasks such as filtering or demultiplexing in photonic integrated circuits. Moreover, the slab optomechanical configuration could serve as a potential silicon alternative to compound-semiconductor slab optical switches and memories. Our numerical investigation shows that both cavities can be designed with ultrahigh quality factors and that the swing and breathing mechanical resonance modes exhibit the strongest optomechanical coupling strength. Notably, as far as we know, this is the first demonstration of an optomechanical breathing mode in 2D PhC structures, with a frequency reaching up to one gigahertz. Finally, we discuss two potential applications for this system: a pseudo-all-optical switch/modulator and resolved sideband operation. These analyses demonstrate that the proposed system holds significant promise for meeting the stringent requirements of various applications in photonic integrated circuits and photonic quantum technologies.

TI US-JAPAN ECONOMIC COOPERATION UNDER THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION
SO MIROVAYA EKONOMIKA I MEZHDUNARODNYE OTNOSHENIYA
AB Since the post-war period, the development of US-Japan relations has been determined by security cooperation and economic integration. As economic integration evolved, the United States and Japan became closely linked through the flow of goods and services, the movement of capital, and the joint implementation of R&D. The US-Japan alliance is becoming more and more necessary for the United States in the context of strategic rivalry with China. Cooperation with Japan in the field of reinforcing and diversifying the GVCs important for ensuring US national security, as well as in the development of the most promising new technologies and the production of innovative knowledge-intensive products, is one of the top priorities for the Biden administration. Sectors that are considered strategic include the semiconductors industry, EV supply chains, certain categories of minerals and digital economy. Export control is another important part of the US economic security policy where the Biden administration gained partial Japan's support. The administration has been implementing strict export controls on "unfriendly countries" and at the same time creating a "tech alliance" with partners. Cooperation with Japan will play an important role in pursuing both goals. Digital transformation should help revitalize economic growth in the United States and in Japan, boost productivity and create new business opportunities. The importance of US-Japan cooperation within the framework of the "tech alliance" will increase. The main areas of bilateral cooperation will be R&D (including such areas as artificial intelligence and quantum technologies), IT infrastructure development, training of skilled workers and creating a joint start-up ecosystem as a pillar of innovation, as well as encouraging the private sector to introduce advanced technologies.

TI Spontaneous Room-Temperature Solid-State Reaction at the
   MoS2/Ti Interface: Implications for Contact Engineering
SO ACS APPLIED NANO MATERIALS
AB High-quality interfaces with metals are essential for exploiting two-dimensional materials in nanoscale solid-state devices. Conventional strategies rely on depositing metals with a suitable work function at low kinetic energies to minimize damage. Direct exfoliation of layered materials onto clean metal surfaces under ultrahigh vacuum offers a promising alternative, producing pristine, oxide-free interfaces while avoiding the disorder induced by high-energy metal deposition. TMDCs possess unique properties, including a direct band gap, high carrier mobility, and strong spin-orbit coupling, which makes them highly promising for high-performance electronic and optoelectronic devices such as transistors, photodetectors, and solar cells, as well as for emerging quantum technologies. While the metal-assisted exfoliation is well established for gold and other noble metals, its applicability to more reactive metals remains unclear. To address this question, we exfoliate large-area MoS2 layers on titanium under ultrahigh vacuum and characterize the resulting heterostructures using X-ray photoelectron and Raman spectroscopy. The monolayer yield is over 75%, but in contrast to noble metals, Ti reacts with exfoliated MoS2 at room temperature, producing metallic molybdenum and various sulfur species upon simple physical contact, and only similar to 6% of MoS2 remains in its pristine form. The degradation also propagates to the second MoS2 layer in the bilayer case. In trilayer MoS2, the degradation and subsequent oxidation upon air exposure are significantly reduced, and the top layer remains intact and partially protects the interface. These findings likely apply to other material combinations and suggest opportunities for engineering low-resistance contacts, particularly with reactive and high-melting-point metals.

TI Buried-stressor technology for the epitaxial growth and device
   integration of site-controlled quantum dots
SO MATERIALS FOR QUANTUM TECHNOLOGY
AB Semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) are high-quality nanocrystals that provide three-dimensional carrier confinement on the scale of the de Broglie wavelength. This makes them ideal candidates as light emitters, especially in the emerging field of photonic quantum technologies, where they can act as quantum light sources. However, their self-assembled epitaxial growth leads to randomness in position and emission wavelength, which hinders their scalable integration into photonic quantum devices. This review summarizes and highlights advances in the site-controlled growth of high-quality epitaxial QDs, with a particular focus on the buried stressor concept. Compared to other QD positioning techniques based for instance on nanohole arrays, nanowire arrays, and arrays of inverted pyramids as dot nucleation centers, the buried stressor growth method is distinguished by its ability to achieve not only spatial accuracy and precision, but also control of the local QD density in combination in an industry-compatible process flow. Therefore, the buried stressor growth technique is highly suitable for the development of both QD-based quantum light sources and microlasers. The buried stressor site-controlled QD growth technique involves the sub-surface embedding of a nano-engineered stressor material, which generates localized strain fields at the growth surface that control the nucleation of QDs. We provide an in-depth review of the underlying mechanisms and technological implementations, and discuss the differences and comparative advantages of the buried stressor method over other techniques for site-controlled growth of QDs. We also address persistent challenges, such as scalability and integration with existing semiconductor technologies, and outline potential future research directions.

TI Covalency versus magnetic axiality in Nd molecular magnets:
   Nd-photoluminescence, strong ligand-field, and unprecedented
   nephelauxetic effect in fullerenes NdM2N@C80 (M =
   Sc, Lu, Y)
SO CHEMICAL SCIENCE
AB Nd-based nitride clusterfullerenes NdM2N@C-80 with rare-earth metals of different sizes (M = Sc, Y, Lu) were synthesized to elucidate the influence of the cluster composition, shape and internal strain on the structural and magnetic properties. Single crystal X-ray diffraction revealed a very short Nd-N bond length in NdSc2N@C-80. For Lu and Y analogs, the further shortening of the Nd-N bond and pyramidalization of the NdM2N cluster are predicted by DFT calculations as a result of the increased cluster size and a strain caused by the limited size of the fullerene cage. The short distance between Nd and nitride ions leads to a very large ligand-field splitting of Nd3+ of 1100-1200 cm(-1), while the variation of the NdM2N cluster composition and concomitant internal strain results in the noticeable modulation of the splitting, which could be directly assessed from the well-resolved fine structure in the Nd-based photoluminescence spectra of NdM2N@C-80 clusterfullerenes. Photoluminescence measurements also revealed an unprecedentedly strong nephelauxetic effect, pointing to a high degree of covalency. The latter appears detrimental to the magnetic axiality despite the strong ligand field. As a result, the ground magnetic state has considerable transversal components of the pseudospin g-tensor, and the slow magnetic relaxation of NdSc2N@C-80 could be observed by AC magnetometry only in the presence of a magnetic field. A combination of the well-resolved magneto-optical states and slow relaxation of magnetization suggests that Nd clusterfullerenes can be useful building blocks for magneto-photonic quantum technologies.

TI Characterization of WSe2 Films Using Reflection Kikuchi
   Diffraction in the Scanning Electron Microscope and Multivariate
   Statistical Analyses
SO ACS NANO
AB The study of thin films and two-dimensional (2D) materials, including transition metal dichalcogenides such as WSe2 offers opportunities to leverage their properties in advanced sensors, quantum technologies, and devices to optimize functional performance. In this work, we characterize thin WSe2 samples with variable thicknesses using scanning electron microscope (SEM)-based techniques focused on analysis of the backscattered electron signal and Kikuchi diffraction patterns. These data were collected via a pixelated electron-counting direct electron detector positioned below the pole piece primarily configured for reflection Kikuchi diffraction (RKD), and a similar detector placed in the more conventional electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) geometry. In addition to conventional pattern analysis for orientation microscopy, multivariate statistical methods (MSA) based on principal component analysis were applied to analyze diffraction patterns and differentiate thickness variations and crystal orientations within the thin films through data clustering. These results were compared with atomic force microscopy to validate thickness measurements. Our findings indicate that RKD combined with MSA is highly effective for characterizing 2D materials, enabling simultaneous assessment of thickness and crystallographic orientation. Systematic acceleration voltage variations in RKD experiments and comparisons with EBSD data suggest that the thickness dependency arises from inelastic scattering of diffracted electrons, which affects pattern contrast in the thin-film regime. Collection and analysis of patterns obtained from monolayer, bilayer, and trilayer of WSe2 are also demonstrated. This work reinforces the utility of SEM-based techniques, such as RKD, as valuable tools for the materials characterization toolkit, particularly for thin films and 2D materials.

TI Nanoscale Band Gap Modulation and Dual Moire Superlattices of Hexagonal
   Boron Nitride Weakly Coupled to Graphite
SO ACS NANO
AB Van der Waals (vdW) materials, such as hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN), are highly promising for applications in optoelectronics and quantum technologies. When assembled into heterostructures, h-BN can form moire superlattices, enabling the engineering of electronic and optical properties by varying the interlayer twist angle. However, understanding the nanoscale interplay between moire patterns and electronic properties such as the band gap or work function, particularly in optically active h-BN structures, remains a challenge. Here, we use the atomic-scale precision of scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) to uncover the role of moire superlattices in the electronic properties of a weakly coupled h-BN/Graphite heterostructure. Our STM study reveals large moire patterns (14.8-18.3 nm periodicity) on the surface, implying slight local variations in the h-BN/Graphite stacking throughout the sample. Spectroscopic measurements show significant modulations of 330 meV in the local work function and 170 meV in the band gap within a moire unit cell, which are comparable to h-BN/metallic interfaces. Additionally, we identify dual moire superlattices in twisted homobilayers of h-BN/Graphite, offering an extra degree of freedom to tune the heterostructure's properties. These findings suggest that moire engineering in h-BN-based systems could lead to a range of effects, including exciton broadening, twist-tunable defect luminescence, and the theoretically predicted trapping of excitons within the moire landscape. Furthermore, this tunability may also affect adjacent layered materials, providing a versatile platform for tailoring the electronic and optical properties of h-BN and its van der Waals heterostructures.

TI Contrasting magnetism in VPS3 and CrI3 monolayers with the common
   honeycomb S=3/2 spin lattice
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB Two-dimensional (2D) magnetic materials are promising candidates for spintronics and quantum technologies. One extensively studied example is the ferromagnetic (FM) CrI3 monolayer with the honeycomb Cr3+ (t32g, S = 3/2) spin lattice, while VPS3 has the same honeycomb S = 3/2 spin lattice (V2+, t32g) but displays N & eacute;el antiferromagnetism. In this paper, we study the electronic structure and particularly the contrasting magnetism of VPS3 and CrI3 monolayers, using density functional calculations, magnetic exchange pictures, maximally localized Wannier function (MLWF) analysis, and parallel tempering Monte Carlo simulations. We find that VPS3 is a Mott-Hubbard insulator but CrI3 is a charge-transfer insulator, and therefore their magnetic exchange mechanisms are essentially different. The first-nearest-neighbor (1NN) direct d-d exchange dominates in VPS3, thus leading to a strong antiferromagnetic (AF) coupling. However, the formation of vanadium vacancies, associated with instability of the low-valence V2+ ions, suppresses the AF coupling and thus strongly reduces the N & eacute;el temperature (TN) in line with experimental observation. In contrast, our results reveal that the major 1NN d-p-d superexchanges in CrI3 via different channels give rise to competing FM and AF couplings, ultimately resulting in a weak FM coupling as observed experimentally. After revisiting several important superexchange channels reported in the literature, based on our MLWF and tight-binding analyses, we note that some antiphase contributions must be subtly and simultaneously considered, and thus we provide a deeper insight into the FM coupling of CrI3. Moreover, we identify and compare the major contributions to the magnetic anisotropy, i.e., a weak shape anisotropy in VPS3 and a relatively strong exchange anisotropy in CrI3. Our paper offers a comprehensive understanding of 2D magnetism using spin-orbital states and distinct exchange channels.

TI Quantifying the Size-Dependent Exciton-Phonon Coupling Strength in
   Single Lead-Halide Perovskite Quantum Dots
SO ADVANCED OPTICAL MATERIALS
AB Optimizing the performance of semiconductors in both classical and quantum applications, not only requires a solid understanding of elementary excitations such as electrons, holes, or bound electron-hole pairs (excitons), but also of their interaction with the host material's vibrational states (phonons). Exciton-phonon coupling is particularly relevant in quantum dots (QDs) of APbX3 lead-halide perovskite (where "A" can be Cs, formamidinium (FA), or methylammonium (MA), and X can be Cl, Br, or I), a new class of semiconductors with a soft crystal structure. Here, they quantify the strength of coupling to interband transitions for both FAPbBr3 and CsPbBr3 QDs, via the magnitude of phonon replicas in their photoluminescence (PL) spectra at cryogenic temperatures. CsPbBr3 QDs exhibit weaker exciton-phonon coupling than similarly sized FAPbBr3 QDs. While the phonon energies are size-independent, the exciton-phonon coupling strength decreases with increasing QD size due to the decreased coupling of the transition to low-energy surface-enhanced phonon modes, consistent withab initio molecular-dynamics (AIMD) simulations. Furthermore, within the harmonic approximation, the size-dependent PL linewidth at room temperature can coarsely be estimated from the low-temperature phonon replica spectrum, highlighting the crucial role of anharmonic effects. These findings contribute to realizing perovskite QD-based devices with narrow and coherent emission for quantum technologies.
   Exciton-phonon coupling is particularly relevant in quantum dots (QDs) of APbX3 lead-halide perovskite, a new class of semiconductors with exceptional potential in optoelectronics and as quantum light sources. Here, the exciton-phonon coupling strength is quantified via the magnitude of phonon replicas in CsPbBr3 and FAPbBr3 QDs obtained by single-QD spectroscopy.image

TI Atomic structures and interfacial engineering of ultrathin indium
   intercalated between graphene and a SiC substrate
SO NANOSCALE ADVANCES
AB Two-dimensional metals stabilized at the interface between graphene and SiC are attracting considerable interest thanks to their intriguing physical properties, providing promising material platforms for quantum technologies. However, the nanoscale picture of the ultrathin metals within the interface that represents their ultimate two-dimensional limit has not been well captured. In this work, we explore the atomic structures and electronic properties of atomically thin indium intercalated at the epitaxial graphene/SiC interface by means of cryogenic scanning tunneling microscopy. Two types of surfaces with distinctive crystalline characteristics are found: (i) a triangular indium arrangement epitaxially matching the (root 3 x root 3)R30 degrees cell of the SiC substrate and (ii) a featureless surface of more complex atomic structures. Local tunneling spectroscopy reveals a varying n-type doping in the graphene capping layer induced by the intercalated indium and an occupied electronic state at similar to-1.1 eV that is attributed to the electronic structure of the newly formed interface. Tip-induced surface manipulation is used to alter the interfacial landscape; indium atoms are locally de-intercalated below graphene. This enables the quantitative measurement of the intercalation thickness revealing mono and bi-atomic layer indium within the interface and offers the capability to tune the number of metal layers such that a monolayer is converted irreversibly to a bilayer indium. Our findings demonstrate a scanning probe-based method for in-depth investigation of ultrathin metal at the atomic level, holding importance from both fundamental and technical viewpoints.
   The STM tip is used to visualize and to engineer the intercalated indium at the interface between graphene and SiC substrate with atomic precision.

TI Exploring quantum control landscape and solution space complexity
   through optimization algorithms and dimensionality reduction
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Understanding the quantum control landscape (QCL) is important for designing effective quantum control strategies. In this study, we analyze the QCL for a single two-level quantum system (qubit) using various control strategies. We employ Principal Component Analysis (PCA), to visualize and analyze the QCL for higher dimensional control parameters. Our results indicate that dimensionality reduction techniques such as PCA, can play an important role in understanding the complex nature of quantum control in higher dimensions. Evaluations of traditional control techniques and machine learning algorithms reveal that Genetic Algorithms (GA) outperform Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), while Q-learning (QL) shows great promise compared to Deep Q-Networks (DQN) and Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO). Additionally, our experiments highlight the importance of reward function design in DQN and PPO demonstrating that using immediate reward results in improved performance rather than delayed rewards for systems with short time steps. A study of solution space complexity was conducted by using Cluster Density Index (CDI) as a key metric for analyzing the density of optimal solutions in the landscape. The CDI reflects cluster quality and helps determine whether a given algorithm generates regions of high fidelity or not. Our results provide insights into effective quantum control strategies, emphasizing the significance of parameter selection and algorithm optimization.

TI A continuous-wave and pulsed X-band electron spin resonance spectrometer
   operating in ultra-high vacuum for the study of low dimensional spin
   ensembles
SO REVIEW OF SCIENTIFIC INSTRUMENTS
AB We report the development of a continuous-wave and pulsed X-band electron spin resonance (ESR) spectrometer for the study of spins on ordered surfaces down to cryogenic temperatures. The spectrometer operates in ultra-high vacuum and utilizes a half-wavelength microstrip line resonator realized using epitaxially grown copper films on single crystal Al2O3 substrates. The one-dimensional microstrip line resonator exhibits a quality factor of more than 200 at room temperature, close to the upper limit determined by radiation losses. The surface characterizations of the copper strip of the resonator by atomic force microscopy, low-energy electron diffraction, and scanning tunneling microscopy show that the surface is atomically clean, flat, and single crystalline. Measuring the ESR spectrum at 15 K from a few nm thick molecular film of YPc2, we find a continuous-wave ESR sensitivity of 2.6 x 10(11) spins/G <middle dot> Hz(1/2), indicating that a signal-to-noise ratio of 3.9 G <middle dot> Hz(1/2) is expected from a monolayer of YPc2 molecules. Advanced pulsed ESR experimental capabilities, including dynamical decoupling and electron-nuclear double resonance, are demonstrated using free radicals diluted in a glassy matrix.

TI Recent progresses of quantum confinement in graphene quantum dots
SO FRONTIERS OF PHYSICS
AB Graphene quantum dots (GQDs) not only have potential applications on spin qubit, but also serve as essential platforms to study the fundamental properties of Dirac fermions, such as Klein tunneling and Berry phase. By now, the study of quantum confinement in GQDs still attract much attention in condensed matter physics. In this article, we review the experimental progresses on quantum confinement in GQDs mainly by using scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and scanning tunneling spectroscopy (STS). Here, the GQDs are divided into Klein GQDs, bound-state GQDs and edge-terminated GQDs according to their different confinement strength. Based on the realization of quasi-bound states in Klein GQDs, external perpendicular magnetic field is utilized as a manipulation approach to trigger and control the novel properties by tuning Berry phase and electron-electron (e-e) interaction. The tip-induced edge-free GQDs can serve as an intuitive mean to explore the broken symmetry states at nanoscale and single-electron accuracy, which are expected to be used in studying physical properties of different two-dimensional materials. Moreover, high-spin magnetic ground states are successfully introduced in edge-terminated GQDs by designing and synthesizing triangulene zigzag nanographenes.

TI Profile control of fiber-based micro-mirrors using adaptive laser
   shooting with in situ imaging
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB fiber Fabry-Perot cavities (FFPCs) are used in various studies in cavity quantum electrodynamics (CQED) and quantum technologies due to the cavity's small mode volume and compact integration with optical fibers. We develop a novel CO2 laser machining method that produces well-controlled surface profiles on the end facets of cleaved optical fibers. Using multiple shots in distinct spatial distribution patterns, our method employs a shooting algorithm that adaptively changes laser ablation parameters during the shooting to suppress deviations from the desired profile. This is made possible by in situ imaging of the machined profile, its inspection, and the usage of the information in the subsequent steps. Underlying this algorithm is a newly found laser ablation parameter, the pause between shots, which controls the accumulation of heat in between successive laser shots, and as a result, determines the area of impact made by an individual ablation sequence. We fabricate fiber-based micro-mirrors with radii of curvature ranging from 250 mu m to 700 mu m with an effective mirror diameter of 60 mu m in either Gaussian or spherical profiles. Due to the self-correcting nature of our adaptive algorithm, we achieve a near 100% success rate in the production of desired profiles with low ellipticity. After furnishing the laser-machined fiber end facets with high reflectivity coating, FFPCs are formed to demonstrate a high finesse up to 150,000 at an optical wavelength of 854 nm.

TI Electric field driven focusing and transport of plasma ion beams by
   micro-glass capillaries beyond the self-focusing limit
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS D-APPLIED PHYSICS
AB Micro-glass capillaries emerge as an important tool for the lossless guiding and focusing of ion beams (Kojima 2018 J. Phys. B: At. Mol. Opt. Phys. 51 042001). The self-focusing mechanism of the capillaries is primarily governed by charged patches induced on their inner walls by the incident beam (Stolterfoht et al 2002 Phys. Rev. Lett. 88 133201). However, the dominance of space charge forces over self-focusing forces in intense (J approximate to 1 A m-2) ion beams establishes a self-focusing limit (Maurya et al 2019 J. Phys. D: Appl. Phys. 52 055205), posing challenges to beam focusing beyond this limit. In this work, a novel method is introduced, demonstrating electrical control over the charge patch dynamics through an externally applied bias voltage, thereby enabling the focusing of Ar ion beams beyond the self-focusing limit. Experimental results reveal that adjusting the biasing voltage allows overcoming the self-focusing limit, resulting in the generation of a high-intensity ( Jout approximate to 3.05x105 A m-2) nano-beam (similar to 160 nm). Furthermore, electrical control is shown to enhance the performance of both straight and tapered capillaries (SC/TC), with the TC being more effective for nano-beam generation. A Particle-In-Cell (PIC) simulation code has been developed to explain the experimental results. The implications of high-intensity nano ion beams in advancing nanopatterning, nanoscale material analysis, and matter wave interferometry, underscore significant contributions to research and innovation within electronics, materials science, nanotechnology, and emerging quantum technologies.

TI Entanglement in Quantum Dots: Insights from Dynamic Susceptibility and
   Quantum Fisher Information
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB This study investigates the entanglement properties of quantum dots (QDs) under a universal Hamiltonian where the Coulomb interaction between particles (electrons or holes) decouples into charging energy and exchange coupling terms. Although this formalism typically decouples the charge and spin components, confinement-induced energy splitting can induce unexpected entanglement within the system. By analyzing the dynamic susceptibility and quantum Fisher information (QFI), significant behaviors are uncovered influenced by exchange constants, temperature variations, and confinement effects. In QDs with Ising exchange interactions, far below the Stoner instability (SI) point, where the QD is in a disordered paramagnetic phase, temperature reductions lead to decreased entanglement, challenging conventional expectations. These findings demonstrate that for QDs with small exchange interactions, the responses of easy-plane (J(z) < J(perpendicular to)) and easy-axis (J(z) > J(perpendicular to)) configurations are similar, with increased anisotropy broadening susceptibility and shifting its maximum to higher frequencies. For large exchange interactions, the susceptibility differences between easy-plane and easy-axis QDs become significant, with easy-plane QDs exhibiting a higher susceptibility magnitude. Additionally, the study reveals that temperature variations affect the dynamic response functions differently in easy-axis and easy-plane QDs. In easy-plane QDs, QFI consistently decreases with increasing temperature, whereas in easy-axis QDs, QFI behavior is highly dependent on the strengths of J(z) and J(perpendicular to), showing either an increase or decrease with temperature based on specific coupling conditions. Conversely, at low temperatures, anisotropic Heisenberg models exhibit enhanced entanglement near isotropic points. Overall, this work contributes to advancing the understanding of entanglement in QDs and its potential applications in quantum technologies.

TI Violation of the thermodynamic uncertainty relation in quantum
   collisional models
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB The thermodynamic uncertainty relation (TUR) is a fundamental principle in nonequilibrium thermodynamics that relates entropy production to fluctuations in a system, establishing a trade-off between the precision of an observable and the thermodynamic cost. Investigating TUR violations challenges classical thermodynamic limits, offering the potential for improved precision-entropy trade-offs, which is crucial for enhancing performance and optimization in quantum technologies. In this work, we investigate the thermodynamic uncertainty relation within a quantum collisional model, which offers the advantage of discretizing interactions into successive collisions with auxiliaries, allowing for precise tracking of dynamics and the incorporation of memory effects and non-Markovian behavior. We consider three types of dynamics in the collisional model: one is Markovian evolution, achieved by taking the continuous-time limit and imposing the stability condition, while the other two are non-Markovian dynamics-one arising from increasing the collision time between the system and the auxiliaries, and the other from incorporating interactions between the auxiliaries. For the Markovian dynamics, we examine the classical and quantum TUR bounds in the nonequilibrium steady-state regime, and also the finite-time TUR bound. We identify two distinct regimes of classical TUR violation: in some cases, the maximum violation occurs in the steady state, while in others, it is necessarily transient-appearing only at early times and vanishing with further evolution. For the two non-Markovian approaches, we find that both the degree and type of non-Markovianity crucially affect TUR violations. The second approach shows more pronounced violations during transient times, while the first approach has much stronger violations in the steady-state regime for a certain parameter window.

TI Subwavelength Photorefractive Grating in a Thin-Film Lithium Niobate
   Microcavity
SO LASER & PHOTONICS REVIEWS
AB Subwavelength gratings play a fundamental and pivotal role in numerous science and applications for wave manipulation, exhibiting distinctive features such as filtering, phase manipulation, and anti-reflection. However, conventional fabrication methods for ultrasmall periodic structures are constrained by the fundamental optical diffraction limit, making it challenging to produce subwavelength gratings for optics. Here, a novel technique is demonstrated to build a reconfigurable subwavelength photorefractive grating (SPG) in a thin-film lithium niobate on the platform of an optical microcavity. Such SPGs are optically induced through the photorefractive effect and the subwavelength features originate from the spatial phase modulations of the pump's standing wave. The resulting SPGs lead to the mode splitting of two counter-propagating modes inside the microcavity, exhibiting an Electromagnetically Induced Transparency (EIT)-like transmission spectrum. Moreover, the unique subwavelength characteristic of SPGs enables first-order quasi-phase-matching for backward second-harmonic generation, a long-standing problem in nonlinear optics. Also, free-space-to-chip vertical nonlinear frequency conversion can be achieved in a similar manner. These results provide a flexible approach toward fabricating subwavelength gratings, which holds significant potential in various applications such as nonlinear frequency conversion, optical communication, sensing, and quantum technologies.
   A reconfigurable subwavelength photorefractive grating (SPG) within a thin-film lithium niobate optical microcavity is demonstrated, benefitting from the photorefractive effect with a short period equal to half of the wavelength of the incident light, without complex fabrication processes. Backward second harmonic generation and vertical excited second harmonic generation are enabled with the assistance of SPGs through quasi-phase-matching. image

TI Electronic excitations of the charged nitrogen-vacancy center in diamond
   obtained using time-independent variational density functional
   calculations
SO SCIPOST PHYSICS
AB Elucidation of the mechanism for optical spin initialization of point defects in solids in the context of quantum applications requires an accurate description of the excited electronic states involved. While variational density functional calculations have been successful in describing the ground state of a great variety of systems, doubts have been expressed in the literature regarding the ability of such calculations to describe electronic excitations of point defects. A direct orbital optimization method is used here to perform time-independent, variational density functional calculations of a prototypical defect, the negatively charged nitrogen-vacancy center in diamond. The calculations include up to 511 atoms subject to periodic boundary conditions and the excited state calculations require similar computational effort as ground state calculations. Contrary to some previous reports, the use of local and semilocal density functionals gives the correct ordering of the low-lying triplet and singlet states, namely 3A2 < 1E < 1A1 < 3E. Furthermore, the more advanced meta generalized gradient approximation functionals give results that are in remarkably good agreement with high-level, many-body calculations as well as available experimental estimates, even for the excited singlet state which is often referred to as having multireference character. The lowering of the energy in the triplet excited state as the atom coordinates are optimized in accordance with analytical forces is also close to the experimental estimate and the resulting zero-phonon line triplet excitation energy is underestimated by only 0.15 eV. The approach used here is found to be a promising tool for studying electronic excitations of point defects in, for example, systems relevant for quantum technologies.

TI Stochastic Thermodynamics at the Quantum- Classical Boundary: A
   Self-Consistent Framework Based on Adiabatic-Response Theory
SO QUANTUM
AB Microscopic thermal machines promise to play an important role in future quantum technologies. Making such devices widely applicable will require effective strategies to channel their output into easily accessible storage systems like classical degrees of freedom. Here, we develop a self-consistent theoretical framework that makes it possible to model such quantum-classical hybrid devices in a thermodynamically consistent manner. Our approach is based on the assumption that the quantum part of the device is subject to strong decoherence and dissipation induced by a thermal reservoir. Due to the ensuing separation of time scales between slowly evolving classical and fast relaxing quantum degrees of freedom, the dynamics of the hybrid system can be described by means of adiabatic-response theory. We show that, upon including fluctuations in a minimally consistent way, the resulting equations of motion can be equipped with a first and second law, both on the ensemble level and on the level of individual trajectories of the classical part of the system, where thermodynamic quantities like heat and work become stochastic variables. As an application of our theory, we work out a physically transparent model of a quantum-classical hybrid engine, whose working system consists of a chain of Rydberg atoms, which is confined in an optical cavity and driven by periodic temperature variations. We demonstrate through numerical simulations that the engine can sustain periodic oscillations of a movable mirror, which acts as a classical load, against external friction and extract the full distributions of input heat and output work. By making the statistics of thermodynamic processes in quantum-classical hybrid systems accessible without the need to further specify a measurement protocol, our work contributes to bridging the long-standing gap between classical and quantum stochastic thermodynamics.

TI Matrix Product State Simulations of Non-Equilibrium Steady States and
   Transient Heat Flows in the Two-Bath Spin-Boson Model at Finite
   Temperatures
SO ENTROPY
AB Simulating the non-perturbative and non-Markovian dynamics of open quantum systems is a very challenging many body problem, due to the need to evolve both the system and its environments on an equal footing. Tensor network and matrix product states (MPS) have emerged as powerful tools for open system models, but the numerical resources required to treat finite-temperature environments grow extremely rapidly and limit their applications. In this study we use time-dependent variational evolution of MPS to explore the striking theory of Tamascelli et al. (Phys. Rev. Lett. 2019, 123, 090402.) that shows how finite-temperature open dynamics can be obtained from zero temperature, i.e., pure wave function, simulations. Using this approach, we produce a benchmark dataset for the dynamics of the Ohmic spin-boson model across a wide range of coupling strengths and temperatures, and also present a detailed analysis of the numerical costs of simulating non-equilibrium steady states, such as those emerging from the non-perturbative coupling of a qubit to baths at different temperatures. Despite ever-growing resource requirements, we find that converged non-perturbative results can be obtained, and we discuss a number of recent ideas and numerical techniques that should allow wide application of MPS to complex open quantum systems.

TI The game of life as a species model
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB Conway's classic game of life is a two-dimensional cellular automaton in which each cell is alive or dead and evolves according to simple rules that depend solely on the number of live cells in its immediate neighborhood. The emergence of complex multi-cellular objects provides a fascinating vehicle for exploration. A variant of the classic game of life is presented, the generalized semi-classical game of life, in which each cell contains a qubit that evolves by repeated application of birth, death, and survival operators. Species are characterized by just two parameters: a preferred neighborhood liveness representing the tendency to herd and a resilience parameter representing species' vulnerability to environmental changes. This generalized model provides the opportunity to model the fortune of species and to compare to available data. The model is shown to mimic environmental catastrophes and is illustrated by the model's prediction of a return to the pre-hunting level of the global whale population by 2140. A student-designed predator-prey model is shown to qualitatively describe the fate of strongly- and weakly coupled predator-prey systems (snowshoe hare/lynx and rabbit/fox, respectively) and sudden and slow predatory impact (dodo and diprotodon, respectively).

TI Probing non-Markovian quantum dynamics with data-driven analysis: Beyond
   "black-box" machine-learning models
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB A precise understanding of the influence of a quantum system's environment on its dynamics, which is at the heart of the theory of open quantum systems, is crucial for further progress in the development of controllable large-scale quantum systems. However, existing approaches to account for complex system-environment interaction in the presence of memory effects are either based on heuristic and oversimplified principles or give rise to computational difficulties. In practice, one can leverage on available experimental data and replace first-principles simulations with a data-driven analysis that is often much simpler. Inspired by recent advances in data analysis and machine learning, we propose a data-driven approach to the analysis of the non-Markovian dynamics of open quantum systems. Our method allows, on the one hand, capturing the most important characteristics of open quantum systems such as the effective dimension of the environment and the spectrum of the joint system-environment quantum dynamics, and, on the other hand, reconstructing a predictive model of non-Markovian quantum dynamics, and denoising the measured quantum trajectories. We demonstrate the performance of the proposed approach with various models of open quantum systems, including a qubit coupled with a finite environment, a spin-boson model, and the damped Jaynes-Cummings model.

TI Simulating a measurement-induced phase transition for trapped-ion
   circuits
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB The rise of programmable quantum devices has motivated the exploration of circuit models which could realize novel physics. A promising candidate is a class of hybrid circuits, where entangling unitary dynamics compete with disentangling measurements. Novel phase transitions between different entanglement regimes have been identified in their dynamical states, with universal properties hinting at unexplored critical phenomena. Trapped-ion hardware is a leading contender for the experimental realization of such physics, which requires not only traditional two-qubit entangling gates, but also a constant rate of local measurements accurately addressed throughout the circuit. Recent progress in engineering high-precision optical addressing of individual ions makes preparing a constant rate of measurements throughout a unitary circuit feasible. Using tensor network simulations, we show that the resulting class of hybrid circuits, prepared with native gates, exhibits a volume-law to area-law transition in the entanglement entropy. This displays universal hallmarks of a measurement-induced phase transition. Our simulations are able to characterize the critical exponents using circuit sizes with tens of qubits and thousands of gates. We argue that this transition should be robust against additional sources of exper-imental noise expected in modern trapped-ion hardware and will rather be limited by statistical requirements on postselection. Our work highlights the powerful role that tensor network simulations can play in advancing the theoretical and experimental frontiers of critical phenomena.

TI A lightweight remote attestation using PUFs and hash-based signatures
   for low-end IoT devices
SO FUTURE GENERATION COMPUTER SYSTEMS-THE INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ESCIENCE
AB Remote attestation is a powerful mechanism that allows a verifier to know if the hardware of an IoT (Internet-of-Thing) device (acting as a prover) has been counterfeited or tampered with and if its firmware has been altered. Remote attestation is based on collecting and reporting measurements in a trusted way, and should be lightweight for resource-constrained IoT devices. This work proposes to include a low-cost Root of Trust for Measuring and Reporting (RoTMR) in the prover, based on the combination of a Physically Unclonable Function (PUF) and an Attestation Read-Only Memory (A-ROM), and to use hash-based digital signatures in the attestation protocol. The proposed RoTMR is addressed to IoT devices based on a microcontroller that executes some application code (the measurable object) located in an external non-volatile memory accessible by an attacker. The secret keys required by the digital signatures are not stored but reconstructed using the PUF. The A-ROM contains the attestation instructions and ensures that its contents cannot be altered and that its instructions are executed sequentially without modification. The use of hash-based digital signatures makes the solution quantum-resistant and very robust because its security relies solely on the unidirectionality of a hash function. The proposed attestation protocol takes advantage of the fact that One-Time Signature (OTS) generation and Many-Time Signature (MTS) verification are very well suited for lowend devices, and the MTS scheme is suitable for the verifier application context. The proposal was validated experimentally with the ESP32 microcontroller, which is widely employed in IoT devices, by using its SRAM as PUF and implementing WOTS+, which is a type of Winternitz One-Time Signature scheme (WOTS), the One-Time Signature of Smart Digital Signatures scheme (SDS-OTS), and the MTS schemes constructed with them. The OTS schemes require smaller codes and thus smaller A-ROM than MTS and ECDSA (Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm). The code of one of the WOTS+ takes about 4 times less space than ECDSA. In terms of execution times, the OTS schemes are very fast. One of the WOTS+ performs all the signature operations in a few tens of milliseconds. The OTS schemes (especially the SDS-OTS) are also very efficient in terms of communication bandwidth because they use small signatures compared to other post-quantum solutions.& COPY; 2023 The Authors.

TI Integrated lithium niobate electro-optic modulators: when performance
   meets scalability
SO OPTICA
AB Electro-optic modulators (EOMs) convert signals from the electrical to the optical domain. They are at the heart of optical communication, microwave signal processing, sensing, and quantum technologies. Next-generation EOMs require high-density integration, low cost, and high performance simultaneously, which are difficult to achieve with established integrated photonics platforms. Thin-film lithium niobate (LN) has recently emerged as a strong contender owing to its high intrinsic electro-optic (EO) efficiency, industry-proven performance, robustness, and, importantly, the rapid development of scalable fabrication techniques. The thin-film LN platform inherits nearly all the material advantages from the legacy bulk LN devices and amplifies them with a smaller footprint, wider bandwidths, and lower power consumption. Since the first adoption of commercial thin-film LN wafers only a few years ago, the overall performance of thin-film LN modulators is already comparable with, if not exceeding, the performance of the best alternatives based on mature platforms such as silicon and indium phosphide, which have benefited from many decades of research and development. In this mini-review, we explain the principles and technical advances that have enabled state-of-the-art LN modulator demonstrations. We discuss several approaches, their advantages and challenges. We also outline the paths to follow if LN modulators are to improve further, and we provide a perspective on what we believe their performance could become in the future. Finally, as the integrated LN modulator is a key subcomponent of more complex photonic functionalities, we look forward to exciting opportunities for larger-scale LN EO circuits beyond single components.

TI A Quantum Public-Key Cryptosystem Without Quantum Storage for
   Public-Keys
SO CONTEMPORARY MATHEMATICS
AB A quantum public-key cryptosystem without quantum storage for public-keys is provided. In traditional quantum public-key cryptosystems the public key of a user is a set of quantum systems. There is a Key Mangement Center (KMC) which needs to keep the public keys of all users for a long time to satisfy communication requirments between users. But it's very difficult to keep quantum systems for a long time beacuse quantum system will undergo decoherence with time. This is a big obstacle for quantum public-key crytosystems when they are applied in practice. This quantum public-key cryptosystem can solve this problem. A user keeps a state sequence and a binary string in the key management center called the source key which is only a piece of classical information. If one user A wants to have another user B to get a secret message, KMC creates a sequence of quantum systems according to the latter one's source key, which is just the user's (public key, private key) pair. Then the two users can acomplish secure communications with KMC's assistance. On the otherhand users can also perform message authentication on the messages to guarantee that the messages can't be forged or distorted. In this cryptosystem KMC needs no quantum storage for public keys, which greatly reduces the technical difficulities of key management and secret communication. Moreover any two users needn't keep a quantum channel between them. Therefore to realize and apply this quantum public-key cryptosystem is much more easier than traditional quantum public-key cryptosystems.

TI Dense Coding with Locality Restriction on Decoders: Quantum Encoders
   versus Superquantum Encoders
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB We investigate practical dense coding by imposing locality restrictions on decoders and symmetry restrictions on encoders within the resource theory of asymmetry framework. In this task, the sender Alice and the helper Fred preshare an entangled state. Alice encodes a classical message into the quantum state using a symmetric preserving encoder and sends the encoded state to Bob through a noiseless quantum channel. The receiver Bob and helper Fred are limited to performing quantum measurements satisfying certain locality restrictions to decode the classical message. We are interested in the ultimate dense coding capacity under these constraints. Our contributions are summarized as follows. First, we derive both one-shot and asymptotic optimal achievable transmission rates of the dense coding task under different encoder and decoder combinations. Surprisingly, our results reveal that the transmission rate cannot be improved even when the decoder is relaxed from one-way local operations and classical communication (LOCC) to two-way LOCC, separable measurements, and partial transpose positive measurements of the bipartite system. Second, depending on the class of allowed decoders with certain locality restrictions, we relax the class of encoding operations to superquantum encoders in the general probability theory frame-work and derive dense coding transmission rates under this setting. For example, when the decoder is fixed to a separable measurement, theoretically, a positive operation is allowed as an encoding operation. Remarkably, even under this superquantum relaxation, the transmission rate still cannot be lifted. This fact highlights the universal validity of our analysis on practical dense coding beyond quantum theory.

AB This work introduces the so-called synchrosqueezed wavelet transform, to shed light on the dipolar fluctuations of a thermal ensemble of nuclear spins in a diamond crystal structure, hyperfine-coupled to a central spin. The raw time series of the nuclear spin bath coherent dynamics is acquired through the two-point correlation function computed using the cluster correlation expansion method. The dynamics can be conveniently analyzed according to zero-, single-, and double-quantum transitions derived from the dipolar pairwise spin flips. We show that in the early-time behavior when the coherence is preserved in the spin ensemble, the Overhauser field fluctuations are modulated by dipole-dipole-induced small inhomogeneous detunings of nearly resonant transitions within the bath. The resulting beating extending over relatively longer time intervals is featured on the scalograms where both temporal and spectral behaviors of nuclear spin noise are unveiled simultaneously. Moreover, a second kind of beating that affects faster dynamics is readily discernible, originating from the inhomogeneous spread of the hyperfine coupling of each nucleus with the central spin. Additionally, any quadrupolar nuclei within the bath imprint as beating residing in the zero-quantum channel. The nuclear spin environment can be directionally probed by orienting the hyperfine axis. Thereby, crucial spatial information about the closely separated spin clusters surrounding the central spin are accessible. Thus, a wavelet-based postprocessing can facilitate the identification of proximal nuclear spins as revealed by their unique beating patterns on the scalograms. Finally, when these features are overwhelmed by either weakly or strongly coupled classical noise sources, we demonstrate the efficacy of thresholding techniques in the wavelet domain in denoising contaminated scalograms.

TI Efficacy of disinfectants and endotoxin-retentive filters for the
   removal of bacterial DNA from dialysates
SO RENAL REPLACEMENT THERAPY
AB BackgroundBacterial DNA (bDNA) fragments in dialysate lines can trigger inflammatory responses in patients on dialysis. However, no studies have reported the removal and inactivation of bDNA in dialysate lines using cleaning and disinfection, and management procedures to control bDNA contamination have yet to be established.MethodsThe efficiency of an endotoxin-retentive filter (ETRF) for the removal of bDNA was examined using an experimental dialysate line incorporating an ETRF and the solubilized materials derived from hot-water-disinfected Pseudomonas aeruginosa cells. To examine the inactivation of bDNA by disinfection, P. aeruginosa cell suspensions were disinfected with hot water, peracetic acid, or sodium hypochlorite, and the amount of bDNA remaining after the disinfection treatment was determined. Single-stranded and double-stranded bDNA were measured using Qubit (R) fluorometry. The molecular size of bDNA was analyzed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.ResultsIn the spike-and-recovery test of solubilized materials derived from hot-water-disinfected bacterial cells, bDNA leakage was observed when the circuit pressure of the inlet ETRF was elevated. bDNA was inactivated more during disinfection with sodium hypochlorite than with peracetic acid and hot water.ConclusionsIn addition to the ETRF, disinfection with sodium hypochlorite is an effective method for the management of bDNA in dialysates.

TI High quality RNA extraction from Pseudomonas aeruginosa and other
   bacteria with a novel rapid and cost-effective method
SO BIOTECHNOLOGY & BIOTECHNOLOGICAL EQUIPMENT
AB High-quality mRNA extraction is essential for gene expression assays. In this study, we developed a rapid method (20 min) named FACTS for the extraction of intact RNA from Pseudomonas aeruginosa and compared its performance to established rapid techniques like RNAsnap and CiAR. The RNA integrity, yield, purity and presence of residual genomic DNA were adopted as assessment criteria. Multiple assays for RNA integrity were applied, including the Agilent 2200 TapeStation, QIAxcel capillary electrophoresis, and the newly available Qubit RNA Integrity and Quality (IQ) Assay Kit. The RNA purity and DNA/RNA yield were assessed by spectrophotometry and fluorimetry, respectively. Following Dnase treatment, two-step RT-qPCR for the expression of the rpoD reference gene was performed to evaluate the performance of each method. In terms of RNA integrity, FACTS showed the highest RNA integrity, while in terms of purity, CiAR scored best. RNAsnap resulted in a substantial amount of residual DNA. Pilot experiments for RNA extraction with FACTS from other Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria revealed promising results. FACTS is a novel RNA extraction method for rapid highly effective extraction of high-quality RNA from P. aeruginosa and can be used as a cost-efficient alternative to other methods in gene expression studies.

TI Characterization of Quantum Betting Tasks in Terms of Arimoto Mutual
   Information
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB We introduce operational quantum tasks based on betting with risk aversion-or quantum betting tasks for short-inspired by standard quantum state discrimination and classical horse betting with risk aversion and side information. In particular, we introduce the operational tasks of quantum state betting (QSB), noisy quantum state betting (NQSB), and quantum-channel betting (QCB) played by gamblers with different risk tendencies. We prove that the advantage that informative measurements (nonconstant channels) provide in QSB (NQSB) is exactly characterized by Arimoto's alpha-mutual information, with the order alpha determining the risk aversion of the gambler. More generally, we show that Arimoto-type information-theoretic quantities characterize the advantage that resourceful objects offer at playing quantum betting tasks when compared to resourceless objects, for general quantum resource theories (QRTs) of measurements, channels, states, and state-measurement pairs, with arbitrary resources. In limiting cases, we show that QSB (QCB) recovers the known tasks of quantum state (channel) discrimination when alpha -> infinity, and quantum state (channel) exclusion when alpha -> -infinity. Inspired by these connections, we also introduce new quantum Renyi divergences for measurements, and derive a new family of resource monotones for the QRT of measurement informativeness. This family of resource monotones recovers in the same limiting cases as above, the generalized robustness and the weight of informativeness. Altogether, these results establish a broad and continuous family of four-way correspondences between operational tasks, mutual information measures, quantum Renyi divergences, and resource monotones, that can be seen to generalize two limiting correspondences that were recently discovered for the QRT of measurement informativeness.

TI Experimental characterization of quantum processes: A selective and
   efficient method in arbitrary finite dimensions
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB The temporal evolution of a quantum system can be characterized by quantum process tomography, a complex task that consumes a number of physical resources scaling exponentially with the number of subsystems. An alternative approach to the full reconstruction of a quantum channel is the selective and efficient quantum process tomography, a method that allows estimating, individually and up to the required accuracy, each element of the matrix that describes the process, using only a polynomial amount of resources. The implementation of this protocol is closely related to the possibility of building a complete set of mutually unbiased bases (MUBs), whose existence is known only when the dimension of the Hilbert space is the power of a prime number. However, an extension of the method that uses tensor products of maximal sets of MUBs has been recently introduced. Here we explicitly describe how to implement the algorithm for a selective and efficient estimation of a quantum process in a nonprime power dimension and conduct, an experimental verification of the method in a Hilbert space of dimension d = 6. This is the smallest space for which a complete set of MUBs is not known to exist, but it can be decomposed as a tensor product of two Hilbert spaces of dimensions D-1 = 2 and D-2 = 3, in which a complete set of MUBs is already known. The six-dimensional states were codified in the discretized transverse linear momentum of photons. The state preparation and detection stages are dynamically programed with the use of only-phase spatial light modulators, in a versatile experimental setup that allows one to implement the algorithm in any finite dimension.

TI Enhancing the accuracy of density functional tight binding models
   through ChIMES many-body interaction potentials
SO JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS
AB Semi-empirical quantum models such as Density Functional Tight Binding (DFTB) are attractive methods for obtaining quantum simulation data at longer time and length scales than possible with standard approaches. However, application of these models can require lengthy effort due to the lack of a systematic approach for their development. In this work, we discuss the use of the Chebyshev Interaction Model for Efficient Simulation (ChIMES) to create rapidly parameterized DFTB models, which exhibit strong transferability due to the inclusion of many-body interactions that might otherwise be inaccurate. We apply our modeling approach to silicon polymorphs and review previous work on titanium hydride. We also review the creation of a general purpose DFTB/ChIMES model for organic molecules and compounds that approaches hybrid functional and coupled cluster accuracy with two orders of magnitude fewer parameters than similar neural network approaches. In all cases, DFTB/ChIMES yields similar accuracy to the underlying quantum method with orders of magnitude improvement in computational cost. Our developments provide a way to create computationally efficient and highly accurate simulations over varying extreme thermodynamic conditions, where physical and chemical properties can be difficult to interrogate directly, and there is historically a significant reliance on theoretical approaches for interpretation and validation of experimental results.

TI NISQ Algorithm for Hamiltonian simulation via truncated Taylor series
SO SCIPOST PHYSICS
AB Simulating the dynamics of many-body quantum systems is believed to be one of the first fields that quantum computers can show a quantum advantage over classical computers. Noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) algorithms aim at effectively using the currently available quantum hardware. For quantum simulation, various types of NISQ algorithms have been proposed with individual advantages as well as challenges. In this work, we propose a new algorithm, truncated Taylor quantum simulator (TQS), that shares the advantages of existing algorithms and alleviates some of the shortcomings. Our algorithm does not have any classical-quantum feedback loop and bypasses the barren plateau problem by construction. The classical part in our hybrid quantum-classical algorithm corresponds to a quadratically constrained quadratic program (QCQP) with a single quadratic equality constraint, which admits a semidefinite relaxation. The QCQP based classical optimization was recently introduced as the classical step in quantum assisted eigensolver (QAE), a NISQ algorithm for the Hamiltonian ground state problem. Thus, our work provides a conceptual unification between the NISQ algorithms for the Hamiltonian ground state problem and the Hamiltonian simulation. We recover differential equation-based NISQ algorithms for Hamiltonian simulation such as quantum assisted simulator (QAS) and variational quantum simulator (VQS) as particular cases of our algorithm. We test our algorithm on some toy examples on current cloud quantum computers. We also provide a systematic approach to improve the accuracy of our algorithm.

TI A scalable routing method for superconducting quantum processor
SO EPJ QUANTUM TECHNOLOGY
AB Routing design is an important aspect in aiding the completion of the Quantum Processing Unit (QPU) layout design for large-scale superconducting quantum processors. One of the research focuses is how to generate reliable routing schemes within a short time. In this study, we propose a superconducting quantum processor auto-routing method for supporting scalable architecture, which is mainly implemented through the bidirectional A star algorithm, the backtracking algorithm, and the greedy strategy. By using this method, the number of crossovers and corners can be reduced while efficiently completing the processor routing. To verify the effectiveness of our method, we selected 5 types of qubit numbers for processor routing experiments. The experimental results show that compared to the improved A star algorithm of Qiskit Metal, our method reduces the average execution time by at least 43.61% and 41.68% in serial and parallel, respectively. Compared with four other routing algorithms, our method has a minimum average reduction of 10.63% and 1.21% in the number of crossovers and corners, respectively. In addition, our method supports the processor routing design of planar and flip-chip architectures, and can automatically process both airbridge and insulation types of crossovers. Therefore, our method can provide efficient and reliable automated routing design to assist the development of large-scale superconducting quantum processors.

TI Evaluation of Circular Complex Permeability in Single-Crystal Yttrium
   Iron Garnet at Cryogenic Temperatures
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INSTRUMENTATION AND MEASUREMENT
AB The operation of superconducting qubits requires a sensitive readout circuit at cryogenic temperatures, driving the demand for cryogenic nonreciprocal microwave components such as circulators. However, evaluating these components at low temperatures (LTs) presents significant challenges for companies and institutions without specialized measurement systems. In the development of such cryogenic nonreciprocal components, the temperature dependence of ferrite's magnetic properties is the most critical factor. Therefore, an evaluation technique for accurately assessing these properties at cryogenic temperatures is essential. In this study, we develop a measurement method to characterize low-loss ferrite materials over a temperature range of 300-2 K. The use of the circularly polarized resonance mode TE11n enables the direct estimation of circular complex permeability and the determination of key material parameters, including saturation magnetization and damping constant-both essential for assessing the performance of ferrite materials in circulator applications. To validate the reliability of our measurement method, we selected single-crystal yttrium iron garnet (YIG) as the test material, as its magnetic properties at cryogenic temperatures are relatively well known. This demonstration confirms that our method is effective for characterizing various low-loss ferrite materials that are potential candidates for compact cryogenic nonreciprocal devices.

TI Quantum approximation of normalized Schatten norms and applications to
   learning
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Efficient measures to determine the similarity of quantum states, such as the fidelity metric, have been widely studied. In this paper, we address the problem of defining a similarity measure for quantum operations that can be efficiently estimated. Given two quantum operations, U-1 and U-2, represented in their circuit forms, we first develop a quantum sampling circuit to estimate the normalized Schatten 2-norm of their difference (parallel to U-1 - U2U parallel to(S2)) with precision epsilon, using only one clean qubit and one classical random variable. We prove a Poly(1/epsilon) upper bound on the sample complexity, which is independent of the size of the quantum system. We then show that such a similarity metric is directly related to a functional definition of similarity of unitary operations using the conventional fidelity metric of quantum states (F): If parallel to U-1 - U-2 parallel to(S2) is sufficiently small (e.g., <= epsilon/1+root 2(1/delta-1)) then the fidelity of states obtained by processing the same randomly and uniformly picked pure state vertical bar psi > is as high as needed [F(U-1 |psi >, U-2 |psi > 1 - epsilon] with probability exceeding 1 - delta. We provide example applications of this efficient similarity metric estimation framework to quantum circuit learning tasks, such as finding the square root of a given unitary operation.

TI An integrated magneto-optic modulator for cryogenic applications
SO NATURE ELECTRONICS
AB A current-driven modulator based on the magneto-optic effect can operate at temperatures as low as 4 K and offer data rates of up to 2 Gbps with an energy consumption below 4 pJ per bit of transferred information.
   Superconducting circuits can operate at higher energy efficiencies than their room-temperature counterparts and have the potential to enable large-scale control and readout of quantum computers. However, the required interface with room-temperature electronics creates difficulties in scaling up such cryogenic systems. One option is to use optical fibres as a medium in conjunction with fast optical modulators that can be efficiently driven by electrical signals at low temperatures. However, as superconducting circuits are current operated with low impedances, they interface poorly with conventional electro-optical modulators. Here we report an integrated current-driven modulator that is based on the magneto-optic effect and can operate at temperatures as low as 4 K. The device combines a magneto-optic garnet crystal with a silicon waveguide resonator and integrates an electromagnet to modulate the refractive index of the garnet. The modulator offers data rates of up to 2 Gbps with an energy consumption below 4 pJ per bit of transferred information, which could be reduced to less than 50 fJ per bit by replacing dissipative electrodes with superconductors and optimizing the geometric parameters.

TI Dynamics and control of entangled electron-photon states in nanophotonic
   systems with time-variable parameters
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We study the dynamics of strongly coupled nanophotonic systems with time-variable parameters. The approximate analytic solutions are obtained for a broad class of open quantum systems including a two-level fermion emitter strongly coupled to a multimode quantized electromagnetic field in a cavity with time-varying cavity resonances or the electron transition energy. The coupling of the fermion and photon subsystems to their dissipative reservoirs is included within the stochastic equation of evolution approach, which is equivalent to the Lindblad approximation in the master equation formalism. The analytic solutions for the quantum states and the observables are obtained under the approximation that the rate of parameter modulation and the amplitude of the frequency modulation are much smaller than the optical transition frequencies. At the same time, they can be arbitrary with respect to the generalized Rabi oscillation frequency, which determines the coherent dynamics. Therefore, our analytic theory can be applied to an arbitrary modulation of the parameters, both slower and faster than the Rabi frequency, for complete control of the quantum state. In particular, we demonstrate protocols for switching on and off the entanglement between the fermionic and photonic degrees of freedom, swapping between the quantum states, and the decoupling of the fermionic qubit from the cavity field due to modulation-induced transparency.

TI Amplification, Inference, and the Manifestation of Objective Classical
   Information
SO ENTROPY
AB Our everyday reality is characterized by objective information-information that is selected and amplified by the environment that interacts with quantum systems. Many observers can accurately infer that information indirectly by making measurements on fragments of the environment. The correlations between the system, S, and a fragment, F, of the environment, E, is often quantified by the quantum mutual information, or the Holevo quantity, which bounds the classical information about S transmittable by a quantum channel F. The latter is a quantum mutual information but of a classical-quantum state where measurement has selected outcomes on S. The measurement generically reflects the influence of the remaining environment, E/F, but can also reflect hypothetical questions to deduce the structure of SF correlations. Recently, Touil et al. examined a different Holevo quantity, one from a quantum-classical state (a quantum S to a measured F). As shown here, this quantity upper bounds any accessible classical information about S in F and can yield a tighter bound than the typical Holevo quantity. When good decoherence is present-when the remaining environment, E/F, has effectively measured the pointer states of S-this accessibility bound is the accessible information. For the specific model of Touil et al., the accessible information is related to the error probability for optimal detection and, thus, has the same behavior as the quantum Chernoff bound. The latter reflects amplification and provides a universal approach, as well as a single-shot framework, to quantify records of the missing, classical information about S.

TI Ascertaining the influences of auxiliary qubits on the
   Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen steering and its directions
SO CHINESE PHYSICS B
AB Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) steering is an example of nontrivial quantum nonlocality and characteristic in the non-classical world. The directivity (or asymmetry) is a fascinating trait of EPR steering, and it is different from other quantum nonlocalities. Here, we consider the strategy in which two atoms compose a two-qubit X state, and the two atoms are owned by Alice and Bob, respectively. The atom of Alice suffers from a reservoir, and the atom of Bob couples with a bit flip channel. The influences of auxiliary qubits on EPR steering and its directions are revealed by means of the entropy uncertainty relation. The results indicate that EPR steering declines with growing time t when adding fewer auxiliary qubits. The EPR steering behaves as damped oscillation when introducing more auxiliary qubits in the strong coupling regime. In the weak coupling regime, the EPR steering monotonously decreases as t increases when coupling auxiliary qubits. The increases in auxiliary qubits are responsible for the fact that the steerability from Alice to Bob (or from Bob to Alice) can be more effectively revealed. Notably, the introductions of more auxiliary qubits can change the situation that steerability from Alice to Bob is certain to a situation in which steerability from Bob to Alice is certain.

TI Neutron imaging of an operational dilution refrigerator
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB The invention of the He-3/He-4 dilution refrigerator opened a new chapter in experimental ultra-low temperature physics. Dilution refrigerators became essential for providing ultra-low temperature environments for nuclear demagnetisation experiments, superconducting-qubit quantum processors and highly sensitive bolometers used in fundamental physics experiments. Development of dilution refrigeration technology requires thorough understanding of the quantum mechanical processes that take place in liquid helium at ultra-low temperatures. For decades the quantum fluids research community provided valuable information to engineers and designers involved in the development of advanced dilution refrigerators. However, the lack of methods that allow the measurement of physical parameters of liquid helium during the operation of a dilution refrigerator was hindering development of the technology. Here we show direct imaging of an operational dilution refrigerator using neutron radiography. This allows direct observation of the dilution process in He-3/He-4 mixtures and opens an opportunity for direct measurement of the He-3 concentration. We observe the refrigerator behaviour in different regimes, such as continuous circulation and single shot, and show that our method allows investigation of various failure modes. Our results demonstrate that neutron imaging applied to the study of dilution refrigeration processes can provide essential information for developers of ultra-low temperature systems. We expect that neutron imaging will become instrumental in the research and development of advanced dilution refrigerators.

TI Frustrated Superradiant Phase Transition
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Frustration occurs when a system cannot find a lowest-energy configuration due to conflicting constraints. We show that a frustrated superradiant phase transition occurs when the ground-state superradiance of cavity fields due to local light-matter interactions cannot simultaneously minimize the positive photon hopping energies. We solve the Dicke trimer model on a triangle motif with both negative and positive hopping energies and show that the latter results in a sixfold degenerate ground-state manifold in which the translational symmetry is spontaneously broken. In the frustrated superradiant phase, we find that two sets of diverging time and fluctuation scales coexist, one governed by the mean-field critical exponent and another by a novel critical exponent. The latter is associated with the fluctuation in the difference of local order parameters and gives rise to site-dependent photon number critical exponents, which may serve as an experimental probe for the frustrated superradiant phase. We provide a qualitative explanation for the emergence of unconventional critical scalings and demonstrate that they are generic properties of the frustrated superradiant phase at the hand of a one-dimensional Dicke lattice with an odd number of sites. The mechanism for the frustrated superradiant phase transition discovered here applies to any lattice geometries where the antiferromagnetic ordering of neighboring sites are incompatible and therefore our work paves the way toward the exploration of frustrated phases of coupled light and matter.

TI Bound state dynamics in the long-range spin-1/2 XXZ model
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB Experimental platforms based on trapped ions, cold molecules, and Rydberg atoms have made possible the investigation of highly nonlocal spin-1/2 Hamiltonians with long-range couplings. Here, we study the effects of such nonlocal couplings in the long-range spin-1/2 XXZ Heisenberg Hamiltonian. We calculate explicitly the two-spin energy spectrum, which describes all possible energetic configurations of two spins pointing in a specific direction embedded in a background of spins with opposite orientation. For fast decay of the spin-spin couplings, we find that the two-spin energy spectrum is characterized by well-defined discrete values, corresponding to bound states, separated by a set of continuum states describing the scattering region. In the deep long-range regime instead, the bound states disappear as they get incorporated by the scattering region. The presence of two-spin bound states results to be crucial to determine both two- and many-spin dynamics. On one hand, radically different two-spin spreadings can be observed by tuning the decay of the spin couplings. On the other hand, two-spin bound states enable the dynamical stabilization of effective antiferromagnetic states in the presence of ferromagnetic couplings. Finally, we propose a novel scheme based on a trapped-ion quantum simulator to experimentally realize the long-range XXZ model and to study its out-of-equilibrium properties.

TI Single-Atom Control of Arsenic Incorporation in Silicon for High-Yield
   Artificial Lattice Fabrication
SO ADVANCED MATERIALS
AB Artificial lattices constructed from individual dopant atoms within a semiconductor crystal hold promise to provide novel materials with tailored electronic, magnetic, and optical properties. These custom-engineered lattices are anticipated to enable new, fundamental discoveries in condensed matter physics and lead to the creation of new semiconductor technologies including analog quantum simulators and universal solid-state quantum computers. This work reports precise and repeatable, substitutional incorporation of single arsenic atoms into a silicon lattice. A combination of scanning tunneling microscopy hydrogen resist lithography and a detailed statistical exploration of the chemistry of arsine on the hydrogen-terminated silicon (001) surface are employed to show that single arsenic dopants can be deterministically placed within four silicon lattice sites and incorporated with 97 +/- 2% yield. These findings bring closer to the ultimate frontier in semiconductor technology: the deterministic assembly of atomically precise dopant and qubit arrays at arbitrarily large scales.
   Single arsenic atoms are deterministically incorporated into a silicon lattice with up to 100% yield. This is achieved using arsine gas as a precursor to arsenic incorporation via scanning tunneling microscopy hydrogen resist lithography. A detailed understanding of the surface chemistry of arsine on lithographically patterned hydrogen-terminated Si(001) underpins the fabrication of a 2 x 2 single-atom arsenic artificial lattice. image

TI Evaluation of synthetic and experimental training data in supervised
   machine learning applied to charge-state detection of quantum dots
SO MACHINE LEARNING-SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Automated tuning of gate-defined quantum dots is a requirement for large-scale semiconductor-based qubit initialisation. An essential step of these tuning procedures is charge-state detection based on charge stability diagrams. Using supervised machine learning to perform this task requires a large dataset for models to train on. In order to avoid hand labelling experimental data, synthetic data has been explored as an alternative. While providing a significant increase in the size of the training dataset compared to using experimental data, using synthetic data means that classifiers are trained on data sourced from a different distribution than the experimental data that is part of the tuning process. Here we evaluate the prediction accuracy of a range of machine learning models trained on simulated and experimental data, and their ability to generalise to experimental charge stability diagrams in two-dimensional electron gas and nanowire devices. We find that classifiers perform best on either purely experimental or a combination of synthetic and experimental training data, and that adding common experimental noise signatures to the synthetic data does not dramatically improve the classification accuracy. These results suggest that experimental training data as well as realistic quantum dot simulations and noise models are essential in charge-state detection using supervised machine learning.

TI Experimental studies on electromagnetic analogies to gravity mediated
   entanglement
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB Recently, experiments aimed at measuring gravity mediated entanglement (GME) between time-like separated objects have been proposed, which offer the possibility to examine the quantum nature of gravity using near-term technologies. There is however a debate about what could be drawn from such GME experiments: does the detection of GME verify that the gravitational field has quantum degrees of freedom, or it only verifies that the gravitational field is sourced coherently by source masses, without ascertaining the nature of quantum fields, such as Hilbert spaces, quantization or gravitons? To clarify this debate, analogies of GME in electromagnetic experiments could provide important clues. Here, for the first time we present the implementation of the analogy of GME by entangling electron and nuclear spins in a single trapped ion mediated by the electromagnetic field. The experiment clarifies that the time-like separated GME protocols support the second perspective in the above debate. Furthermore, we analyze other trapped-ion entanglement experiments in the context of the GME analogy, indicating that GME of space-like separated objects could distinguish the two perspectives in the debate. Our work helps to establish highly controllable electromagnetic analogies as testbeds for studies on the quantum nature of gravity, providing insights for designing experiments measuring the genuine GME, and sheds new light on trappedion quantum simulation.

TI High-Fidelity Detection of Large-Scale Atom Arrays in an Optical Lattice
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Recent advances in quantum simulation based on neutral atoms have largely benefited from highresolution, single-atom sensitive imaging techniques. A variety of approaches have been developed to achieve such local detection of atoms in optical lattices or optical tweezers. For alkaline-earth and alkalineearth-like atoms, the presence of narrow optical transitions opens up the possibility of performing novel types of Sisyphus cooling, where the cooling mechanism originates from the capability to spatially resolve the differential optical level shifts in the trap potential. Up to now, it has been an open question whether high-fidelity imaging could be achieved in a "repulsive Sisyphus" configuration, where the trap depth of the ground state exceeds that of the excited state involved in cooling. Here, we demonstrate high-fidelity (99.971(1)%) and high-survival (99.80(5)%) imaging of strontium atoms using repulsive Sisyphus cooling. We use an optical lattice as a pinning potential for atoms in a large-scale tweezer array with up to 399 tweezers and show repeated, high-fidelity lattice-tweezer-lattice transfers. We furthermore demonstrate loading the lattice with approximately 10 000 atoms directly from the MOT and scalable imaging over > 10 000 lattice sites with a combined survival probability and classification fidelity better than 99.2%. Our lattice thus serves as a locally addressable and sortable reservoir for continuous refilling of optical tweezer arrays in the future.

TI Ab initio modeling of quantum dot qubits: Coupling, gate
   dynamics, and robustness versus charge noise
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB Electron spins in semiconductor devices are highly promising building blocks for quantum processors (QPs). Commercial semiconductor foundries can create QPs using the same processes used for conventional chips, once the QP design is suitably specified. There is a vast accessible design space; to identify the most promising options for fabrication, one requires predictive modeling of interacting electrons in real geometries and complex nonideal environments. In this work we explore a modeling method based on real-space grids, an ab initio approach without assumptions relating to device topology and therefore with wide applicability. Given an electrode geometry, we determine the exchange coupling between quantum dot qubits, and model the full evolution of a root SWAP gate to predict qubit loss and infidelity rates for various voltage profiles. We determine full, three-dimensional solutions and introduce a method that can obtain near-identical predictions using far more efficient two-dimensional computations. Moreover we explore the impact of unwanted charge defects (static and dynamic) in the environment, and test robust pulse sequences. As an example we exhibit a sequence correcting both systematic errors and (unknown) charge defects, observing an order of magnitude boost in fidelity. The technique can thus identify the most promising device designs for fabrication, as well as bespoke control sequences for each such device.

TI Mobile ion in a Fermi sea
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB The remarkable single-particle control of individual ions combined with the versatility of ultracold atomic gases makes hybrid ion-atom systems an exciting new platform for quantum simulation of few- and many-body quantum physics. Here, we study theoretically the properties of a mobile ion immersed in a quantum degenerate gas of fermionic atoms. Using an effective low-energy atom-ion interaction together with a well-established approach that includes exactly two-body correlations, we calculate the full spectral response of the ion and demonstrate the existence of several quasiparticle branches, which are charged analogs of the Fermi polaron observed in neutral atomic gases. Due to the long-range nature of the atom-ion interaction, these ionic Fermi polarons have several properties distinct from their neutral counterparts such as the simultaneous presence of several stable states and smooth transitions from repulsive to attractive polarons with increasing interaction strength. Surprisingly, the residue of the ionic polaron is shown to increase with the Fermi density for fixed interaction strength, which is in marked contrast with the neutral polaron. The properties of the ionic polaron approach that of the neutral polaron only in the low-density limit where the average interparticle spacing is larger than the characteristic length of the atom-ion interaction. We finally analyze the effects of the Fermi gas on the molecular ions, which are bound atom-dimer states.

TI Efficient Quantum Gibbs Samplers with Kubo-Martin-Schwinger Detailed
   Balance Condition
SO COMMUNICATIONS IN MATHEMATICAL PHYSICS
AB Lindblad dynamics and other open-system dynamics provide a promising path towards efficient Gibbs sampling on quantum computers. In these proposals, the Lindbladian is obtained via an algorithmic construction akin to designing an artificial thermostat in classical Monte Carlo or molecular dynamics methods, rather than being treated as an approximation to weakly coupled system-bath unitary dynamics. Recently, Chen, Kastoryano, and Gily & eacute;n (arXiv:2311.09207) introduced the first efficiently implementable Lindbladian satisfying the Kubo-Martin-Schwinger (KMS) detailed balance condition, which ensures that the Gibbs state is a fixed point of the dynamics and is applicable to non-commuting Hamiltonians. This Gibbs sampler uses a continuously parameterized set of jump operators, and the energy resolution required for implementing each jump operator depends only logarithmically on the precision and the mixing time. In this work, we build upon the structural characterization of KMS detailed balanced Lindbladians by Fagnola and Umanit & agrave;, and develop a family of efficient quantum Gibbs samplers using a finite set of jump operators (the number can be as few as one), akin to the classical Markov chain-based sampling algorithm. Compared to the existing works, our quantum Gibbs samplers have a comparable quantum simulation cost but with greater design flexibility and a much simpler implementation and error analysis. Moreover, it encompasses the construction of Chen, Kastoryano, and Gily & eacute;n as a special instance.

TI Can't we negotiate the importance of electron correlation? HF vs RIMP2
   in ab initio quantum mechanical charge field molecular dynamics
   simulations of Cu+ in pure liquid ammonia
SO JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR LIQUIDS
AB The impact of electron correlation in quantum mechanical charge field molecular dynamics (QMCF MD) simulations of Cu+ in pure liquid ammonia has been investigated by comparing the results obtained at the Hartree-Fock (HF) level and via resolution-of-identity second order Moller-Plesset perturbation theory (RIMP2). To achieve a manageable computational demand, a rigid-body solvent model was employed to describe the NH3 molecules. The solvation structures observed in both cases have similar characteristics in which tetrahedral [Cu(NH3)(4)](+) dominates with average Cu-N distances of 2.24 (HF) and 2.12 (RIMP2) angstrom, respectively. The ligand dynamics in the first solvation shell of the RIMP2 simulation are notably higher than in the HF case and resulted in the formation of an intermediate [Cu(NH3)(3)](+) complex along the sampling period. Electron correlation effects were found to mainly impact the solvent-solvent hydrogen bonding interaction, thereby providing a more accurate description of the structural properties in terms of the average Cu-N distances along with greatly enhanced ligand exchange dynamics occurring between the first and second solvation shell.

TI Isolated flat band in artificially designed Lieb lattice based on
   macrocycle supramolecular crystal
SO COMMUNICATIONS MATERIALS
AB Isolated flat bands are known to host various strongly correlated phases due to the enhanced Coulomb interactions when the flat bands are gapped from dispersive bands. One way to achieve an isolated flat band is by breaking the on-site energy symmetry in a Lieb lattice. In this study, we demonstrate the design of such a Lieb lattice. The self-assembly of square-shaped macrocycle molecules on a Ag(111) surface forms a two-dimensional supramolecular crystal, comprising three types of nanopores with different sizes arranged in a Lieb lattice. The surface-state electrons of the Ag(111) substrate confined by these nanopores behave as quantum dots with specific energies depending on the pore size. Using scanning tunneling spectroscopy and plane-wave quantum simulation, we reveal that this artificial Lieb lattice exhibits an isolated flat band gapped at 0.16 eV from the nearest band. The supramolecular crystal is nearly defect-free and extends to sub-micrometer size, making it a practical platform for exploring the exotic properties of the isolated flat band.
   Isolated flat bands can host strongly correlated electronic phases due to the enhancement of the Coulomb interaction. Here, an isolated flat band is realized and visualized in a 2D supramolecular crystal based on self-assembled square-shaped macrocycle molecules on Ag(111) surface arranged in a Lieb lattice.

TI Route to Extend the Lifetime of a Discrete Time Crystal in a Finite Spin
   Chain without Disorder
SO ATOMS
AB Periodically driven (Floquet) systems are described by time-dependent Hamiltonians that possess discrete time translation symmetry. The spontaneous breaking of this symmetry leads to the emergence of a novel non-equilibrium phase of matter-the Discrete Time Crystal (DTC). In this paper, we propose a scheme to extend the lifetime of a DTC in a paradigmatic model-a translation-invariant Ising spin chain with nearest-neighbor interaction J, subjected to a periodic kick by a transverse magnetic field with frequency 2 pi T. This system exhibits the hallmark signature of a DTC-persistent sub-harmonic oscillations with frequency pi T-for a wide parameter regime. Employing both analytical arguments as well as exact diagonalization calculations, we demonstrate that the lifetime of the DTC is maximized, when the interaction strength is tuned to an optimal value, JT=pi. Our proposal essentially relies on an interaction-induced quantum interference mechanism that suppresses the creation of excitations, and thereby enhances the DTC lifetime. Intriguingly, we find that the period doubling oscillations can last eternally in even size systems. This anomalously long lifetime can be attributed to a time reflection symmetry that emerges at JT=pi. Our work provides a promising avenue for realizing a robust DTC in various quantum emulator platforms.

TI Multiphysics Numerical Method for Modeling Josephson Traveling-Wave
   Parametric Amplifiers
SO IEEE JOURNAL ON MULTISCALE AND MULTIPHYSICS COMPUTATIONAL TECHNIQUES
AB Josephson traveling-wave parametric amplifiers (JTWPAs) are wideband, ultralow-noise amplifiers used to enable the readout of superconducting qubits. While individual JTWPAs have achieved high performance, behavior between devices is inconsistent due to wide manufacturing tolerances. Amplifier designs could be modified to improve resilience towards variations in amplifier components; however, existing device models often rely on analytical techniques that typically fail to incorporate component variations. To begin addressing this issue, a 1D numerical method for modeling JTWPAs is introduced in this work. The method treats the Josephson junctions and transmission lines in an amplifier as coupled subsystems and can easily incorporate arbitrary parameter variations. We discretize the transmission line subsystem with a finite element time domain method and the Josephson junction subsystem with a finite difference method, with leap-frog time marching used to evolve the system in time. We validate our method by comparing the computed gain to an analytical model for a traditional JTWPA architecture and one with resonant phase matching. We then use our method to demonstrate the impact of variations in Josephson junctions and phase-matching resonators on amplification. In future work, the method will be adjusted to incorporate additional amplifier architectures and extended to a 3D full-wave approach.

TI Order-by-disorder in the antiferromagnetic
   J1-J2-J3 transverse-field Ising model
   on the ruby lattice
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB We investigate the quantum phase diagram of the J(1)-J(2)-J(3) antiferromagnetic transverse-field Ising model on the ruby lattice. In the low-field limit we derive an effective quantum dimer model, analyzing how the extensive ground-state degeneracy at zero field is lifted by an order-by-disorder scenario. We support our analysis by studying the gap closing of the high-field phase using series expansions. For J(2) > J(3), we find a columnar phase at low fields, followed by a clock-ordered phase stabilized by resonating plaquettes at intermediate field values, and an emergent three-dimensional (3D)-XY quantum phase transition to the polarized high-field phase. For J(3) > J(2), an order-by-disorder mechanism stabilizes a distinct k = (0, 0) order and a quantum phase transition in the 3DIsing universality class is observed. Further, we discuss the possible implementation of the columnar- and clockordered phase in existing Rydberg atom quantum simulators. When taking into account the full algebraically decaying long-range interactions on the ruby lattice, we find that long-range interactions favor the same ground state as the quantum fluctuations induced by a transverse field, which could make the ruby lattice a promising candidate for the realization of a clock-ordered phase.

TI Multi-scale alignment to buried atom-scale devices using Kelvin probe
   force microscopy
SO NANOTECHNOLOGY REVIEWS
AB Fabrication of quantum devices by atomic-scale patterning with scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) has led to the development of single/few atom transistors, few-donor/quantum dot devices for spin manipulation, and arrayed few-donor devices for analog quantum simulation. We have developed atomic precision lithography, dopant incorporation, device encapsulation, ex situ device re-location, and contact processes to enable high-yield device fabrication. In this work, we describe a multiscale alignment strategy using Kelvin probe force microscopy to enable the alignment of buried device components to electronic support structures such as source/drain leads, in-plane and top gates, and waveguides while preserving flexibility in the placement of fabricated STM patterns. The required spatial accuracy to bridge the sub-micrometer scale central region of the device to millimeter scale large wire-bond pads is achieved through a multi-step alignment process at various stages of fabrication, including atom-scale device fabrication using STM, re-location and registration, and electron beam lithography for contact leads and pads. This alignment strategy allows imaging small device regions as well as large-scale fiducial marks, thereby bridging the gap from nanometer STM patterns to the millimeter-scale electrical contact fabrication with a 95% yield on more than 150 devices fabricated to date.

TI Experimental realization of an extended Fermi-Hubbard model using a 2D
   lattice of dopant-based quantum dots
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB The Hubbard model is an essential tool for understanding many-body physics in condensed matter systems. Artificial lattices of dopants in silicon are a promising method for the analog quantum simulation of extended Fermi-Hubbard Hamiltonians in the strong interaction regime. However, complex atom-based device fabrication requirements have meant emulating a tunable two-dimensional Fermi-Hubbard Hamiltonian in silicon has not been achieved. Here, we fabricate 3 x 3 arrays of single/few-dopant quantum dots with finite disorder and demonstrate tuning of the electron ensemble using gates and probe the many-body states using quantum transport measurements. By controlling the lattice constants, we tune the hopping amplitude and long-range interactions and observe the finite-size analogue of a transition from metallic to Mott insulating behavior. We simulate thermally activated hopping and Hubbard band formation using increased temperatures. As atomically precise fabrication continues to improve, these results enable a new class of engineered artificial lattices to simulate interactive fermionic models.
   Atomically precise artificial lattices of dopant-based quantum dots offer a tunable platform for simulations of interacting fermionic models. By leveraging advances in fabrication and atomic-state control, Wang et al. report quantum simulations of the 2D Fermi-Hubbard model on a 3 x 3 few-dopant quantum dot array.

TI First-Principles Simulation of the Interaction Between DNA Nucleotides
   and One-Dimensional Carbon Chain in Electrical Based Sequencing
SO IEEE OPEN JOURNAL OF NANOTECHNOLOGY
AB Electrical DNA sequencing has attracted significant attention in recent years due to its simplified sequencing protocol, compact sequencing system, and relatively low sequencing cost. In the design and fabrication of the sequencing device, carbon-based nanomaterials such as graphene have been explored as a promising sensing material that provides an excellent combination of spatial resolution and base specificity. Using first-principles simulation, we determined the effect on the electrical conductivity of a one-dimensional carbon chain due to the presence of four DNA bases. The simulation results indicate that the interaction between the carbon chain and different DNA bases leads to different levels of conductivity change in the carbon chain. Quantitatively, base A is the most difficult base to detect due to its relatively small current change. Furthermore, the results also show that the relative orientation of the bases with respect to the carbon chain can affect the induced current change in the chain. This information can be used to optimize the structural design of future sequencing devices. Collectively, the first-principles simulation results suggest the integration of a one-dimensional carbon chain with supporting nanofluidic designs can provide a viable approach towards the development of a compact, robust, and high-resolution DNA sequencing system.

TI Integrability Breaking and Bound States in Google's Decorated XXZ
   Circuits
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Recent quantum simulation by Google [Nature 612, 240 (2022)] has demonstrated the formation of bound states of interacting photons in a quantum-circuit version of the XXZ spin chain. While such bound states are protected by integrability in a one-dimensional chain, the experiment found the bound states to be unexpectedly robust when integrability was broken by decorating the circuit with additional qubits, at least for small numbers of qubits (<= 24) within the experimental capability. Here we scrutinize this result by state-of-the-art classical simulations, which greatly exceed the experimental system sizes and provide a benchmark for future studies in larger circuits. We find that the bound states consisting of afinite number of photons are indeed robust in the nonintegrable regime, even after scaling to the infinite-time and infinitesystem size limit. Moreover, we show that such systems possess unusual spectral properties, with level statistics that deviates from the random matrix theory expectation. On the other hand, for low but finite density of photons, we find a much faster onset of thermalization and significantly weaker signatures of bound states, suggesting that anomalous dynamics may only be a property of dilute systems with zero density of photons in the thermodynamic limit. The robustness of the bound states is also influenced by the number of decoration qubits and, to a lesser degree, by the regularity of their spatial arrangement.

TI About electron transport and spin control in semiconductor devices
SO SOLID-STATE ELECTRONICS
AB As the scaling of CMOS-based technology displays signs of an imminent saturation, employing the second intrinsic electron characteristics - the electron spin - is attractive to further boost the performance of integrated circuits and to introduce new computational paradigms. A single electron spin forms a qubit and is suitable for quantum applications. In digital applications, the spin promises to offer an additional functionality to charge -based CMOS circuitry. Recently, spin injection into a semiconductor and spin manipulation by the gate voltage were successfully demonstrated providing a vision that devices using spin in addition to charge may appear in significant numbers on the market in the non-distant future. On the memory side, the nonvolatile CMOS-compatible spin-transfer torque (STT) and the spin-orbit torque (SOT) magnetoresistive random access memories (MRAMs) are already competing with flash memory and SRAM for embedded applications. A combination of nonvolatile elements with CMOS circuitry allows to shift the data processing into the nonvolatile segment, paving the way for a novel low power computational paradigm based on logic-in-memory and in-memory computing architectures. To model MRAM, we innovatively extend the spin and charge transport equations to multi-layered structures consisting of normal and ferromagnetic metal layers separated by tunnel barriers. We validate our approach by modeling the magnetization dynamics in ultra-scaled MRAM cells.

TI Circulating free DNA in the plasma of individuals with neurofibromatosis
   type 1
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF MEDICAL GENETICS PART A
AB Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is an autosomal dominant syndrome whose characteristic manifestations include benign neurofibromas, yet NF1 is also associated with a high risk of cancer. Measurements of circulating free plasma DNA (cfDNA) are gaining wider applicability in cancer diagnostics, targeting of therapy, and monitoring of therapeutic response. Individuals with NF1 are likely to be followed up using this method, but the effects of NF1 and neurofibromas on cfDNA levels are not known. We studied peripheral blood samples from 19 adults with NF1 and 12 healthy controls. The cfDNA was isolated from plasma with QIAamp Circulating Nucleic Acid Kit and quantified using the Qubit 2.0 Fluorometer. The cfDNA concentration of each sample was normalized relative to the plasma protein concentration. The normalized median concentration of cfDNA in plasma was 19.3 ng/ml (range 6.6-78.6) among individuals with NF1 and 15.9 ng/ml (range 4.8-47.0) among controls (p = .369). Individuals with NF1 who also had plexiform neurofibroma (pNF) showed non-significantly elevated cfDNA concentration compared to individuals with NF1 and without known pNF (median 25.4 vs. 18.8 ng/ml, p = .122). The effect of NF1 on cfDNA seems to be relatively small and NF1 is therefore unlikely to hamper the use of cfDNA-based assays.

TI Spin and quadrupole correlations by three-spin interaction in the
   frustrated pyrochlore magnet
   Tb2+xT2-xO7+y
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB We have investigated the origin of the magnetic dipole correlations <sigma(z)(Q)sigma(z)(-Q)> characterized by the modulation wave vector k similar to (1/2, 1/2, 1/2) observed in the frustrated pyrochlore magnet Tb2+x,Ti2-x,O7+y. This magnetic short- range order cannot be accounted for by adding further-neighbor exchange interactions to the nearest-neighbor pseudospin-1/2 Hamiltonian for quantum pyrochlore magnets. Using classical Monte Carlo simulation and quantum simulation based on thermally pure quantum (TPQ) states we have shown that the spin correlations with k similar to (1/2, 1/2, 1/2) are induced at low temperatures by a three-spin interaction of a form sigma(+/-)(r)sigma(z)(r')sigma(z)(r ''),which is a correction to the Hamiltonian due to the low crystal-field excitation. Simulations using TPQ states have shown that the spin correlations coexist with electric quadrupole correlations <sigma(alpha)(Q)sigma(beta)(-Q)> (alpha, beta = x, y) with k similar to 0. These results suggest that the putative quantum spin liquid state of Tb2+xTi2-xO7+y, is located close to phase boundaries of the spin-ice, quadrupole-ordered, and magnetic-ordered states in the classical approximation, and that the three-spin interaction brings about a quantum disordered ground state with both spin and quadrupole correlations.

TI Experimental demonstration of adversarial examples in learning
   topological phases
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Machine learning has been applied to problems in condensed matter physics, but its performance in an experimental setting needs testing. Zhang et al. study the effects of adversarial perturbations on a neural-network-based topological phase classifier, applied to experimental data from an NV center in diamond.
   Classification and identification of different phases and the transitions between them is a central task in condensed matter physics. Machine learning, which has achieved dramatic success in a wide range of applications, holds the promise to bring unprecedented perspectives for this challenging task. However, despite the exciting progress made along this direction, the reliability of machine-learning approaches in experimental settings demands further investigation. Here, with the nitrogen-vacancy center platform, we report a proof-of-principle experimental demonstration of adversarial examples in learning topological phases. We show that the experimental noises are more likely to act as adversarial perturbations when a larger percentage of the input data are dropped or unavailable for the neural network-based classifiers. We experimentally implement adversarial examples which can deceive the phase classifier with a high confidence, while keeping the topological properties of the simulated Hopf insulators unchanged. Our results explicitly showcase the crucial vulnerability aspect of applying machine learning techniques in experiments to classify phases of matter, which can benefit future studies in this interdisciplinary field.

TI Classical shadows with improved median-of-means estimation
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB The classical shadows protocol, introduced by Huang et al (2020 Nat. Phys. 16 1050), makes use of the median-of-means (MoM) estimator to efficiently estimate the expectation values of M observables with failure probability delta using only O(log(M/delta)) measurements. In their analysis, Huang et al used loose constants in their asymptotic performance bounds for simplicity. However, the specific values of these constants can significantly affect the number of shots used in practical implementations. To address this, we studied a modified MoM estimator proposed by Minsker (2023 Proc. 36th Conf. on Learning Theory (PMLR) 195 5925) that uses optimal constants and involves a U-statistic over the data set. For efficient estimation, we implemented two types of incomplete U-statistics estimators, the first based on random sampling and the second based on cyclically permuted sampling. We compared the performance of the original and modified estimators when used with the classical shadows protocol with single-qubit Clifford unitaries (Pauli measurements) for an Ising spin chain, and global Clifford unitaries (Clifford measurements) for the Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger state. While the original estimator outperformed the modified estimators for Pauli measurements, the modified estimators showed improved performance over the original estimator for Clifford measurements. Our findings highlight the importance of tailoring estimators to specific measurement settings to optimize the performance of the classical shadows protocol in practical applications.

TI Convergence and quantum advantage of Trotterized MERA for
   strongly-correlated systems
SO QUANTUM
AB Strongly-correlated quantum many-body systems are difficult to study and simulate classically. We recently proposed a variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) based on the multiscale entanglement renormalization ansatz (MERA) with tensors constrained to certain Trotter circuits. Here, we determine the scaling of computation costs for various critical spin chains which substantiates a polynomial quantum advantage in comparison to classical MERA simulations based on exact energy gradients or variational Monte Carlo. Algorithmic phase diagrams suggest an even greater separation for higher-dimensional systems. Hence, the Trotterized MERA VQE is a promising route for the efficient investigation of strongly-correlated quantum many-body systems on quantum computers. Furthermore, we show how the convergence can be substantially improved by building up the MERA layer by layer in the initialization stage and by scanning through the phase diagram during optimization. For the Trotter circuits being composed of single-qubit and twoqubit rotations, it is experimentally advantageous to have small rotation angles. We find that the average angle amplitude can be reduced considerably with negligible effect on the energy accuracy. Benchmark simulations suggest that the structure of the Trotter circuits for the TMERA tensors is not decisive; in particular, brick-wall circuits and parallel random-pair circuits yield very similar energy accuracies.

TI Anionic nanocellulose as competing agent in microbial DNA extraction
   from mine process samples
SO JOURNAL OF MICROBIOLOGICAL METHODS
AB Microorganisms in flotation and minerals processing may significantly affect the grade and yield of metal concentrates. However, studying the phenomena requires working techniques to detach microorganisms and their DNA from mineral particles to which they strongly adhere. We developed a new method utilizing the competitive properties of anionic nanocellulose to block sorption of DNA to and detach microbial cells from mineral particles from ore processing. In general, up to one ng DNA mL-1 sample was obtained with the custom anionic nanocellulose method (CM) compared to DNA amounts below the Qubit assay's detection limit for extractions with a commercial kit (KIT). Similarly, 0.5-4 orders of magnitude more bacterial 16S and fungal 5.8S rRNA gene copies were detected by qPCR from CM treated samples compared to KIT extractions. A clear difference in the detected microbial community structure between CM and KIT extracted samples was also observed. Commercial kits optimized for mineral soils are easy to use and time efficient but may miss a considerable part of the microbial communities. A competing agent such as anionic nanocellulose may decrease the interaction between microorganisms or their DNA and minerals and provide a comprehensive view into the microbial communities in mineral processing environments.

TI Broadband parametric amplification for multiplexed SiMOS quantum dot
   signals
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB Spins in semiconductor quantum dots hold great promise as building blocks of quantum processors. Trapping them in SiMOS transistorlike devices eases future industrial-scale fabrication. Among the potentially scalable readout solutions, gate-based dispersive radio-frequency reflectometry only requires the already existing transistor gates to read a quantum dot state, which alleviates the need for additional elements. In this effort toward scalability, traveling-wave superconducting parametric amplifiers significantly enhance the readout signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) by reducing the noise below that of typical cryogenic low-noise amplifiers, while offering a broad amplification band, essential to multiplex the readout of multiple resonators. In this work, we demonstrate a 3-GHz gate-based reflectometry readout of electron charge states trapped in quantum dots formed in SiMOS multigate devices, with SNR enhanced due to a Josephson traveling-wave parametric amplifier (JTWPA). The broad tunable 2-GHz amplification bandwidth combined with more than 10-dB ON-OFF SNR improvement of the JTWPA enables frequency and time-division-multiplexed readout of interdot transitions, and noise performance consistent with JTWPA characteristics at higher frequencies. In addition, owing to a design without superconducting loops and with a metallic ground plane, the JTWPA is flux insensitive and shows stable performance up to a magnetic field of 1.1 T at the quantum dot device, compatible with standard SiMOS spin-qubit experiments.

TI Cryptanalysis and improvement of efficient multiparty quantum secret
   sharing based on a novel structure and single qubits
SO EPJ QUANTUM TECHNOLOGY
AB In the paper (EPJ Quant. Technol. 10:29, 2023), Kuo et al. proposed a multiparty quantum secret sharing protocol based on a novel structure and single qubits. Owing to the absence of an entanglement state, the proposed protocol is more practical than other quantum secret sharing protocols which use entanglement properties. Therefore, we study the security of the proposed protocol and find there exists a security loophole in the n-party ( n >= 4 \documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$n\geq 4$\end{document} ) secret sharing case in it, that is, two dishonest agents can collude to obtain (part of) Alice's secret without the help of the other agents. In order to overcome the security loophole, we give an improved protocol and make a security analysis for it. By calculating, the qubit efficiency of the three-party case in it is equal to 1 8 \documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$\frac{1}{8}$\end{document} , which is higher than that in Hillery et al.'s protocol (Phys.

TI Sectional curvatures distribution of complexity geometry
SO JOURNAL OF HIGH ENERGY PHYSICS
AB In the geometric approach to defining complexity, operator complexity is defined as the distance in the operator space. In this paper, based on the analogy with the circuit complexity, the operator size is adopted as the metric of the operator space where the path length is the complexity. The typical sectional curvatures of this complexity geometry are positive. It is further proved that the typical sectional curvatures are always positive if the metric is an arbitrary function of operator size, while complexity geometry is usually expected to be defined on negatively curved manifolds. By analyzing the sectional curvatures distribution for the N-qubit system, it is shown that surfaces generated by Hamiltonians of size smaller than the typical size can have negative curvatures. In the large N limit, the form of complexity metric is uniquely constrained up to constant corrections if we require sectional curvatures are of order 1/N-2. With the knowledge of states, the operator size should be modified due to the redundant action of operators, and thus is generalized to be state-dependent. Then we use this state-dependent operator size as the metric of the Hilbert space to define state complexity. It can also be shown that in the Hilbert space, 2-surfaces generated by operators of size much smaller than the typical size acting on typical states also have negative curvatures.

TI Subleading conformal dimensions at the O(4) Wilson-Fisher fixed point
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
AB In this work we focus on computing the conformal dimensions D(j(L),J(R) ) of local fields that transform in an irreducible representation of SU(2) x SU(2) labeled with (j(L), j(R)) at the O(4) Wilson-Fisher fixed point using the Monte Carlo method. In the large charge expansion, among the sectors with a fixed large value of j = max(j(L), j(R)), the leading sector has vertical bar j(L) - j(R)vertical bar = 0 and the subleading one has vertical bar jL - j(R)vertical bar = 1. Since Monte Carlo calculations at large j become challenging in the traditional lattice formulation of the 0(4) model, a qubit regularized O(4) lattice model was used recently to compute D(j, j). Here we extend those calculations to the subleading sector. Our Monte Carlo results in the range 2 <= j <= 20 fit well to the expected large j expansion D(j, j - 1) - D(j, j) similar to lambda(0) +lambda(1/2)/root j+ lambda(1)/j + 3/2/j(3/2), but we have to assume that at least one of the purely quantum mechanical contributions lambda(0) or lambda(1) is nonzero. Assuming lambda(0) = 0 as conjectured recently, we find lambda(1/2) approximate to 2.1(1), lambda(1) approximate to 2.3(2), and lambda(3/2) approximate to 1.2(2).

TI Static properties of two linearly coupled discrete circuits
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS B-ATOMIC MOLECULAR AND OPTICAL PHYSICS
AB Bosonic two-ring ladders constitute an important class of atomtronic circuits, where coherent current flows not only can offer a new insight into many-body physics, but also can play the role of actual degrees of freedom, and hence allow for a viable implementation of cold-atom based devices and qubit systems. In this work, we exhaustively investigate the ground state properties and the low-lying energy spectrum of two linearly coupled Bose-Hubbard rings. We show that the competition among interactions, intra- and inter-ring hopping processes gives place to a rather rich physical scenario, where Mott-like states and (different kinds of) superfluid-like states emerge. The latter ones depend also on the (in)commensurate filling of the atoms. Our analysis, carried out within a simple analytical framework and by means of the exact numerical diagonalization of the system Hamiltonian, provides one with a rather complete characterization of the static properties of the two-ring ladder, including, but not limited to, coherence, fragmentation, correlations, and entanglement. We complement our investigation by studying how these indicators depend on the commensurability of the total number of bosons with respect to the total number of sites and show that the two stacked rings are always entangled for an odd number of atoms.

TI Simulation model of the performance of a mid-wave infrared Ga-free type
   2 superlattice barrier photodetector
SO JOURNAL OF ASTRONOMICAL TELESCOPES INSTRUMENTS AND SYSTEMS
AB A numerical model has been developed to simulate mid-wave infrared Ga-free InAs/InAsSb type 2 superlattice (T2SL) unipolar barrier (XBn) technology-based photodetectors. The model has been extensively studied to evaluate the effects of doping levels and the thickness of both the absorber and barrier layers on key metrics such as dark current (DC) and quantum efficiency (QE). The model utilizes the nextnano 8-band k<middle dot>p theory and optics module to solve the Schr & ouml;dinger equation and compute the band dispersion and the absorption coefficient. The band dispersion of the structure demonstrates the formation of minibands, indicating the carrier's delocalization. This crucial condition allows us to consider the T2SL as a bulk material. Material parameters such as band gap energy, electron and hole effective masses, intrinsic concentration, and extinction coefficient are extracted from the quantum simulation results and input into the Technology Computer-Aided Design software by Silvaco. The software solves the Poisson drift-diffusion continuity equations to compute the DC and QE. The model has been validated using experimental results from existing literature, demonstrating good agreement with experimental findings, making it an effective tool for designing and predicting the performance of Ga-free T2SL XBn technology-based structures.

TI Accurately computing the electronic properties of a quantum ring
SO NATURE
AB A promising approach to study condensed-matter systems is to simulate them on an engineered quantum platform(1-4). However, the accuracy needed to outperform classical methods has not been achieved so far. Here, using 18 superconducting qubits, we provide an experimental blueprint for an accurate condensed-matter simulator and demonstrate how to investigate fundamental electronic properties. We benchmark the underlying method by reconstructing the single-particle band structure of a one-dimensional wire. We demonstrate nearly complete mitigation of decoherence and readout errors, and measure the energy eigenvalues of this wire with an error of approximately 0.01 rad, whereas typical energy scales are of the order of 1 rad. Insight into the fidelity of this algorithm is gained by highlighting the robust properties of a Fourier transform, including the ability to resolve eigenenergies with a statistical uncertainty of 10(-4) rad. We also synthesize magnetic flux and disordered local potentials, which are two key tenets of a condensed-matter system. When sweeping the magnetic flux we observe avoided level crossings in the spectrum, providing a detailed fingerprint of the spatial distribution of local disorder. By combining these methods we reconstruct electronic properties of the eigenstates, observing persistent currents and a strong suppression of conductance with added disorder. Our work describes an accurate method for quantum simulation(5,6) and paves the way to study new quantum materials with superconducting qubits.

TI Unconditionally superposition-robust entangled state in all multiparty
   quantum systems
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We investigate the inseparability of states generated by superposition of a multipartite pure entangled state with a product state. In particular, we identify specific multipartite entangled states that will always produce inseparability after superposition with an arbitrary completely product state. Thus, these entangled states are unconditionally superposition robust, and we refer to this phenomenon as "unconditional inseparability of superposition" in multipartite quantum systems. In this way, we complete the picture of unconditional inseparability of superposition which was introduced earlier for bipartite systems. We also characterize the superposition of a multipartite pure entangled state with a pure biseparable state. However, the present analysis allows us to obtain a more general result, viz., there exists at least one pure entangled state in any multipartite Hilbert space such that its superposition with an arbitrary completely product state always yields an entangled state. On the other hand, for any bipartite pure entangled state, if at least one of the subsystems is a qubit, then it is always possible to find a suitable product state such that the superposition of the entangled state and the product state produces a product state. In this way, we find a feature of multipartite quantum systems which is in sharp contrast with that of bipartite ones. We then show how unconditional inseparability of superposition can be useful in exhibiting an indistinguishability property within the local unambiguous state discrimination problem.

TI Conservation of correlation in measurements underlying the violation of
   Bell inequalities and a game of joint mapping
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB What compels quantum measurement to violate the Bell inequalities? Suppose that regardless of measurement, one can assign to a spin-21 particle (qubit) a definite value of spin, called c-valued spin variable, but it may take any continuous real number. Suppose further that measurement maps the c-valued spin variable from the continuous range of possible values onto the binary standard quantum spin values +/- 1 while preserving the bipartite correlation. Here, we show that such c-valued spin variables can indeed be constructed. In this model, one may therefore argue that it is the requirement of conservation of correlation which compels quantum measurement to violate the Bell inequalities when the prepared state is entangled. We then discuss a statistical game which captures the model of measurement, wherein two parties are asked to independently map a specific ensemble of pairs of real numbers onto pairs of binary numbers +/- 1, under the requirement that the correlation is preserved. The conservation of correlation forces the game to respect the Bell theorem, which implies that there is a class of games no classical (i.e., local and deterministic) strategy can ever win. On the other hand, a quantum strategy with an access to an ensemble of entangled spin-21 particles and circuits for local quantum spin measurement can be used to win the game.

TI A solid-state quantum microscope for wavefunction control of an
   atom-based quantum dot device in silicon
SO NATURE ELECTRONICS
AB A scanning tunnelling microscope, operating on an insulating substrate, can be used to perform spatially resolved wavefunction spectroscopy and local gate control of a quantum dot device consisting of phosphorus atoms in silicon.
   Quantum states of atomic systems can be directly addressed using quantum optical microscopes. However, solid-state microscopy techniques cannot typically achieve both local measurements and control of the state due to their measurement mechanism or the presence of a globally conductive substrate that impedes local gate control. Here we report a solid-state quantum microscope that can control and locally probe the wavefunctions of atomic quantum dots in silicon. Our microscope consists of a scanning tunnelling microscope tip, source and gate electrodes defined on an insulating silicon substrate by subsurface antimony implantation and phosphorus dopants incorporated with atomic precision. In contrast to conventional semiconductor qubit devices, the macroscopic electrodes are fabricated before patterning the nanoscale elements. A light-assisted method is designed to make the substrate conductive to stabilize the microscope tip close to the quantum dots, before reversing to an insulator for local gating and spectroscopy. We show that the microscope can be used to tune and map the charge states of single and double quantum dots, as well as control the relative electrochemical potential between two dots.

TI Performance Assessment of Ultrascaled Vacuum Gate Dielectric
   MoS2 Field-Effect Transistors: Avoiding Oxide Instabilities
   in Radiation Environments
SO MICROMACHINES
AB Gate dielectrics are essential components in nanoscale field-effect transistors (FETs), but they often face significant instabilities when exposed to harsh environments, such as radioactive conditions, leading to unreliable device performance. In this paper, we evaluate the performance of ultrascaled transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) FETs equipped with vacuum gate dielectric (VGD) as a means to circumvent oxide-related instabilities. The nanodevice is computationally assessed using a quantum simulation approach based on the self-consistent solutions of the Poisson equation and the quantum transport equation under the ballistic transport regime. The performance evaluation includes analysis of the transfer characteristics, subthreshold swing, on-state and off-state currents, current ratio, and scaling limits. Simulation results demonstrate that the investigated VGD TMD FET, featuring a gate-all-around (GAA) configuration, a TMD-based channel, and a thin vacuum gate dielectric, collectively compensates for the low dielectric constant of the VGD, enabling exceptional electrostatic control. This combination ensures superior switching performance in the ultrascaled regime, achieving a high current ratio and steep subthreshold characteristics. These findings position the GAA-VGD TMD FET as a promising candidate for advanced radiation-hardened nanoelectronics.

TI Tensor-network study of correlation-spreading dynamics in the
   two-dimensional Bose-Hubbard model
SO COMMUNICATIONS PHYSICS
AB Recent developments in analog quantum simulators based on cold atoms and trapped ions call for cross-validating the accuracy of quantum-simulation experiments with use of quantitative numerical methods; however, it is particularly challenging for dynamics of systems with more than one spatial dimension. Here we demonstrate that a tensor-network method running on classical computers is useful for this purpose. We specifically analyze real-time dynamics of the two-dimensional Bose-Hubbard model after a sudden quench starting from the Mott insulator by means of the tensor-network method based on infinite projected entangled pair states. Calculated single-particle correlation functions are found to be in good agreement with a recent experiment. By estimating the phase and group velocities from the single-particle and density-density correlation functions, we predict how these velocities vary in the moderate interaction region, which serves as a quantitative benchmark for future experiments and numerical simulations.
   Quantitative numerical simulations on classical computers are integral to analog quantum simulator experiments. This work studies the propagation of correlations in the out of equilibrium dynamics of the Bose-Hubbard model in two dimensions via tensor-network methods, comparing to predictions in known limits and a recent experiment, also covering the intermediate regime of moderate interactions.

TI Hyperfine-mediated spin relaxation in donor-atom qubits in silicon
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Donor electron spin qubits hosted within nanoscale devices have demonstrated seconds-long relaxation times at magnetic fields suitable for the operation of spin qubits in silicon of B = 1.5 T. The relaxation rates of these qubits have been shown at milliKelvin temperatures to be mediated by spin-orbit coupling with a B5 dependency on magnetic field for B > 3 T with a transition to a B3 dependency at magnetic fields below (B 3 T). This deviation has been observed in many spin qubit systems but is particularly notable in multidonor quantum dot qubits. The reason for this has remained a mystery. In this paper we show that for these multidonor low noise, crystalline qubits this deviation at low magnetic fields can be explained by a hyperfine mediated relaxation mechanism of the electron spin through a quantitative model of the relaxation rates. This model identifies the importance of donor nuclear spin flips which are more apparent in multidonor systems in which the larger numbers of donor nuclei creates stronger confinement potentials and enhanced hyperfine couplings. We show theoretically that with atomic precision engineering of the locations of the donor nuclei in these multidonor quantum dot qubits, and/or nuclear spin control, we can minimize the hyperfine mediated relaxation allowing T1 to extend to similar to 200 seconds (B = 1.5 T).

TI Interpretable correlator Transformer for image-like quantum matter data
SO MACHINE LEARNING-SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Due to their inherent capabilities of capturing non-local dependencies, Transformer neural networks have quickly been established as the paradigmatic architecture for large language models and image processing. Next to these traditional applications, machine learning (ML) methods have also been demonstrated to be versatile tools in the analysis of image-like data of quantum phases of matter, e.g. given snapshots of many-body wave functions obtained in ultracold atom experiments. While local correlation structures in image-like data of physical systems can reliably be detected, identifying phases of matter characterized by global, non-local structures with interpretable ML methods remains a challenge. Here, we introduce the correlator Transformer (CoTra), which classifies different phases of matter while at the same time yielding full interpretability in terms of physical correlation functions. The network's underlying structure is a tailored attention mechanism, which learns efficient ways to weigh local and non-local correlations for a successful classification. We demonstrate the versatility of the CoTra by detecting local order in the Heisenberg antiferromagnet, and show that local gauge constraints in one- and two-dimensional lattice gauge theories can be identified. Furthermore, we establish that the CoTra reliably detects non-local structures in images of correlated fermions in momentum space (Cooper pairs) and that it can distinguish percolating from non-percolating images.

TI Photophysics of O-band and transition metal color centers in monolithic

SO COMMUNICATIONS PHYSICS
AB Color centers in the O-band (1260-1360 nm) are crucial for realizing long-coherence quantum network nodes in memory-assisted quantum communications. However, only a limited number of O-band color centers have been thoroughly explored in silicon hosts as spin-photon interfaces. This study explores and compares two promising O-band color centers in silicon for high-fidelity spin-photon interfaces: T and *Cu (transition metal) centers. During T center generation process, we observed the formation and dissolution of other color centers, including the copper-silver related centers with a doublet line around 1312 nm (*Cun0\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$${{{\rm{Cu}}}}_{n}<^>{0}$$\end{document}), near the optical fiber zero dispersion wavelength (around 1310 nm).

TI Optimized Protocol for High-Quality RNA Extraction from Grape Berry
   Skins Using Sorbitol Pre-Wash
SO PLANTS-BASEL
AB Extracting high-quality RNA from grape (Vitis Vinifera) berry skins is challenging due to their high levels of polysaccharides, phenolic compounds, sugars, and organic acids, which can negatively impact RNA purity and yield. Indeed, polyphenols can bind to RNA, polysaccharides may co-precipitate, and sugars and organic acids can interfere with the pH and ionic properties of the extraction buffer. Commercial kits offer a quick extraction method but are often ineffective for grape berry skins. Similarly, protocols that work well for other vegetal tissues are also inefficient and time-consuming for this tissue. To overcome these limitations, we optimized the RNA isolation by adding a sorbitol pre-wash step to both a non-commercial protocol and a commercial kit. Our results show that it significantly improves the RNA yield and quality from grape berry skins, increasing the RNA purity and integrity, as evidenced by higher RIN (RNA Integrity Number) values and better Qubit and Nanodrop measurements. The strategy's efficacy was further validated through RNA sequencing, yielding high-quality reads with low error rates, suitable for gene expression studies. Thus, incorporating a sorbitol pre-wash step improves the RNA yield and quality from grape berry skins making it suitable for high-throughput sequencing, and provides a reliable tool for advancing grapevine research.

TI Towards large-scale quantum optimization solvers with few qubits
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Quantum computers hold the promise of more efficient combinatorial optimization solvers, which could be game-changing for a broad range of applications. However, a bottleneck for materializing such advantages is that, in order to challenge classical algorithms in practice, mainstream approaches require a number of qubits prohibitively large for near-term hardware. Here we introduce a variational solver for MaxCut problems over m=O(nk)\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$m={{\mathcal{O}}}({n}<^>{k})$$\end{document} binary variables using only n qubits, with tunable k > 1. The number of parameters and circuit depth display mild linear and sublinear scalings in m, respectively. Moreover, we analytically prove that the specific qubit-efficient encoding brings in a super-polynomial mitigation of barren plateaus as a built-in feature. Altogether, this leads to high quantum-solver performances. For instance, for m = 7000, numerical simulations produce solutions competitive in quality with state-of-the-art classical solvers. In turn, for m = 2000, experiments with n = 17 trapped-ion qubits feature MaxCut approximation ratios estimated to be beyond the hardness threshold 0.941. Our findings offer an interesting heuristics for quantum-inspired solvers as well as a promising route towards solving commercially-relevant problems on near-term quantum devices.

TI Prokaryotic communities profiling of Indonesian hot springs using
   long-read Oxford Nanopore sequencing
SO BMC RESEARCH NOTES
AB ObjectivesIndonesia's location at the convergence of multiple tectonic plates results in a unique geomorphological feature with abundant hot springs. This study pioneers the metagenomic exploration of Indonesian hot springs, harbouring unique life forms despite high temperatures. The microbial community of hot springs is taxonomically versatile and biotechnologically valuable. 16s rRNA amplicon sequencing of the metagenome is a viable option for the microbiome investigation. This study utilized Oxford Nanopore's long-read 16 S rRNA sequencing for enhanced species identification, improved detection of rare members, and a more detailed community composition profile.Data descriptionWater samples were taken from three hot springs of the Bali, Indonesia (i) Angseri, 8.362503 S, 115.133452 E; (ii) Banjar, 8.210270 S, 114.967063 E; and (iii) Batur, 8.228806 S, 115.404829 E. BioLit Genomic DNA Extraction Kit (SRL, Mumbai, India) was used to isolate DNA from water samples. The quantity and quality of the DNA were determined using a NanoDrop (TM) spectrophotometer and a Qubit fluorometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA). The library was created using Oxford Nanopore Technology kits, and the sequencing was done using Oxford Nanopore's GridION platform. All sequencing data was obtained in FASTQ files and filtered using NanoFilt software. This dataset is valuable for searching novel bacteria diversity and their existence.

TI TOF-SIMS analysis of decoherence sources in superconducting qubits
SO APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS
AB Superconducting qubits have emerged as a potentially foundational platform technology for addressing complex computational problems deemed intractable with classical computing. Despite recent advances enabling multiqubit designs that exhibit coherence lifetimes on the order of hundreds of mu s, material quality and interfacial structures continue to curb device performance. Two-level system defects in the thin superconducting film and adjacent dielectric regions introduce stochastic noise and dissipate electromagnetic energy at the cryogenic operating temperatures. In this study, we utilize time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry to understand the role specific fabrication procedures play in introducing such dissipation mechanisms in these complex systems. We interrogated Nb thin films and transmon qubit structures fabricated through slight modifications in the processing and vacuum conditions. We find that when the Nb film is sputtered onto the Si substrate, oxide and silicide regions are generated at various interfaces. We also observe that impurity species, such as niobium hydrides and carbides, are incorporated within the niobium layer during the subsequent lithographic patterning steps. The formation of these resistive compounds likely impacts the superconducting properties of the Nb thin film. Additionally, we observe the presence of halogen species distributed throughout the patterned thin films. We conclude by hypothesizing the source of such impurities in these structures in an effort to intelligently fabricate superconducting qubits and extend coherence times moving forward.

TI Electronic and optical properties of transition metal impurities in GaN
   and AlN
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB The optical properties of Cr(III) impurities are well studied and exploited in alpha-Al2O3, which enables ruby lasers. Photoluminescence spectra resembling the famous 1.78 eV emission of Cr in alpha-Al2O3 have been observed in other wide-band-gap host materials, in particular AlN. However, it is unclear whether Cr would produce the same emission in the nitrides as in alpha-Al2O3, especially given the different local environment (tetrahedral vs octahedral coordination). We investigate the electronic and optical properties of transition metal substitutional impurities (Cr, Co, Ni, and Cu) in wurtzite GaN and AlN from first principles, utilizing hybrid density functional theory. We calculate the optical transition energies using a constrained occupation approach that accounts for the multideterminant nature of the excited states. Our results indicate that substitutional Cr(III) is not responsible for the emission near 1.78 eV observed in the nitrides. Among the examined impurities, only substitutional Co(II) produces emission near 1.78 eV. Based on the favorable properties of Co(II) (low formation energy, small Huang-Rhys factor, and an S = 3/2 ground state) we propose it as a promising single-photon emitter or spin qubit. We additionally assign the PL peak observed near 1.05 eV in GaN and AlN to the 2E -> 4A2 transition of the Ni(III) substitution.

TI Average correlation as an indicator for inseparability
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Inseparability of quantum states is one of the most crucial aspects of quantum physics, as it often provides the key ingredient for obtaining a quantum advantage. Quantifying inseparability is thus an important objective to better understand quantum physics and to improve quantum applications. So far, many measures for inseparability exist, however, most of them are based on abstract mathematical procedures and are not defined operationally which can easily be realized in an experiment. Recently we introduced average correlation [Tschaffon et al., Phys. Rev. Res. 5, 023063 (2023)] as a reference frame independent indicator for nonclassicality in the Bell sense based on randomized measurements. It is defined as the average absolute value of the two-qubit correlation function and allows one to formulate a necessary and sufficient condition for the ability to violate the CHSH inequality. Experimentally it can be realized by randomized measurements which can approximate its value arbitrarily closely. This makes it independent of a shared reference frame between the two measuring parties, which can be useful in scenarios where it is impossible to find one. In this second article, we show that average correlation also serves as an indicator for inseparability by deriving a necessary and sufficient condition. From there, we prove the remaining open conjectures of the first article. Due to the operational definition of average correlation, it offers a first step toward finding a new operationally defined inseparability measure.

TI Quantum-inspired modeling of social impact in complex networks with
   artificial intelligent agents
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB We propose a quantum-inspired framework for modeling open distributed intelligence systems (DISs) comprising natural intelligence agents (NIAs) and artificial intelligence agents (AIAs) that interact with each other. Each NIA - AIA pair represents a user and their digital assistant - an avatar implemented as an agent based on a large language model (LLM). The AIAs are interconnected through a complex, scale-free network and communicate with users and one another in real time. We focus on the social impact and evolution of users' emotional states, which we model as simple, two-level cognitive systems shaped by interactions with AIAs and external information sources. Within this framework, the AIAs adiabatically follow the NIAs, mediating emotional influence by disseminating information and propagating user emotions throughout the system. Building on Mehrabian's Pleasure-Arousal-Dominance (PAD) model and Wundt's three-dimensional theory of emotions, we put forward a quantum-like representation of affective states on an emotional sphere. We demonstrate that the arousal component is governed by the interplay between external informational inputs and individual personality traits. This leads to the emergence of limiting cycles in emotional dynamics. Assuming weak AIA - AIA coupling, we identify two distinct regimes of affective behavior. In the first regime, coherent NIA - AIA interaction supports emotional heterogeneity and individual differentiation across the network. In the second regime, shared exposure to external information drives synchronized emotional responses, resulting in a macroscopic affective field that captures collective emotional dynamics. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the network's structural properties, particularly node degree correlations, play a role analogous to quantum correlations in ensembles of two-level physical systems; a quantum-like superradiant state corresponds to the network-induced collective emotional activation of NIAs within a DIS. These findings advance our understanding of affective dynamics and emergent social phenomena in hybrid human-AI ecosystems.

TI A Stabilizer Framework for the Contextual Subspace Variational Quantum
   Eigensolver and the Noncontextual Projection Ansatz
SO JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL THEORY AND COMPUTATION
AB Quantum chemistry is a promising application for quantum computers have thus far not succeeded in providing solutions to problems of real scientific significance, with algorithmic advances being necessary to fully utilize even the modest NISQ machines available today. We discuss a method of ground state energy estimation predicated on a partitioning of the molecular Hamiltonian into two parts: one that is noncontextual and can be solved classically, supplemented by a contextual component that yields quantum corrections obtained via a has been termed Contextual Subspace VQE (CS-VQE); however, there are obstacles to overcome before it can be deployed on NISQ devices. The problem we address here is that of the ansatz, a parametrized quantum state over which we optimize during VQE; it is not initially clear how a splitting of the Hamiltonian should be reflected in the CS-VQE ansatze. We propose a "noncontextual projection" approach that is illuminated by a reformulation of CS-VQE in the stabilizer formalism. This defines an ansatz restriction from the full electronic structure problem to the contextual subspace and facilitates an implementation of CS-VQE that may be deployed on NISQ devices. We validate the noncontextual projection ansatz using a quantum simulator and demonstrate chemically precise ground state energy calculations for a suite of small molecules at a significant reduction in the required qubit count and circuit depth.

TI Scalable Experimental Bounds for Entangled Quantum State Fidelities
SO ACM TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM COMPUTING
AB Estimating the state preparation fidelity of highly entangled states on noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices is important for benchmarking and application considerations. Unfortunately, exact fidelity measurements quickly become prohibitively expensive, as they scale exponentially as O ( 3 N ) for N-qubit states, using full state tomography with measurements in all Pauli bases combinations. However, Somma et al. established that the complexity could be drastically reduced when looking at fidelity lower bounds for states that exhibit symmetries, such as Dicke states and GHZ states. These bounds must still be tight enough for larger states to provide reasonable estimations on NISQ devices. For the first time and more than 15 years after the theoretical introduction, we report meaningful lower bounds for the state preparation fidelity of all Dicke states up to N = 10 and all GHZ states up to N = 20 on Quantinuum H1 ion-trap systems using efficient implementations of recently proposed scalable circuits for these states. Our achieved lower bounds match or exceed previously reported exact fidelities on superconducting systems for much smaller states. Furthermore, we provide evidence that for large Dicke states | D N N / 2 > ,we may resort to a GHZ-based approximate state preparation to achieve better fidelity. This work provides a path forward to benchmarking entanglement as NISQ devices improve in size and quality.

TI Scaling of quantum interference from single molecules to molecular cages
   and their monolayers
SO PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF
   AMERICA
AB The discovery of quantum interference (QI) is widely considered as an important advance in molecular electronics since it provides unique opportunities for achieving single-molecule devices with unprecedented performance. Although some pioneering studies suggested the presence of spin qubit coherence and QI in collective systems such as thin films, it remains unclear whether the QI can be transferred step-by-step from single molecules to different length scales, which hinders the application of QI in fabricating active molecular devices. Here, we found that QI can be transferred from a single molecule to their assemblies. We synthesized and investigated the charge transport through the molecular cages using 1,3-dipyridylbenzene (DPB) as a ligand block with a destructive quantum interference (DQI) effect and 2,5-dipyridylfuran (DPF) as a control building block with a constructive quantum interference (CQI) effect using both single-molecule break junction and large area junction techniques. Combined experiments and calculations revealed that both DQI and CQI had been transferred from the ligand blocks to the molecular cages and the monolayer thin film of the cages. Our work introduced QI effects from a ligand to the molecular cage comprising 732 atoms and even their monolayers, suggesting that the quantum interference could be scaled up within the phase-coherent distance.

TI Global Heisenberg scaling in noisy and practical phase estimation
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Heisenberg scaling characterizes the ultimate precision of parameter estimation enabled by quantum mechanics, which represents an important quantum advantage of both theoretical and technological interest. Here, we present a comprehensive and rigorous study of the attainability of strong, global notions of Heisenberg scaling (in contrast to the commonly studied local estimation based on e.g. quantum Fisher information) in the fundamental problem of quantum metrology, in noisy environments. As our first contribution, we formally define two useful notions of Heisenberg scaling in global estimation respectively based on the average estimation error and the limiting distribution of estimation error (which we highlight as a practically important figure of merit). A main result of this work is that for the standard phase damping noise, an O(n (-1)) noise rate is a necessary and sufficient condition for attaining global Heisenberg scaling. We first prove that O(n (-1)) is an upper bound on the noise rate for Heisenberg scaling to be possible, and then show by constructing a 'robust' estimation procedure that global Heisenberg scaling in both senses can indeed be achieved under Theta(n (-1)) noise. In addition, we provide a practically more friendly adaptive protocol using only an one-qubit memory, which achieves global Heisenberg scaling in terms of limiting distribution as well under O(n (-1)) noise.

TI Multiclass classification of dephasing channels
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We address the use of neural networks (NNs) in classifying the environmental parameters of single-qubit dephasing channels. In particular, we investigate the performance of linear perceptrons and of two nonlinear NN architectures. At variance with time-series-based approaches, our goal is to learn a discretized probability distribution over the parameters using tomographic data at just two random instants of time. We consider dephasing channels originating either from classical 1/f(alpha) noise or from the interaction with a bath of quantum oscillators. The parameters to be classified are the color alpha of the classical noise or the Ohmicity parameter s of the quantum environment. In both cases, we find that NNs are able to exactly classify parameters into 16 classes using noiseless data (a linear NN is enough for the color, whereas a single-layer NN is needed for the Ohmicity). In the presence of noisy data (e.g., coming from noisy tomographic measurements), the network is able to classify the color of the 1/f(alpha) noise into 16 classes with about 70% accuracy, whereas classification of Ohmicity turns out to be challenging. We also consider a more coarse-grained task and train the network to discriminate between two macroclasses corresponding to alpha less than or greater than 1 and s less than or greater than 1, obtaining up to 96% and 79% accuracy using single-layer NNs.

TI Power maximization of two-stroke quantum thermal machines
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We present a detailed study of quantum thermal machines employing quantum systems as working substances. In particular, we study two different types of two-stroke cycles where two collections of identical quantum systems with evenly spaced energy levels are initially prepared at thermal equilibrium by putting them in contact with a cold and a hot thermal bath, respectively. The two cycles differ in the absence or the presence of a mediator system, while, in both cases, nonresonant exchange Hamiltonians are exploited as particle interactions. We show that the efficiencies of these machines depend only on the energy gaps of the systems composing the collections and are equal to the efficiency of "equivalent" Otto cycles. Focusing on the cases of qubits or harmonic oscillators for both models, we maximize the engine power and analyze, in the model without the mediator, the role of the waiting time between subsequent interactions. It turns out that the case with the mediator can bring performance advantages when the interaction times are comparable with the waiting time of the correspondent cycle without the mediator. We find that in both cycles, the power peaks of qubit systems can surpass the Curzon-Ahlborn efficiency. Finally, we compare our cycle without the mediator with previous schemes of the quantum Otto cycle showing that high coupling is not required to achieve the same maximum power.

TI Microstructural and preliminary optical and microwave characterization
   of erbium-doped CaMoO4 thin films
SO APL MATERIALS
AB This work explores erbium-doped calcium molybdate (Er:CaMoO4) thin films grown on silicon and yttria stabilized zirconia (YSZ) substrates, as a potential solid state system for C-band (utilizing the similar to 1.5 mu m Er3+ 4f-4f transition) quantum emitters for quantum network applications. Through molecular beam epitaxial growth experiments and electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, and reflection electron diffraction studies, we identify an incorporation limited deposition regime that enables a 1:1 Ca:Mo ratio in the growing film leading to single phase CaMoO4 formation that can be in situ doped with Er (typically 2-100 ppm). We further show that growth on silicon substrates is single phase but polycrystalline in morphology, while growth on YSZ substrates leads to high-quality epitaxial single crystalline CaMoO4 films. We perform preliminary optical and microwave characterization on the suspected Y-1-Z(1) transition of 2 ppm, 200 nm epitaxial Er:CaMoO4 annealed thin films and extract an optical inhomogeneous linewidth of 9.1(1) GHz, an optical excited state lifetime of 6.7(2) ms, a spectral diffusion-limited homogeneous linewidth of 6.7(4) MHz, and an EPR linewidth of 1.10(2) GHz.

TI QOptCraft: A Python package for the design and study of linear optical
   quantum systems
SO COMPUTER PHYSICS COMMUNICATIONS
AB The manipulation of the quantum states of light in linear optical systems has multiple applications in quantum optics and quantum computation. The package QOptCraft gives a collection of methods to solve some of the most usual problems when designing quantum experiments with linear interferometers. The methods include functions that compute the quantum evolution matrix for n photons from the classical description of the system and inverse methods that, for any desired quantum evolution, will either give the complete description of the experimental system that realizes that unitary evolution or, when this is impossible, the complete description of the linear system which approximates the desired unitary with a locally minimal error. The functions in the package include implementations of different known decompositions that translate the classical scattering matrix of a linear system into a list of beam splitters and phase shifters and methods to compute the effective Hamiltonian that describes the quantum evolution of states with n photons. The package is completed with routines for useful tasks like generating random linear optical systems, computing matrix logarithms, and quantum state entanglement measurement via metrics such as the Schmidt rank. The routines are chosen to avoid usual numerical problems when dealing with the unitary matrices that appear in the description of linear systems.Program summaryProgram Title: QOptCraftCPC Library link to program files: https://doi .org /10 .17632 /r24hszggf4 .1Developer's repository link: https://github .tel .uva .es /juagar /qoptcraft Licensing provisions: Apache-2.0Programming language: Python 3 v3.9.5:0a7dcbd, May 3 2021 17:27:52 Supplementary material:: User's manual at https://github .tel .uva .es /juagar /qoptcraft /-/blob /main /QOptCraft _V1.1 _user _guide .pdfNature of problem: The evolution of the quantum states of light in linear optical devices can be computed from the scattering matrix of the system using a few alternative points of view. Apart from being able to compute the evolution through a known optical system, it is interesting to consider the less studied inverse problem of design: finding the optical system which gives or approximates a desired evolution. Linear optical systems are limited and can only provide a small subset of all the physically possible quantum transformations on multiple photons. Choosing the best approximation for the evolutions that cannot be achieved with linear optics is not trivial. This software deals with the analysis of the quantum evolution of multiple photons in linear optical devices and the design of optical setups that achieve or approximate a desired quantum evolution. Solution method: We have automated multiple computation processes regarding quantum experiments via linear optic devices. The methods rely on the properties of the groups and algebras that describe the problem of light evolution in linear system. The library QOptCraft for Python 3 includes known numerical methods for decomposing an optical system into beam splitters and phase shifters and methods to give the quantum evolution of system classically described by a scattering matrix using either the Heisenberg picture evolution of the states, a description based on the permanents of certain matrices or the evolution from the effective Hamiltonian of the system.
   It also provides methods for the design of achievable evolutions, using the adjoint representation, and for approximating quantum evolutions outside the reach of linear optics with an iterative method using Toponogov's comparison theorem from differential geometry. The package is completed with useful functions that deal with systems including losses and gain, described with quasiunitary matrices, the generation of random matrices and stable implementations of the matrix logarithm.Additional comments including restrictions and unusual features: The package is designed to work with intermediate scale optical systems. Due to the combinatorial growth in the state space with the number of photons and modes involved, there is an upper limit on the efficiency of any classical calculation. QOptCraft serves as a design tool to explore the building blocks of photonic quantum computers, optical systems that generate useful quantum states of light for their use in metrology or other applications or the design of quantum optics experiments to probe the foundations of quantum mechanics.(c) 2022 The Author(s).

TI Lieb-Robinson correlation function for the quantum transverse-field
   Ising model
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB The Lieb-Robinson correlation function is the norm of a commutator between local operators acting on separate subsystems at different times. This provides a useful state-independent measure for characterizing the specifically quantum interaction between spatially separated qubits. The finite propagation velocity for this correlator defines a "light cone" of quantum influence. We calculate the Lieb-Robinson correlation function for one-dimensional qubit arrays described by the transverse-field Ising model. Direct calculations of this correlation function have been limited by the exponential increase in the size of the state space with the number of qubits. We introduce a technique that avoids this barrier by transforming the calculation to a sum over Pauli walks which results in linear scaling with system size. We can then explore propagation in arrays of hundreds of qubits and observe the effects of the quantum phase transition in the system. We observe the emergence of two distinct velocities of propagation: a correlation front velocity, which is affected by the phase transition, and the Lieb-Robinson velocity which is not. The correlation front velocity is equal to the maximum group velocity of single quasiparticle excitations. The Lieb-Robinson velocity describes the extreme leading edge of correlations when the value of the correlation function itself is still very small. For the semi-infinite chain of qubits at the quantum critical point, we derive an analytical result for the correlation function.

TI Scalable flux controllers using adiabatic superconductor logic for
   quantum processors
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Quantum processors have the potential to accelerate specific computing tasks but are difficult to scale up due to engineering limitations, such as the number of available cables and cooling power for dilution refrigerators for quantum bits (qubits). Hence, it is very important to develop scalable, energy-efficient interface circuits that can control many qubits via a few control lines inside a dilution refrigerator. One of the most important interface circuits is the flux controller (FC), which generates arbitrary dc flux bias to adjust the characteristics of component devices such as qubits. In this paper, we propose and demonstrate FCs using an energy-efficient superconductor logic family, adiabatic quantum-flux-parametron (AQFP) logic. We develop two types of FCs: the AQFP FC and the AQFP/single-flux-quantum (AQFP/SFQ) FC. Both FCs require only a few control lines and have extremely small power dissipation, thus exhibiting high scalability. Furthermore, the AQFP/SFQ FC can control flux bias using ballistic SFQ transmission, which is crucial for integration with qubits. As a proof of concept, we demonstrate AQFP and AQFP/SFQ FCs at 4.2 K, fabricated by the AIST high-speed standard process. Our results indicate that AQFP logic is highly suitable for use as qubit interface circuits for very large-scale quantum processors, especially from the viewpoint of the control line count, power dissipation, and amount of supply currents.

TI Test of an Improved DNA and RNA Purification Protocol-Importance of
   Proteinase K and Co-Purified Small RNAs
SO SEPARATIONS
AB Optimized and reliable DNA/RNA extraction protocols are a vital tool in clinical practice in the context of molecular testing. Here, we present our successful attempt to enhance the quantity of RNA isolated from clinical specimens, which we originally found challenging (breast and testis). We compared several purification methods with special focus on two AllPrep system-based protocols (QIAGEN). Our data suggest that addition of proteinase K may markedly increase RNA and, in some cases, also DNA yield. The extraction kit used, AllPrep DNA/RNA/miRNA universal kit, provides RNA amounts comparable with the phenol-chloroform extraction method; however, part of the final yield consisted of small RNAs, visible as a thick band in the bioanalyzer gel-like image (5S peak). The 5S peak, albeit in some cases dominating the bioanalyzer image, plays only a small role in RT-qPCR analysis, and Qubit or NanoDrop measurements can still be used as a reliable estimate of starting amounts of mRNA for downstream analyses. In conclusion, we showed that implementing a protocol containing a step of proteinase K digestion markedly increases RNA yield. The AllPrep DNA/RNA/miRNA Universal Kit can be successfully used for simultaneous extraction of DNA and total RNA, irrespective of the tissue of origin, and does not present inconveniences related to phenol-chloroform extraction.

TI Optimal Purification of a Spin Ensemble by Quantum-Algorithmic Feedback
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW X
AB Purifying a high-temperature ensemble of quantum particles toward a known state is a key requirement to exploit quantum many-body effects. An alternative to passive cooling, which brings a system to its ground state, is active feedback, which stabilizes the system at a chosen target state. This alternative, if realized, offers additional control capabilities for the design of quantum states. Here we present a feedback algorithm applied to a quantum system, which is capable of stabilizing the collective state of an ensemble from its maximum entropy state to the limit of single quantum fluctuations. Our algorithmic approach maximizes the rate of state purification given the system???s physical constants; thus it remains the optimal feedback approach even in the presence of dissipation and disorder. We test experimentally the robustness of this feedback on the highly inhomogeneous nuclear-spin ensemble of a semiconductor quantum dot, reducing nuclear-spin fluctuations 83-fold, down to 5.7(2) spin macrostates. Simulations demonstrate that without system-specific inhomogeneities, our algorithm can purify the system down to single-spin fluctuations. Further, we exploit our algorithmic approach to tailor nontrivial nuclear-spin distributions that go beyond simple polarization, including weighted bimodality and latticed multistability. This control is a precursor toward quantum-correlated macrostates, which an extended version of our algorithm could generate in homogeneous systems.

TI Towards the simulation of large scale protein-ligand interactions on
   NISQ-era quantum computers
SO CHEMICAL SCIENCE
AB We explore the use of symmetry-adapted perturbation theory (SAPT) as a simple and efficient means to compute interaction energies between large molecular systems with a hybrid method combining NISQ-era quantum and classical computers. From the one- and two-particle reduced density matrices of the monomer wavefunctions obtained by the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE), we compute SAPT contributions to the interaction energy [SAPT(VQE)]. At first order, this energy yields the electrostatic and exchange contributions for non-covalently bound systems. We empirically find from ideal statevector simulations that the SAPT(VQE) interaction energy components display orders of magnitude lower absolute errors than the corresponding VQE total energies. Therefore, even with coarsely optimized low-depth VQE wavefunctions, we still obtain sub kcal mol(-1) accuracy in the SAPT interaction energies. In SAPT(VQE), the quantum requirements, such as qubit count and circuit depth, are lowered by performing computations on the separate molecular systems. Furthermore, active spaces allow for large systems containing thousands of orbitals to be reduced to a small enough orbital set to perform the quantum portions of the computations. We benchmark SAPT(VQE) (with the VQE component simulated by ideal statevector simulators) against a handful of small multi-reference dimer systems and the iron center containing human cancer-relevant protein lysine-specific demethylase 5 (KDM5A).

TI Toward simulating quantum field theories with controlled phonon-ion
   dynamics: A hybrid analog-digital approach
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Quantum field theories are the cornerstones of modern physics, providing relativistic and quantum mechanical descriptions of physical systems at the most fundamental level. Simulating real-time dynamics within these theories remains elusive in classical computing. This provides a unique opportunity for quantum simulators, which hold the promise of revolutionizing our simulation capabilities. Trapped-ion systems are successful quantum-simulator platforms for quantum many-body physics and can operate in digital, or gate-based, and analog modes. Inspired by the progress in proposing and realizing quantum simulations of a number of relativistic quantum field theories using trapped-ion systems, and by the hybrid analog-digital proposals for simulating interacting boson-fermion models, we propose hybrid analog-digital quantum simulations of selected quantum field theories, taking recent developments to the next level. On one hand, the semi-digital nature of this proposal offers more flexibility in engineering generic model interactions compared with a fully-analog approach. On the other hand, encoding the bosonic fields onto the phonon degrees of freedom of the trapped-ion system allows a more efficient usage of simulator resources, and a more natural implementation of intrinsic quantum operations in such platforms. This opens up ways for simulating complex dynamics of, e.g., Abelian and non-Abelian gauge theories, by combining the benefits of digital and analog schemes.

TI Asynchronous-bit-rate differential phase-shift-keying
SO APL PHOTONICS
AB An adaptive differential-phase-shifting (DPS) quantum key distribution (QKD) protocol improved by encoding asynchronous-bit-rate with harmonic clock tunability, decoded by shortened delay-line interferometer (DLI) with enhancing stability, and received by single-photon detection with long hold-off is demonstrated to realize low-erroneous transmission. To achieve long-term stabilized visibility with a maintained quantum bit-error-ratio (QBER) and secure key rate, the shortened and polarized DLI enlarges its free-spectral range (FSR) and reduces its power-to-wavelength slope (delta P/delta lambda) to suppress its sensitivity to thermal gradient, channel leakage, and wavelength disturbance. Extremely low power and wavelength drifts of Delta P/P < +/- 0.02% and Delta lambda/lambda = +/- 6.45 x 10(-8) can be achieved, even when using a single-mode QKD carrier with a relatively broadened 300-kHz linewidth. Flexibly expanding the 1-bit-delay FSR of the polarized DLI from 0.04 to 1.00 GHz improves its immunity to environmental disturbances, enabling the DPS-QKD decoding with 2(10)-2(13) patterns, 3.2% QBER, and 17.46-kbit/s under 0.22 photon/pulse in average. The asynchronous-bit-rate DPS-QKD protocol enables harmonic expansion of DLI's FSR at limited single-photon avalanche detector's bit rate, which lengthens the duration of stable visibility to support long-pattern DPS-QKD.

TI Remote characterization of nonlinear distortions in ultrashort pulses
   transmitted through dynamic fiber optic links
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Ultrashort pulse sources are complex and resource-intensive. To reduce overhead and simplify operations, we had previously developed a method to deliver ultra-short pulses through fiber-optic links to multiple locations and to characterize them remotely using a compact detector module. We created a pulse pair with varying delays at the central location using a pulse shaper before launching them into the fiber links and measured the first and second-order autocor relations at the satellite location. However, this method proved inadequate for detecting the effects of optical nonlinearities as the spectral broadening seen by a pulse pair with varying degrees of overlap differs from that of a pair of pulses undergoing nonlinear broadening separately. To overcome this drawback, we propose to launch a variable-delay pulse pair with no temporal overlap to avoid combined nonlinear distortions in the fiber link and measure the autocor relations at the output by adding a fixed-delay interferometer to our detector module. The in-house fabricated fixed-delay element consisted of a quartz plate with its surfaces coated by partially reflecting Bragg mirrors. Using this modified setup, we have been able to detect the nonlinear distortions encountered by sub similar to 400fs pulses in the delivery links.

AB Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites undergo a period of rapid development driven by ever-increasing user demands, reduced costs, and technological progress. Since there is a lack of literature on the security and reliability issues of LEO Satellite Communication Systems (SCSs), we aim to fill this knowledge gap. Specifically, we critically appraise the inherent characteristics of LEO SCSs and elaborate on their security and reliability requirements. In light of this, we further discuss their vulnerabilities, including potential security attacks launched against them and reliability risks, followed by outlining the associated lessons learned.

TI Thin Film Lithium Niobate Electro-Optic Devices and Ultralarge-Scale
   Photonic Integration (Invited)
SO CHINESE JOURNAL OF LASERS-ZHONGGUO JIGUANG
AB Objective The recent advancement in thin film lithium niobate photonic integration technology has been rapid, driven by profound physical, material, and technological factors. Single crystal thin film lithium niobate is particularly noteworthy for offering the most comprehensive performance solution to date, addressing long-term challenges in low transmission loss, high -density integration, and low modulation power consumption within the realm of photonic integrated circuits. This paper provides an overview of the origin and recent swift development of thin film lithium niobate photonic technology, focusing on its potential for the future generation of highspeed optoelectronic devices and ultra-large-scale photonic integrated circuit applications. Various processing technologies for thin film lithium niobate photonic structures are discussed, accompanied by the introduction of current high-performance devices and systems. These include ultra-low loss tunable optical delay lines, ultra -fast light modulators, high-efficiency quantum light sources, as well as high-power on -chip amplifiers and lasers. These devices, distinguished by their unprecedented advantages of small size, light weight, low power consumption, and high performance, are poised to make a tremendous impact on the entire optoelectronic industry. Significance Since the laboratory production of the lithium niobate single crystal, lithium niobate has emerged as a crucial material in the fields of electro-optics and nonlinear optics. Optical modulators based on the linear electro-optic effect, utilizing lithium niobate, offer notable advantages including high modulation rates, a substantial extinction ratio, low chirp, and high linearity. In the 21st century, integrated photonics technology has gained increasing attention for two primary reasons. Firstly, the demand for photonic devices with attributes such as low energy consumption, high-performance computing, and reconfiguration capabilities has surged due to the explosive growth in applications for information technology, including big data, artificial intelligence, high-speed networks, virtual reality, and quantum information processing. Secondly, integrated photonics technology itself has been continuously advancing. The enhancement of on-chip photonic device performance and cost reduction have reached a threshold that is propelling the emergence of a new photonic industry. Traditional fabrication techniques, such as ion diffusion and ion implantation, impose limitations on the modulation efficiency and power consumption of lithium niobate modulators, impeding the progress of lithium niobate photonic integration technology. Overcoming this challenge requires addressing both material platforms and device fabrication. In this context, thin film lithium niobate has emerged as a pivotal material, paving the way for integrated photonics. China has long been engaged in research on lithium niobate materials and photonics, contributing significantly to the field s advancement through several crucial milestones. Therefore, it essential to summarize the recent revolution to provide guidance for future development. Progress The fabrication flow diagram for the electron beam lithography combined with ion etching process is presented (Fig. 1). schematic diagram of the photolithography-assisted chemo-mechanical etching (PLACE) technique is provided (Fig. 2). The report includes an ultra-high-speed high-resolution laser lithography system for lithium niobate integrated photonics (Fig. 3).
   Through integration of thin film lithium niobate with advanced fabrication techniques, substantial progress has been achieved in the development of lithium niobate photonic devices, encompassing delay lines (Fig. 4), high-speed electro-optical modulators (Fig. optical frequency combs (Fig. 6), quantum light sources (Fig. 7), metasurfaces (Fig. 8), waveguide lasers (Fig. 9), and amplifiers (Fig. 10). Additionally, the article outlines some integrated photonics applications. Specifically, the achievement of electro-optically 4x4 programmable photonic circuits enabled by wafer-scale integration on thin film lithium niobate is illustrated (Fig. 11). This device, composed of cascaded MZIs, demonstrates a total on-chip power dissipation of only 1.5 mW when operated at a 100 MHz modulation rate. Furthermore, an on-chip arrayed waveguide grating (AWG) fabricated on thin film lithium niobate with on-chip loss as low as 3.32 dB is reported (Fig. 12). Finally, four-channel waveguide amplifiers fabricated on monolithically integrated active/ passive thin film lithium niobate are also showcased (Fig. 11), demonstrating a robust low-loss optical interface for the monolithic integration of passive and active thin film lithium niobate photonics. Conclusions and Prospects Significant enhancements have been achieved in critical parameters of photonic devices, including modulation bandwidth, power consumption, propagation loss, and active and passive functionalities, as well as advancements large-scale integration. These technological strides are poised to benefit the evolution of integrated photonics applications. However, some exceptional performances have yet to reach the physical limits of lithium niobate photonics devices, necessitating further efforts in thin film lithium niobate integrated photonics technology. Notably, numerous thin film lithium niobate photonics devices have already approached or even attained optical performances suitable for industrial applications. This opens up abundant opportunities the development of next-generation optical information technology.

TI A comprehensive study of various superconductors for superconducting
   nanowire single photon detectors applications
SO ISCIENCE
AB Research activities in the field of superconducting nanowire single photon detectors (SNSPDs) have exhibited major progress over the last two decades. The low dark count rate, low jitter time, low recovery time, and ultrafast response time in an extended wavelength range, along with several improvements in the material parameters, cryogenic environment, and associated electronics make SNSPDs a superior choice over other photo-detectors. The struggle in simultaneously optimizing these parameters made the pace of SNSPD research steady, until the report of unit system detection efficiency at low temperatures for WSi SNSPD. Due to the difficulty in maintaining the low temperature for a long time, researchers are currently focusing on using high transition temperatures cuprate-based superconductors. These have the added advantages of making a portable SNSPD combined with faster response dynamics required for commercial SNSPD applications. In this review, we have discussed different models for single photon detection, followed by research activities carried out employing different superconducting materials over the last 20 years. The ongoing research toward utilizing oxide-based superconductors as photon detection devices along with a few suggestions for improving the device performance is discussed. This review will fill the gap required for a detailed study of different classes of superconductors for SNSPD applications.

AB Most active quench circuits used for single-photon avalanche detectors are designed either with discrete components which lack the flexibility of dynamically changing the control parameters, or with custom ASICs which require a long development time and high cost. As an alternative, we present a reconfigurable and robust hybrid design implemented using a System-on-Chip (SoC), which integrates both an FPGA and a microcontroller. We take advantage of the FPGA's speed and configuration capabilities to vary the quench and reset parameters dynamically over a large range, thus allowing our circuit to operate with a wide variety of APDs without having to re-design the system. The microcontroller enables the remote adjustment of control parameters and re-calibration of APDs in the field. The ruggedized design uses components with space heritage, thus making it suitable for space-based applications in the fields of telecommunications and quantum key distribution (QKD). We characterize our circuit with a commercial APD cooled to -20 degrees C, and obtain a deadtime of 35ns while maintaining the after-pulsing probability at close to 3%. We also demonstrate versatility of the circuit by directly testing custom fabricated chip-scale APDs, which paves the way for automated wafer-scale testing and characterization.

TI Controlled Excitation of Supermodes in a Multicore Fiber with a 5 x 5
   Square Array of Strongly Coupled Cores
SO PHOTONICS
AB Coherent propagation of supermodes in a multicore fiber is promising for power scaling of fiber laser systems, eliminating the need for the active feedback system to maintain the phases between the channels. We studied the propagation of broadband pulsed radiation at a central wavelength of 1030 nm in a multicore fiber with coupled cores arranged in a square array. We designed and fabricated a silica multicore fiber with a 5 x 5 array of cores. For controllable excitation of a desired supermode, we developed a beam-forming system based on a spatial light modulator. We experimentally measured intensity and phase distributions of the supermodes, in particular, the in-phase and out-of-phase supermodes, which matched well the numerically calculated profiles. We obtained selective excitation and coherent propagation of broadband radiation with the content of the out-of-phase supermode of up to 90% maintained without active feedback. Using three-dimensional numerical modeling with allowance for a refractive index profile similar to those of the developed fiber, we demonstrated stable propagation of the out-of-phase supermode and collapse of the in-phase supermode at a high signal power.

TI Erbium and thulium on MgO(100)/Ag(100) as candidates for single atom
   qubits
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB Lanthanide atoms on surfaces are an exceptional platform for atomic-scale magnetic information storage. However, their potential as qubits remains unexplored due to the limited number of experimental setups that can coherently drive the spins of single adatoms. Here we propose a combined experimental and theoretical method to estimate the performance of surface-adsorbed lanthanide atoms for quantum coherent operations. We investigate Er and Tm on MgO(100)/Ag(100) with x-ray absorption spectroscopy to address their magnetic and electronic properties and with scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) to identify their adsorption sites. With atomic multiplet calculations and density functional theory, we infer for both atoms a magnetic ground state that is suitable for quantum coherent operations. We investigate whether these systems lend themselves to electron spin resonance scanning tunneling microscopy (ESR-STM). By adapting the piezoelectric model of ESR-STM to the case of lanthanide atoms, we show that these systems should exhibit a detectable signal and that they have a higher Rabi rate compared to the systems studied up to date. In addition to their suitable electron spin properties, these elements possess a nontrivial nuclear spin that could be exploited to perform two-qubit operations on a single atom or to store quantum states in the nuclear spin.

TI Scaling Relations and Topological Quadruple Points in Light-Matter
   Interactions with Anisotropy and Nonlinear Stark Coupling
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB Universality is a common quality in different physical parameters that is rooted in the deep nature of physical systems. Scaling relation is a typical universality for critical phenomena around a quantum phase transition, while topological classification provides another type of universality essentially different from the critical universality. Both classes of universalities can be present in a single-qubit system with light-matter interactions, as exhibiting generally in the fundamental quantum Rabi model with anisotropy not only for linear coupling but also for nonlinear Stark coupling (NSC). In low frequencies different levels of scaling relations are extracted, holding for anisotropic or/and NSCs, locally or globally. At finite frequencies such a critical universality breaks down and diversity is dominant. However, common topological feature of the ground state can be extracted from the node number, which yields a topological class of universality amidst the critical diversity. Both conventional and unconventional topological transitions emerge, with their meeting, which never occurs in linear interaction, enabled by the nonlinear coupling to form topological quadruple points which are found to be spin-invariant points. Sensitivity analysis indicates that the NSC can be another applicable approach to manipulate topological transitions in addition to coupling anisotropy.

TI Practical continuous-variable quantum secret sharing using plug-and-play
   dual-phase modulation
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Continuous-variable quantum secret sharing (CVQSS) allows a legitimate user, i.e., the dealer, to share a string of secret keys with multiple distant users. These users cannot individually recover the dealer's secret key unless they work cooperatively. Although the theoretical security proof of CVQSS has been well established, its practical security and implementation still face challenges. In this paper, we suggest a practical scheme for CVQSS using plug-and-play (P&P) configuration and dual-phase-modulated coherent state (DPMCS). The proposed scheme, called P&P DPM-based CVQSS, waives the necessity that each user has to prepare respective coherent states with their own lasers, thereby eliminating synchronous loopholes caused by different lasers and reducing the complexity of deployment of the user's stations. Moreover, the local oscillator (LO) can be generated locally by the dealer so that the whole CVQSS system could be naturally immune to all LO -aimed attacks. We derive the security bounds for P&P DPM-based CVQSS by properly making most of the existing security analysis techniques of continuous-variable quantum key distribution (CVQKD). In addition, an experimental concept of P&P DPM-based CVQSS is also presented, which can be deemed a guideline for future implementation.

TI An Analysis of Temperature-Dependent Timing Jitter Factors in the

SO SENSORS
AB Single-Photon Avalanche Photodiodes (SPADs) are increasingly utilized in high-temperature-operated, high-performance Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) systems as well as in ultra-low-temperature-operated quantum science applications due to their high photon sensitivity and timing resolution. Consequently, the jitter value of SPADs at different temperatures plays a crucial role in LiDAR systems and Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) applications. However, limited studies have been conducted on this topic. In this study, we analyze the jitter characteristics of SPAD devices, focusing on the influence of device structures in two SPAD designs fabricated using the TSMC 18HV and TSMC 13HV processes. Using picosecond lasers with wavelengths ranging from ultraviolet (405 nm) to near-infrared (905 nm), we investigate the impact of different diffusion carrier types on jitter values and their temperature dependence across a range of 0 degrees C to 60 degrees C. Our results show that the jitter value of SPAD devices with low electric field regions varies significantly with temperature. This variation can be attributed to the higher temperature-dependent diffusion constant, as demonstrated by fitting the jitter diffusion tail with two diffusion time constants. In contrast, SPADs designed with modified electric field distributions exhibit smaller diffusion time constants and weaker temperature dependence, resulting in a much smaller temperature-dependent jitter value.

TI Design and Analysis of Compact High-Performance Lithium-Niobate
   Electro-Optic Modulator Based on a Racetrack Resonator
SO PHOTONICS
AB With the ever-growing demand for high-speed optical communications, microwave photonics, and quantum key distribution systems, compact electro-optic (EO) modulators with high extinction ratios, large bandwidth, and high tuning efficiency are urgently pursued. However, most integrated lithium-niobate (LN) modulators cannot achieve these high performances simultaneously. In this paper, we propose an improved theoretical model of a chip-scale electro-optic (EO) microring modulator (EO-MRM) based on X-cut lithium-niobate-on-insulator (LNOI) with a hybrid architecture consisting of a 180-degree Euler bend in the coupling region, double-layer metal electrode structure, and ground-signal-signal-ground (G-S-S-G) electrode configuration, which can realize highly comprehensive performance and a compact footprint. After parameter optimization, the designed EO-MRM exhibited an extinction ratio of 38 dB. Compared to the structure without Euler bends, the increase was 35 dB. It also had a modulation bandwidth of 29 GHz and a tunability of 8.24 pm/V when the straight waveguide length was 100 mu m. At the same time, the proposed device footprint was 1.92 x 104 mu m2. The proposed MRM model provides an efficient solution to high-speed optical communication systems and microwave photonics, which is helpful for the fabrication of high-performance and multifunctional photonic integrated devices.

TI Quantum Mpemba effect in parity-time symmetric systems
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB The quantum Mpemba effect (QMPE), an anomalous relaxation phenomenon, has been demonstrated in both closed and open Hermitian quantum systems. While some studies have linked the QMPE to Liouvillian exceptional points-non-Hermitian features emerged at the Liouvillian level-in open Hermitian quantum systems, it remains largely unexplored whether the QMPE can occur in intrinsic non-Hermitian systems, where non-Hermiticity is inherent at the Hamiltonian level. Here, we demonstrate unequivocally the occurrence of QMPE in experimentally realizable parity-time symmetric qubit systems immersed in a bosonic bath. Using established quantifiers for QMPE, we show numerically that the QMPE persists across parameter regimes both near and far from Hamiltonian and Liouvillian exceptional points, but disappears entirely when a Hermitian Hamiltonian is restored. Interestingly, neither Hamiltonian nor Liouvillian exceptional points demarcate the boundaries of the QMPE regime. To complement numerical results, we develop an analytical description based on a long-time approximation of the relaxation dynamics of quantifiers. This approach allows us to decipher the number of intersections between two dynamical trajectories of quantifier starting from two initial conditions in the validity regime of the long-time approximation, thereby providing additional information that delineates the parameter regimes supporting the genuine QMPE. We further demonstrate the robustness of QMPE against increasing the number of qubits and dephasing effect. Our findings not only broaden the scope of the QMPE but also suggest its intricate interplay with non-Hermitian features beyond exceptional points.

TI Circulating Cell-Free DNA Concentration as a Biomarker in Head and Neck
   Cancer
SO ORAL DISEASES
AB Objective: Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), particularly human papillomavirus (HPV) -negative HNSCC, poses a significant clinical challenge due to late diagnoses and poor survival. This study evaluates the potential of circulating cell-free DNA (ccfDNA) as a minimally invasive biomarker for diagnosis, prognosis and disease monitoring in HNSCC. Methods: We conducted a multicentre, prospective study enrolling 85 patients across all disease stages and 28 healthy controls, using two quantification ccfDNA methods: fluorometry (Qubit) and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). Results: Baseline plasma ccfDNA concentrations were significantly elevated in HNSCC patients compared to healthy controls, with an area under the curve of 0.705. Higher ccfDNA levels were observed in early-stage HNSCC patients. While ccfDNA levels correlated with age, no significant associations were found with tumour stage or location. Patients with lower post-treatment ccfDNA levels demonstrated longer median progression-free survival (PFS) (16.37 months vs. 9.63 months, p < 0.05). Longitudinal analysis of locally advanced HNSCC revealed significant inter-patient variability in ccfDNA kinetics. Conclusions: Our study demonstrates the potential value of fluorometric ccfDNA quantification as a diagnostic, prognostic and monitoring biomarker for HNSCC. However, further well-designed studies must be carried out to enhance the clinical utility of ccfDNA as a biomarker for HNSCC management.

TI Overcoming challenges in single electron charge detection of nanoscale
   dipoles
SO JOURNAL OF VACUUM SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY B
AB Single-electron transistors (SETs) can serve as electrometers to sense single-electron charge switching in nanoscale objects. A sub-20 nm metal double-dot (DD) structure, separated by a tunnel barrier, essentially functions as a dipole, and SETs have been utilized to detect single-electron switching within these DDs. The sensing of single-electron charge switching within these nanoscale metal DDs mimics single-charge sensing in molecular regimes and charge qubit sensing. In this study, two SET electrometers were employed to sense a single DD structure. The sensing outcomes of both SETs confirmed the detection of electron switching within the DD as well as the detection of the other SETs across the DD. To increase the induced charge in the SET due to electron switching within the DD, the SET electrometer was placed in very close proximity to the DD in one of the designs. This design, however, led to the formation of a metal dot tunnel-coupled to the SET electrometer, effectively functioning as a Single Electron Box and potentially disrupting the charge sensing fidelity of SETs while detecting charge switching in the DD. The impact of a SET tunnel-coupled to a metal dot was further investigated in a separate design. It was also demonstrated how proper design of SETs can incorporate a tunnel-coupled metal dot while maintaining the ability to detect electron switching within DDs with high fidelity simultaneously.

TI Development of KI-TWPAs for the DARTWARS Project
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON APPLIED SUPERCONDUCTIVITY
AB Noise at the quantum limit over a broad bandwidth is a fundamental requirement for future cryogenic experiments for neutrino mass measurements, dark matter searches, and Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) measurements as well as for fast high-fidelity read-out of superconducting qubits. In the last years, Josephson Parametric Amplifiers (JPA) have demonstrated noise levels close to the quantum limit, but due to their narrow bandwidth, only few detectors or qubits per line can be read out in parallel. An alternative and innovative solution is based on superconducting parametric amplification exploiting the travelling-wave concept. Within the Detector Array Readout with Travelling Wave AmplifieRS (DARTWARS) project, we develop Kinetic Inductance Travelling-Wave Parametric Amplifiers (KI-TWPAs) for low temperature detectors and qubit read-out. KI-TWPAs are typically operated in a three-wave mixing (3WM) mode and are characterised by a high gain, a high saturation power, a large amplification bandwidth, and nearly quantum limited noise performance. The goal of the DARTWARS project is to optimise the KI-TWPA design, explore new materials, and investigate alternative fabrication processes in order to enhance the overall performance of the amplifier. In this contribution we present the advancements made by the DARTWARS collaboration to produce a working prototype of a KI-TWPA, from the fabrication to the characterisation.

TI Proximity superconductivity in atom-by-atom crafted quantum dots
SO NATURE
AB Gapless materials in electronic contact with superconductors acquire proximity-induced superconductivity in a region near the interface(1,2). Numerous proposals build on this addition of electron pairing to originally non-superconducting systems and predict intriguing phases of matter, including topological(3-7), odd-frequency(8), nodal-point(9) or Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov(10) superconductivity. Here we investigate the most miniature example of the proximity effect on only a single spin-degenerate quantum level of a surface state confined in a quantum corral(11) on a superconducting substrate, built atom by atom by a scanning tunnelling microscope. Whenever an eigenmode of the corral is pitched close to the Fermi energy by adjusting the size of the corral, a pair of particle-hole symmetric states enters the gap of the superconductor. We identify these as spin-degenerate Andreev bound states theoretically predicted 50 years ago by Machida and Shibata(12), which had-so far-eluded detection by tunnel spectroscopy but were recently shown to be relevant for transmon qubit devices(13,14). We further find that the observed anticrossings of the in-gap states are a measure of proximity-induced pairing in the eigenmodes of the quantum corral. Our results have direct consequences on the interpretation of impurity-induced in-gap states in superconductors, corroborate concepts to induce superconductivity into surface states and further pave the way towards superconducting artificial lattices.

TI PAXgene Fixation for Pancreatic Cancer: Implications for Molecular and
   Surgical Pathology
SO JOURNAL OF CLINICAL MEDICINE
AB Genomic profiling of pancreatic cancer using small core biopsies has taken an increasingly prominent role in precision medicine. However, if not appropriately preserved, nucleic acids (NA) from pancreatic tissues are known to be susceptible to degradation due to high intrinsic levels of nucleases. PAXgene fixation (PreAnalytix, Switzerland) represents a novel formalin-free tissue preservation method. We sought to compare the NA and histomorphological preservation of pancreatic cancer tissues preserved with PAXgene-fixed paraffin-embedding (PFPE) and formalin-fixed paraffin-embedding (FFPE). Tissues from 19 patients were obtained prospectively from pancreaticoduodenectomy specimens and evaluated by four gastrointestinal pathologists. The extracted NA were quantified by Nanodrop and Qubit and assessed for quality by qPCR, targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) assay, and RNA-sequencing. Our results demonstrated that, when assessed blindly for morphological quality, the four pathologists deemed the PFPE slides adequate for diagnostic purposes. PFPE tissues enable greater yields of less fragmented and more amplifiable DNA. PFPE tissues demonstrated significantly improved quality control (QC) metrics in a targeted NGS assay including Median Absolute Pair-wise Difference (MAPD) scores. Our results support the use of PAXgene fixative for the processing of specimens from pancreatic cancers with the potential benefits of improved yields for more amplifiable DNA in low-yield biopsy specimens and its ideal use for amplicon-based NGS assays.

TI DNA degradation in human teeth exposed to thermal stress
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Human identification from burned remains poses a challenge to forensic laboratories, and DNA profiling is widely used for this purpose. Our aim was to evaluate the effect of temperature on DNA degradation in human teeth. Thirty teeth were exposed to temperatures of 100, 200, or 400 degrees C for 60 min. DNA was quantified by Real-Time qPCR (Quantifiler Human DNA Quantification Kit) and fluorescence spectroscopy (Qubit 3.0 Fluorometer). DNA degradation was evaluated by using STR markers (AmpFLSTR Identifiler Plus PCR Amplification Kit) to determine the allele and locus dropout, inter-locus balance, and degradation slope (observed (Oa) to expected (Ea) locus peak height ratio against the molecular weight). Most of the genomic DNA was degraded between 100 degrees C and 200 degrees C. At 100 degrees C, locus dropout ratios showed significant differences between the largest loci (FGA, D7S820, D18S51, D16S539, D2S1338 and CSF1PO) and amelogenin. Inter-locus balance values significantly differed between all dye channels except between NED and PET. The dropout ratio between D18S51 (NED) and amelogenin (PET) can be recommended for the evaluation of DNA degradation. The Oa/Ea regression model can predict locus peak heights in DNA degradation (R-2=0.7881). These findings may be useful to assess the reliability of DNA typing for human identification in teeth subjected to prolonged incineration.

TI Three-Wave Mixing Kinetic Inductance Traveling-Wave Amplifier with
   Near-Quantum-Limited Noise Performance
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB We present a theoretical model and experimental characterization of a microwave kinetic inductance traveling-wave (KIT) amplifier, whose noise performance, measured by a shot-noise tunnel junction (SNTJ), approaches the quantum limit. Biased with a dc current, this amplifier operates in a three-wave mixing fashion, thereby reducing by several orders of magnitude the power of the microwave pump tone and associated parasitic heating compared to conventional four-wave mixing KIT amplifier devices. It consists of a 50 Omega artificial transmission line whose dispersion allows for a controlled amplification bandwidth. We measure 16.5(-1.3)(+1) dB of gain across a 2 GHz bandwidth with an input 1 dB compression power of -63 dBm, in qualitative agreement with theory. Using a theoretical framework that accounts for the SNTJ-generated noise entering both the signal and idler ports of the KIT amplifier, we measure the system-added noise of an amplification chain that integrates the KIT amplifier as the first amplifier. This system-added noise, 3.1 +/- 0.6 quanta (equivalent to 0.66 +/- 0.15 K) between 3.5 and 5.5 GHz, is the one that a device replacing the SNTJ in that chain would see. This KIT amplifier is therefore suitable to read large arrays of microwave kinetic inductance detectors and promising for multiplexed superconducting qubit readout.

TI Quench dynamics of noninteracting fermions with a delta impurity
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS A-MATHEMATICAL AND THEORETICAL
AB We study the out-of-equilibrium dynamics of noninteracting fermions in one dimension and in continuum space, in the presence of a delta impurity potential at the origin whose strength g is varied at time t = 0. The system is prepared in its ground state with g = g (0) = +infinity, with two different densities and Fermi wave-vectors k (L) and k (R) on the two half-spaces x > 0 and x < 0 respectively. It then evolves for t > 0 as an isolated system, with a finite impurity strength g. We compute exactly the time dependent density and current. For a fixed position x and in the large time limit t -> infinity, the system reaches a non-equilibrium stationary state (NESS). We obtain analytically the correlation kernel, density, particle current, and energy current in the NESS, and characterize their relaxation, which is algebraic in time. In particular, in the NESS, we show that, away from the impurity, the particle density displays oscillations which are the non-equilibrium analog of the Friedel oscillations. In the regime of 'rays', x/t = xi fixed with x, t -> infinity, we compute the same quantities and observe the emergence of two light cones, associated to the Fermi velocities k (L) and k (R) in the initial state. Interestingly, we find non trivial quantum correlations between two opposite rays with velocities xi and -xi which we compute explicitly. We extend to a continuum setting and to a correlated initial state the analytical methods developed in a recent work of Ljubotina, Sotiriadis and Prosen, in the context of a discrete fermionic chain with an impurity. We also generalize our results to an initial state at finite temperature, recovering, via explicit calculations, some predictions of conformal field theory in the low energy limit.

TI Generalised Kochen-Specker theorem for finite non-deterministic outcome
   assignments
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB The Kochen-Specker (KS) theorem is a cornerstone result in quantum foundations, establishing that quantum correlations in Hilbert spaces of dimension d >= 3 cannot be explained by (consistent) hidden variable theories that assign a single deterministic outcome to each measurement. Specifically, there exist finite sets of vectors in these dimensions such that no non-contextual deterministic ({0, 1}) outcome assignment is possible obeying the rules of exclusivity and completeness-that the sum of assignments to every set of mutually orthogonal vectors be <= 1 and the sum of value assignments to any d mutually orthogonal vectors be equal to 1. Another central result in quantum foundations is Gleason's theorem that justifies the Born rule as a mathematical consequence of the quantum formalism. The KS theorem can be seen as a consequence of Gleason's theorem and the logical compactness theorem. In a similar vein, Gleason's theorem also indicates the existence of KS-type finite vector constructions to rule out other finite-alphabet outcome assignments beyond the {0, 1} case. Here, we propose a generalisation of the KS theorem that rules out hidden variable theories with outcome assignments in the set {0, p, 1 - p, 1} for p is an element of [0, 1/d) boolean OR (1/d, 1/2]. The case p = 1/2 is especially physically significant. We show that in this case the result rules out (consistent) hidden variable theories that are fundamentally binary, i.e., theories where each measurement has fundamentally at most two outcomes (in contrast to the single deterministic outcome per measurement ruled out by KS). We present a device-independent application of this generalised KS theorem by constructing a two-player non-local game for which a perfect quantum winning strategy exists (a Pseudo-telepathy game) while no perfect classical strategy exists even if the players are provided with additional no-signaling resources of PR-box type (with marginals in {0, 1/2, 1}).

TI Probing arbitrary polarized photon pairs undergoing double Compton
   scatterings by a dedicated MC simulator validated with experimental data
SO EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL C
AB Quantum correlations in the degree of polarization of freedom of the two-photon system have been extensively studied and form our current understanding of the quantum nature of our world. Most of the studies are concentrated on the low-energy (optical) photon pairs, for which efficient polarization measurement devices exist. However, for high-energetic (MeV) pairs of photons, e.g. produced in the decay of positronium atoms, no polarizers are available. Partial information about the polarization degree of freedom can be extracted by exploiting the measurements of photon pairs that undergo double Compton scattering. We present a Geant4-based Monte Carlo Vienna-Warsaw model capable of simulating any initial polarization state of bipartite photons.

TI Quantum spin liquids of Rydberg excitations in a honeycomb lattice
   induced by density-dependent Peierls phases
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB We show that the nonlinear transport of bosonic excitations in a two-dimensional honeycomb lattice of spin-orbit-coupled Rydberg atoms gives rise to disordered quantum phases which are topological and may be candidates for quantum spin liquids. As recently demonstrated by Lienhard et al. [Phys. Rev. X 10, 021031 (2020)] the spin-orbit coupling breaks time-reversal and chiral symmetries and leads to a tunable density -dependent complex hopping of spin excitations which behave as hard-core bosons. Using exact diagonalization (ED), we numerically investigate the phase diagram resulting from the competition between density-dependent and direct transport terms as well as density-density interactions. In mean-field approximation there is a phase transition from a condensate to a 120 degrees phase when the amplitude of the complex hopping exceeds that of the direct one. In the full model a new phase emerges close to the mean-field critical point as a result of quantum correlations induced by the density dependence of the complex hopping. We show that without density-density interactions this phase is a genuine disordered one, has large spin chirality, and is characterized by a nontrivial many-body Chern number. The Chern number is found to be robust to disorder. ED simulations of small lattices with up to 30 lattice sites give indications for a nondegenerate ground state with finite spin and collective gaps and thus for a bosonic integer quantum Hall phase, protected by U(1) symmetry. On the other hand, while staying finite, the many-body gap varies substantially when different twisted boundary conditions are applied, which points to a gapless phase. For very strong negative nonlinear hopping amplitudes we find another disordered regime with vanishing spin gap. This phase also has a large spin chirality and could be a gapless spin liquid but lies outside the parameter regime experimentally accessible in the Rydberg system.

TI Evolving objective function for improved variational quantum
   optimization
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB A promising approach to useful computational quantum advantage is to use variational quantum algorithms for optimization problems. Crucial for the performance of these algorithms is to ensure that the algorithm converges with high probability to a near-optimal solution in a small time. In Barkoutsos et al. [Quantum 4, 256 (2020)], an alternative class of objective functions, called conditional value at risk (CVaR), was introduced and it was shown that they perform better than standard objective functions. Here we extend that work by introducing an evolving objective function, which we call ascending-CVaR and that can be used for any optimization problem. We test our proposed objective function in an emulation environment, using as case studies three different optimization problems: MaxCut, number partitioning, and portfolio optimization. We examine multiple instances of different sizes and analyze the performance using the variational quantum eigensolver with hardware-efficient ansatz and the quantum approximate optimization algorithm. We show that ascending-CVaR in all cases performs better than standard objective functions or the constant CVaR of Barkoutsos et al. [Quantum 4, 256 (2020)] and that it can be used as a heuristic for avoiding suboptimal minima. Our proposal achieves higher overlap with the ideal state in all problems, whether we consider easy or hard instances-on average, it gives up to ten times greater overlap at portfolio optimization and number partitioning, while it gives an 80% improvement at MaxCut. In the hard instances we consider, for the number partitioning problem, standard objective functions fail to find the correct solution in almost all cases, CVaR finds the correct solution at 60% of the cases, while ascending-CVaR finds the correct solution in 95% of the cases.

TI Overview and Perspectives of Chaos Theory and Its Applications in
   Economics
SO MATHEMATICS
AB Starting from the contribution of such thinkers as the famous Giordano Bruno (1583) and the great mathematician and physicist Henri Poincare (1889) and the surprising discovery of the meteorologist Edward Lorenz (1963), we consider the expansion of the mathematics of chaos in this article, paying attention to topology, qualitative geometry, and Catastrophe Theory, on the one hand, and addressing the possibilities derived from the new Computer Science as Quantum Algorithms and the advances in Artificial Intelligence, on the other. We especially highlight the section on computing chaos, which we consider to be new calculation and analysis instruments, such as machine learning and its algorithm called reservoir computing, through which we can know the dynamics of a chaotic system. With past data, with equations like Karamoto-Sivashinsky, one can improve predictions of the system eight times further ahead than in previous methods. Integrating the machine learning approach and traditional model-based prediction, one could obtain accurate predictions twelve Lyapunov times. As we know, in the framework of chaos theory, it is habitually accepted that the idea of long-term prediction seems impossible because we live under a veil of uncertainty. But with technological advances, the landscape begins to change, both in chaos theory and in its applications, especially in the field of economics, to which we devote particular attention, carrying out as an example the analysis of the evolution of the Madrid Stock Exchange in the 2006-2013 crisis. Above all this, a reflection of a general nature is necessary to enlighten us on the possibility of opening a new horizon.

TI A comparison of various classical optimizers for a variational quantum
   linear solver
SO QUANTUM INFORMATION PROCESSING
AB Variational hybrid quantum classical algorithms are a class of quantum algorithms intended to run on noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices. These algorithms employ a parameterized quantum circuit (ansatz) and a quantum-classical feedback loop. A classical device is used to optimize the parameters in order to minimize a cost function that can be computed far more efficiently on a quantum device. The cost function is constructed such that finding the ansatz parameters that minimize its value, solves some problem of interest. We focus specifically on the variational quantum linear solver, and examine the effect of several gradient-free and gradient-based classical optimizers on performance. We focus on both the average rate of convergence of the classical optimizers studied, as well as the distribution of their average termination cost values, and how these are affected by noise. Our work demonstrates that realistic noise levels on NISQ devices present a challenge to the optimization process. All classical optimizers appear to be very negatively affected by the presence of realistic noise. If noise levels are significantly improved, there may be a good reason for preferring gradient-based methods in the future, which performed better than the gradient-free methods with only shot-noise present. The gradient-free optimizers, simultaneous perturbation stochastic approximation (SPSA) and Powell's method, and the gradient-based optimizers, AMSGrad and BFGS performed the best in the noisy simulation, and appear to be less affected by noise than the rest of the methods. SPSA appears to be the best performing method. COBYLA, Nelder-Mead and Conjugate-Gradient methods appear to be the most heavily affected by noise, with even slight noise levels significantly impacting their performance.

TI Quasiparticle Cooling Algorithms for Quantum Many-Body State Preparation
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Probing correlated states of many-body systems is one of the central tasks for quantum simulators and processors. A promising approach to state preparation is to realize desired correlated states as steady states of engineered dissipative evolution. A recent experiment with a Google superconducting quantum processor [X. Mi et al., Science 383, 1332 (2024)] demonstrated a cooling algorithm utilizing auxiliary degrees of freedom that are periodically reset to remove quasiparticles from the system, thereby driving it towards its ground state. In this work, we develop a kinetic-theory framework to describe quasiparticle cooling dynamics, and employ it to compare the efficiency of different cooling algorithms. In particular, we introduce a protocol where coupling to auxiliaries is modulated in time to minimize heating processes, and demonstrate that it allows a high-fidelity preparation of ground states in different quantum phases. We verify the validity of the kinetic-theory description by an extensive comparison with numerical simulations for the examples of a one-dimensional transverse-field Ising model, the transverse-field Ising model with an additional integrability-breaking field, and a nonintegrable antiferromagnetic Heisenberg spin ladder. In all cases, we are able to efficiently cool into the many-body ground state. The effects of noise, which limits efficiency of variational quantum algorithms in near-term quantum processors, are investigated through the lens of the kinetic theory: we show how the steady-state quasiparticle populations depend on the noise rate, and we establish maximum noise values for achieving high-fidelity ground states. This work establishes quasiparticle cooling algorithms as a practical, robust method for many-body state preparation on near-term quantum processors.

TI Reinforcement Learning for Many-Body Ground-State Preparation Inspired
   by Counterdiabatic Driving
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW X
AB The quantum alternating operator ansatz (QAOA) is a prominent example of variational quantum algorithms. We propose a generalized QAOA called CD-QAOA, which is inspired by the counterdiabatic driving procedure, designed for quantum many-body systems and optimized using a reinforcement learning (RL) approach. The resulting hybrid control algorithm proves versatile in preparing the ground state of quantum-chaotic many-body spin chains by minimizing the energy. We show that using terms occurring in the adiabatic gauge potential as generators of additional control unitaries, it is possible to achieve fast highfidelity many-body control away from the adiabatic regime. While each unitary retains the conventional QAOA-intrinsic continuous control degree of freedom such as the time duration, we consider the order of the multiple available unitaries appearing in the control sequence as an additional discrete optimization problem. Endowing the policy gradient algorithm with an autoregressive deep learning architecture to capture causality, we train the RL agent to construct optimal sequences of unitaries. The algorithm has no access to the quantum state, and we find that the protocol learned on small systems may generalize to larger systems. By scanning a range of protocol durations, we present numerical evidence for a finite quantum speed limit in the nonintegrable mixed-field spin-1/2 Ising and Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick models, and for the suitability to prepare ground states of the spin-1 Heisenberg chain in the long-range and topologically ordered parameter regimes. This work paves the way to incorporate recent success from deep learning for the purpose of quantum many-body control.

AB This paper focuses on the optimization of the number of logical qubits in quantum algorithms for factoring and computing discrete logarithms in Z* N. These algorithms contain an exponentiation circuit modulo.N, which is responsible for most of their cost, both in qubits and operations.
   In this paper, we show that using only o(logN) work qubits, one can obtain the least significant bits of the modular exponentiation output. We combine this result with May and Schlieper's truncation technique (ToSC 2022) and the Ekera-IIastad variant of Shor's algorithm (PQCrypto 2017) to solve the discrete logarithm problem in Z(N)(*) using only d+ o(logN) qubits, where d is the bit size of the logarithm. Consequently we can factor n-bit RSA moduli using n/2 + o(n) qubits, while current envisioned implementations require about 2n qubits.
   Our algorithm uses a Residue Number System and succeeds with a parametrizable probability. Being completely classical, we have implemented and tested it. For RSA factorization, we can reach a gate count O(n(3)) for a depth O(n(2) log(3) n), which then has to be multiplied by O(log n) (the number of measurement results required by Ekera-IIastad). To factor an RSA-2048 instance, we estimate that 1730 logical qubits and 2(36) Toffoli gates will suffice for a single run, and the algorithm needs on average 40 runs. To solve a discrete logarithm instance of 224 bits (112bit classical security) in a safe-prime group of 2048 bits, we estimate that 684 logical qubits would suffice, and 20 runs with 2(32) Toffoli gates each.

TI Efficient lattice-based revocable attribute-based encryption against
   decryption key exposure for cloud file sharing
SO JOURNAL OF CLOUD COMPUTING-ADVANCES SYSTEMS AND APPLICATIONS
AB Cloud file sharing (CFS) has become one of the important tools for enterprises to reduce technology operating costs and improve their competitiveness. Due to the untrustworthy cloud service provider, access control and security issues for sensitive data have been key problems to be addressed. Current solutions to these issues are largely related to the traditional public key cryptography, access control encryption or attribute-based encryption based on the bilinear mapping. The rapid technological advances in quantum algorithms and quantum computers make us consider the transition from the tradtional cryptographic primitives to the post-quantum counterparts. In response to these problems, we propose a lattice-based Ciphertext-Policy Attribute-Based Encryption(CP-ABE) scheme, which is designed based on the ring learing with error problem, so it is more efficient than that designed based on the learing with error problem. In our scheme, the indirect revocation and binary tree-based data structure are introduced to achieve efficient user revocation and dynamic management of user groups. At the same time, in order to further improve the efficiency of the scheme and realize file sharing across enterprises, the scheme also allows multiple authorities to jointly set up system parameters and manage distribute keys. Furthermore, by re-randomizing the user's private key and update key, we achieve decryption key exposure resistance(DKER) in the scheme. We provide a formal security model and a series of security experiments, which show that our scheme is secure under chosen-plaintext attacks. Experimental simulations and evaluation analyses demonstrate the high efficiency and practicality of our scheme.

TI Cooperative engineering the multiple radio-frequency fields to reduce
   the X-junction barrier for ion trap chips
SO CHIP
AB With the increasing number of ion qubits and improving performance of sophisticated quantum algorithms, more and more scalable complex ion trap electrodes have been developed and integrated. Nonlinear ion shuttling operations at the junction are more frequently used, such as in the areas of separation, merging, and exchanging. Several studies have been conducted to optimize the geometries of the radio-frequency (RF) electrodes to generate ideal trapping electric fi elds with a lower junction barrier and an even ion height of the RF saddle points. However, this iteration is time-consuming and commonly accompanied by complicated and sharp electrode geometry. Therefore, high-accuracy fabrication process and high electric breakdown voltage are essential. In the current work, an effective method was proposed to reduce the junction ' s pseudo-potential barrier and ion height variation by setting several individual RF electrodes and adjusting each RF voltage amplitude without changing the geometry of the electrode structure. The simulation results show that this method shows the same effect on engineering the trapping potential and reducing the potential barrier, but requires fewer parameters and optimization time. By combining this method with the geometrical shapeoptimizing, the pseudo-potential barrier and the ion height variation near the junction can be further reduced. In addition, the geometry of the electrodes can be simpli fi ed to relax the fabrication precision and keep the ability to engineer the trapping electric fi eld in real-time even after the fabrication of the electrodes, which provides a potential all-electric degree of freedom for the design and control of the two-dimensional ion crystals and investigation of their phase transition.

TI Shallow implementation of quantum fingerprinting with application to
   quantum finite automata
SO FRONTIERS IN COMPUTER SCIENCE
AB Quantum fingerprinting is a technique that maps a classical input word to a quantum state. The obtained quantum state is much shorter than the original word, and its processing uses fewer resources, making it useful in quantum algorithms, communication, and cryptography. One of the examples of quantum fingerprinting is the quantum automata algorithm for MODp={ai<middle dot>p divided by i >= 0} languages, where p is a prime number. However, implementing such an automaton on current quantum hardware is not efficient. Quantum fingerprinting maps a word x is an element of{0, 1}n of length n to a state |psi(x)> of O(logn) qubits, and uses O(n) unitary operations. Computing quantum fingerprint using all available qubits of the current quantum computers is infeasible due to many quantum operations. To make quantum fingerprinting practical, we should optimize the circuit for depth instead of width, in contrast to the previous works. We propose explicit methods of quantum fingerprinting based on tools from additive combinatorics, such as generalized arithmetic progressions (GAPs), and prove that these methods provide circuit depth comparable to a probabilistic method. We also compare our method to prior work on explicit quantum fingerprinting methods. We provide a series of numerical experiments with implementation of the quantum automata for MOD17 language on noisy simulators of IBMQ quantum devices. We show that shallow implementation based on GAPs produces results with much smaller computational error compared to standard deep circuit implementation. Despite the fact that on the ideal quantum computational device, the opposite situation arises. We show that the shallow circuit for the quantum automaton is better for near-future quantum computational devices.

TI Naturally restricted subsets of nonsignaling correlations: typicality
   and convergence
SO QUANTUM
AB It is well-known that in a Bell experiment, the observed correlation between measurement outcomes-as predicted by quantum theory-can be stronger than that allowed by local causality, yet not fully constrained by the principle of relativistic causality. In practice, the characterization of the set Q of quantum correlations is carried out, often, through a converging hierarchy of outer approximations. On the other hand, some subsets of Q arising from additional constraints [e.g., originating from quantum states having positive-partial-transposition (PPT) or being finite-dimensional maximally entangled (MES)] turn out to be also amenable to similar numerical characterizations. How, then, at a quantitative level, are all these naturally restricted subsets of nonsignaling correlations different? Here, we consider several bipartite Bell scenarios and numerically estimate their volume relative to that of the set of nonsignaling correlations. Within the number of cases investigated, we have observed that (1) for a given number of inputs n(s) (outputs n(o)), the relative volume of both the Bell-local set and the quantum set increases (decreases) rapidly with increasing n(o) (n(s)) (2) although the so-called macroscopically local set Q(1) may approximate Q well in the two-input scenarios, it can be a very poor approximation of the quantum set when n(s) > n(o) (3) the almost-quantum set (Q) over tilde (1) is an exceptionally-good approximation to the quantum set (4) the difference between Q and the set of correlations originating from MES is most significant when n(o) = 2, whereas (5) the difference between the Bell-local set and the PPT set generally becomes more significant with increasing no. This last comparison, in particular, allows us to identify Bell scenarios where there is little hope of realizing the Bell violation by PPT states and those that deserve further exploration.

TI Parallel Implementation of Lightweight Secure Hash Algorithm on CPU and
   GPU Environments
SO ELECTRONICS
AB Currently, cryptographic hash functions are widely used in various applications, including message authentication codes, cryptographic random generators, digital signatures, key derivation functions, and post-quantum algorithms. Notably, they play a vital role in establishing secure communication between servers and clients. Specifically, servers often need to compute a large number of hash functions simultaneously to provide smooth services to connected clients. In this paper, we present highly optimized parallel implementations of Lightweight Secure Hash (LSH), a hash algorithm developed in Korea, on server sides. To optimize LSH performance, we leverage two parallel architectures: AVX-512 on high-end CPUs and NVIDIA GPUs. In essence, we introduce a word-level parallel processing design suitable for AVX-512 instruction sets and a data parallel processing design appropriate for the NVIDIA CUDA platform. In the former approach, we parallelize the core functions of LSH using AVX-512 registers and instructions. As a result, our first implementation achieves a performance improvement of up to 50.37% compared to the latest LSH AVX-2 implementation. In the latter approach, we optimize the core operation of LSH with CUDA PTX assembly and apply a coalesced memory access pattern. Furthermore, we determine the optimal number of blocks/threads configuration and CUDA streams for RTX 2080Ti and RTX 3090. Consequently, in the RTX 3090 architecture, our optimized CUDA implementation achieves about a 180.62% performance improvement compared with the initially ported LSH implementation to the CUDA platform. As far as we know, this is the first work on optimizing LSH with AVX-512 and NVIDIA GPU. The proposed implementation methodologies can be used alone or together in a server environment to achieve the maximum throughput of LSH computation.

TI Energy landscapes for the quantum approximate optimization algorithm
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) have demonstrated considerable potential in solving NP-hard combinatorial problems in the contemporary noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) era. The quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) is one such algorithm, used in solving the maximum cut (Max-Cut) problem for a given graph by successive implementation of L quantum circuit layers within a corresponding Trotterized ansatz. The challenge of exploring the cost function of VQAs arising from an exponential proliferation of local minima with increasing circuit depth has been well documented. However, fewer studies have investigated the impact of circuit depth on QAOA performance in finding the correct Max-Cut solution. Here we employ basinhopping global optimization methods to navigate the energy landscapes for QAOA ans & auml;tze for various graphs, and analyze QAOA performance in finding the correct Max-Cut solution. The structure of the solution space is also investigated using discrete path sampling to build databases of local minima and the transition states that connect them, providing insightful visualizations using disconnectivity graphs. We find that the corresponding landscapes generally have a single funnel organization, which makes it relatively straightforward to locate low-lying minima with good Max-Cut solution probabilities. In some cases below the adiabatic limit the second lowest local minimum may even yield a higher solution probability than the global minimum. This important observation has motivated us to develop broader metrics in evaluating QAOA performance, based on collections of minima obtained from basin-hopping global optimization. Hence we establish expectation thresholds in elucidating useful solution probabilities from local minima, an approach that may provide significant gains in elucidating reasonable solution probabilities from local minima.

AB We present Laplace, a microarchitecture for tracking machine representations of probability distributions paired with architectural state. We present two newmethods for in-processor distribution representations which are approximations of probability distributions just as floating-point number representations are approximations of real-valued numbers. Laplace executes unmodified RISC-V binaries and can track uncertainty through them. We present two sets of ISA extensions to provide a mechanism to initialize distributional information in the microarchitecture and to allow applications to query statistics of the distributional information without exposing the uncertainty representations above the ISA.
   We evaluate the accuracy and performance of Laplace using a suite of 21 benchmarks spanning domains ranging from variational quantum algorithms and sensor data processing to materials properties modeling. Monte Carlo simulation on the benchmarks requires 2 076x more instructions on average (and up to 21 343x in some cases) to achieve the same accuracy that Laplace can achieve in a single execution. Compared to state-of-the-art alternatives to Monte Carlo, Laplace achieves an average 1.3x accuracy improvement versus PaCAL [22] and more than 4.6x accuracy improvement versus the method used by the NIST Uncertainty Machine [26], quantified using the Wasserstein distance to Monte Carlo.
   Unlike existing methods for uncertainty tracking which require software to be rewritten in a domain-specific language or extensive source-level changes, Laplace achieves all of these benefits while requiring no changes to existing binaries in order to track uncertainty through them, with only minimal changes required to get uncertainty information into the microarchitecture. We have deployed an implementation of Laplace as a commercial product in the form of a cloud-accessible virtual machine.

AB In 1948, Shannon used a probabilistic argument to show that there exist codes achieving a maximal rate defined by the channel capacity. In 1954, Muller and Reed introduced a simple deterministic code construction, conjectured shortly after to achieve channel capacity. Major progress was made towards establishing this conjecture over the last decades, with various branches of discrete mathematics involved such as combinatorial bounds, sharp thresholds, hypercontractivity, additive combinatorics and polarization theory. In particular, the special case of the erasure channel was settled by Kudekar at al., relying on Bourgain-Kalai's sharp threshold theorem for symmetric monotone properties. The main case of error channels remained however unsettled, due in particular to the property being non-monotone and the lack of techniques to obtain fast local error decay up to capacity, despite the notable vanishing bound on the local error from Reeves-Pfister.
   This paper closes the conjecture's proof. The main ingredient is a new recursive boosting framework for coding, where codewords are decoded by aggregating restrictions on a 'subspace-sunflower' structure, analogous to the structure from Erdos-Rado 1960. The dependencies between the sunflower petals are handled with an L-2 and L-4 Boolean Fourier analysis, and a list-decoding argument with a weight enumerator bound from Sberlo-Shpilka is used to control the global error from the local one. For the local error, while monotonicity does not apply, we show that a 'weak threshold' result still holds using solely symmetries. This gives in particular a shortened and tightened argument for the vanishing local error result, and with prior works, it also implies the strong wire-tap secrecy of RM codes on pure-state classical-quantum channels.

TI A tale of two transfers: characterizing polydimethylsiloxane
   viscoelastic stamping and heated poly bis-A carbonate transfer of
   hexagonal boron nitride
SO MICRON
AB Two-dimensional (2D) materials have many applications ranging from heterostructure electronics to nanofluidics and quantum technology. In order to effectively utilize 2D materials towards these ends, they must be transferred and integrated into complex device geometries. In this report, we investigate two conventional methods for the transfer of 2D materials: viscoelastic stamping with polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) and a heated transfer with poly bis-A carbonate (PC). We use both methods to transfer mechanically-exfoliated flakes of hexagonal boron nitride onto silicon nitride (SiNx) substrates and characterize the resulting transfers using atomic force microscopy (AFM), aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy (AC-STEM) and electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS). We find that both transfer methods yield flakes with significant and comparable residue (within the limitations of our study on eight samples). Qualitative interpretation of EELS maps demonstrates that this residue is comprised of silicon, carbon and oxygen for both transfer methods. Quantitative analysis of ACSTEM images reveals that the area covered in residue is on average, slightly lower for PDMS transfers (31 % +/- 1 %), compared to PC transfers (41 % +/- 4 %). This work underscores the importance of improving existing transfer protocols towards applications where cleaner materials are critical, as well as the need for robust methods to clean 2D materials.

TI Gouy Phase Induced Optical Skyrmion Transformation in Diffraction
   Limited Scale
SO LASER & PHOTONICS REVIEWS
AB Optical skyrmions are topologically stable quasiparticles that can be constructed with electric field, spin angular momentum, polarization Stokes vector, pseudospin, etc. In this letter, both theoretical and experimental studies are carried out to reveal the role of Gouy phase in the topology transformation during the tight focusing of Stokes skyrmions. The Stokes skyrmionic beam can be constructed by superposing two orthogonally polarized components with orthogonal spatial modes. The Gouy phase produced in the focused field depends on the orbital angular momentum carried by the high order mode component of the incident Stokes skyrmionic beam. While the beam size of the focused field is diffraction limited, the variation of the Stokes vectors in the skyrmion topology is in the sub-diffraction limited scale. The presented results shed light on the understanding of the topology transformation between the incident and the tightly focused fields, paving the way for engineering the optical skyrmions in micro-nano scale and their applications in information processing, quantum technology, metrology, etc.
   The tight focusing of the incident skyrmionic beams will produce topology transformations between the incident and the corresponding focused beams. The Gouy phase plays a key role in such transformations, which is related to the orbital angular momentum carried by the high order Laguerre-Gaussian mode in the skyrmionic beam. The focused skyrmion exhibits sub-diffraction limited variation of its Stokes vectors. image

TI Heterogeneous integration of superconducting thin films and epitaxial
   semiconductor heterostructures with lithium niobate
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS D-APPLIED PHYSICS
AB We report on scalable heterointegration of superconducting electrodes and epitaxial semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) on strong piezoelectric and optically nonlinear lithium niobate. The implemented processes combine the sputter-deposited thin film superconductor niobium nitride and III-V compound semiconductor membranes onto the host substrate. The superconducting thin film is employed as a zero-resistivity electrode material for a surface acoustic wave resonator with internal quality factors Q approximate to 17 000 representing a three-fold enhancement compared to identical devices with normal conducting electrodes. Superconducting operation of approximate to 400 MHz resonators is achieved to temperatures T > 7 K and electrical radio frequency powers P-rf > +9 dBm. Heterogeneously integrated single QDs couple to the resonant phononic field of the surface acoustic wave resonator operated in the superconducting regime. Position and frequency selective coupling mediated by deformation potential coupling is validated using time-integrated and time-resolved optical spectroscopy. Furthermore, acoustoelectric charge state control is achieved in a modified device geometry harnessing large piezoelectric fields inside the resonator. The hybrid QD-surface acoustic wave resonator can be scaled to higher operation frequencies and smaller mode volumes for quantum phase modulation and transduction between photons and phonons via the QD. Finally, the employed materials allow for the realization of other types of optoelectronic devices, including superconducting single photon detectors and integrated photonic and phononic circuits.

TI Nonlinear Dynamics of Higher-Order Quasi-Phase-Matched Dispersive Waves
   Formation in Dispersion-Oscillating Liquid-Core Fibers
SO LASER & PHOTONICS REVIEWS
AB Here, the concept of generating higher-order dispersive waves (DWs) via quasi-phase-matching (QPM) in periodically dispersion-modulated liquid-core fibers are demonstrated by generating distinct narrowband sidebands generated outside the conventional supercontinuum (SC) spectrum. Through controlled partial core collapse, the commonly used phase-matching (PM) condition is amended by an additional grating-related term. This results in the generation of ultrashort higher-order DWs controlled by the grating parameters, extending the conventional SC spectrum up to 3 mu m$\umu {\rm m}$. Of particular interest is the excellent overlap of the QPM-peaks obtained from experiments, simulations, and PM considerations, showing the quality of the implementation approach and allowing for controlled narrowband peaks generation even for femtosecond input pulses. In summary, this multicolor generation concept embodies a versatile photonic platform with unique dispersion control capabilities for the transfer of spectral power into selected narrowband spectral intervals. It stands out with its unique capabilities, making it well-suited for applications in diverse fields like bioanalytics, life sciences, quantum technology, and metrology.
   Quasi-phase-matched dispersive wave formation represents a novel nonlinear frequency conversion scheme to transfer electromagnetic energy into tailored narrowband spectral domains. Using ultrashort pulses, this work demonstrates the capabilities of core-diameter modulated liquid core fibers to generate strong sidebands outside conventional supercontinua of silica fibers that can be tuned by the properties of the modulation. image

TI Quantum Dot-Polymer Architectures by Two-Photon Polymerization: From 4D
   Microfabrication to Quantum Light Sources
SO ADVANCED OPTICAL MATERIALS
AB Solid-state nanoemitters, or quantum dots (QDs), exhibit high quantum yield, tunable light emission, and exceptional photo-stability, making them ideal for integration into polymers and enabling the fabrication of devices with tailored optical properties. Combining QD-doped photopolymers with two-photon polymerization (2PP) enables the fabrication of fluorescent 3D complex objects with nanometric resolution. To avoid QD agglomeration, which would hinder the device's optical performance, different strategies for achieving homogeneous particle dispersion within the polymer matrix are analyzed. Notable approaches include surface modifications, dual-functional QDs serving as photoinitiators and fluorophores, and resin additives. Depending on the protocol employed, the QDs enable sub-wavelength resolution and precise structuring during the manufacturing, by interacting with both the photopolymer and the laser beam. These physicochemical phenomena are also systematically investigated. Finally, this review provides a comprehensive examination of the characteristics and applications of QD-based optical devices, including photoluminescent security tags and PUFs, QD-integrated photonic crystals (PCs), stimuli-responsive 4D sensors, multicolor metamaterials, near-infrared (NIR) filters, and light nanosources, including single photon sources. The fabrication strategies of plasmonic light nanosources are investigated as well. The various fabrication approaches for these devices are critically analyzed and systematically compared to highlight their respective advantages, limitations, and potential for future advancements.

TI Ultra-efficient surface grating couplers for chip-to-fiber and
   chip-to-free-space coupling based on single-beam radiation
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Surface grating couplers, such as fiber-chip grating couplers and optical antennas, are fundamental devices in photonic integrated circuits, as they enable the coupling of light between the chip and an external medium. An important metric of surface grating couplers is the coupling efficiency, and high values, greater than-1 dB, are required for applications in quantum technology, light detection and ranging, and optical interconnects. Surface grating couplers typically suffer from radiation loss to the substrate, which significantly limits their coupling efficiency. Here we propose a novel grating-coupling concept that utilizes a high-refractive-index upper cladding to frustrate radiation orders to the substrate by operating in a single-beam diffraction regime. To illustrate this concept, we report the design of an easily fabricable silicon surface grating coupler with an unprecedented coupling efficiency of-0.2 dB to a single-mode optical fiber. Furthermore, the proposed strategy allows us to design an evanescently coupled millimeter-long optical antenna with a coupling efficiency of-0.1 dB to free space. Additionally, an ultra-fast wavelength-tunable beam steering of 0.37 degrees/nm is achieved, which corresponds to more than a 2.5-fold enhancement over comparable silicon antennas. These results represent a pathway for a new set of photonic integrated interfaces for applications in which high-efficiency chip-to-fiber and chip-to-free-space coupling is critical.

TI Modification of WS2 thin film properties using high dose
   gamma irradiation
SO NANOTECHNOLOGY
AB The tunability of the transition metal dichalcogenide properties has gained attention from numerous researchers due to their wide application in various fields including quantum technology. In the present work, WS2 has been deposited on fluorine doped tin oxide substrate and its properties have been studied systematically. These samples were irradiated using gamma radiation for various doses, and the effect on structural, morphological, optical and electrical properties has been reported. The crystallinity of the material is observed to be decreased, and the results are well supported by x-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy techniques. The increase in grain boundaries has been supported by the agglomeration observed in the scanning electron microscopy micrographs. The XPS results of WS2 after gamma irradiation show evolution of oxygen, carbon, C=O, W-O and SO4-2 peaks, confirming the addition of impurities and formation of point defect. The gamma irradiation creates point defects, and their density increases considerably with increasing gamma dosage. These defects crucially altered the structural, optical and electrical properties of the material. The reduction in the optical band gap with increased gamma irradiation is evident from the absorption spectra and respective Tauc plots. The I-V graphs show a 1000-fold increase in the saturation current after 100 kGy gamma irradiation dose. This work has explored the gamma irradiation effect on the WS2 and suggests substantial modification in the material and enhancement in electrical properties.

TI Surface ligand networking promotes intersystem crossing in the
   Au18(SR)14 nanocluster
SO NANOSCALE HORIZONS
AB Understanding the relationships between the structure and optical properties of ligand-protected, atomically precise metal nanoclusters (NCs) is of paramount importance for exploring their applications in photonics, biomedicine and quantum technology. Here, two Au18(SR)14 NCs protected by 2,4-dimethylbenzenethiolate (DMBT) and cyclohexanethiolate (CHT), respectively, are studied using time-resolved absorption and emission spectroscopies. Although the two NCs exhibit similar photoluminescence (PL) quantum yields (QY similar to 0.1%) at room temperature, their excited state dynamics are very different, which are modulated by the interactions between the Au core and the ligands, as well as the networking interactions among aromatic ligands. Specifically, Au18(CHT)14 exhibits a single exponential decay of its singlet excited state (time constant tau = 17 ns) with almost no triplet population. In contrast, there is a triplet population of more than 15% for Au18(DMBT)14, and an intersystem crossing (ISC) process of similar to 4 ns is identified. Temperature-dependent PL measurements of Au18(DMBT)14 show three radiative processes, including prompt fluorescence, thermally activated delayed fluorescence and phosphorescence. The nonradiative process is partially suppressed at low temperatures, leading to enhanced photoluminescence (QY up to 9.0%) and exclusive phosphorescence was observed below 120 K. The obtained insights into the excited state energy flow and PL dynamics will benefit future design of luminescent NCs for optoelectronic applications.

TI Improving the accuracy and efficiency of quantum connected moments
   expansions
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB The still-maturing noisy intermediate-scale quantum technology faces strict limitations on the algorithms that can be implemented efficiently. In the realm of quantum chemistry, the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) algorithm has become ubiquitous, with many variations. Alternatively, a promising new avenue has been unraveled by the quantum variants of techniques grounded on expansions of the moments of the Hamiltonian, notably the connected moments expansion (CMX) and the Peeters-Devreese-Soldatov (PDS) energy functional. Common to those approaches is that, upon preparing an approximate ground state used to compute the necessary moments, the accuracy of the estimated ground state energy depends on the degree of overlap between the prepared state and the true ground state. Thus, we use the ADAPT-VQE algorithm to test shallow circuit construction strategies for the purpose of increasing the overlap with the exact ground state, validated by the sizable accuracy improvement herein reported in the PDS and CMX ground state energies. We also show that we can take advantage of the fact that the terms to be measured are highly recurring in different moments, incurring a substantial reduction in the number of necessary measurements. By coupling this measurement caching with a threshold that determines whether a given term is to be measured based on its associated scalar coefficient, we observe a further reduction in the number of circuit implementations while allowing for tunable accuracy.

TI Facilitating Uniform Large-Scale MoS2, WS2
   Monolayers, and Their Heterostructures through van der Waals Epitaxy
SO ACS APPLIED MATERIALS & INTERFACES
AB The fabrication process for the uniform large-scale MoS2, WS2 transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) monolayers, and their heterostructures has been developed by van der Waals epitaxy (VdWE) through the reaction of MoCl5 or WCl6 precursors and the reactive gas H2S to form MoS2 or WS2 monolayers, respectively. The heterostructures of MoS2/WS2 or WS2/MoS2 can be easily achieved by changing the precursor from WCl6 to MoCl5 once the WS2 monolayer has been fabricated or switching the precursor from MoCl5 to WCl6 after the MoS2 monolayer has been deposited on the substrate. These VdWE-grown MoS2, WS2 monolayers, and their heterostructures have been successfully deposited on Si wafers with 300 nm SiO2 coating (300 nm SiO2/Si), quartz glass, fused silica, and sapphire substrates using the protocol that we have developed. We have characterized these TMDCs materials with a range of tools/techniques including scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), micro-Raman analysis, photoluminescence (PL), atomic force microscopy (AFM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), and selected-area electron diffraction (SAED). The band alignment and large-scale uniformity of MoS2/WS2 heterostructures have also been evaluated with PL spectroscopy. This process and resulting large-scale MoS2, WS2 monolayers, and their heterostructures have demonstrated promising solutions for the applications in next-generation nanoelectronics, nanophotonics, and quantum technology.

TI Quantum oscillations in a hexagonal boron nitride-supported single
   crystalline InSb nanosheet
SO CHINESE PHYSICS B
AB A gated Hall-bar device is made from an epitaxially grown, free-standing InSb nanosheet on a hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) dielectric/graphite gate structure and the electron transport properties in the InSb nanosheet are studied by gate-transfer characteristic and magnetotransport measurements at low temperatures. The measurements show that the carriers in the InSb nanosheet are of electrons and the carrier density in the nanosheet can be highly efficiently tuned by the graphite gate. The mobility of the electrons in the InSb nanosheet is extracted from low-field magneotransport measurements and a value of the mobility exceeding similar to 1.8 x 10(4) cm(2).V-1.s(-1) is found. High-field magentotransport measurements show well-defined Shubnikov-de Haas (SdH) oscillations in the longitudinal resistance of the InSb nanosheet. Temperature-dependent measurements of the SdH oscillations are carried out and key transport parameters, including the electron effective mass m* similar to 0.028m(0) and the quantum lifetime tau similar to 0.046 ps, in the InSb nanosheet are extracted. It is for the first time that such experimental measurements have been reported for a free-standing InSb nanosheet and the results obtained indicate that InSb nanosheet/hBN/graphite gate structures can be used to develop advanced quantum devices for novel physics studies and for quantum technology applications.

TI Cascaded four-wave mixing in liquid-core optical fibers
SO APL PHOTONICS
AB Ultrafast nonlinear interactions in optical fibers are commonly employed for generating light with tailored properties, with four-wave mixing (FWM) being a widely used mechanism. Existing systems mainly rely on fibers with solid glass cores, facing limitations due to a lack of tunability and susceptibility to noise. Here, fibers with fluidic cores emerge as a promising alternative for efficient FWM, offering novel functionalities and expanded parameter ranges. In this study, we investigate single and cascaded FWM in liquid-core fibers regarding spectral tunability and interplay with the Raman effect. The study relies on binary liquids used as core materials in combination with ultrashort ps-pulses and seeding. Strong side bands were observed whose spectral position could be adjusted by the liquid composition and the seed wavelength. Seeding additionally leads to higher-order side bands, which we assign to cascaded FWM. Furthermore, we explore the interaction between FWM and stimulated Raman scattering by adjusting the FWM peaks to overlap or deviate from the Raman bands through variations of the core liquid and the seed wavelength. The presented results shed light on the unique characteristics of the liquid-core fiber platform in the context of parametric nonlinear interactions, particularly regarding tunability and interaction with Raman scattering. These findings offer new possibilities for the development of light sources capable of Raman-free photon pair generation for quantum technology or for creating tunable narrowband spectra for imaging applications in life sciences.

TI Research Progress in Rotation Detection and Imaging Based on Optical
   Vortex
SO LASER & OPTOELECTRONICS PROGRESS
AB Optical vortex refers to a structured beam carrying orbital angular momentum, with an annular intensity distribution and a vortex-like wavefront structure. Due to its unique optical complex amplitude and orbital angular momentum, the optical vortex demonstrates tremendous potential in biomedicine, high-capacity optical communication, quantum technology, optical measurement and imaging. In terms of rotation detection, a rotational Doppler frequency shift is generated when a vortex beam illuminates rotating objects. The parameters of the rotation, precession and other motion characteristics can be efficiently and conveniently measured based on the detection of this frequency shift, which is of great significance for identifying the geometric structure, motion characteristics and attitude information of targets. In terms of imaging, the orbital angular momentum of an optical vortex can be used for digital spiral imaging. Optical vortices of different modes are a set of orthogonal complete basis vectors in Hilbert space and can be developed into optical vortex single pixel complex amplitude imaging combined with single pixel imaging technology, which has a potential application in astronomical observation and medical diagnosis. In this paper, we comprehensively review the research progress in rotation detection and imaging technology based on optical vortices. The theoretical principle and the latest research advances are introduced, and future development is also discussed.

TI Formation and stability of point defect color centers in 6H silicon
   carbide
SO JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS
AB Point defect color centers acting as single-photon emitters are promising for quantum technology applications and have been extensively studied, e.g., in the 4H polytype of silicon carbide (SiC). However, the physics of such color centers in other SiC polytypes is much less explored. Herein, we study the formation and thermal stability of such color centers in 6H-SiC using photoluminescence spectroscopy. The emissions from typical single-photon emitters, such as silicon vacancies, divacancies, and carbon antisite-vacancy pairs in 6H-SiC, were monitored as a function of the proton irradiation fluence and post-irradiation annealing, and compared to that in 4H-SiC. Overall, at the background of similarities between the emission behavior in 4H- and 6H-SiC polytypes, we observed prominent differences; e.g., for the thermal stability of the carbon antisite-vacancy pair, which exhibited maximized emissions upon 300 and 900 degrees C anneals in 4H- and 6H-SiC, respectively. Moreover, we observed a range of defect emission signatures not previously reported for 6H-SiC in the literature and discussed their potential origin in the context of the thermal stability. For example, among the PL-lines in 6H-SiC, we detected periodically repeatable emission signatures, resembling the so-called L-lines recently reported in 4H-SiC, even though their exact origin has not yet been settled in the literature. Thus, we use color centers comparison in different polytypes to better understand the nature of the single-photon emitters in SiC.

TI Thermometry with a dissipative heavy impurity
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Improving the measurement precision of low temperature is significant in fundamental science and advanced quantum technology application. However, the measurement precision of temperature T usually diverges as T tends to zero. Here, by utilizing a heavy impurity to measure the temperature of a Bose gas, we obtain the Landau bound to precision delta T-2 proportional to T-2 to avoid the divergence. When the initial momentum of the heavy impurity is close to be fixed and nonzero, the measurement precision can be delta T-2 proportional to T-3 to break the Landau bound. We derive the momentum distribution of the heavy impurity at any moment and obtain the optimal measurement precision of the temperature by calculating the Fisher information. As a result, we find that increasing the expectation value P-0 and reducing the variance Delta/2 of the initial momentum can help to improve the measurement precision. Moreover, under certain conditions, root Delta/P-0 is a relevant parameter, the smallness of which helps improve the thermometric precision of the probe. In addition, the momentum measurement is the optimal measurement of the temperature in the case that the initial momentum is close to be fixed and not equal to zero. The kinetic energy measurement is the optimal measurement in the case that the expectation value of the initial momentum is close to zero. Finally, we obtain that the temperatures of two Bose gases can be measured simultaneously. The simultaneous measurement precision is proportional to T2 when two temperatures are close to T.

TI Quantitative measurement of graphitic sp 2 on single nanodiamonds with
   sub-monolayer sensitivity using differential interference contrast and
   photo-thermal microscopy
SO CARBON
AB The surface of nanodiamonds is prone to be decorated with a graphitic layer due to the thermodynamic instability of diamond versus graphite. Notably, this surface layer affects the zeta-potential of nanodiamonds controlling their colloidal stability, modulates the charging of embedded nitrogen vacancy centres used for sensing and quantum technology, and introduces an optical absorption which leads to heating and destruction of nanodiamonds under intense laser irradiation. Physical and chemical treatments to reduce the graphitic carbon are available, but a sensitive method to measure this graphitic layer on single nanodiamonds is lacking. Here, we demonstrate a non-destructive method to quantitatively determine the graphitic carbon correlatively with the nanodiamond size, on individual nanodiamonds. The method allows determining the fraction of graphitic sp 2 to diamond sp 3 bonded atoms, and estimating the sp 2 surface layer thickness. We investigated milled nanodiamonds, both untreated and chemically treated to remove sp 2 . We found that untreated nanodiamonds were covered by the equivalent of a single sp 2 monolayer, which was reduced to 10% of a monolayer for treated nanodiamonds. In both cases, significant variations between individual nanodiamonds were observed. The minimum number of sp 2 bonded atoms detectable under the measurement conditions reported here was found to be 2 x 10 4 .

TI Control and tuning of color centers in 4H silicon carbide by application
   of electric field via Schottky diode
SO MATERIALS SCIENCE IN SEMICONDUCTOR PROCESSING
AB The ability to tune and manipulate the energy and intensity of photons emitted from color centers in semiconductors is of great importance for developing point defect quantum emitters as a platform for future quantum technology (QT) applications. One of the promising materials to realize point defect based QT is silicon carbide (SiC), as it combines a plethora of color center candidates with mature material processing and device fabrication. Here we explore the use of a Schottky diode, fabricated on a highly doped n-type 4H-SiC epitaxial layer, to control and modulate defect-related emission under both forward and reverse bias conditions. Zero phonon lines (ZPLs) from three prominent color centers are investigated: V1, V1' and V2 assigned to the silicon vacancy, B1 and B2 from the carbon antisite-vacancy pair, and PL4 of the divacancy complex. All the studied defect-related emission wavelengths are found to shift in response to applied bias, but with a varying magnitude and direction of the shift. The electric field-induced variations are assigned to Stark effect and current flow within the device. Furthermore, two unknown defect signatures, labeled K1 and K2, are observed in the vicinity (within 2 meV) of the V2 ZPL and exhibit a strong forward bias dependence. A possible origin related to silicon vacancies perturbed by nearby carbon antisites is discussed.

TI Plexcitonic dynamics in plasmonic nanorod dimer strongly coupled to a
   single quantum dot via modulation of dark modes
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Strong light-matter interaction in plexcitonic systems plays a crucial role in both fundamental quantum optics study and practical applications, including quantum information processing and nanophotonic devices. However, despite strong light confinement associated with plasmons, large damping of plasmonic cavities remains a major obstacle to achieving strong coupling, particularly with single exciton. Here, we introduce a novel platform that achieves strong coupling via leveraging dark plasmon mode to reduce the loss of the system rather than only enhancing the coupling strength to overcome the system's large damping. Optical properties of the bright/dark modes supported by different silver nanorod dimers are studied, revealing the connection between symmetric configurations and the properties of these resonant modes. The dark mode of side-by-side silver nanorod dimer exhibits an ultralow loss of approximately 22 meV, dramatically decreasing the harsh requirement in coupling strength and enabling strong coupling with a single quantum dot. The time-domain and frequency-domain characteristics of the bright/dark mode-exciton coupling system are compared in detail. Furthermore, a new scheme based on symmetry breaking is proposed to realize the coupling state control across three coupling regimes with different time-domain and frequency-domain characteristics.

AB Exceptional points (EPs) have been extensively explored in mechanical, acoustic, plasmonic, and photonic systems. However, little is known about the role of EPs in tailoring the dynamic tunability of optical devices. A specific type of EPs known as chiral EPs has recently attracted much attention for controlling the flow of light and for building sensors with better responsivity. A recently demonstrated route to chiral EPs via lithographically defined symmetric Mie scatterers on the rim of resonators has not only provided the much-needed mechanical stability for studying chiral EPs, but also helped reduce losses originating from nanofabrication imperfections, facilitating the in-situ study of chiral EPs and their contribution to the dynamics and tunability of resonators. Here, we use asymmetric Mie scatterers to break the rotational symmetry of a microresonator, to demonstrate deterministic thermal tuning across a chiral EP, and to demonstrate EP-mediated chiral optical nonlinear response and efficient electro-optic tuning. Our results indicate asymmetric electro-optic modulation with up to 17 dB contrast at GHz and CMOS-compatible voltage levels. Such wafer-scale nano-manufacturing of chiral electro-optic modulators and the chiral EP-tailored tunning may facilitate new micro-resonator functionalities in quantum information processing, electromagnetic wave control, and optical interconnects.

TI Modified gravity/entropic gravity correspondence due to graviton mass
SO ANNALS OF PHYSICS
AB Some time ago, it has been suggested that gravitons can acquire mass in the process of spontaneous symmetry breaking of diffeomorphisms through the condensation of scalar fields [Chamseddine and Mukhanov, JHEP, 2010]. Taking this possibility into account, in the present paper, first we show how the graviton mass intricately reshapes the gravitational potential akin to a Yukawa-like potential at large distances. Notably, this long-range force modifies the Newton's law in large distances and might explain the phenomena of dark matter. The most important finding in the present paper is the derivation of a modified Newtons law of gravity by modifying the Verlinde's entropic force relation due to the graviton contribution. The graviton contribution to the entropy basically measures the correlation of graviton and matter fields which then reproduces the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy at the horizon. This result shows the dual description of gravity: in the language of quantum information and entropy the gravity can be viewed as an entropic force, however in terms of particles and fields, it can be viewed as a long range force. Further we have recovered the corrected Einstein field equations as well as the Lambda CDM where dark matter emerges as an apparent effect.

TI Twist-angle-dependent momentum-space direct and indirect interlayer
   excitons in WSe2/WS2 heterostructure
SO RSC ADVANCES
AB Interlayer excitons (ILEs) in the van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures of type-II band alignment transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) have attracted significant interest owing to their unique exciton properties and potential in quantum information applications. However, the new dimension that emerges with the stacking of structures with a twist angle leads to a more complex fine structure of ILEs, presenting both an opportunity and a challenge for the regulation of the interlayer excitons. In this study, we report the evolution of interlayer excitons with the twist angle in the WSe2/WS2 heterostructure and identify the direct (indirect) interlayer excitons by combining photoluminescence (PL) and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Two interlayer excitons with opposite circular polarization assigned to the different transition paths of K-K and Q-K were observed. The nature of the direct (indirect) interlayer exciton was confirmed by circular polarization PL measurement, excitation power-dependent PL measurement and DFT calculations. Furthermore, by applying an external electric field to regulate the band structure of the WSe2/WS2 heterostructure and control the transition path of the interlayer excitons, we could successfully realize the regulation of interlayer exciton emission. This study provides more evidence for the twist-angle-based control of heterostructure properties.

TI Realizing the symmetry-protected Haldane phase in Fermi-Hubbard ladders
SO NATURE
AB Topology in quantum many-body systems has profoundly changed our understanding of quantum phases of matter. The model that has played an instrumental role in elucidating these effects is the antiferromagnetic spin-1 Haldane chain(1,2). Its ground state is a disordered state, with symmetry-protected fourfold-degenerate edge states due to fractional spin excitations. In the bulk, it is characterized by vanishing two-point spin correlations, gapped excitations and a characteristic non-local order parameter(3,4). More recently it has been understood that the Haldane chain forms a specific example of a more general classification scheme of symmetry-protected topological phases of matter, which is based on ideas connected to quantum information and entanglement(5-7). Here, we realize a finite-temperature version of such a topological Haldane phase with Fermi-Hubbard ladders in an ultracold-atom quantum simulator. We directly reveal both edge and bulk properties of the system through the use of single-site and particle-resolved measurements, as well as non-local correlation functions. Continuously changing the Hubbard interaction strength of the system enables us to investigate the robustness of the phase to charge (density) fluctuations far from the regime of the Heisenberg model, using a novel correlator.

TI Quantum reference frame transformations as symmetries and the paradox of
   the third particle
SO QUANTUM
AB In a quantum world, reference frames are ultimately quantum systems too - but what does it t o mean to "jump into the perspective of a quantum particle"? In this work, we show that quantum reference frame (QRF) transformations appear naturally as symmetries of simple physical systerns. This allows us to rederive and generalize known QRF transformations within an alternative, operationally transparent framework, and to shed new light on their structure and interpretation. We give an explicit description of the observables that are measurable by agents constrained by such quantum symmetries, and apply our results to a puzzle known as the 'para-dox of the third particle'. We argue that it can be reduced to the question of how to relationally embed fewer into more particles, and give a thorough physical and algebraic analysis of this question. This leads us to a generalization of the partial trace ('relational trace') which arguably resolves the paradox, and it uncovers important structures of constraint quantization within a simple quantum information setting, such as relational observables which are key in this resolution. While we restrict our attention to finite Abelian groups for transparency and mathematical rigor, the intuitive physical appeal of our results makes us expect that they remain valid in more general situations.

TI Effect of inter-dot tunneling coupling on soliton dynamical behaviors in
   four-level triple quantum dot EIT medium
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB Soliton, which can travel over long distance without attenuation or shape change due to the balance of the interplay between dispersion (or diffraction) and nonlinearity in nonlinear medium, becomes a good information carrier in quantum information processing and transmission. Up to now, the study on the optical solitons mainly focuses on ultra-cold atomic electromagnetic induction transparency (EIT) medium. This is mainly because ultra-cold atomic system can generate strong nonlinear effect under low light excitation. However, for the practical application, it is a big challenge to control accurately the optical soliton dynamics in the atomic EIT medium due to its low temperature (which approaches to absolute zero) and rarefaction. Fortunately, with the maturity of semiconductor quantum production technology, quantum dots have extensive application prospect in quantum information processing and transmission. So, in the paper, we study the optical soliton dynamics in a four-level asymmetric array-type three-quantum-dot EIT medium.
   Based on the current experimental results, we first propose a four-level asymmetric array-type three-quantum-dot EIT model. Subsequently, by using amplitude variable approach combined with multi-scale method, we study analytically the propagation of a probe pulse in this system. It is shown that when one (the another) inter-dot tunneling coupling is turned on (off), only a single transparency window appears in the center range of the probe field detuning. Only if two inter-dot tunneling couplings are turned on will two transparent windows be distributed on both sides of the central region of the probe field detuning. And the width of the single transparent window or the widths of two transparent windows become wider with the strength of the inter-dot tunneling coupling increasing. For the nonlinear case, by choosing appropriate parameters in the area of the transparency window, the stable propagation of soliton can be realized. Interestingly, we find that the strength of the inter-dot tunneling coupling has an important effect on the soliton dynamic behaviors. In the case that one (the another) inter-dot tunneling coupling is turned on (off), with the increase of strength of the inter-dot tunneling coupling, the velocity of the soliton exhibits a trend of first increasing and then decreasing, and the amplitude of the soliton presents a increasing trend for ever. For the case that two inter-dot tunneling couplings are turned on, with the strength of the two inter-dot tunneling coupling increasing, the velocity of the soliton presents a decreasing trend for ever, while the amplitude of the soliton exhibits a trend of first decreasing and then increasing. Thus, the amplitude modulation effect of optical soliton can be realized in semiconductor quantum dot devices.

TI The Role of the Excluded
SO PHILOSOPHIES
AB We consider the peculiarity of unique events, such as those of a natural, evolutionary, and social nature. In particular, we consider unique social events that have had either the claim or the vocation of being salvific for humanity, such as the introduction over time of the Torah, Hinduism, Buddhism, Christianity, and Islam. We question how the claimed, general salvific vocation contrasts, or is inconsistent with, the non-retroactive temporality and locality of such events, which could not have happened otherwise. This undeclared and philosophically unsolved inconsistency then reappears in subsequent cultural contradictions and inadequacies, political and social allowances such as, for instance, homo-centrism and a pathological relation with Nature. In the case of Christianity, this inconsistency is represented by the painting reproduced in the article, a work in which the excluded humans and other living beings are represented as astonished by the occurrence in this moment, and in such an unnatural context. Furthermore, we consider the original understanding as related to concepts of classical physics, or of such concepts naively adopted within the texts considered sacred. However, in some religions, such as Christianity, the inconsistency is theologically solved. We stress the need to update the ancient original elementary, naive, pre-classic philosophical and conceptual frameworks used so that these alleged inconsistencies and contradictions may be not only theologically solved, but also conceptually solved in more complex understandings of the world, for example, considering relativistic time, long-range interdependence, quantum entanglement, and theories of the universe. Without this update, the unique saving events can affect only religiously, that is, optionally, on the scientific and philosophical conceptions used. Without this adjustment, homo-centrist illusion and egoism prevail as the natural, linear consequential attitude without raising these questions. It rather assumes that the intervention is for involved human beings, and moreover for those who have had and are lucky enough to receive and practice it, ignoring the enormous inconsistency within the message itself, and its presumed general and available salvific nature. This requires theological, philosophical, and scientific interdisciplinarity. The theme concerns inconsistencies within and superficiality of the narratives and their treatment of the unique, salvific events, without any reference to possible general and retroactive effects of how these events are represented in the painting. We conclude that the subject should be debated by taking into account contemporary understandings, such as relativistic space and time, quantum physics, and of the universe, with new philosophical and anthropological approaches. This should be a matter of responsible philosophical and theological interdisciplinary debate involving science, suitable to establish new understandings.

AB Private Information Retrieval (PIR) allows a user to privately retrieve any item from a database such that the server(s) holding the database cannot learn any information about the user's choice. Most existing PIR protocols focus on minimizing the communication cost for retrieving one bit from the database, in an honest-but-curious server model. Dishonest servers were studied in an ad-hoc fashion including the robust PIR and verifiable PIR for cheater identification, where the former further guarantees error correction but only works when the number of dishonest servers are bounded and the latter works for any number of dishonest servers but has to rely on the intractability assumption of certain computational hard problems and a tag published by the honest data owner. We initiate a systematic study of the fundamental problem of cheating detection for PIR (cd-PIR). We first show a theoretic result that rules out the possibility of information-theoretically secure cd-PIR against arbitrary number of cheaters (even allowing the data owner to publish a tag and lifting cheater identification), which justifies our study of computational cd-PIR. On the positive side, we show that computational cd-PIR against arbitrary number of cheaters can be achieved much more efficiently than all previous constructions and with weaker cryptography hardness assumptions. In particular, we obtain efficient cheating detection for PIR with more than one server that resists quantum algorithm for the first time.

TI Orienteering with One Endomorphism
SO MATEMATICA
AB In supersingular isogeny-based cryptography, the path-finding problem reduces to the endomorphism ring problem. Can path-finding be reduced to knowing just one endomorphism? It is known that a small degree endomorphism enables polynomial-time path-finding and endomorphism ring computation (in: Love and Boneh, ANTS XIV-Proceedings of the Fourteenth Algorithmic Number Theory Symposium, volume 4 of Open Book Ser. Math. Sci. Publ., Berkeley, 2020). An endomorphism gives an explicit orientation of a supersingular elliptic curve. In this paper, we use the volcano structure of the oriented supersingular isogeny graph to take ascending/descending/horizontal steps on the graph and deduce path-finding algorithms to an initial curve. Each altitude of the volcano corresponds to a unique quadratic order, called the primitive order. We introduce a new hard problem of computing the primitive order given an arbitrary endomorphism on the curve, and we also provide a sub-exponential quantum algorithm for solving it. In concurrent work (in: Wesolowski, Advances in cryptology-EUROCRYPT 2022, volume 13277 of Lecture Notes in Computer Science. Springer, Cham, 2022), it was shown that the endomorphism ring problem in the presence of one endomorphism with known primitive order reduces to a vectorization problem, implying path-finding algorithms. Our path-finding algorithms are more general in the sense that we don't assume the knowledge of the primitive order associated with the endomorphism.

TI Molecularly-anchored single PbS quantum dots as resonant tunnelling
   transistors
SO NANOSCALE
AB The growing need for high-performance computing continues to drive improvement in circuit and device technologies, particularly with respect to speed and power efficiency. Device scaling remains the most effective strategy for meeting circuit performance requirements while reducing power consumption. Thanks to their solution processability, colloidal semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) are highly suitable for device miniaturisation as quantum information science platforms. Quantum mechanical effects must be carefully considered when designing nanometre-scale electronic devices (i.e., transistors) that incorporate a single QD. Here, we demonstrate a resonant tunnelling transistor (RTT) based on a single lead sulfide (PbS) QD anchored by a bidentate ligand molecule attached to heteroepitaxial spherical Au/Pt nanogap electrodes. Five negative differential resistances (NDRs) were observed at both positive and negative drain voltages in output characteristics, which could be attributed to the formation of a double-barrier "quantum well" structure with the strong Fermi level pinning of the discrete energy level of the QD to one electrode. Furthermore, these NDRs could be tuned by applying a gate electric field, which will become one of the keys for enabling quantum and neuromorphic electronics. This demonstration of single PbS-QD-based RTTs paves the way for sub-10 nm solution-processable quantum electronic devices.

TI Texture-Induced Strain in a WS2 Single Layer to Monitor
   Spin-Valley Polarization
SO NANOMATERIALS
AB Nanoscale-engineered surfaces induce regulated strain in atomic layers of 2D materials that could be useful for unprecedented photonics applications and for storing and processing quantum information. Nevertheless, these strained structures need to be investigated extensively. Here, we present texture-induced strain distribution in single-layer WS2 (1L-WS2) transferred over Si/SiO2 (285 nm) substrate. The detailed nanoscale landscapes and their optical detection are carried out through Atomic Force Microscopy, Scanning Electron Microscopy, and optical spectroscopy. Remarkable differences have been observed in the WS2 sheet localized in the confined well and at the periphery of the cylindrical geometry of the capped engineered surface. Raman spectroscopy independently maps the whole landscape of the samples, and temperature-dependent helicity-resolved photoluminescence (PL) experiments (off-resonance excitation) show that suspended areas sustain circular polarization from 150 K up to 300 K, in contrast to supported (on un-patterned area of Si/SiO2) and strained 1L-WS2. Our study highlights the impact of the dielectric environment on the optical properties of two-dimensional (2D) materials, providing valuable insights into the selection of appropriate substrates for implementing atomically thin materials in advanced optoelectronic devices.

TI Complete genuine multipartite entanglement monotone
SO RESULTS IN PHYSICS
AB A complete characterization and quantification of entanglement, particularly the multipartite entanglement, remains an unfinished long-term goal in quantum information theory. As long as the multipartite system is concerned, the relation between the entanglement contained in different partitions or different subsystems need to take into account. The complete multipartite entanglement measure and the complete monogamy relation is a framework that just deals with such a issue. In this paper, we put forward conditions to justify whether the multipartite entanglement monotone (MEM) and genuine multipartite entanglement monotone (GMEM) are complete, completely monogamous, and tightly complete monogamous according to the feature of the reduced function. Especially, with the assumption that the maximal reduced function is nonincreasing on average under LOCC, we proposed a class of complete MEMs and a class of complete GMEMs via the maximal reduced function for the first time. By comparison, it is shown that, for the tripartite case, this class of GMEMs is better than the one defined from the minimal bipartite entanglement in literature under the framework of complete MEM and complete monogamy relation. In addition, the relation between monogamy, complete monogamy, and the tightly complete monogamy are revealed in light of different kinds of MEMs and GMEMs.

TI Reversible fast to slow-light transition originating in the optical
   analog of EIA-EIT transformation in optical resonators
SO OSA CONTINUUM
AB Coupled-resonator-induced transparency (CRIT) and coupled-resonator-induced absorption (CRIA) are the all-optical analogs of electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) and electromagnetically induced absorption (EIA), and enable an optical pulse to propagate subluminally and superluminally in integrated photonic systems, respectively. Here, we describe the results of a theoretical study, which reveals a reversible CRIA-CRIT transition using coupled optical ring resonators. Analogous to the dispersion reversal occurring in the EIA-EIT transition, the dispersion also reverses during the CRIA-CRIT transition. Besides the EIA-EIT crossover analogy, we describe additional analogs of the coherent atomic phenomena arising in the CRIA-CRIT transition. We also discuss the specific conditions that lead to strongly enhanced dispersion. Furthermore, in contrast to the previous studies on coupled resonators, we reveal acquiring a critically and undercoupled slow-light CRIT from an overcoupled fast-light CRIA. Our experimentally viable study provides a route for the dynamic control and reversal of dispersion, which, among other, is important for quantum information technology, the Fresnel light dragging effect, temporal cloaking, and enhanced performance of the optical devices.

TI Equilibration of the planar modes of ultracold two-dimensional ion
   crystals in a Penning trap
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Planar thermal equilibration is studied using direct numerical simulations of ultracold two-dimensional ion crystals in a Penning trap with a rotating wall. The large magnetic field of the trap splits the modes that describe in-plane motion of the ions into two branches: high-frequency cyclotron modes dominated by kinetic energy and low-frequency E x B modes dominated by potential energy associated with thermal position displacements. Using an eigenmode analysis we extract the equilibration rate between these two branches as a function of the ratio of the frequencies that characterize the two branches and observe this equilibration rate to be exponentially suppressed as the ratio increases. Under experimental conditions relevant for current work at NIST, the predicted equilibration time is orders of magnitude longer than any relevant experimental timescales. We also study the coupling rate dependence on the initial energy of the planar modes and the number of ions. In addition, we show how increasing the rotating wall strength improves crystal stability. These details of in-plane mode dynamics help set the stage for developing strategies to efficiently cool the in-plane modes and improve the performance of single plane ion crystals for quantum information processing.

TI Controllable quantum point junction on the surface of an
   antiferromagnetic topological insulator
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Engineering and manipulation of unidirectional channels has been achieved in quantum Hall systems, leading to the construction of electron interferometers and proposals for low-power electronics and quantum information science applications. However, to fully control the mixing and interference of edge-state wave functions, one needs stable and tunable junctions. Encouraged by recent material candidates, here we propose to achieve this using an antiferromagnetic topological insulator that supports two distinct types of gapless unidirectional channels, one from antiferromagnetic domain walls and the other from single-height steps. Their distinct geometric nature allows them to intersect robustly to form quantum point junctions, which then enables their control by magnetic and electrostatic local probes. We show how the existence of stable and tunable junctions, the intrinsic magnetism and the potential for higher-temperature performance make antiferromagnetic topological insulators a promising platform for electron quantum optics and microelectronic applications. Recent advances in the identification and growth of antiferromagnetic topological insulators open the way to the manipulation of the chiral edge states that are topologically required at their step edges and domain walls. Here, the authors propose a quantum point junction formed by two types of edge states and discuss its applications in electron quantum optics.

TI The Mechanics Underpinning Non-Deterministic Computation in Cortical
   Neural Networks
SO APPLIEDMATH
AB Cortical neurons integrate upstream signals and random electrical noise to gate signaling outcomes, leading to statistically random patterns of activity. Yet classically, the neuron is modeled as a binary computational unit, encoding Shannon entropy. Here, the neuronal membrane potential is modeled as a function of inherently probabilistic ion behavior. In this new model, each neuron computes the probability of transitioning from an off-state to an on-state, thereby encoding von Neumann entropy. Component pure states are integrated into a physical quantity of information, and the derivative of this high-dimensional probability distribution yields eigenvalues across the multi-scale quantum system. In accordance with the Hellman-Feynman theorem, the resolution of the system state is paired with a spontaneous shift in charge distribution, so this defined system state instantly becomes the past as a new probability distribution emerges. This mechanistic model produces testable predictions regarding the wavelength of free energy released upon information compression and the temporal relationship of these events to physiological outcomes. Overall, this model demonstrates how cortical neurons might achieve non-deterministic signaling outcomes through a computational process of noisy coincidence detection.

TI Quantum realism: Axiomatization and quantification
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB The emergence of an objective reality in line with the laws of the microscopic world has been the focus of longstanding debates. Recent approaches seem to have reached a consensus at least with respect to one aspect, namely, that the encoding of information about a given observable in a physical degree freedom is a necessary condition for such an observable to become an element of the physical reality. Taking this as a fundamental premise and inspired by quantum information theory, here we build an axiomatization for quantum realism-a notion of realism compatible with quantum theory. Our strategy consists of listing some physically motivated principles able to characterize quantum realism in a "metric" independent manner. We introduce some criteria defining monotones and measures of realism and then search for potential candidates within some celebrated information theories-those induced by the von Neumann, Renyi, and Tsallis entropies. We explicitly construct some classes of entropic quantifiers, among which some are shown to satisfy all the proposed axioms and hence can be taken as faithful estimates for the degree of reality (or definiteness) of a given physical observable. Hopefully, our framework may offer a formal ground for further discussions on foundational aspects of quantum mechanics.

TI Magnetization dynamics in the YIG/Au/YIG magnon valve
SO APL MATERIALS
AB The magnetization dynamics of an yttrium iron garnet (YIG)/Au/YIG magnon valve was investigated using broadband ferromagnetic resonance. The material characterizations of YIG/Au/YIG were performed using cross-sectional scanning transmission electron microscopy, x-ray diffraction spectroscopy, x-ray photoemission spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, and UV-visible spectroscopy. Asymmetric Fano resonance in the YIG/Au (60 nm)/YIG magnon valve structure was observed experimentally, and the two coupled oscillators model was used to describe the source of the Fano resonance qualitatively. We also provide a quantitative description of the Fano resonance and extract the Fano factor, which is an important feature that can be used to define the interaction sign. This represents the first attempt to apply the Fano resonance to magnetization dynamics. The spin wave resonance modes excited by the Au nanoparticles (NPs) surface plasmons were also observed in a YIG/Au NPs/YIG structure. Our findings confirm the occurrence of magnetic Fano resonance in the YIG/Au/YIG magnon valve and pave the way toward the development of quantum information devices based on magnon valves.

TI High-Bandwidth Intensity-Difference Squeezed State at 895 nm Based on
   Four-Wave Mixing
SO PHOTONICS
AB As an essential quantum resource, the intensity-difference squeezed state based on four-wave mixing (FWM) in atomic vapor is widely applied in quantum information processing. In particular, a high intensity-difference squeezing bandwidth is vital for the realization of high-speed information processing. However, limited by the bandwidth of photodetectors, broadband intensity-difference squeezed state based on this system has not yet been reported. Here, we developed a transimpedance broadband balanced homodyne detector at 895 nm, achieving a bandwidth greater than 100 MHz and a maximum signal-to-noise ratio of 15 dB with 4 mW optical power. Utilizing this detector in a nondegenerate FWM process based on cesium vapor, we experimentally achieved broadband intensity-difference squeezing with a bandwidth of 100 MHz, which yielded a maximum squeezing of -7.17 +/- 0.8 dB between 20 and 40 MHz. Meanwhile, using this detector, we experimentally investigated the cavity-enhanced FWM process, achieving a squeezing level of -6.07 +/- 0.5 dB within a 4 MHz frequency range, which is limited by the cavity bandwidth. This work provides a reliable detection tool and experimental foundation for the research and application of broadband squeezed light sources based on FWM.

TI Spatially dependent f-π exchange interaction within a
   single-molecule magnet TbPc2
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Electrically probing the spin state of localized f electrons in a rare-earth-based single-molecule magnet, along with understanding its intramolecular magnetic coupling, is of crucial importance for applications in quantum information and advanced spintronics, yet it remains experimentally challenging. Herein, within a single-molecule magnet terbium(III) bis(phthalocyaninato) (TbPc2) double-decker molecule adsorbed on a bilayer graphene epitaxially grown on a SiC(0001) substrate, we experimentally demonstrate a spatially dependent exchange interaction between the magnetic moment of the localized Tb 4f electron and the unpaired spin of the Pc pi-radical. The magnetic state of TbPc2, associated with the f-pi interaction, is evidently detected through the spectroscopic Kondo resonance and a zero-field Kondo splitting, which can be reversibly switched in a charge/discharge process triggered by the tip-molecule distance. Furthermore, we theoretically describe how the Kondo resonance evolves at the molecular scale, which is mediated by the f-pi exchange interaction with its strength varying spatially in a radial decay fashion. Our spatially resolved Kondo characteristics offer a quantitative understanding of the many-body spin correlation, which is coupled with the charge states in a nonuniform and spatially extended system.

TI Environment-induced information scrambling transition with charge
   conservations
SO AAPPS BULLETIN
AB In generic closed quantum systems, the complexity of operators increases under time evolution governed by the Heisenberg equation, reflecting the scrambling of local quantum information. However, when systems interact with an external environment, the system-environment coupling allows operators to escape from the system, inducing a dynamical transition between the scrambling phase and the dissipative phase. This transition is known as the environment-induced information scrambling transition, originally proposed in Majorana fermion systems. In this work, we advance this discovery by investigating the transition in charge-conserved systems with space-time randomness. We construct solvable Brownian Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev models of complex fermions coupled to an environment, enabling the analytical computation of operator growth. We determine the critical dissipation strength, which is proportional to n(1-n)\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$n(1-n)$$\end{document} with n being the density of the complex fermions, arising from the suppression in the quantum Lyapunova exponent due to the Pauli blockade in the scattering process. We further analyze the density dependence of maximally scrambled operators at late time. Our results shed light on the intriguing interplay between information scrambling, dissipation, and conservation laws.

TI Room temperature valley polarization via spin selective charge transfer
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB The two degenerate valleys in transition metal dichalcogenides can be used to store and process information for quantum information science and technology. A major challenge is maintaining valley polarization at room temperature where phonon-induced intervalley scattering is prominent. Here we demonstrate room temperature valley polarization in heterostructures of monolayer MoS2 and naphthylethylammine based one-dimensional chiral lead halide perovskite. By optically exciting the heterostructures with linearly polarized light close to resonance and measuring the helicity resolved photoluminescence, we obtain a degree of polarization of up to -7% and 8% in MoS2/right-handed (R-(+)-) and left-handed (S-(-)-) 1-(1-naphthyl)ethylammonium lead iodide perovskite, respectively. We attribute this to spin selective charge transfer from MoS2 to the chiral perovskites, where the perovskites act as a spin filter due to their chiral nature. Our study provides a simple, yet robust route to obtain room temperature valley polarization, paving the way for practical valleytronics devices.
   Valleytronics is a portmanteau of 'valley' and 'electronics' and refers to the use of the valley degree of freedom, present in some materials, for encoding and processing information. Here, Shrestha et al demonstrate a room temperature valley polarization in heterostructures composed of molybdenum disulfide and a chiral lead halide perovskite, an important step in development of valleytronics.

TI Quantum scale estimation
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Quantum scale estimation, as introduced and explored here, establishes the most precise framework for the estimation of scale parameters that is allowed by the laws of quantum mechanics. This addresses an important gap in quantum metrology, since current practice focuses almost exclusively on the estimation of phase and location parameters. For given prior probability and quantum state, and using Bayesian principles, a rule to construct the optimal probability-operator measurement is provided. Furthermore, the corresponding minimum mean logarithmic error is identified. This is then generalised as to accommodate the simultaneous estimation of multiple scale parameters, and a procedure to classify practical measurements into optimal, almost-optimal or sub-optimal is highlighted. As a means of illustration, the new framework is exploited to generalise scale-invariant global thermometry, as well as to address the estimation of the lifetime of an atomic state. On a more conceptual note, the optimal strategy is employed to construct an observable for scale parameters, an approach which may serve as a template for a more systematic search of quantum observables. Quantum scale estimation thus opens a new line of enquire-the precise measurement of scale parameters such as temperatures and rates-within the quantum information sciences.

TI Transfer of Orbital Angular Momentum of Light Using Autler-Townes
   Splitting
SO PHOTONICS
AB We propose a scheme to exchange optical vortices beyond electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) but based on four-wave mixing (FWM) in a five-level atomic system consisting of two lambda subsystems linked via a weak driving field. When the laser fields are strong enough, the quantum interference responsible for the EIT in each lambda subsystem is washed out, giving rise to the Autler-Townes splitting (ATS). When only one of the control fields carries an optical vortex, it is shown that the generated FWM field obtains the vorticity of the vortex control. We distinguish between three different regimes, i.e., a pure EIT, a joint EIT-ATS, and a dual-ATS, where the optical angular momentum (OAM) translation can take place. Elaborating on the distinction between three regimes through numerical analysis, we find that the maximum energy conversion efficiency is obtained in the joint EIT-ATS and dual-ATS regimes. The latter is more favorable as the absorption losses vanish as the beam propagates into the atomic cloud. The results may find applications in the implementation of high-efficient frequency and OAM conversion devices for quantum information processing.

TI Verification of Information Thermodynamics in a Trapped Ion System
SO ENTROPY
AB Information thermodynamics has developed rapidly over past years, and the trapped ions, as a controllable quantum system, have demonstrated feasibility to experimentally verify the theoretical predictions in the information thermodynamics. Here, we address some representative theories of information thermodynamics, such as the quantum Landauer principle, information equality based on the two-point measurement, information-theoretical bound of irreversibility, and speed limit restrained by the entropy production of system, and review their experimental demonstration in the trapped ion system. In these schemes, the typical physical processes, such as the entropy flow, energy transfer, and information flow, build the connection between thermodynamic processes and information variation. We then elucidate the concrete quantum control strategies to simulate these processes by using quantum operators and the decay paths in the trapped-ion system. Based on them, some significantly dynamical processes in the trapped ion system to realize the newly proposed information-thermodynamic models is reviewed. Although only some latest experimental results of information thermodynamics with a single trapped-ion quantum system are reviewed here, we expect to find more exploration in the future with more ions involved in the experimental systems.

TI Quantum-enhanced detection of viral cDNA via luminescence resonance
   energy transfer using upconversion and gold nanoparticles
SO NANOPHOTONICS
AB The COVID-19 pandemic has profoundly impacted global economies and healthcare systems, revealing critical vulnerabilities in both. In response, our study introduces a sensitive and highly specific detection method for cDNA, leveraging Luminescence Resonance Energy Transfer (LRET) between upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) and gold nanoparticles (AuNPs), and achieves a detection limit of 242 fM for SARS-CoV-2 cDNA. This innovative sensing platform utilizes UCNPs conjugated with one primer and AuNPs with another, targeting the 5 ' and 3 ' ends of the SARS-CoV-2 cDNA, respectively, enabling precise differentiation of mismatched cDNA sequences and significantly improving detection specificity. Through rigorous experimental analysis, we established a quenching efficiency range from 10.4 % to 73.6 %, with an optimal midpoint of 42 %, thereby demonstrating the superior sensitivity of our method. Our work uses SARS-CoV-2 cDNA as a model system to demonstrate the potential of our LRET-based detection method. This proof-of-concept study highlights the adaptability of our platform for future diagnostic applications. Instrumental validation confirms the synthesis and formation of AuNPs, addressing the need for experimental verification of the preparation of nanomaterial. Our comparative analysis with existing SARS-CoV-2 detection methods revealed that our approach provides a low detection limit and high specificity for target cDNA sequences, underscoring its potential for targeted COVID-19 diagnostics. This study demonstrates the superior sensitivity and adaptability of using UCNPs and AuNPs for cDNA detection, offering significant advances in rapid, accessible diagnostic technologies.

TI The wave function of stabilizer states and the Wehrl conjecture
SO JOURNAL DE MATHEMATIQUES PURES ET APPLIQUEES
AB We focus on quantum systems represented by a Hilbert space L2(A), where A is a locally compact Abelian group that contains a compact open subgroup. We examine two interconnected issues related to Weyl-Heisenb erg operators. First, we provide a complete and elegant solution to the problem of describing the stabilizer states in terms of their wave functions - an issue that arises in quantum information theory. Subsequently, we demonstrate that the stabilizer states are exactly the minimizers of the Wehrl entropy, thereby solving the Wehrl-type entropy conjecture for any such group (in particular, for finite-dimensional vector spaces over non-Archimedean local fields). Additionally, we construct a moduli space for the set of stabilizer states, that is, a parametrization of this set, that endows it with a natural algebraic structure, and we derive a formula for the number of stabilizer states when A is finite. Indeed, these results are novel even for finite Abelian groups. (c) 2025 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Masson SAS.

TI Directional dipole dice enabled by anisotropic chirality
SO PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF
   AMERICA
AB Directional radiation and scattering play an essential role in light manipulation for various applications in integrated nanophotonics, antenna and metasurface designs, quantum optics, etc. The most elemental system with this property is the class of directional dipoles, including the circular dipole, Huygens dipole, and Janus dipole. A unified realization of all three dipole types and a mechanism to freely switch among them are previously unreported, yet highly desirable for developing compact and multifunctional directional sources. Here, we theoretically and experimentally demonstrate that the synergy of chirality and anisotropy can give rise to all three directional dipoles in one structure at the same frequency under linearly polarized plane wave excitations. This mechanism enables a simple helix particle to serve as a directional dipole dice (DDD), achieving selective manipulation of optical directionality via different "faces" of the particle. We employ three "faces" of the DDD to realize face-multiplexed routing of guided waves in three orthogonal directions with the directionality determined by spin, power flow, and reactive power, respectively. This construction of the complete directionality space can enable high-dimensional control of both near-field and far-field directionality with broad applications in photonic integrated circuits, quantum information processing, and subwavelength-resolution imaging.

TI Coherence Between Different Propagating Surface Plasmon Polariton Modes
   Excited by Quantum Mechanical Tunnel Junctions
SO ADVANCED OPTICAL MATERIALS
AB Coherence between different surface plasmon polariton (SPP) modes excited by inelastically tunneling electrons in biased metal-insulator-metal tunnel junctions (MIM-TJs) is demonstrated. By employing a dedicated SPP stripe waveguide with MIM-TJ, an effective double-slit configuration similar to the Young's experiment is realized for an electrically biased SPP source. The spatial correlation between different SPP modes originates from a single inelastic tunneling event and leads to strong interference in the far-field, observed as alternate bright and dark fringes in the Fourier plane. The measured fringe-spacing inversely follows the stripe waveguide length, with upper limit dictated by the SPP propagation length, confirming the SPP mediated spatial correlation. Finite difference time domain simulations support the experimental findings. Also, the experimental and simulation results unambiguously demonstrate the two-step plasmonic decay process in plasmonic MIM-TJs. The results presented here provide a simple and robust demonstration of the inherent coherence existing between different decay channels (plasmons and photons) of the inelastically tunneling electrons and can be exploited for plasmonic applications with tailored spatial coherence with implications in plasmon amplification and quantum information processing.

TI Observers of quantum systems cannot agree to disagree
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Is the world quantum? An active research line in quantum foundations is devoted to exploring what constraints can rule out the postquantum theories that are consistent with experimentally observed results. We explore this question in the context of epistemics, and ask whether agreement between observers can serve as a physical principle that must hold for any theory of the world. Aumann's seminal Agreement Theorem states that two observers (of classical systems) cannot agree to disagree. We propose an extension of this theorem to no-signaling settings. In particular, we establish an Agreement Theorem for observers of quantum systems, while we construct examples of (postquantum) no-signaling boxes where observers can agree to disagree. The PR box is an extremal instance of this phenomenon. These results make it plausible that agreement between observers might be a physical principle, while they also establish links between the fields of epistemics and quantum information that seem worthy of further exploration.
   Aumann's agreement theorem states that observers of classical systems can't "agree to disagree." Here, the authors show that the same epistemic consistency holds for observers of quantum states, but not for observers of post-quantum no-signalling boxes, hinting at its potential status as a physical principle.

TI Optical activation and detection of charge transport between individual
   colour centres in diamond
SO NATURE ELECTRONICS
AB Confocal fluorescence microscopy and magnetic resonance can be used to induce and probe charge transport between individual nitrogen-vacancy centres in diamond.
   Understanding the capture of charge carriers by colour centres in semiconductors is important for the development of novel forms of sensing and quantum information processing, but experiments typically involve ensemble measurements, often impacted by defect proximity. Here we show that confocal fluorescence microscopy and magnetic resonance can be used to induce and probe charge transport between individual nitrogen-vacancy centres in diamond at room temperature. In our experiments, a 'source' nitrogen vacancy undergoes optically driven cycles of ionization and recombination to produce a stream of photogenerated carriers, one of which is subsequently captured by a 'target' nitrogen vacancy several micrometres away. We use a spin-to-charge conversion scheme to encode the spin state of the source colour centre into the charge state of the target, which allows us to set an upper bound to carrier injection from other background defects. We attribute our observations to the action of unscreened Coulomb potentials producing giant carrier capture cross-sections, orders of magnitude greater than those measured in ensembles.

TI Strong coupling between excitons and magnetic dipole quasi-bound states
   in the continuum in WS2-TiO2 hybrid metasurfaces
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Enhancing the light-matter interactions in two-dimensional materials via optical metasurfaces has attracted much attention due to its potential to enable breakthrough in advanced compact photonic and quantum information devices. Here, we theoretically investigate a strong coupling between excitons in monolayer WS2 and quasi-bound states in the continuum (quasi-BIC). In the hybrid structure composed of WS2 coupled with asymmetric titanium dioxide nanobars, a remarkable spectral splitting and typical anticrossing behavior of the Rabi splitting can be observed, and such strong coupling effect can be modulated by shaping the thickness and asymmetry parameter of the proposed metasurfaces, and the angle of incident light. It is found that the balance of line width of the quasi-BIC mode and local electric field enhancement should be considered since both of them affect the strong coupling, which is crucial to the design and optimization of metasurface devices. This work provides a promising way for controlling the light-matter interactions in strong coupling regime and opens the door for the future novel quantum, low-energy, distinctive nanodevices by advanced meta-optical engineering.

TI Exciton-acoustic phonon coupling revealed by resonant excitation of
   single perovskite nanocrystals
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Single perovskite nanocrystals have attracted great research attention very recently due to their potential quantum-information applications, which critically depend on the development of powerful optical techniques to resolve delicate exciton photophysics. Here we have realized resonant and near-resonant excitations of single perovskite CsPbI3 nanocrystals, with the scattered laser light contributing to only similar to 10% of the total collected signals. This allows us to estimate an ultranarrow photoluminescence excitation linewidth of similar to 11.32 mu eV for the emission state of a single CsPbI3 nanocrystal, corresponding to an exciton dephasing time of similar to 116.29ps. Meanwhile, size-quantized acoustic phonons can be resolved from a single CsPbI3 nanocrystal, whose coupling with the exciton is proposed to arise from the piezoelectric potential. The ability to collect resonance fluorescence from single CsPbI3 nanocrystals, with the subsequent revelation of exciton-acoustic phonon coupling, has marked a critical step towards their steady advancement into superior quantum-light sources. In order to develop perovskite nanocrystals as a single-photon source, there is a need to understand the complex exciton photo-physics. Here, the authors employ resonant and near-resonant excitation technique to study single CsPbI3 nanocrystal that allows them to probe the continuous and size-quantised acoustic-phonon modes.

TI Generation of Massively Entangled Bright States of Light during Harmonic
   Generation in Resonant Media
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW X
AB At the fundamental level, full description of light-matter interaction requires quantum treatment of both matter and light. However, for standard light sources generating intense laser pulses carrying quadrillions of photons in a coherent state, the classical description of light during intense laser-matter interaction has been expected to be adequate. Here, we show how nonlinear optical response of matter can be controlled to generate dramatic deviations from this standard picture, including generation of several squeezed and entangled harmonics of the incident laser light. In particular, such nontrivial quantum states of harmonics are generated as soon as one of the harmonics induces a transition between different laser-dressed states of the material system. Such transitions generate an entangled light-matter wave function, which can generate quantum states of harmonics even in the absence of a quantum driving field or material correlations. In turn, entanglement of the material system with a single harmonic generates and controls entanglement between different harmonics. Hence, nonlinear media that are near resonant with at least one of the harmonics appear to be quite attractive for controlled generation of massively entangled quantum states of light. Our analysis opens remarkable opportunities at the interface of attosecond physics and quantum optics, with implications for quantum information science.

TI Quantum Collapse and Computation in an Everett Multiverse
SO ENTROPY
AB The mathematical representation of the universe consists of sequences of symbols, rules and operators containing G & ouml;del's undecidable propositions: information and its manipulation, also with Turing Machines. Classical information theory and mathematics, ideally independent from the medium used, can be interpreted realistically and objectively from their correspondence with quantum information, which is physical. Each representation of the universe and its evolution are, in any case, physical subsets of the universe, structured sets of observers and their complements in the universe made with spacetime events generated by local quantum measurements. Their description becomes a semantically closed structure without a global object-environment loss of decoherence as a von Neumann's universal constructor with a semantical abstract whose structure cannot be decided deterministically a priori from an internal observer. In a semantically closed structure, the realization of a specific event that writes the semantical abstract of the constructor is a problem of finding "which way" for the evolution of the universe as a choice of the constructor's state in a metastructure, like the many-world Everett scenario, from a specific result of any quantum measurement, corresponding to a G & ouml;del undecidable proposition for an internal observer.

TI Design of GaAs microcavity on SiN waveguide for efficient single-photon
   generation by resonant excitation
SO MATERIALS FOR QUANTUM TECHNOLOGY
AB Silicon nitride (SiN) photonic circuits are attracting significant interest as a platform for photonic quantum information processing. Integration of deterministic single photon sources (SPSs) is required for large-scale single-photon-based quantum applications. InAs/GaAs quantum dots (QDs) have been demonstrated to be state-of-the-art deterministic SPSs under resonant excitation. However, InAs/GaAs QD SPSs integrated on chip often suffer from unwanted crosstalk from scattering of resonant excitation laser. Moreover, the mismatch in refractive indices of SiN and GaAs impedes efficient coupling of single photons into the photonic circuit. In this work, we design a GaAs photonic crystal (PhC) nanobeam cavity with an embedded QD on top of a SiN waveguide in SiO2 that can suppress crosstalk from resonant excitation and realize high coupling efficiency at the same time. The crosstalk is reduced by employing a carefully designed nanobeam cavity that removes complex structures around the excitation spot. The high coupling efficiency is achieved with a weak hybridized mirror formed by proximity of GaAs PhC nanobeam and SiN waveguide that makes the cavity and helps transferring photons into the waveguide. This enables more than 90% coupling efficiency. The designed device is expected to be a bright source of indistinguishable photons.

TI Self-routing dual color nanosource based on the co-excitation via
   coupling between nano cavities
SO RESULTS IN PHYSICS
AB Optical nano sources play important roles in optical communications, photonic integrated circuits, and quantum information. However, integratable, multi-color and directionally controllable nanoscale optical sources remain a challenge. This work presents a design of a two-channel upconversion nanosource based on phase coupling between metal-dielectric-metal (MDM) cavities. The resonant cavities embedded with upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) couple with each other by phase modulation in the bus waveguide, which enables simultaneous excitation and fluorescence enhancement of the UCNPs in cavities. Benefiting from inherent ability of MDM structure, the emitted light can be manipulated directionally for subsequent multi-channel applications. In addition, the relevant optical properties can be accurately described by a theoretical model. The excitation field strength in cavities was found to be sensitive to the coupling phase, and the derived theoretical model can predict the optimal coupling distance for an efficient dual-channel upconversion nano-emitter. This nano-emitter combines the unique fluorescence advantages of UCNPs with the easy preparation of MDM nanocavities for easy integration and nanoscale optical control, promising major applications in photonic chips, optical sensors, and complex energy optoelectronic devices.

TI Entanglement in the quantum phases of an unfrustrated Rydberg atom array
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Recent experimental advances have stimulated interest in the use of large, two-dimensional arrays of Rydberg atoms as a platform for quantum information processing and to study exotic many-body quantum states. However, the native long-range interactions between the atoms complicate experimental analysis and precise theoretical understanding of these systems. Here we use new tensor network algorithms capable of including all long-range interactions to study the ground state phase diagram of Rydberg atoms in a geometrically unfrustrated square lattice array. We find a greatly altered phase diagram from earlier numerical and experimental studies, revealed by studying the phases on the bulk lattice and their analogs in experiment-sized finite arrays. We further describe a previously unknown region with a nematic phase stabilized by short-range entanglement and an order from disorder mechanism. Broadly our results yield a conceptual guide for future experiments, while our techniques provide a blueprint for converging numerical studies in other lattices.
   Rydberg atom arrays are a promising platform for simulating many-body systems. The authors introduce a tensor-network method to compute phase diagrams of infinite arrays with long-range interactions and experimental-scale finite arrays, unveiling a new entangled phase and offering a guide for experiments.

TI Manipulation of continuous variable orbital angular momentum squeezing
   and entanglement by pump shaping
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Spatially structured quantum states, such as orbital angular momentum (OAM) squeezing and entanglement, is currently a popular topic in quantum optics. The method of generating and manipulating spatial quantum states on demand needs to be explored. In this paper, we generated OAM mode squeezed states of -5.4 dB for the LG+10 mode and -5.3 dB for the LG-1 0 mode directly by an optical parametric oscillator (OPO) for the first time. Additionally, we demonstrated that the OAM mode squeezed and entangled states were respectively generated by manipulating the nonlinear process of the OPO by controlling the relative phase of two beams of different modes, thus making two different spatial multimode pump beams. We characterized the Laguer re-Gaussian (LG) entangled states by indirectly measuring the squeezing for the HG10(45 degrees) mode and HG10(135 degrees) mode, and directly measuring the entanglement between the LG+1 0 and LG-1 0 modes. The effective manipulation of the OAM quantum state provides a novel insight into the continuous variable quantum state generation and construction on demand for high-dimensional quantum information and quantum metrology.(c) 2023 Optica Publishing Group under the terms of the Optica Open Access Publishing Agreement

TI Conditions for experimental detection of one-way quantum steering in a
   three-mode optomechanical system
SO ALEXANDRIA ENGINEERING JOURNAL
AB Conditions for experimental detection of asymmetric one-way quantum steering in a three-mode optomechanical system are examined. We consider cases of collective steering in which two modes collectively interact with the third mode, and the case of separate modes steering in which two mutually independent modes interact with the third mode. We find that the occurrence of both collective and separate modes quantum steering results not from an asymmetry between thermal noise of the modes, as it has been realized in linear optics systems, but from an asymmetry between the damping rates of the modes. We show the requirement that the modes are damped with different rates to be the necessary and sufficient condition for collective steering. In the case of separate modes, we find that apart from unequal damping rates, an additional condition is required that the modes are coupled to the third mode with unequal strengths. Thus, the generation of quantum steering between separate modes is more restrictive to the parameters than the collective steering. Determination of conditions for experimental detection of one-way steering in multi-mode system could give a new stimulus to develop secure directional communication networks.

TI Nonclassical correlated optical multistability at low photon level for
   cavity electromagnetically induced transparency
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB We study the nonequilibrium dynamic behaviors in a driven-dissipative single-atom cavity electromagnetically induced transparency. The optical bistability and multistability beyond a Kerr nonlinearity are observed utilizing the optical Stark shift induced strong nonlinearity. We show that the nonequilibrium dynamical phase transition between bistability and multistability is highly tunable by the system parameters in a large parameter region. The first-order dissipative optical bistability (multistability) always corresponds to the photon-bunching quantum statistics, which indicates that the quantum fluctuations and correlations play important roles in nonequilibrium dynamics. Interestingly, bistability and multistability with photon-bunching quantum statistics occurring at extremely low steady-state cavity photon number are observed, even under a very strong cavity driven field. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the unique cavity steady-state solution of the full quantum calculation is excellently consistent with the lowest solution based on the semiclassical mean-field approach in bistability and multistability regimes when the cavity photon number is much less than unity, albeit these nonclassical quantum states should possess strong quantum fluctuations in this parameter regime. Our results pave the way to exploring nonclassical correlated optical multistability in quantum regime, which may bring exciting opportunities for potential applications from quantum information processing to quantum metrology.

TI Integrable spin chains and the Clifford group
SO JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL PHYSICS
AB We construct new families of spin chain Hamiltonians that are local, integrable, and translationally invariant. To do so, we make use of the Clifford group that arises in quantum information theory. We consider translation invariant Clifford group transformations that can be described by matrix product operators (MPOs). We classify translation invariant Clifford group transformations that consist of a shift operator and an MPO of bond dimension two-this includes transformations that preserve locality of all Hamiltonians and those that lead to non-local images of particular operators but, nevertheless, preserve locality of certain Hamiltonians. We characterize translation invariant Clifford group transformations that take single-site Pauli operators to local operators on at most five sites-examples of Quantum Cellular Automata-leading to a discrete family of Hamiltonians that are equivalent to the canonical XXZ model under such transformations. For spin chains solvable by the algebraic Bethe ansatz, we explain how conjugating by an MPO affects the underlying integrable structure. This allows us to relate our results to the usual classifications of integrable Hamiltonians. We also treat the case of spin chains solvable by free fermions. (c) 2022 Author(s).

TI Recent Progress in Chiral Topological Quantum Interface
SO FRONTIERS IN PHYSICS
AB Chiral quantum optics and Topological photonics are both emerging field of research, which have attracted great attention in recent years. Chiral quantum optics provides a new approach to achieve full quantum control of light-matter interaction in a novel manner, which has potential possibility for the implementation of complex quantum information networks. Meanwhile, topological photonics provides a novel route for designing and realizing optical device with unprecedented functionality, such as robust light propagation, the immunity to various structural imperfection, back-scattering suppression as well as unidirectional transmission. The application of topological photonics in chiral quantum optics will promote the whole performance of integrated quantum device with topological protection. In this review, we summarize the progress of chiral quantum optics and topological photonics firstly. Then, we mainly focus on the research of topological chiral edge states based on photonic quantum spin-Hall effect and photonic quantum valley-Hall effect. Furthermore, we introduce the recent work of chiral topological quantum interface formed by embedding quantum dot into the interface between two topologically distinct photonic crystal structures. At last, we give short outlook on the future development direction and prospect for application of topological chiral quantum interface.

TI Vortex Quantum Droplets under Competing Nonlinearities
SO CHINESE PHYSICS LETTERS
AB This concise review summarizes recent advancements in theoretical studies of vortex quantum droplets (VQDs) in matter-wave fields. These are robust self-trapped vortical states in two- and three-dimensional (2D and 3D) Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) with intrinsic nonlinearity. Stability of VQDs is provided by additional nonlinearities resulting from quantum fluctuations around mean-field states, often referred to as the Lee-Huang-Yang (LHY) corrections. The basic models are presented, with emphasis on the interplay between the mean-field nonlinearity, LHY correction, and spatial dimension, which determines the structure and stability of VQDs. We embark by delineating fundamental properties of VQDs in the 3D free space, followed by consideration of their counterparts in the 2D setting. Additionally, we address stabilization of matter-wave VQDs by optical potentials. Finally, we summarize results for the study of VQDs in the single-component BEC of atoms carrying magnetic moments. In that case, the anisotropy of the long-range dipole-dipole interactions endows the VQDs with unique characteristics. The results produced by the theoretical studies in this area directly propose experiments for the observation of novel physical effects in the realm of quantum matter, and suggest potential applications to the design of new schemes for processing classical and quantum information.

TI Characterizing quantum criticality in the transverse field Ising model
   with interaction
SO JOURNAL OF MAGNETISM AND MAGNETIC MATERIALS
AB The quantum criticality and entanglement properties are investigated in the one-dimensional spin-1/2 transverse field Ising model with staggered Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction by utilizing the infinite-time evolving block decimation method. In this model, the staggered Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction does not lead any new phase, while it only appears a phase transition line between Neel phase and paramagnetic phase. The behaviors of measurements of information illustrate the quantum phase transition and the existence of factorized points. The factorization phenomena is observed in the transverse Neel phase detecting by the entanglement quantities, in which the double degenerate ground state in transverse Neel phase is preserved by the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction also evidencing from the fidelity map. From the perspective of magnetism, the existence of chiral order and transverse Neel order suggests the helical magnetic structure induced by Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction. The critical exponents and central charge keep invariant and convinced that the phase transitions belong to the Ising universality class. In contrary to the systems confined within central charge c = 1, although the competition between the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction and external field changes the phase transition and entanglement properties, the quantum criticality seems independent of Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction.

TI Ultrafast Molecular Frame Quantum Tomography
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB We develop and experimentally demonstrate a methodology for a full molecular frame quantum tomography (MFQT) of dynamical polyatomic systems. We exemplify this approach through the complete characterization of an electronically nonadiabatic wave packet in ammonia (NH3). The method exploits both energy and time-domain spectroscopic data, and yields the lab frame density matrix (LFDM) for the system, the elements of which are populations and coherences. The LFDM fully characterizes electronic and nuclear dynamics in the molecular frame, yielding the time- and orientation-angle dependent expectation values of any relevant operator. For example, the time-dependent molecular frame electronic probability density may be constructed, yielding information on electronic dynamics in the molecular frame. In NH3, we observe that electronic coherences are induced by nuclear dynamics which nonadiabatically drive electronic motions (charge migration) in the molecular frame. Here, the nuclear dynamics are rotational and it is nonadiabatic Coriolis coupling which drives the coherences. Interestingly, the nuclear-driven electronic coherence is preserved over longer timescales. In general, MFQT can help quantify entanglement between electronic and nuclear degrees of freedom, and provide new routes to the study of ultrafast molecular dynamics, charge migration, quantum information processing, and optimal control schemes.

TI Strong coupling in plasmonic metal nanoparticles
SO NANO CONVERGENCE
AB The study of strong coupling between light and matter has gained significant attention in recent years due to its potential applications in diverse fields, including artificial light harvesting, ultraefficient polariton lasing, and quantum information processing. Plasmonic cavities are a compelling alternative of conventional photonic resonators, enabling ultracompact polaritonic systems to operate at room temperature. This review focuses on colloidal metal nanoparticles, highlighting their advantages as plasmonic cavities in terms of their facile synthesis, tunable plasmonic properties, and easy integration with excitonic materials. We explore recent examples of strong coupling in single nanoparticles, dimers, nanoparticle-on-a-mirror configurations, and other types of nanoparticle-based resonators. These systems are coupled with an array of excitonic materials, including atomic emitters, semiconductor quantum dots, two-dimensional materials, and perovskites. In the concluding section, we offer perspectives on the future of strong coupling research in nanoparticle systems, emphasizing the challenges and potentials that lie ahead. By offering a thorough understanding of the current state of research in this field, we aim to inspire further investigations and advances in the study of strongly coupled nanoparticle systems, ultimately unlocking new avenues in nanophotonic applications.

TI Discovery of Topological Magnetic Textures near Room Temperature in
   Quantum Magnet TbMn6Sn6
SO ADVANCED MATERIALS
AB The study of topology in quantum materials has fundamentally advanced the understanding in condensed matter physics and potential applications in next-generation quantum information technology. Recently, the discovery of a topological Chern phase in the spin-orbit-coupled Kagome lattice TbMn6Sn6 has attracted considerable interest. Whereas these phenomena highlight the contribution of momentum space Berry curvature and Chern gap on the electronic transport properties, less is known about the intrinsic real space magnetic texture, which is crucial for understanding the electronic properties and further exploring the unique quantum behavior. Here, the stabilization of topological magnetic skyrmions in TbMn6Sn6 using Lorentz transmission electron microscopy near room temperature, where the spins experience full spin reorientation transition between the a- and c-axes, is directly observed. An effective spin Hamiltonian based on the Ginzburg-Landau theory is constructed and micromagnetic simulation is performed to clarify the critical role of Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida interaction on the stabilization of skyrmion lattice. These results not only uncover nontrivial spin topological texture in TbMn6Sn6, but also provide a solid basis to study its interplay with electronic topology.

TI Multivalent optical cycling centers: towards control of polyatomics with
   multi-electron degrees of freedom
SO PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY CHEMICAL PHYSICS
AB Optical control of polyatomic molecules promises new opportunities in precision metrology and fundamental chemistry, as well as quantum information and many-body science. Contemporary experimental and theoretical efforts have mostly focused on cycling photons via excitation of a single electron localized to an alkaline earth (group 2)-like metal center. In this paper, we consider pathways towards optical cycling in polyatomic molecules with multi-electron degrees of freedom, which arise from two or more cycling electrons localized to p-block post-transition metal and metalloid (group 13, 14, and 15) centers. We characterize the electronic structure and rovibrational branching of several prototypical candidates using ab initio quantum chemical methods. Despite increased internal complexity and challenging design parameters, we find several molecules possessing quasi-closed photon cycling schemes with highly diagonal, visible and near-infrared transitions. Furthermore, we identify new heuristics for engineering optically controllable and laser-coolable polyatomic molecules with multi-electron cycling centers. Our results help elucidate the interplay between hybridization, repulsion, and ionicity in optically active species and provide new directions for using polyatomic molecules with complex electronic structure as a resource for quantum science and measurement.

TI In-plane resonant excitation of quantum dots in a dual-mode
   photonic-crystal waveguide with high β-factor
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB A high-quality quantum dot (QD) single-photon source is a key resource for quantum information processing. Exciting a QD emitter resonantly can greatly suppress decoherence processes and lead to highly indistinguishable single-photon generation. It has, however, remained a challenge to implement strict resonant excitation in a stable and scalable way, without compromising any of the key specs of the source (efficiency, purity, and indistinguishability). In this work, we propose a novel dual-mode photonic-crystal waveguide that realizes direct in-plane resonant excitation of the embedded QDs. The device relies on a two-mode waveguide design, which allows exploiting one mode for excitation of the QD and the other mode for collecting the emitted single photons with high efficiency. By proper engineering of the photonic bandstructure, we propose a design with single-photon collection efficiency of beta > 0.95 together with a single-photon impurity of epsilon < 5 x 10(-3) over a broad spectral and spatial range. The device has a compact footprint of similar to 50 mu m(2) and would enable stable and scalable excitation of multiple emitters for multi-photon quantum applications.

TI Photophysics of 2D Organic-Inorganic Hybrid Lead Halide Perovskites:
   Progress, Debates, and Challenges
SO ADVANCED SCIENCE
AB 2D organic-inorganic hybrid Ruddlesden-Popper perovskites (RPPs) have recently attracted increasing attention due to their excellent environmental stability, high degree of electronic tunability, and natural multiquantum-well structures. Although there is a rapid development of photoelectronic applications in solar cells, photodetectors, light emitting diodes (LEDs), and lasers based on 2D RPPs, the state-of-the-art performance is far inferior to that of the existing devices because of the limited understanding on fundamental physics, especially special photophysics in carrier dynamics, excitonic fine structures, excitonic quasiparticles, and spin-related effect. Thus, there is still plenty of room to improve the performances of photoelectronic devices based on 2D RPPs by enhancing knowledge on fundamental photophysics. This review highlights the special photophysics of 2D RPPs that is fundamentally different from the conventional 3D congeners. It also provides the most recent progress, debates, challenges, prospects, and in-depth understanding of photophysics in 2D perovskites, which is significant for not only boosting performance of solar cells, LEDs, photodetectors, but also future development of applications in lasers, spintronics, quantum information, and integrated photonic chips.

TI Harnessing Light for Valley Control in 2d Semiconductors
SO ADVANCED OPTICAL MATERIALS
AB The presence of two degenerate unconventional quantum states, known as valleys, in 2D materials is often regarded as analogous to binary operational units - representing 0 and 1. These valley states can also exist in superposition, effectively functioning as qubits. The unique properties of valleys make 2D materials a viable possibility for integration into devices designed for coherent encoding, processing, and reading of both classical and quantum information. To realize such applications, precise control over valley states is essential, enabling the implementation of valley-based devices for practical purposes. A novel approach was introduced to exercise necessary control in achieving valley polarization using a nonresonant single color linearly polarized laser pulse. By exploiting the asymmetric waveform of the linear pulse with skewed polarization, valley polarization was successfully induced. Remarkably, the method enables the complete reversal of valley polarization between valleys in 2D semiconductors. The asymmetric waveform also generates a valley current, which serves as a quantifiable marker for induced valley polarization. This approach provides a means to induce valley polarization, achieve its complete reversal, and quantify it through the associated valley current. The present findings hold significant potential for advancing valleytronics at ambient conditions by showcasing an all-optical approach to effectively harness and manipulate valley states in 2D semiconductors.

TI Temperature-dependent energy transfer dynamics in
   InP/MnxZn1-xS core/shell quantum dots
SO JOURNAL OF INFORMATION DISPLAY
AB Manganese-doped quantum dots have been explored for a variety of applications, including as display phosphors, light absorbers for photocatalysis and photovoltaics, and in quantum information technologies. The majority of work on Mn-doped quantum dots employs either heavy metal-containing hosts (Cd or Pb) or UV-absorbing hosts (ZnS or ZnSe). Manganese doping in the heavy metal free, visible-light-absorbing, InP quantum dot material is relatively underexplored. In particular, only a handful of studies probe the excited state dynamics in these materials. To build a deeper picture of the photophysics in these materials, the current work employs InP/MnxZn1-xS core/shell quantum dots with varying Mn concentrations. Temperature-dependent and time-resolved photoluminescence spectroscopy is used to explore the forward and reverse energy transfer between the InP excitonic state and the excited Mn state. We find that the InP to Mn energy transfer rate constant is proportional to Mn concentration. Furthermore, we show that an equilibrium exists between these two states that can be well understood with Boltzmann statistics and allows for thermally-activated delayed photoluminescence from the InP exciton (similar to 4 ms).

AB Lead halide perovskites have emerged as promising semiconductors for high-performance photovoltaics, light-emitting devices as well as quantum information technologies. In this review, we highlight the magneto-optical effects in these materials from both fundamental research and practical application perspectives. We summarize the experimental results measured for basic physical quantities and the assignment of various spectral peaks using the magneto-optical spectroscopy. These results provide a solid foundation underlying the excellent photo-electronic properties of lead halide perovskites. Additionally, we provide an overview of carrier spin precession and its hyperfine interaction with the nuclear spin bath in response to the applied magnetic field, which is essential for developing perovskite-based spintronic devices. We also illustrate the magnetic-field effects in optoelectronic devices, aiming at providing instructions for performance optimization. Finally, we discuss several challenging research directions towards a comprehensive understanding of the perovskite family and their potential applications in quantum physics, which might be accessed with the magneto-optical techniques. Overall, this review highlights the intriguing possibilities for lead halide perovskites in magneto-optical research and technology, and provides insights for future investigations to advance this promising field.

TI Collisional dynamics of a few atom quantum system with tunable
   interaction
SO PHYSICA SCRIPTA
AB The advent of single-atom trapping in optical tweezers and experimental evolution in control, isolation, and manipulation of cold atoms allows us to manifest the few-body physics and its connection with the many-body systems. In cold atom experiments, the universality of few-body physics is majorly governed by the scattering length which makes it an important parameter in determining theoretically calculated loss rates. Here, we numerically study the 3-body collisional dynamics for Cesium atoms using the atom loss model described by Born-Markov approximation. Using the Cs atoms provides us the freedom to vary the scattering length, a, as a function of the magnetic field through Feshbach resonances. We investigate the three-, two-, and one-particle processes in the repulsive interactions regime at different values for a. We find that the probability of one atom remaining in the trap is maximum at B = 26 G corresponding to a = 402.382a (0) and has the highest value amongst the probability of zero-, two-, and three-particle remaining in the trap at same magnetic field after the collision. Our findings leads to high fidelity single atom tweezers which have direct application in creating defect free arrays for quantum information processing purposes.

TI A review on recent advances in fabricating freestanding
   single-crystalline complex-oxide membranes and its applications
SO PHYSICA SCRIPTA
AB Complex-oxide materials are gaining a tremendous amount of interest in the semiconductor materials and device community as they hold many useful intrinsic physical properties such as ferro/piezoelectricity, pyroelectricity, ferromagnetism, as well as magnetostriction and other properties suitable for energy storage elements. Complex-oxides can also be complemented with conventional semiconductor-based devices or used by themselves to realize state-of-the-art electronic/photonic/quantum information devices. However, because complex-oxide materials have vastly different crystalline structures and lattice constant difference compared to conventional semiconductor devices (such as Si or III-V/III-N materials), integration of complex-oxides onto conventional semiconductor platforms has been difficult. Thus, there has been constant efforts to produce freestanding single-crystalline complex-oxide thin films such that these films can be transferred and integrated together with device platforms based on other materials. This review will provide a comprehensive review on single-crystalline complex-oxide membranes technology developed thus far: how they are synthesized, methods to release them from the substrate, and their outstanding properties and applications.

TI Robust Control Performance for Open Quantum Systems
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON AUTOMATIC CONTROL
AB Robust performance of control schemes for open quantum systems is investigated under classical uncertainties in the generators of the dynamics and non-classical uncertainties due to decoherence and initial state preparation errors. A formalism is developed to measure performance based on the transmission of a dynamic perturbation or initial state preparation error to the quantum state error. This makes it possible to apply tools from classical robust control, such as structured singular value analysis. A difficulty arising from the singularity of the closed-loop Bloch equations for the quantum state is overcome by introducing the #-inversion lemma, a specialized version of the matrix inversion lemma. Under some conditions, this guarantees continuity of the structured singular value at s = 0. Additional difficulties occur when symmetry gives rise to multiple open-loop poles, which under symmetry-breaking unfold into single eigenvalues. The concepts are applied to systems subject to pure decoherence and a general dissipative system example of two qubits in a leaky cavity under laser driving fields and spontaneous emission. A nonclassical performance index, steady-state entanglement quantified by the concurrence, a nonlinear function of the system state, is introduced. Simulations confirm a conflict between entanglement, its log-sensitivity and stability margin under decoherence.

TI Understanding Heterogeneities in Quantum Materials
SO ADVANCED MATERIALS
AB Quantum materials are usually heterogeneous, with structural defects, impurities, surfaces, edges, interfaces, and disorder. These heterogeneities are sometimes viewed as liabilities within conventional systems; however, their electronic and magnetic structures often define and affect the quantum phenomena such as coherence, interaction, entanglement, and topological effects in the host system. Therefore, a critical need is to understand the roles of heterogeneities in order to endow materials with new quantum functions for energy and quantum information science applications. In this article, several representative examples are reviewed on the recent progress in connecting the heterogeneities to the quantum behaviors of real materials. Specifically, three intertwined topic areas are assessed: i) Reveal the structural, electronic, magnetic, vibrational, and optical degrees of freedom of heterogeneities. ii) Understand the effect of heterogeneities on the behaviors of quantum states in host material systems. iii) Control heterogeneities for new quantum functions. This progress is achieved by establishing the atomistic-level structure-property relationships associated with heterogeneities in quantum materials. The understanding of the interactions between electronic, magnetic, photonic, and vibrational states of heterogeneities enables the design of new quantum materials, including topological matter and quantum light emitters based on heterogenous 2D materials.

TI Higher-order exceptional point in a pseudo-Hermitian cavity
   optomechanical system
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Higher-order exceptional points (EPs), resulting from non-Hermitian degeneracies, have shown greater advantages in sensitive enhancement than second-order EPs (EP2s). Therefore, seeking higher-order EPs in various quantum systems is important for quantum information science. Here we propose a benchmark cavity optomechanical (COM) system consisting of a mechanical resonator coupled to two cavities via radiation pressure for predicting the third-order exceptional point (EP3). We first give the pseudo-Hermitian condition for the non-Hermitian COM system by taking the bath effects into account. Then we consider the mechanical gain effect, and we find that the pseudo-Hermitian COM system without PT symmetry can host both EP3 and EP2 for symmetric and asymmetric cavities. In the symmetric case, only EP3 or EP2 can be predicted in the parameter space, but EP3 and EP2 can be transformed into each other by tuning the optomechanical coupling strength in the asymmetric case. We further consider the case of one cavity with gain. For this case, the pseudo-Hermitian COM system is PT symmetric and can also host EP3 or EP2. The influence of system parameters on them is discussed. Our proposal provides a potential way to realize sensitive detection and study other physical phenomena around higher-order EPs in non-Hermitian COM systems.

TI Accelerating Luminescence in Nanostructures: Exploring the Physical
   Limits and Impact of Ultrafast Emission in Nanoscale Materials
SO ADVANCED PHOTONICS RESEARCH
AB Ultrafast luminescence represents a frontier in optical materials science, bridging fundamental investigations of light-matter interaction and the development of next-generation photonic devices. Enhancing the speed of luminescence has long been a central objective, with continued relevance in both fundamental and applied contexts. In advanced photonic systems, rapid light emission enables the realization of extremely bright and temporally precise optical signals. This capability is crucial for quantum information technologies, where single-photon sources with short radiative lifetimes are essential, as well as for classical high-speed optical communication and sensing platforms. This review highlights recent progress in accelerating the emission process by leveraging cooperative emission effects, resonator-enhanced coupling, and nonlocal or multipolar interactions, incorporating the authors' original contributions and perspectives. These advances have led to the realization of novel coherent and incoherent bright light sources, high-efficiency single-photon emitters, radiative processes robust against thermal dephasing, and photon generation from materials typically regarded as nonluminescent due to thermal relaxation or self-trapping. These mechanisms from both theoretical and experimental perspectives are explored, and insights into their integration for future photonic architectures are offered.

TI Topology optimization of optical nanoantennas with desired multipoles
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Engineering the field scattered by an object is an important problem across the entire electromagnetic spectrum. For example, directional scattering achieved by means of nanoantennas is sought for applications in integrated optics, nanophotonics, sensing, single photon sources, and quantum information processing. Since a scattered field can be decomposed into a superposition of multipolar fields, the multipole decomposition technique provides an ideal platform for scattering engineering. In this paper, we present a topology optimization method for the inverse design of nanostructures to achieve specific multipoles with amplitude and phase control at a given wavelength. Our technique is formulated based on the discrete dipole approximation (DDA), and the optimization objective is specified as the current density associated with each multipole. Our approach operates on near-field quantities and is computationally lighter than similar methods targeting the far-field. Moreover, we can enforce a desired size/shape of the design volume, e.g., to meet fabrication or diffractionless constraints. We demonstrate our method by optimizing dielectric and metallic nanoantennas to achieve directional scattering based on the Kerker effect, using different excitation sources, including a plane wave and a dipole emitter. However, the generality of our approach makes it suitable for engineering nanoantennas with arbitrary scattering properties under various illumination conditions.

TI Electrical charge control of h-BN single photon sources
SO 2D MATERIALS
AB Colour centres of hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) have been discovered as promising and practical single photon sources due to their high brightness and narrow spectral linewidth at room-temperature. In order to realize h-BN based photonic quantum communications, the ability to electrically activate the single photon fluorescence using an external electric field is crucial. In this work, we show the electrical switching of the photoluminescence from h-BN quantum emitters, enabled by the controllable electron transfer from the nearby charge reservoir. By tuning the Fermi level of graphene next to the h-BN defects, we observed luminescence brightening of quantum emitters upon the application of a voltage due to the direct charge state manipulation. In addition, the correlation measurement of the single photon sources with the graphene's Raman spectroscopy allows us to extract the exact charge transition level of quantum emitters, providing the information on the crystallographic nature of the defect structure. With the complete on-off switching of emission intensity of h-BN quantum emitters using a voltage, our result paves the way for the van der Waals colour centre based photonic quantum information processing, cryptography and memory applications.

TI Thermodynamic origin of quantum time-energy uncertainty relation
SO JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL MECHANICS-THEORY AND EXPERIMENT
AB The problem of time is a notable obstacle towards the recognition of quantum theory as the ultimate fundamental description of nature. Quantum theory may not be complete if founded upon classical notions. Louis de Broglie, seeming to be more or less convinced about the ontology of his proposed matter waves, tried to develop a theory of sub-quantum degrees of freedom relying on statistical thermodynamics. He realized a quantum particle as a fluctuating dense corpuscle formed via non-linear effects from a sub-quantum medium. A wave on the medium guides the vibrating corpuscle. He argued that an intrinsic clock of a quantum particle is related to its Brownian motion at the sub-quantum level. This led him to conjecture a relation between the de Broglie clock frequency mc (2)/h and its implicit temperature, which equals that of the surrounding sub-quantum medium. About the same time, Mandelbrot was the first to derive in a classical setting a thermodynamic uncertainty relation between energy and temperature, that was, coincidentally or not, anticipated by Bohr and Heisenberg in the first years of development of quantum theory. We show here that, when the de Broglie temperature-time conjecture is assumed, the thermodynamic temperature-energy uncertainty relation leads to the quantum time-energy uncertainty relation.

TI Witnessing quantum phase transition in a non-Hermitian trapped ion
   system via quantum Fisher information
SO CHINESE OPTICS
AB Quantum Fisher information is used to witness the quantum phase transition in a non-Hermitian trapped ion system with balanced gain and loss, from the viewpoint of quantum parameter estimation. We formulate a general non-unitary dynamic of any two-level non-Hermitian system in the form of state vector. The sudden change in the dynamics of quantum Fisher information occurs at an exceptional point characterizing quantum criticality. The dynamical behaviors of quantum Fisher information are classified into two different ways which depends on whether the system is located in symmetry unbroken or broken phase regimes. In the phase regime where parity and time reversal symmetry are unbroken, the oscillatory evolution of quantum Fisher information is presented, achieving better quantum measurement precision. In the broken phase regime, quantum Fisher information undergoes the monotonically decreasing behavior. The maximum value of quantum estimation precision is obtained at the exceptional point. It is found that the two distinct kinds of behaviors can be verified by quantum entropy and coherence. Utilizing quantum Fisher information to witness phase transition in the non-Hermitian system is emphasized. The results may have potential applications to non-Hermitian quantum information technology.

TI Influence of disorder on antidot vortex Majorana states in
   three-dimensional topological insulators
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB Topological insulator/superconductor two-dimensional heterostructures are promising candidates for realizing topological superconductivity and Majorana modes. In these systems, a vortex pinned by a prefabricated antidot in the superconductor can host Majorana zero-energy modes (MZMs), which are exotic quasiparticles that may enable quantum information processing. However, a major challenge is to design devices that can manipulate the information encoded in these MZMs. One of the key factors is to create small and clean antidots, so the MZMs, localized in the vortex core, have a large gap to other excitations. If the antidot is too large or too disordered, the level spacing for the subgap vortex states may become smaller than temperature. In this paper, we numerically investigate the effects of disorder, chemical potential, and antidot size on the subgap vortex spectrum, using a two-dimensional effective model of the topological insulator surface. Our model allows us to simulate large system sizes with vortices up to 1.8 mu m in diameter (with a 6 nm lattice constant). We also compare our disorder model with the transport data from existing experiments. We find that the spectral gap can exhibit a nonmonotonic behavior as a function of disorder strength, and that it can be tuned by applying a gate voltage.

TI A broadband high-brightness quantum-dot double solid immersion lens
   single photon source
SO APL PHOTONICS
AB High-brightness single photon sources (SPSs) are key components for practical quantum information processing systems. Although the performances of recently reported high-brightness SPSs are excellent, it remains challenging to match the emission wavelength of a quantum dot (QD) to the cavity since the high-Q cavity structures have narrow spectral bandwidths. Here, we propose a highly bright and broadband QD SPS that can be deterministically fabricated with a simple yet precise method. The optimized GaAs-polymer double solid immersion lens structure is capable of a brightness of 88% at 0.5 NA and has an operation band of 65 nm with a brightness of over 80% from numerical simulations. Experimentally, we achieved a brightness of 51.6%+/- 2% and pure single photon emission [g((2))(0) = 0.029 +/- 0.005] at saturation. We believe that our result can pave the way to a practical high-brightness QD SPS, considering its simple QD geometry together with its low cost and precise deterministic fabrication without using expensive and complicated e-beam lithography and dry etching processes.(c) 2023 Author(s).

TI Gate fidelity, dephasing, and 'magic' trapping of optically trapped
   neutral atom
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB The fidelity of the gate operation and the coherence time of neutral atoms trapped in an optical dipole trap are figures of merit for the applications. The motion of the trapped atom is one of the key factors which influences the gate fidelity and coherence time. The motion has been considered as a classical oscillator in analyzing the influence. Here we treat the motion of the atom as a quantum oscillator. The population on the vibrational states of the atom are considered in analyzing the gate fidelity and decoherence. We show that the fidelity of a coherent rotation gate is dramatically limited by the temperature of a thermally trapped atom. We also show that the dephasing between the two hyperfine states due to the thermal motion of the atom could rephase naturally if the differential frequency shift is stable and the vibrational states do not change. The decoherence due to the fluctuations of the trap laser intensity is also discussed. Both the gate fidelity and coherence time can be dramatically enhanced by cooling the atom into vibrational ground states and/or by using a blue-detuned trap. More importantly, we propose a 'magic' trapping condition by preparing the atom into specific vibrational states.

TI Imaging the electrostatic landscape of unstrained self-assemble GaAs
   quantum dots
SO NANOTECHNOLOGY
AB Unstrained GaAs quantum dots are promising candidates for quantum information devices due to their optical properties, but their electronic properties have remained relatively unexplored until now. In this work, we systematically investigate the electronic structure and natural charging of GaAs quantum dots at room temperature using Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM). We observe a clear electrical signal from these structures demonstrating a lower surface potential in the middle of the dot. We ascribe this to charge accumulation and confinement inside these structures. Our systematical investigation reveals that the change in surface potential is larger for a nominal dot filling of 2 nm and then starts to decrease for thicker GaAs layers. Using k center dot p calculation, we show that the confinement comes from the band bending due to the surface Fermi level pinning. We find a correlation between the calculated charge density and the KPFM signal indicating that k center dot p calculations could be used to estimate the KPFM signal for a given structure. Our results suggest that these self-assembled structures could be used to study physical phenomena connected to charged quantum dots like Coulomb blockade or Kondo effect.

TI Microscale whispering-gallery-mode light sources with lattice-confined
   atoms
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Microlasers, relying on the strong coupling between active particles and optical microcavity, exhibit fundamental differences from conventional lasers, such as multi-threshold/thresholdless behavior and nonclassical photon emission. As light sources, microlasers possess extensive applications in precision measurement, quantum information processing, and biochemical sensing. Here we propose a whispering-gallery-mode microlaser scheme, where ultracold alkaline-earth metal atoms, i.e., gain medium, are tightly confined in a two-color evanescent lattice that is in the ring shape and formed around a microsphere. To suppress the influence of the lattice-induced ac Stark shift on the moderately-narrow-linewidth laser transition, the red-detuned trapping beams operate at a magic wavelength while the wavelength of the blue-detuned trapping beam is set close to the other magic wavelength. The tiny mode volume and high quality factor of the microsphere ensure the strong atom-microcavity coupling in the bad-cavity regime. As a result, both saturation photon and critical atom numbers, which characterize the laser performance, are substantially reduced below unity. We explore the lasing action of the coupled system by using the Monte Carlo approach. Our scheme may be potentially generalized to the microlasers based on the forbidden clock transitions, holding the prospect for microscale active optical clocks in precision measurement and frequency metrology.

TI Topological phonon blockade and its transfer via dark-mode engineering
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Unidirectional topological behavior, engendered by imposing topological operations winding around an exceptional point, is sensitive to dark modes, which allow deactivating topological operations, resulting in a complete blockade of both mode conversion and phonon transfer between dark and bright modes. Here we demonstrate how to beat this challenge and achieve a versatile yet unique nonreciprocal topological phonon transfer and blockade via dark-mode engineering. This happens by harnessing the power of synthetic magnetism, leading to an extraordinary transition between the dark-mode nonbreaking and breaking regimes, in a precise and controlled manner. Specifically, topological phonon blockade (transfer) happens in the dark-mode nonbreaking (breaking) regime, offering an exciting opportunity of switching between topological phonon blockade and its transfer on demand, which has no counterpart in previous studies. Remarkably, applying dark-mode engineering to quantum optomechanical networks can enable scalable network-based topological phonon transfer and quantum collective ground-state preparation. The proposed mechanism has general validity and can be generalized to the manipulation of various dark-state-related quantum effects, advancing the development of scalable quantum information processors. This study maps a general path towards generating a profoundly different topological quantum resource with immunity against both dark modes and dark states.

TI Ultra-fast and Universal Vector Mode Analyzer Based on 4D Jones Vector
   and Intensity-Only Detection
SO LASER & PHOTONICS REVIEWS
AB The vast applications of vector vortex beams (VVBs) have driven the development of generation devices on various platforms and at different wavelengths, leading to a growing demand for universal optical field characterization methods. Simultaneously, high-speed optical field characterization can be utilized for signal demodulation in information applications. In this paper, a universal and ultra-fast vector mode decomposition (VMD) method based on purely analytical, non-iterative formulas is proposed for the first time. This method requires only the intensity measurements of a few polarization components to achieve a complete 2D electric field characterization of VVBs. By utilizing the conversion relationships between different mode bases, this approach is compatible with various mode types-such as cylindrical vector (CV) and linearly polarized (LP) modes-across fibers, on-chip waveguides, and other platforms. It is not limited by azimuthal or radial mode orders (determined only by detector resolution), and operates over 100 000 times faster than previous neural network methods. This universal and rapid method is expected to facilitate the characterization of vector-structured beams and their practical applications in telecommunications, higher-dimensional quantum information, and beyond.

TI Intense Circular Dichroism and Spin Selectivity in AgBiS2
   Nanocrystals by Chiral Ligand Exchange
SO ADVANCED MATERIALS
AB Chiral semiconducting nanomaterials offer many potential applications in photodetection, light emission, quantum information, and so on. However, it is difficult to achieve a strong circular dichroism (CD) signal in semiconducting nanocrystals (NCs) due to the complexity of chiral ligand surface engineering and multiple, uncertain mechanisms of chiroptical behavior. Here, a chiral ligand exchange strategy with cysteine on the ternary metal chalcogenide AgBiS2 NCs is developed, and a strong, long-lasting CD signal in the near-UV region is achieved. By carefully optimizing the ligand concentration, the CD peaks are observed at 260 and 320 nm, respectively, giving insight into the different ligand binding mechanisms influencing the CD signal of AgBiS2 NCs. Using density-functional theory, a large degree of crystal distortion by the bidentate mode of ligand chelation, and efficient ligand-NC electron transfer, synergistically resulting in the strongest CD signal (g-factor over 10-2) observed in chiral ligand-exchanged semiconductor NCs to date, is demonstrated. To demonstrate the effective chiral properties of these AgBiS2 NCs, a spin-filter device with over 86% efficiency is fabricated. This work represents a considerable leap in the field of chiral semiconductor NCs and points toward their future applications.

TI Bidirectional Optical Non-Reciprocity in a Multi-Mode Cavity
   Optomechanical System
SO ANNALEN DER PHYSIK
AB Optical non-reciprocity that allows unidirectional flow of optical field is pivoted on time reversal symmetry breaking, which originates from radiation pressure because of light-matter interaction in cavity optomechanical systems. Here, the non-reciprocal transport of optical signals across two ports via three optical modes optomechanically coupled to the mechanical excitations of two nanomechanical resonators (NMRs) is studied under the influence of strong classical drive fields and weak probe fields. It is found that there exists the conversion of reciprocal to non-reciprocal signal transmission via tuning the drive fields and perfect non-reciprocal transmission of output fields is realized when the effective cavity detuning parameters are near resonant to the NMRs' frequencies. The unidirectional non-reciprocal transport is robust to the optomechanical couplings around resonance conditions. Moreover, the loss rates of cavities play an inevitable role in the unidirectional flow of signal across the two ports. Bidirectional transmission can also be controlled by the phase changes associated with the probe and drive fields along with their relative phase. This scheme may provide a foundation for the compact non-reciprocal communication and quantum information processing, thus enabling novel devices that route photons in unconventional ways such as all-optical diodes, optical transistors, and optical switches.

TI Dynamical Collective Excitations and Entanglement of Two Strongly
   Correlated Rydberg Superatoms
SO PHOTONICS
AB Based on the dipole blockade effect and with the aid of the superatom (SA) model, we propose a scheme to investigate the correlated evolution of two Rydberg sub-superatoms (SSAs), formed by two spatially separated atomic Rydberg sub-ensembles but in the same blockade region. Starting from the pure separable states, we investigate the in-phase or anti-phase correlated dynamics and explore how two Rydberg SSAs entangle with each other mediated by a single Rydberg excitation. Starting from the entangled states, we discuss the robustness of the system against decoherence induced by the dephasing rate. Our results show that both the correlated evolution of two Rydberg SSAs and their collective-state entanglement are usually sensitive to the number of each Rydberg SSA. This allows us to coherently manipulate the Rydberg ensemble over long distances from the single-quantum level to the mesoscopic level by changing the number of atoms. Furthermore, the method for dividing an SA into two SSAs and obtaining their spin operators without any approximation can be readily generalized to the case of many SSAs. It may have potential promising applications in quantum information processing and provide an attractive platform to study the quantum-classical correspondence, many-body physics and so on.

TI Quantum-coherent nanoscience
SO NATURE NANOTECHNOLOGY
AB For the past three decades nanoscience has widely affected many areas in physics, chemistry and engineering, and has led to numerous fundamental discoveries, as well as applications and products. Concurrently, quantum science and technology has developed into a cross-disciplinary research endeavour connecting these same areas and holds burgeoning commercial promise. Although quantum physics dictates the behaviour of nanoscale objects, quantum coherence, which is central to quantum information, communication and sensing, has not played an explicit role in much of nanoscience. This Review describes fundamental principles and practical applications of quantum coherence in nanoscale systems, a research area we call quantum-coherent nanoscience. We structure this Review according to specific degrees of freedom that can be quantum-coherently controlled in a given nanoscale system, such as charge, spin, mechanical motion and photons. We review the current state of the art and focus on outstanding challenges and opportunities unlocked by the merging of nanoscience and coherent quantum operations.
   Although quantum physics underpins the behaviour of nanoscale objects, its role in nanoscience has been mostly limited to determining the static, equilibrium properties of small systems. This Review describes seminal developments and new directions for the explicit exploitation of quantum coherence in nanoscale systems, a research area termed quantum-coherent nanoscience.

TI Metrological complementarity reveals the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen paradox
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB The Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) paradox plays a fundamental role in our understanding of quantum mechanics, and is associated with the possibility of predicting the results of non-commuting measurements with a precision that seems to violate the uncertainty principle. This apparent contradiction to complementarity is made possible by nonclassical correlations stronger than entanglement, called steering. Quantum information recognises steering as an essential resource for a number of tasks but, contrary to entanglement, its role for metrology has so far remained unclear. Here, we formulate the EPR paradox in the framework of quantum metrology, showing that it enables the precise estimation of a local phase shift and of its generating observable. Employing a stricter formulation of quantum complementarity, we derive a criterion based on the quantum Fisher information that detects steering in a larger class of states than well-known uncertainty-based criteria. Our result identifies useful steering for quantum-enhanced precision measurements and allows one to uncover steering of non-Gaussian states in state-of-the-art experiments. Steering reflects the ability to predict measurement results on one side of a quantum-correlated system based on measurements on the other side, which can be phrased as a metrology problem. Here, the authors explore this connection, deriving a general steering criterion based on quantum Fisher information.

TI Towards Quantum One-Time Memories from Stateless Hardware
SO QUANTUM
AB A central tenet of theoretical cryptography is the study of the minimal assumptions required to implement a given cryptographic primitive. One such primitive is the one-time memory (OTM), introduced by Goldwasser, Kalai, and Rothblum [CRYPTO 2008], which is a classical functionality modeled after a non-interactive 1-out-of-2 oblivious transfer, and which is complete for one-time classical and quantum programs. It is known that secure OTMs do not exist in the standard model in both the classical and quantum settings. Here, we propose a scheme for using quantum information, together with the assumption of stateless (i.e., reusable) hardware tokens, to build statistically secure OTMs. Via the semidefinite programming-based quantum games framework of Gutoski and Watrous [STOC 2007], we prove security for a malicious receiver making at most 0.114n adaptive queries to the token (for n the key size), in the quantum universal composability framework, but leave open the question of security against a polynomial amount of queries. Compared to alternative schemes derived from the literature on quantum money, our scheme is technologically simple since it is of the "prepare-and-measure" type. We also give two impossibility results showing certain assumptions in our scheme cannot be relaxed.

TI Cascaded metasurface for polarization-dependent varifocal vortex beam
   manipulation
SO NANOPHOTONICS
AB Vortex beams, characterized by orbital angular momentum (OAM), hold significant potential in optical communications, quantum information processing, and optical manipulation. However, existing metasurface designs are largely confined to single-degree-of-freedom control, such as static OAM generation or fixed focal points, which limiting their ability to integrate polarization multiplexing with dynamic focal tuning. To address this challenge, we propose a tunable multifunctional cascaded metasurface that synergizes polarization-sensitive phase engineering with interlayer rotational coupling, overcoming conventional device limitations. The designed metasurface independently generates distinct OAM states in orthogonal circular polarization channels under right-handed circularly polarized (RCP) incidence, that is, a vortex beam with topological charge & ell; = -1 in the left-handed circularly polarized (LCP) channel and a superimposed vortex state (& ell; = +1, -1) in the RCP channel. Continuous focal tuning is achieved via interlayer rotation in the axis-direction, with experimental validation at target frequency. Experimental results demonstrate the focal length modulation range from 25.9 lambda to 9.5 lambda as the interlayer rotation angle varies between 90 degrees and 240 degrees. This multi-degree-of-freedom control strategy establishes a new method for high-capacity optical communications, dynamic holography, and quantum state manipulation, while advancing the development of intelligent metasurfaces for 6G networks and integrated photonic systems.

TI Performance improvement factors in quantum radar/illumination
SO COMMUNICATIONS IN THEORETICAL PHYSICS
AB In this study, we exploit quantum information processing, the research field focusing on quantum two-mode squeezed (QTMS) radar and quantum illumination (QI), to investigate the qualitative behaviors of entanglement, the entropy of formation, and squeezing in these protocols. We use logarithmic negativity to investigate entanglement between the signal and idler and propose strategies to maintain entanglement at room temperature in both protocols. We also calculate the entanglement, squeezing, and entropy for the QTMS radar when the target is present and the signal is transmitted to the target. In addition, by controlling the squeezing parameter which is a tool to control entanglement, entropy, and squeezing, the performance of the QTMS radar can be improved, so this work shows how it is implemented in practice. In both protocols, entanglement is maintained by considering conditions. Since the squeezing parameter controls both signal and idler power and the correlation between them, therefore, the qualitative behavior of squeezing in the QTMS radar and QI is also studied in this research. The significant result obtained from the QI is that the entanglement maintains at high power, low temperature, and high correlation between signal and idler. In contrast, in the QTMS, the entanglement survives when the correlation and power are low, even at room temperature.

TI Stabilization improvement of the squeezed optical fields using a high
   signal-to-noise ratio bootstrap photodetector
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB High-precision cavity locking is crucial for squeezing optical fields. Here, a bootstrapped low-noise photodetector is utilized in the generation process of the squeezed state of light. This process is based on a combination of a modified trans-impedance amplifier (TIA) circuit and a two-stage bootstrap amplifier circuit. This not only achieves high-precision and long-term stable locking of the optical cavity, but it also improves the degree to which the light field is squeezed. The experiment results show that the detector has a high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of 26.7 dB at the analysis frequency of 3 MHz when measuring the shot noise with an injection optical power of 800 mu W, and the equivalent optical power noise level is lower than 2.4 root pW/ Hz in the frequency range of 1-30 MHz. Moreover, the squeezing degree of the quadrature amplitude squeezed state light field can be improved by more than 34.9% when the detector is used for optical cavity locking. The photodetector is useful in continuous variable (CV) quantum information research.(c) 2022 Optica Publishing Group under the terms of the Optica Open Access Publishing Agreement

TI Localization and slow-thermalization in a cluster spin model
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB Novel cluster spin model with interactions and disorder is introduced and studied. In specific type of interactions, we find an extensive number of local integrals of motions (LIOMs), which are a modified version of the stabilizers in quantum information, i.e., mutually commuting operators specifying all quantum states in the system. These LIOMs can be defined for any strength of the interactions and disorder, and are of compact-support instead of exponentially-decaying tail. Hence, even under the presence of interactions, integrability is held, and all energy eigenstates are labeled by these LIOMs and can be explicitly obtained. Integrable dynamics is, then, expected to occur. The compact-support nature of the LIOMs crucially prevents the thermalization and entanglement spreading. We numerically investigate dynamics of the system governed by the existence of the compact-support LIOMs, and clarify the effects of additional interactions, which break the compact-support nature of the LIOMs. There, we find that the ordinary many-body localization behaviors emerge, such as the logarithmic growth of the entanglement entropy in the time evolution. Besides the ergodicity breaking dynamic, we find that symmetry protected topological order preserves for specific states even in the presence of the interactions.

We derive optimal trade-off between the two correlation witnesses in 3 -> 1 sequential quantum random access codes (QRACs), and use the result to complete the self-testing of quantum preparations, instruments and measurements for three sequential parties. We also give the upper and lower bounds of the sharpness parameter to complete the robustness analysis of the self-testing scheme. In addition, we find that classical correlation witness violation based on 3 -> 1 sequential RACs cannot be obtained by both correlation witnesses simultaneously. This means that if the second party uses strong unsharp measurements to overcome the classical upper bound, the third party cannot do so even with sharp measurements. Finally, we give the analysis and comparison of the random number generation efficiency under different sharpness parameters based on the determinant value, 2 -> 1 and 3 -> 1 QRACs separately. This letter sheds new light on generating random numbers among multi-party in semi-device independent framework.

TI Exciton-Photon Coupling Microcavity as a Selective Biosensing Platform
   for Nonlocal Terahertz Metamaterials
SO ADVANCED SCIENCE
AB The strong-coupling microcavity between excitons and photons facilitates efficient modulation and control of light, as well as precise manipulation of photon propagation properties. This phenomenon demonstrates significant potential for diverse applications in quantum information processing, optical sensing, and nonlinear optics. The anapole, as a specific type of captured state, allows for effective control over the electromagnetic field through appropriate distributions of current and charge, generating substantial localized effects within the field. This mechanism provides a novel avenue for investigating the strong-coupling dynamics between photons and excitons in hybrid metamaterial sensing. Here, the rate of energy exchange between the excitons and the optical microcavity of the metamaterial is greater than their individual dissipation rates, resulting in significant Rabi splitting phenomena and pronounced anti-crossing behavior, ultimately forming an "ultrasensitive photoreactive region" suitable for sensing applications. Furthermore, the nonlocal metamaterial, characterized by strong light-matter coupling, can be integrated with functionalized colloidal gold and monoclonal tag antibodies to enable rapid multidimensional detection and identification of total prostate-specific antigen (tPSA) in complex environmental solutions. The proposed strong-coupling resonance microcavity plays a crucial role in the rapid evolution of nonlocal metamaterials, enhancing their applicability in molecular detection and selective recognition of fundamental light-matter interaction phenomena.

TI Creation of a Photopolymerized Double Spiral Structure by Interference
   of Plasmonic Scattering and Circularly Polarized Light
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY C
AB Chiro-optical effects of materials enable many intriguing optical phenomena in the subwavelength regime and are expanding their application in broad areas, such as nano/microfabrication, biosensing, and quantum information. To take advantage of the chiro-optical effect, precise control of chiral structures on the nano- and micrometer scales is crucial. Recently, the possibility of producing strong chiro-optical effects using achiral plasmonic nanostructures has been intensively studied. The interaction of achiral nanostructures with circularly polarized light can break the mirror symmetry and enable the circular-polarization-selective distribution of local electromagnetic fields. In this study, we present a method to create a novel double spiral structure by using achiral plasmonic nanoparticles and circularly polarized light. We focus on the chiral electromagnetic field scattered from the nanoparticle over several micrometer scales, which is sometimes neglected due to the relatively weak intensity of the scattering field. The interference between the circularly polarized incident field and the plasmonic scattering field produced a double spiral pattern of the electromagnetic fields, which was replicated via the photopolymerization reaction and resulted in chiral surface relief patterns on the surface of the polymer layer. We believe that our approach can support the development of novel photonic devices and chiral nanomaterials.

TI The suppression of finite size effect within a few lattice sites
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB Boundary modes localized on the boundaries of a finite-size lattice experience a finite size effect (FSE) that could result in unwanted couplings, crosstalks and formation of gaps even in topological boundary modes. It is commonly believed that the FSE decays exponentially with the size of the system and thus requires many lattice sites before eventually becoming negligibly small. Here we consider a two-dimensional strip geometry that is periodic along one direction and truncated along the other direction, in which we identify a special type of FSE of some boundary modes that apparently vanishes at some particular wave vectors along the periodic direction. Meanwhile, the number of wave vectors where the FSE vanishes equals the number of lattice sites across the strip. We analytically prove this type of FSE in a simple model and prove this peculiar feature. We also provide a physical system consisting of a plasmonic sphere array where this FSE is present. Our work points to the possibility of almost arbitrarily tunning of the FSE, which facilitates unprecedented manipulation of the coupling strength between modes or channels such as the integration of multiple waveguides and photonic non-abelian braiding.

TI Silicon-Based On-Chip Tunable High-Q-Factor and Low-Power Fano
   Resonators with Graphene Nanoheaters
SO NANOMATERIALS
AB Tunable and low-power microcavities are essential for large-scale photonic integrated circuits. Thermal tuning, a convenient and stable tuning method, has been widely adopted in optical neural networks and quantum information processing. Recently, graphene thermal tuning has been demonstrated to be a power-efficient technique, as it does not require thick spacers to prevent light absorption. In this paper, a silicon-based on-chip Fano resonator with graphene nanoheaters is proposed and fabricated. This novel Fano structure is achieved by introducing a scattering block, and it can be easily fabricated in large quantities. Experimental results demonstrate that the resonator has the characteristics of a high quality factor (similar to 31,000) and low state-switching power (similar to 1 mW). The temporal responses of the microcavity exhibit qualified modulation speed with 9.8 mu s rise time and 16.6 mu s fall time. The thermal imaging and Raman spectroscopy of graphene at different biases were also measured to intuitively show that the tuning is derived from the joule heating effect of graphene. This work provides an alternative for future large-scale tunable and low-power-consumption optical networks, and has potential applications in optical filters and switches.

TI Entanglement and separability in continuum Rokhsar-Kivelson states
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB We study a vast family of continuum Rokhsar-Kivelson (RK) states, which have their ground state encoded by a local quantum field theory. These describe certain quantum magnets, and are also important in quantum information. We prove the separability of the reduced density matrix of two disconnected subsystems, implying the absence of entanglement between the two subsystems-a stronger statement than the vanishing of logarithmic negativity. As a particular instance, we investigate the case where the ground state is described by a relativistic boson, which is relevant for certain magnets or Lifshitz critical points with dynamical exponent z = 2, and we propose nontrivial deformations that preserve their RK structure. Specializing to 1D systems, we study a deformation that maps the ground state to the quantum harmonic oscillator, leading to a gap for the boson. We study the resulting correlation functions, and find that cluster decomposition is restored. We analytically compute the c function for the entanglement entropy along a renormalization group flow for the wavefunction, which is found to be strictly decreasing as in CFTs. Finally, we comment on the relations to certain stoquastic quantum spin chains. We show that the Motzkin and Fredkin chains possess unusual entanglement properties not properly captured by previous studies.

TI Arbitrary linear transformations for photons in the frequency synthetic
   dimension
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Arbitrary linear transformations are of crucial importance in a plethora of photonic applications spanning classical signal processing, communication systems, quantum information processing and machine learning. Here, we present a photonic architecture to achieve arbitrary linear transformations by harnessing the synthetic frequency dimension of photons. Our structure consists of dynamically modulated micro-ring resonators that implement tunable couplings between multiple frequency modes carried by a single waveguide. By inverse design of these short- and long-range couplings using automatic differentiation, we realize arbitrary scattering matrices in synthetic space between the input and output frequency modes with near-unity fidelity and favorable scaling. We show that the same physical structure can be reconfigured to implement a wide variety of manipulations including single-frequency conversion, nonreciprocal frequency translations, and unitary as well as non-unitary transformations. Our approach enables compact, scalable and reconfigurable integrated photonic architectures to achieve arbitrary linear transformations in both the classical and quantum domains using current state-of-the-art technology. Photonic processors that can perform arbitrary tasks are in demand for many applications. Here, the authors present a photonic architecture using waveguide and resonator couplings to perform arbitrary linear transformations, by taking advantage of the frequency synthetic dimension.

TI Nanophotonic phenomena driven by vector beams
SO ADVANCED PHOTONICS
AB Cylindrical vector beams (CVBs), characterized by their spatially varying polarization and axial symmetry, have emerged as powerful tools for engineering light-matter interactions at the nanoscale. Unlike conventional linearly polarized beams, tightly focused CVBs can generate strong longitudinal electric or magnetic field components, enabling the selective excitation of specific multipolar modes and various resulting modes in optical nanostructures. This unique field configuration facilitates the excitation of various optical phenomena such as anapole states, dark modes, Fano resonances, optical magnetism, and enhanced nonlinear optical responses, which are challenging to achieve with traditional illumination. We summarize recent advancements in nanophotonic phenomena/effects driven by CVB excitation, illustrated through seminal studies in plasmonic, dielectric, or hybrid nanostructures, offering promising opportunities for applications in imaging, sensing, optical trapping, quantum information processing, etc. We discuss how enhanced electromagnetic field confinement, increased coupling efficiency, and precise control over resonant scattering can lead to advanced nanophotonic phenomena/effects under CVB illumination. The insights presented here aim to guide future developments in structured light-matter interaction and inspire the design of advanced nanophotonic systems.

TI Characterizing Multipartite non-Gaussian Entanglement for a Three-Mode
   Spontaneous Parametric Down-Conversion Process
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB Very recently, strongly non-Gaussian states have been observed via a direct three-mode spontaneous parametric down-conversion in a superconducting cavity [Phys. Rev. X 10, 011011 (2020)]. The created multiphoton non-Gaussian correlations are attractive and useful for various quantum information tasks. However, how to detect and classify multipartite non-Gaussian entanglement has not yet been completely understood. Here, we present an experimentally practical method to characterize continuous-variable mul-tipartite non-Gaussian entanglement, by introducing a class of nonlinear squeezing parameters involving accessible higher-order moments of phase-space quadratures. As these parameters can depend on arbi-trary operators, we consider their analytical optimization over a set of practical measurements, in order to detect different classes of multipartite non-Gaussian entanglement ranging from fully separable to fully inseparable. We demonstrate that the nonlinear squeezing parameters act as an excellent approximation to the quantum Fisher information within accessible third-order moments. The level of the nonlinear squeez-ing quantifies the metrological advantage provided by those entangled states. Moreover, by analyzing the above-mentioned experiment, we show that our method can be readily used to confirm fully insepara-ble tripartite non-Gaussian entangled states by performing a limited number of measurements without requiring full knowledge of the quantum state.

TI The operational framework for quantum theories is both epistemologically
   and ontologically neutral
SO STUDIES IN HISTORY AND PHILOSOPHY OF SCIENCE
AB Operational frameworks are very useful to study the foundations of quantum mechanics, and are sometimes used to promote antirealist attitudes towards the theory. The aim of this paper is to review three arguments aiming at defending an antirealist reading of quantum physics based on various developments of standard quantum mechanics appealing to notions such as quantum information, non-causal correlations and indefinite causal orders. Those arguments will be discussed in order to show that they are not convincing. Instead, it is argued that there is conceptually no argument that could favour realist or antirealist attitudes towards quantum mechanics based solely on some features of some formalism. In particular, both realist and antirealist views are well accomodable within operational formulations of the theory. The reason for this is that the realist/antirealist debate is located at a purely epistemic level, which is not engaged by formal aspects of theories. As such, operational formulations of quantum mechanics are epistmologically and ontologically neutral. This discussion aims at clarifying the limits of the historical and methodological affinities between scientific antirealism and operational physics while engaging with recent discoveries in quantum foundations. It also aims at presenting various realist strategies to account for those developments.

SO NANOPHOTONICS
AB Perovskite semiconductor nanocrystals have emerged as a promising family of materials for optoelectronic applications including light-emitting diodes, lasers, light-to-electricity convertors and quantum light emitters. The performances of these devices are fundamentally dependent on different aspects of the excited-state dynamics in nanocrystals. Herein, we summarize the recent progress on the photoinduced carrier dynamics studied by a variety of time-resolved spectroscopic methods in perovskite nanocrystals. We review the dynamics of carrier generation, recombination and transport under different excitation densities and photon energies to show the pathways that underpin the photophysics for light-emitting diodes and solar cells. Then, we highlight the up-to-date spin dynamics and coherent exciton dynamics being manifested with the exciton fine levels in perovskite semiconductor nanocrystals which are essential for potential applications in quantum information technology. We also discuss the controversial results and the possible origins yet to be resolved. In-depth study toward a comprehensive picture of the excited-state dynamics in perovskite nanocrystals may provide the key knowledge of the device operation mechanism, enlighten the direction for device optimization and stimulate the adventure of new conceptual devices.

TI Spin-decoupled metasurface for simultaneous detection of spin and
   orbital angular momenta via momentum transformation
SO LIGHT-SCIENCE & APPLICATIONS
AB With inherent orthogonality, both the spin angular momentum (SAM) and orbital angular momentum (OAM) of photons have been utilized to expand the dimensions of quantum information, optical communications, and information processing, wherein simultaneous detection of SAMs and OAMs with a single element and a single-shot measurement is highly anticipated. Here, a single azimuthal-quadratic phase metasurface-based photonic momentum transformation (PMT) is illustrated and utilized for vortex recognition. Since different vortices are converted into focusing patterns with distinct azimuthal coordinates on a transverse plane through PMT, OAMs within a large mode space can be determined through a single-shot measurement. Moreover, spin-controlled dual-functional PMTs are proposed for simultaneous SAM and OAM sorting, which is implemented by a single spin-decoupled metasurface that merges both the geometric phase and dynamic phase. Interestingly, our proposed method can detect vectorial vortices with both phase and polarization singularities, as well as superimposed vortices with a certain interval step. Experimental results obtained at several wavelengths in the visible band exhibit good agreement with the numerical modeling. With the merits of ultracompact device size, simple optical configuration, and prominent vortex recognition ability, our approach may underpin the development of integrated and high-dimensional optical and quantum systems.

TI Detecting the metabolism of individual yeast mutant strain cells when
   aged, stressed or treated with antioxidants with diamond magnetometry
SO NANO TODAY
AB Free radicals play a key role in the ageing process. However, free radicals are small, reactive and short lived and thus challenging to measure. We utilize a new technique called diamond magnetometry for this pur-pose. We make use of nitrogen vacancy centers in nanodiamonds. Via a quantum effect these defects convert a magnetic resonance signal into an optical signal. While this method is increasingly popular for its unprecedented sensitivity in physics, we use this technique here for the first time to measure free radicals in living cells. Our signals are equivalent to T1 signals in conventional MRI but from nanoscale voxels from single cells with sub-cellular resolution. With this powerful tool we are able to follow free radical gen-eration after chemically inducing stress. In addition, we can observe free radical reduction in presence of an antioxidant. We were able to clearly differentiate between mutant strains with altered metabolism. Finally, the excellent stability of our diamond particles allowed us to follow the ageing process and differentiate between young and old cells. We could confirm the expected increase of free radical load in old wild type and sod1 Delta mutants. We further applied this new technique to investigate tor1 Delta and pex19 Delta cells. For these mutants an increased lifespan has been reported but the exact mechanism is unclear. We find a decreased free radical load in, which might offer an explanation for the increased lifespan in these cells.(c) 2022 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI Soliton solutions and wave dynamics of complex fractional models in

SO RESULTS IN ENGINEERING
AB The space-time fractional nonlinear Kaup-Newell and unstable Schro<spacing diaeresis>dinger equations with beta derivative describe the evolution of waves in nonlinear media characterized by nonlinear optics, self-phase modulation, optical solitons, intense laser pulses in nonlinear media, quantum information processing, plasma physics, tsunami dynamics, etc. In this study, some standard, compatible, and useful wave solutions with accuracy and applicability, designated in terms of rational, hyperbolic, and trigonometric functions of the stated models expending the (G(y) /G, 1 /G)-expansion approach, are established. The models are adapted to univariate wave equations through fractional wave transformation, erstwhile to investigation. In the space-time solutions, when definite values of the parameters are assigned, solitons of various shapes, including general solitons, periodic, and irregular-periodic are obtained. We also examine how the fractional-order attribute alpha changes the wave profile and find a correlation between the variation of the soliton profile and the variation of the fractional-order derivative alpha. To illustrate the physical structure and attributes of the obtained solitons, this study depicts threeand two-dimensional graphs.

TI Diffractive Metasurface-Enabled Single-Shot Characterization of
   Hybrid-Order Poincaré Beams
SO ADVANCED OPTICAL MATERIALS
AB Hybrid-order Poincar & eacute; beams (HyOPBs) with complex transverse polarization states hold significant potential in optical communication and quantum information. Fully characterizing the Poincar & eacute; parameters of HyOPBs is a key task to accelerate applications. Conventional methods typically require mapping in multiple polarization states and reconstructing point by point, creating a fundamental bottleneck for fast measurement and real-time monitoring of Poincar & eacute; parameters. In this work, a single-shot and real-time characterization scheme for HyOPBs is demonstrated by applying diffractive neural networks to a system of cascaded diffractive metasurfaces. The designed diffractive metasurfaces essentially function as an optical processor, efficiently extracting high-dimensional spatial modes and complex amplitude information. Whereafter, the Poincar & eacute; parameters are accurately predicted, and the HyOPBs are correctly reconstructed with the help of electronic deep neural networks. This innovative approach is validated through a series of simulation studies with average reconstruction errors of <2.68% for sigma and 1.84% for theta, respectively. The work provides an effective strategy for precise, compact, and real-time detection of HyOPBs, paving the way for their application in the next generation of high-capacity optical communication systems.

TI Discriminating ferrotoroidic from antiferrotoroidic ground states using
   a 3d quantum spin sensor
SO NPJ QUANTUM MATERIALS
AB Molecular toroidal states have come to the forefront as candidates for next-generation quantum information devices owing to their bistability and protection from weak, short-range magnetic interactions. The protection offered by these non-magnetic vortex spin states proves to be a double-edged sword as inferring their existence in a molecular system has yet to be achieved through experimental means alone. Here, we investigate the anomalous, sickle-shaped, single-crystal magnetisation profile arising in mu-SQUID measurements of a novel CrDy3 molecule. Theoretical modelling supported by ab initio calculations demonstrates that the weak field CrDy3 spin dynamics is resultant from quantum superposition of the CrIII spin states determined by three competing interactions: (i) the alignment of the CrIII magnetic moment to the external magnetic field, (ii) the zero-field splitting of the CrIII ground quartet, and (iii) coupling to the remnant magnetisation of the toroidal ground state in the Dy3 triangle. If zero-field splitting of the central transition metal ion is quenched, it operates as a quantum spin sensor, which can be exploited to experimentally discriminate between ferrotoroidic and antiferrotoroidic ground states in MDy6 double triangle complexes through electron paramagnetic resonance experiments and single-crystal magnetisation measurements with a restricted field sweeping domain.

TI Broadband spin-dependent anti-reflection in chiral time-varying
   metamaterials
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Time-varying metamaterials have garnered significant attention for their ability to achieve anti-reflection in the time domain. However, current systems face limitations in spin-controlled manipulation, as most studies focus on non-chiral, time-varying metamaterials. Consequently, realizing spin-dependent broadband anti-reflection using time-varying chiral metamaterials remains underexplored. In this work, we propose a time-varying chiral structure composed of four temporal layers, each with distinct impedances and chiral parameters. By carefully adjusting these parameters across the layers, our structure enables broadband anti- reflection for both right- and left-circularly polarized (RCP and LCP) waves under small chiral conditions. Under large chiral parameters, the structure selectively achieves broadband anti- reflection for LCP waves, while consistently reflecting RCP waves across the bandwidth. This unique spin-dependent broadband anti-reflection results from significant phase delays between RCP and LCP waves, a feature not achievable by non-chiral, time-varying multilayer structures. Additionally, the proposed structure allows impedance matching between chiral and non-chiral dielectric spatial-temporal slabs in finite regions under small chiral parameters. These findings offer promising avenues for advanced wave manipulation in chiral metamaterials, with potential applications in broadband absorbers, filters, and quantum information processing systems.

TI Nonreciprocal Pancharatnam-Berry metasurface for unidirectional
   wavefront manipulations
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Optical metasurfaces employing the Pancharatnam-Berry (PB) geometric phase, called PB metasurfaces, have been extensively applied to realize spin-dependent light manipulations. However, the properties of conventional PB metasurfaces are intrinsically limited by the Lorentz reciprocity. Breaking reciprocity can give rise to new properties and phenomena unavailable in conventional reciprocal systems. Here, we propose a mechanism to realize nonreciprocal PB metasurfaces of subwavelength thickness by using the Faraday magneto-optical (FMO) effect of yttrium iron garnet (YIG) material in synergy with the PB geometric phase of spatially rotating meta-atoms. Using full-wave numerical simulations and multipole analysis, we show that the metasurface composed of dielectric cylinders and a thin YIG layer can achieve high isolation of circularly polarized lights, attributed to the enhancement of the magneto-optical effect by the resonant Mie modes and Fabry-P & eacute;rot (FP) cavity mode. In addition, the metasurface can enable unidirectional wavefront manipulations of circularly polarized lights, including nonreciprocal beam steering and nonreciprocal beam focusing. The results contribute to the understanding of the interplay between nonreciprocity and geometric phase in light manipulations and can find applications in optical communications, optical sensing, and quantum information processing.

TI Quantum Fisher information power of quantum evolutions
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS A-MATHEMATICAL AND THEORETICAL
AB Quantum metrology is an important field in quantum information and plays a crucial role in quantum parameter estimation. Quantum Fisher information (QFI) is widely used to characterize the precision of quantum parameter estimation. However, a full understanding of the precision for different parameterization processes and the role of quantum evolutions in quantum parameter estimations, remains a crucial area of research. In this paper, we introduce a new concept, named as quantum Fisher information power (QFI power), to characterize the QFI-creating capability of quantum evolutions. At the same time, we take both unitary and non-unitary evolutions as examples and study QFI power. The results show that: (i) For unitary evolutions described by spin angular momentum operators, the dynamic of QFI power is dependent on the z component of the Bloch vector, and the rotating angle; (ii) For non-unitary evolutions under decoherence channels, QFI cannot be enhanced when the initial probe state belongs to zero QFI set, and the QFI power is negative when the initial probe state has maximal QFI; (iii) For the PT - and APT -symmetric non-unitary evolutions, the dynamics of QFI power exhibit oscillations in symmetry unbroken regime, while the phenomenon of stable value (SV) occurs in broken regimes with the SV = 1.

TI Investigation of zero-phonon line characteristics in ensemble
   nitrogen-vacancy centers at 1.6 K-300 K
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB The ensemble of nitrogen -vacancy (NV) centers is widely used in quantum information transmission, high -precision magnetic field, and temperature sensing due to their advantages of long-lived state and the ability to be pumped by optical cycling. In this study, we investigate the zero -phonon line behavior of the two charge states of NV centers by measuring the photoluminescence of the NV center at 1.6 K-300 K. The results demonstrate a positional redshift, an increase in line width, and a decrease in fluorescence intensity for the ZPL of NV degrees and NV - as the temperature increased. In the range of 10 K to 140 K, the peak shift with high concentrations of NV - revealed an anomaly of bandgap reforming. The peak position undergoes a blueshift and then a redshift as temperature increases. Furthermore, the transformation between NV degrees and NV - with temperature changes has been obtained in diamonds with different nitrogen concentrations. This study explored the ZPL characteristics of NV centers in various temperatures, and the findings are significant for the development of high -resolution temperature sensing and high -precision magnetic field sensing in ensemble NV centers.

TI Preparation of non-Gaussian states based on three-photon quantum
   scissors
SO RESULTS IN PHYSICS
AB We investigate the properties of non-Gaussian quantum states generated by a three-photon quantum scissor (3-QS). Three different types of inputs to the 3-QS are considered: coherent state (CS), squeezed vacuum state (SVS), and optical field thermal state (TS). We discuss both the detection probability and fidelity of the output states. Our results demonstrate that when the input states have a smaller mean photon number, the output non-Gaussian state can exhibit high detection probability and high fidelity by selecting an appropriate transmissivity. Additionally, we calculate the Wigner functions for the various output states and analyze the non-classical properties by comparing the negative volume of the Wigner functions. The results indicate that the output non-Gaussian states display significant non-classical behavior, particularly when the transmissivity is high, with SVS as the input state showing the strongest effect. Moreover, we compare the performance of the 3 -QS with that of the two-photon quantum scissors (2-QS). The findings demonstrate that the non-Gaussian states prepared by the 3-QS possess stronger non-classical characteristics. These results have potential implications for advancing the practical application of the 3-QS in quantum information technology.

TI Entanglement entropies of an interval in the free Schrodinger field
   theory at finite density
SO JOURNAL OF HIGH ENERGY PHYSICS
AB We study the entanglement entropies of an interval on the infinite line in the free fermionic spinless Schrodinger field theory at finite density and zero temperature, which is a non-relativistic model with Lifshitz exponent z = 2. We prove that the entanglement entropies are finite functions of one dimensionless parameter proportional to the area of a rectangular region in the phase space determined by the Fermi momentum and the length of the interval. The entanglement entropy is a monotonically increasing function. By employing the properties of the prolate spheroidal wave functions of order zero or the asymptotic expansions of the tau function of the sine kernel, we find analytic expressions for the expansions of the entanglement entropies in the asymptotic regimes of small and large area of the rectangular region in the phase space. These expansions lead to prove that the analogue of the relativistic entropic C function is not monotonous. Extending our analyses to a class of free fermionic Lifshitz models labelled by their integer dynamical exponent z, we find that the parity of this exponent determines the properties of the bipartite entanglement for an interval on the line.

TI Confinement and Mott Transitions of Dynamical Charges in One-Dimensional
   Lattice Gauge Theories
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Confinement is an ubiquitous phenomenon when matter couples to gauge fields, which manifests itself in a linear string potential between two static charges. Although gauge fields can be integrated out in one dimension, they can mediate nonlocal interactions which in turn influence the paradigmatic Luttinger liquid properties. However, when the charges become dynamical and their densities finite, understanding confinement becomes challenging. Here we show that confinement in 1D Z(2) lattice gauge theories, with dynamical matter fields and arbitrary densities, is related to translational symmetry breaking in a nonlocal basis. The exact transformation to this string-length basis leads us to an exact mapping of Luttinger parameters reminiscent of a Luther-Emery rescaling. We include the effects of local, but beyond contact, interactions between the matter particles, and show that confined mesons can form a Mott-insulating state when the deconfined charges cannot. While the transition to the Mott state cannot be detected in the Green's function of the charges, we show that the metallic state is characterized by hidden off-diagonal quasi-long-range order. Our predictions provide new insights to the physics of confinement of dynamical charges, and can be experimentally addressed in Rydberg-dressed quantum gases in optical lattices.

TI Mitigate the variation of energy band gap with electric field induced by
   quantum confinement Stark effect via a gradient quantum system for
   frequency-stable laser diodes
SO NANOPHOTONICS
AB Most light-emitting devices based on quantum-confined structures are commonly utilized as electrically injected devices. However, the electric-field-dependent energy band gap induced by the quantum confinement Stark effect (QCSE) usually hinders the realization of frequency-stable laser devices. This is because the change in the energy band gap, which also means the corresponding change in the photon energy, will result in an electric-field-dependent frequency. Here, we propose a novel approach to mitigate this electric-field-dependent variation in the energy band gap by employing a gradient quantum system. In this system, the energy band edges are inclined due to the action of the indium (In)-segregation effect. This special design can effectively weaken the changes in the band profile associated with the electric field effect and counteract the electric-field-dependent band gap variations within the active region to a certain extent. Experimental studies indicate that the energy band gap of this gradient quantum system remains almost unchanged (<18.9 mu eV cm(2)/A) even under a relatively strong applied electric field. Meanwhile, compared with the traditional GaAs quantum well, the efficiency improvement in the band gap stability of our nanowire-well gradient system is 64.1 % and 70.6 % for the TE and TM polarization modes, respectively, which suggests that our proposed gradient quantum structure can significantly mitigate the electric-field-induced change in the energy band gap. This achievement is of great significance for advancing the development of high-performance frequency-stable laser devices in some advanced fields, such as quantum sensing systems and optical communications.

TI Exact Model Reduction for Continuous-Time Open Quantum Dynamics
SO QUANTUM
AB We consider finite-dimensional many-body quantum systems described by time-independent Hamiltonians and Markovian master equations, and present a systematic method for constructing smaller-dimensional, reduced models that exactly reproduce the time evolution of a set of initial conditions or observables of interest. Our approach exploits Krylov operator spaces and their extension to operator algebras, and may be used to obtain reduced linear models of minimal dimension, well-suited for simulation on classical computers, or reduced quantum models that preserve the structural constraints of physically admissible quantum dynamics, as required for simulation on quantum computers. Notably, we prove that the reduced quantum-dynamical generator is still in Lindblad form. By introducing a new type of observable-dependent symmetries, we show that our method provides a non-trivial generalization of techniques that leverage symmetries, unlocking new reduction opportunities. We quantitatively benchmark our method on paradigmatic open many-body systems of relevance to condensed-matter and quantum-information physics. In particular, we demonstrate how our reduced models can quantitatively describe decoherence dynamics in central-spin systems coupled to structured environments, magnetization transport in boundary-driven dissipative spin chains, and unwanted error dynamics on information encoded in a noiseless quantum code.

TI Quantum Private Set Intersection Scheme Based on Bell States
SO AXIOMS
AB In this paper, we introduce a quantum private set intersection (QPSI) scheme that leverages Bell states as quantum information carriers. Our approach involves encoding private sets into Bell states using unitary operations, enabling the computation of the intersection between two private sets from different users while keeping their individual sets undisclosed to anyone except for the intersection result. In our scheme, a semi-honest third party (TP) distributes the first and second qubits of the Bell states to the two users. Each user encodes their private sets by applying unitary operations on the received qubits according to predefined encoding rules. The modified sequence is encrypted and then sent back to TP, who can compute the set intersection without learning any information about the users' private inputs. The simulation outcomes on the IBM quantum platform substantiate the viability of our scheme. We analyze the security and privacy aspects of the sets, showing that both external attacks and internal threats do not compromise the security of the private inputs. Furthermore, our scheme exhibits better practicality by utilizing easily implementable Bell states and unitary operations, rather than relying on multiple encoded states for set intersection calculations.

AB Three-dimensional (3D) inorganic micro and nanostructures play an important role in photonics, quantum information, aerospace, energy, and other fields. Inorganic microstructures prepared using traditional methods usually exhibit low resolution and uncontrollable morphology. The precise and controllable fabrication of 3D inorganic micro and nanostructures is a critical problem. Because of advantages such as 3D fabrication capability, high precision, and controllable morphology, laser fabrication can realize the preparation of 3D, high-resolution, and multiscale micro and nanostructures; furthermore, it can address the problem of accurate and controllable preparation of these 3D structures. In this study, the research progress of laser fabrication of inorganic micro and nanostructures was reviewed. First, continuous wave and ultrafast pulse laser fabrication methods were discussed, and especially, the femtosecond laser fabrication of 3D systems, and polymer templates, were summarized. Further, the applications of 3D micro and nanostructures in optical devices, quantum chips, information storage, aerospace, and bionic structures in recent years were summarized. Finally, we highlighted the potential future development of the laser fabrication of 3D inorganic micro and nanostructures.

Light transcends the conventional landscape of electromagnetism, offering the possibility to tailor light in three dimensions (intermixing all three electric field components), in four-dimensional spacetime (for fields manifesting both temporal and spatial patterns), and, beyond that, to make structured quantum light, tuning its characteristics at an unprecedented new level of control. This article addresses the physical foundations of structured light, its interactions with matter, including the nonlinear regime and probing chirality, its classical benefits with holography as a specific highlight, and quantum mechanical applications. It describes the various applications connecting structured light with material physics, quantum information, and technology. Notably, we discuss weak measurements with structured light acting as the meter with connections to probing structured-light beam shifts at interfaces. Ultimately, revealing the interplay between structured light and matter opens attractive avenues for different new technologies and applications, covering both the classical and the quantum realms.

TI Scattering matrix for chiral harmonic generation and frequency mixing in
   nonlinear metasurfaces
SO JOURNAL OF OPTICS
AB We generalize the concept of optical scattering matrix (S-matrix) to characterize harmonic generation and frequency mixing in planar metasurfaces in the limit of undepleted pump approximation. We show that the symmetry properties of such nonlinear S-matrix are determined by the metasurface symmetries at the macroscopic and microscopic scale. We demonstrate that for description of degenerate frequency mixing processes such as optical harmonic generation, the multidimensional S-matrix can be replaced with a reduced two-dimensional S-matrix. We show that for metasurfaces possessing specific point group symmetries, the selection rules determining the transformation of the reduced nonlinear S-matrix are simplified substantially and can be expressed in a compact form. We apply the developed approach to analyze chiral harmonic generation in nonlinear metasurfaces with various symmetries including rotational, inversion, in-plane mirror, and out-of-plane mirror symmetries. For each of those symmetries, we confirm the results of the developed analysis by full-wave numerical calculations. We believe our results provide a new paradigm for engineering nonlinear optical properties of metasurfaces which may find applications in active and nonlinear optics, biosensing, and quantum information processing.

TI Deep photonic network platform enabling arbitrary and broadband optical
   functionality
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Expanding applications in optical communications, computing, and sensing continue to drive the need for high-performance integrated photonic components. Designing these on-chip systems with arbitrary functionality requires beyond what is possible with physical intuition, for which machine learning-based methods have recently become popular. However, computational demands for physically accurate device simulations present critical challenges, significantly limiting scalability and design flexibility of these methods. Here, we present a highly-scalable, physics-informed design platform for on-chip optical systems with arbitrary functionality, based on deep photonic networks of custom-designed Mach-Zehnder interferometers. Leveraging this platform, we demonstrate ultra-broadband power splitters and a spectral duplexer, each designed within two minutes. The devices exhibit state-of-the-art experimental performance with insertion losses below 0.66 dB, and 1-dB bandwidths exceeding 120 nm. This platform provides a tractable path towards systematic, large-scale photonic system design, enabling custom power, phase, and dispersion profiles for high-throughput communications, quantum information processing, and medical/biological sensing applications.
   An efficient and physically accurate platform is required to rapidly design high-performance integrated photonic devices. Here, the authors present a scalable framework for creating on-chip optical systems with complex and arbitrary functionality.

TI Trade-off relations of quantum resource theory in neutrino oscillations
SO EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL PLUS
AB The violation of the classical bounds imposed by Leggett-Garg inequalities has tested the quantumness of neutrino oscillations (NOs) over a long distance during the propagation. The measure of quantumness in experimentally observed NOs is studied via quantum resource theory (QRT). Here, we focus on the trade-off relations of QRT in the three-flavor NOs, based on Bell-type violations, first-order coherence and intrinsic concurrence, and the relative entropy of coherence. For the electron and muon antineutrino oscillations, the analytical trade-off relations obeyed by the Bell-CHSH inequality of pairwise flavor states in this three-flavor neutrino system are obtained; the sum of the maximal violation of the CHSH tests for three pairwise flavor states is less than or equal to 12. Moreover, there exists an equality relation concerning first-order coherence and intrinsic concurrence in NOs, showing how much quantum resources flow between first-order coherence and intrinsic concurrence during the neutrino propagation. In addition, it is found that the tripartite coherence of three-flavor system is equal to or larger than the sum of the coherence of reduced bipartite flavor states. The trade-off relations of QRT provide a method for studying how the quantum resources convert and distribute in NOs, which might inspire the future applications in quantum information processing using neutrinos.

TI Dynamical Behavior of Two Interacting Double Quantum Dots in 2D
   Materials for Feasibility of Controlled-NOT Operation
SO NANOMATERIALS
AB Two interacting double quantum dots (DQDs) can be suitable candidates for operation in the applications of quantum information processing and computation. In this work, DQDs are modeled by the heterostructure of two-dimensional (2D) MoS2 having 1T-phase embedded in 2H-phase with the aim to investigate the feasibility of controlled-NOT (CNOT) gate operation with the Coulomb interaction. The Hamiltonian of the system is constructed by two models, namely the 2D electronic potential model and the 4 x 4 matrix model whose matrix elements are computed from the approximated two-level systems interaction. The dynamics of states are carried out by the Crank-Nicolson method in the potential model and by the fourth order Runge-Kutta method in the matrix model. Model parameters are analyzed to optimize the CNOT operation feasibility and fidelity, and investigate the behaviors of DQDs in different regimes. Results from both models are in excellent agreement, indicating that the constructed matrix model can be used to simulate dynamical behaviors of two interacting DQDs with lower computational resources. For CNOT operation, the two DQD systems with the Coulomb interaction are feasible, though optimization of engineering parameters is needed to achieve optimal fidelity.

TI Kinetically Constrained Quantum Dynamics in Superconducting Circuits
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB We study the dynamical properties of the bosonic quantum East model at low temperature. We show that a naive generalization of the corresponding spin-1/2 quantum East model does not possess analogous slow dynamical properties. In particular, conversely to the spin case, the bosonic ground state turns out to be not localized. We restore localization by introducing a repulsive interaction term. The bosonic nature of the model allows us to construct rich families of many-body localized states, including coherent, squeezed, and cat states. We formalize this finding by introducing a set of superbosonic creation-annihilation operators that satisfy the bosonic commutation relations and, when acting on the vacuum, create excitations that are exponentially localized around a certain site of the lattice. Given the constrained nature of the model, these states retain memory of their initial conditions for long times. Even in the presence of dissipation, we show that quantum information remains localized within decoherence times that are tunable with the parameters of the system. We propose an implementation of the bosonic quantum East model based on state-of-the-art superconducting circuits, which could be used in the near future to explore the dynamical properties of kinetically constrained models in modern platforms.

TI Geometry of quantum complexity
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
AB Computational complexity is a quantum information concept that recently has found applications in the holographic understanding of the black hole interior. We consider quantum computational complexity for n qubits using Nielsen's geometrical approach. In the definition of complexity there is a big amount of arbitrariness due to the choice of the penalty factors, which parametrizes the cost of the elementary computational gates. In order to reproduce desired features in holography, such as ergodicity and exponential maximal complexity for large number of qubits n, negative curvatures are required. With the simplest choice of penalties, this is achieved at the price of singular sectional curvatures in the large n limit. We investigate a choice of penalties in which we can obtain negative curvatures in a smooth way. We also analyze the relation between operator and state complexities, framing the discussion with the language of Riemannian submersions. This provides a direct relation between geodesics and curvatures in the unitaries and the states spaces, which we also exploit to give a closed-form expression for the metric on the states in terms of the one for the operators. Finally, we study conjugate points for a large number of qubits in the unitary space and we provide a strong indication that maximal complexity scales exponentially with the number of qubits in a certain regime of the penalties space.

TI Electric current paths in a Si:P delta-doped device imaged by
   nitrogen-vacancy diamond magnetic microscopy
SO NANOTECHNOLOGY
AB The recently-developed ability to control phosphorous-doping of silicon at an atomic level using scanning tunneling microscopy, a technique known as atomic precision advanced manufacturing (APAM), has allowed us to tailor electronic devices with atomic precision, and thus has emerged as a way to explore new possibilities in Si electronics. In these applications, critical questions include where current flow is actually occurring in or near APAM structures as well as whether leakage currents are present. In general, detection and mapping of current flow in APAM structures are valuable diagnostic tools to obtain reliable devices in digital-enhanced applications. In this paper, we used nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond for wide-field magnetic imaging (with a few-mm field of view and micron-scale resolution) of magnetic fields from surface currents flowing in an APAM test device made of a P delta-doped layer on a Si substrate, a standard APAM witness material. We integrated a diamond having a surface NV ensemble with the device (patterned in two parallel mm-sized ribbons), then mapped the magnetic field from the DC current injected in the APAM device in a home-built NV wide-field microscope. The 2D magnetic field maps were used to reconstruct the surface current densities, allowing us to obtain information on current paths, device failures such as choke points where current flow is impeded, and current leakages outside the APAM-defined P-doped regions. Analysis on the current density reconstructed map showed a projected sensitivity of similar to 0.03 A m(-1), corresponding to a smallest-detectable current in the 200 mu m wide APAM ribbon of similar to 6 mu A. These results demonstrate the failure analysis capability of NV wide-field magnetometry for APAM materials, opening the possibility to investigate other cutting-edge microelectronic devices.

TI Decoherence induced by dipole-dipole couplings between atomic species in
   rare earth ion doped Y2SiO5
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB Rare earth ion doped crystals are state-of-the-art platforms for processing quantum information, particularly thanks to their excellent optical and spin coherence properties at cryogenic temperatures. Experimental observations have shown that the application of a static magnetic bias field significantly improves the coherence times in the rare earth ions ensemble, but only a few studies have focused on its dependency as a function of both magnetic field direction and amplitude. This is especially true for magnetic field amplitudes under the mT, and for low magnetic dipole moment ions. In this paper, we investigate the relationship between the magnetic field parameters and the decoherence caused by magnetic dipole-dipole coupling with the nearest-neighbor nuclear spins in the crystal. The primary non-Kramers rare earth ions investigated here are europium and praseodymium, but we also extend our study to the ytterbium Kramers ion due to its low magnetic dipole in the mT range. We perform theoretical investigations and simulations of the energy structure and coherence time evolution and identify good correspondences between experimental and simulated spin echo data. This work allows us to pinpoint the most relevant decoherence mechanisms in the considered magnetic field regime, and to predict favorable magnetic configurations.

TI Influence of temperature, doping, and amorphization on the electronic
   structure and magnetic damping of iron
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB Hybrid magnonic quantum systems have drawn increased attention in recent years for coherent quantum information processing, but too large magnetic damping is a persistent concern when metallic magnets are used. Their intrinsic damping is largely determined by electron-magnon scattering induced by spin-orbit interactions. In the low-scattering limit, damping is dominated by intraband electronic transitions, which has been theoretically shown to be proportional to the electronic density of states at the Fermi level. In this work, we focus on body-centered-cubic iron as a paradigmatic ferromagnetic material. We comprehensively study its electronic structure using first-principles density functional theory simulations and account for finite lattice temperature, boron (B) doping, and structure amorphization. Our results indicate that temperature-induced atomic disorder and amorphous atomic geometries only have a minor influence. Instead, boron doping noticeably decreases the density of states near the Fermi level with an optimal doping level of 6.25%. In addition, we show that this reduction varies significantly for different atomic geometries and report that the highest reduction correlates with a large magnetization of the material. This may suggest materials growth under external magnetic fields as a route to explore in experiment.

TI Steady-state phases and interaction-induced depletion in a
   driven-dissipative chirally-coupled dissimilar atomic array
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB A nanophotonic waveguide coupled with an atomic array forms one of the strongly coupled quantum interfaces to showcase many fascinating collective features of quantum dynamics. In particular, for a dissimilar array of two different interparticle spacings with competing photon-mediated dipole-dipole interactions and directionality of couplings, we study the steady-state phases of atomic excitations under a weakly driven condition of laser field. We identify a partial set of steady-state phases of the driven system composed of combinations of steady-state solutions in a homogeneous array. We also reveal the intricate role of the atom at the interface of the dissimilar array in determining the steady-state phases and find an alteration in the dichotomy of the phases strongly associated with steady-state distributions with crystalline orders. We further investigate in detail the interaction-induced depletion in half of the dissimilar array, where the blockaded region results from two contrasting interparticle spacings near the reciprocal coupling regime. This can be further evidenced from the analytical solutions under the reciprocal coupling. Our results can provide insights in the driven-dissipative quantum phases of atomic excitations with nonreciprocal couplings and pave the avenues toward quantum simulations of exotic many-body states essential for quantum information applications.

TI Optical control and coherent coupling of spin diffusive modes in thermal
   gases
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Quantum science and technology devices exploiting collective spins in thermal gases are extremely appealing due to their simplicity and robustness. This comes at the cost of dealing with the random thermal motion of the atoms which is usually an uncontrolled source of decoherence and noise. There are however conditions, for example, when diffusing in a buffer gas, where thermal atoms can occupy a discrete set of stable spatial modes. Diffusive modes can be extended or localized, have different magnetic properties depending on boundary conditions, and can react differently to external perturbations. Here, we selectively excite, manipulate, and interrogate the longest -lived of these modes by using laser light. In particular, we identify the conditions for the generation of modes that are exceptionally resilient to detrimental effects such as light induced frequency shifts and power -broadening, which are often the dominant sources of systematic errors in atomic magnetometers and comagnetometers. Moreover, we show that the presence of spatial inhomogeneities in the pump introduces a coupling that leads to a coherent exchange of excitation between the two longest -lived modes. Our results demonstrate that systematic engineering of the multi -mode nature of diffusive gases has great potential for improving the performance of quantum sensors based on alkali -metal thermal vapors, and opens new perspectives for quantum information applications.

TI Arkhipov's theorem, graph minors, and linear system nonlo cal games
SO ALGEBRAIC COMBINATORICS
AB The perfect quantum strategies of a linear system game correspond to certain representations of its solution group. We study the solution groups of graph incidence games, which are linear system games in which the underlying linear system is the incidence system of a (non-properly) two-coloured graph. While it is undecidable to determine whether a general linear system game has a perfect quantum strategy, for graph incidence games this problem is solved by Arkhipov's theorem, which states that the graph incidence game of a connected graph has a perfect quantum strategy if and only if it either has a perfect classical strategy, or the graph is nonplanar. Arkhipov's criterion can be rephrased as a forbidden minor condition on connected two-coloured graphs. We extend Arkhipov's theorem by showing that, for graph incidence games of connected two-coloured graphs, every quotient closed property of the solution group has a forbidden minor characterization. We rederive Arkhipov's theorem from the group theoretic point of view, and then find the forbidden minors for two new properties: finiteness and abelianness. Our methods are entirely combinatorial, and finding the forbidden minors for other quotient closed properties seems to be an interesting combinatorial problem.

TI Photonic Jet Writing of Quantum Dots Self-Aligned to Dielectric
   Microspheres
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB Owing to their ability to generate non-classical light states, quantum dots (QDs) are very promising candidates for the large-scale implementation of quantum information technologies. However, the high photon collection efficiency demanded by these technologies may be impossible to reach for "standalone" semiconductor QDs, embedded in a high-refractive index medium. In this work a novel laser writing technique is presented, enabling the direct fabrication of a QD self-aligned-with a precision of +/- 30 nm-to a dielectric microsphere. The presence of the microsphere leads to an enhancement of the QD luminescence collection by a factor 7.3 +/- 0.7 when an objective with 0.7 numerical aperture is employed. This technique exploits the possibility of breaking the N-H bonds in GaAs1-xN(x):H by a laser light, obtaining a lower-bandgap material, GaAs1-xN(x). The microsphere, deposited on top of a GaAs1-xN(x):H/GaAs quantum well, is used to generate a photonic nanojet, which removes hydrogen exactly below the microsphere, creating a GaAs1-xN(x) QD at a predefined distance from the sample surface. Second-order autocorrelation measurements confirm the ability of the QDs obtained with this technique to emit single photons.

TI Scrambling in Ising spin systems with periodic transverse magnetic
   fields
SO EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL D
AB Scrambling of quantum information in both integrable and nonintegrable Floquet spin systems is studied. Our study employs tripartite mutual information (TMI), with negative TMI serving as an indicator of scrambling, where a more negative value suggests a higher degree of scrambling. Both integrable and nonintegrable Floquet systems display scrambling behavior across all periods lying between 0 and pi/2\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$\pi /2$$\end{document}, except at self-dual point (pi/4)\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$(\pi /4)$$\end{document}. Nonintegrable Floquet systems exhibit more pronounced scrambling compared to integrable ones across all periods. The degree of scrambling increases as we move toward the self-dual point (but not at the self-dual point), regardless of the initial states. TMI demonstrates periodic behavior at the self-dual point, with a period matching the system size in the case of the integrable system while displaying complex patterns in the nonintegrable system. The initial growth of scrambling in both integrable and nonintegrable Floquet systems manifests as a power-law increase for small periods, followed by a sudden jump in scrambling near the self-dual point.

TI Optical readout of singlet fission biexcitons in a heteroacene with
   photoluminescence detected magnetic resonance
SO JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS
AB Molecular spin systems based on photoexcited triplet pairs formed via singlet fission (SF) are attractive as carriers of quantum information because of their potentially pure and controllable spin polarization, but developing systems that offer optical routes to readout as well as initialization is challenging. Herein, we characterize the electron spin magnetic resonance change in the photoluminescence intensity for a tailored organic molecular crystal while sweeping a microwave drive up to 10 GHz in a broadband loop structure. We observe resonant transitions for both triplet and quintet spin sublevel populations showing their optical sensitivity and revealing the zero-field parameters for each. We map the evolution of these spectra in both microwave frequency and magnetic field, producing a pattern of optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) peaks. Fits to these data using a suitable model suggest significant spin polarization in this system with orientation selectivity. Unusual excitation intensity dependence is also observed, which inverts the sign of the ODMR signal for the triplet features, but not for the quintet. These observations demonstrate optical detection of the spin sublevel population dictated by SF and intermolecular geometry, and highlight anisotropic and multi-scale dynamics of triplet pairs.

TI Plasmon-Enhanced Photo-Luminescence Emission in Hybrid Metal-Perovskite
   Nanowires
SO NANOMATERIALS
AB Semiconductor photonic nanowires are critical components for nanoscale light manipulation in integrated photonic and electronic devices. Optimizing their optical performance requires enhanced photon conversion efficiency, for which a promising solution is to combine semiconductors with noble metals, using the surface plasmon resonance of noble metals to enhance the photon absorption efficiency. Here, we report plasmon-enhanced light emission in a hybrid nanowire device composed of perovskite semiconductor nanowires and silver nanoparticles formed using superfluid helium droplets. A cesium lead halide perovskite-based four-layer structure (CsPbBr3/PMMA/Ag/Si) effectively reduces the metal's plasmonic losses while ensuring efficient surface plasmon-photon coupling at moderate power. Microphotoluminescence and time-resolved spectroscopy techniques are used to investigate the optical properties and emission dynamics of carriers and excitons within the hybrid device. Our results demonstrate an intensity enhancement factor of 29 compared with pure semiconductor structures at 4 K, along with enhanced carrier recombination dynamics due to plasmonic interactions between silver nanoparticles and perovskite nanowires. This work advances existing approaches for exciting photonic nanowires at low photon densities, with potential applications in optimizing single-photon excitations and emissions for quantum information processing.

TI Minimal operational theories: classical theories with quantum features
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB We introduce a class of probabilistic theories, termed Minimal Strongly Causal Operational Probabilistic Theories, where system dynamics are constrained to the minimal set of operations consistent with the set of states and permitting conditional tests. Specifically, the allowed instruments are limited to those derived from compositions of preparations, measurements, swap transformations, and conditional operations. We demonstrate that minimal theories with conditioning and a spanning set of non-separable states satisfy two quantum no-go theorems: no-information without disturbance and no-broadcasting. As a key example, we construct Minimal Strongly Causal Bilocal Classical Theory, a classical toy-theory that lacks incompatible measurements, preparation uncertainty relations, and is noncontextual (both Kochen-Specker and generalised), yet exhibits irreversibility of measurement disturbance, no-information without disturbance, and no-broadcasting. Therefore, the latter three properties cannot be understood per se as signatures of non-classicality. We further explore distinctions between a theory and its minimal strongly causal counterpart, showing that while the minimal strongly causal version of quantum theory diverges from full quantum theory, the same does not hold for classical theory. Additionally, we establish the pairwise independence of the properties of simpliciality, strong causality, and local discriminability.

TI Vectorial polaritons in the quantum motion of a levitated nanosphere
SO NATURE PHYSICS
AB The strong coupling between photons and bosonic excitations in matter produces hybrid quasiparticle states known as polaritons(1-3). Their signature is the avoided crossing between the eigenfrequencies of the coupled system illustrated by the Jaynes-Cummings Hamiltonian(4). It has been observed in quantum electrodynamics experiments based on atoms(5,6), ions(7), excitons(8-10), spin ensembles(11,12) and superconducting qubits(13). In cavity optomechanics, polariton modes originate from the quantum-coherent coupling of a macroscopic mechanical vibration to the cavity radiation field(14,15). Here we investigate polaritonic modes in the motion of an optically levitated nanosphere(16-22) in the quantum-coherent coupling regime. The particle is trapped in a high vacuum by an optical tweezer and strongly coupled to a single cavity mode by coherent scattering of the tweezer photons(23-27). The two-dimensional motion and optical cavity mode define an optomechanical system with three degrees of freedom. In the strong-coupling regime, we observe hybrid light-mechanical states with a vectorial nature. Our results pave the way towards protocols for quantum information transfer between photonic and phononic components and represent a step towards the demonstration of optomechanical entangled states at room temperature.

TI Research process and hotspot prediction of deep-hole presplitting
   blasting technology in China's mines
SO GEOMECHANICS AND GEOPHYSICS FOR GEO-ENERGY AND GEO-RESOURCES
AB The concept and mechanism of the deep-hole presplitting blasting are expounded in detail. Based on China's annual coal production data and the number of papers published on the theme of deep-hole presplitting blasting, the research process of deep-hole presplitting blasting is divided into the early exploration stage (1978-2000), the rapid development stage (2001-2014) and the stable development stage (2015-2024). Based on bibliometrics methods and CiteSpace software, the research hotspots and development trends in the field of deep-hole pre-splitting blasting are discussed. The ARIMA time series prediction model was used to predict the number of publications of the eight main keywords related to the deep-hole Presplitting Blasting from 2025 to 2029, and future high-heat research directions was proposed. The research progress of the deep-hole presplitting blasting in China is systematically summarized from three aspects: theoretical research, experimental research and key parameter research. Combined with the research status and development trend, it is believed that future research should focus on three core directions: first, at the theoretical level, it is necessary to develop the thermal-fluid-solid-chemical multi-field coupling dynamic fracture models, an intelligent machine learning-based blasting parameter design system and dynamic correction models for deep complex media, focusing on the development of nonlinear dynamic modeling and intelligent blasting theory systems. Secondly, in the field of experimental technology, it is necessary to build a high-temperature, high-pressure, seepage-stress multi-field coupling platform, integrate quantum sensing and digital twin technologies, realize microsecond-scale crack propagation monitoring and bionic charging control, and simultaneously develop low-detonation-velocity environmental protection explosives and degradable energy-gathering materials. Third, the engineering technology direction should promote dynamic optimization of the deep-hole presplitting blasting parameters and research and development of extreme geological adaptability technologies.

TI Creation of NV Centers in Diamond under 155 MeV Electron Irradiation
SO ADVANCED PHYSICS RESEARCH
AB Single-crystal diamond substrates presenting a high concentration of negatively charged nitrogen-vacancy centers (NV-) are on high demand for the development of optically pumped solid-state sensors such as magnetometers, thermometers, or electrometers. While nitrogen impurities can be easily incorporated during crystal growth, the creation of vacancies requires further treatment. Electron irradiation and annealing is often chosen in this context, offering advantages with respect to irradiation by heavier particles that negatively affect the crystal lattice structure and consequently the NV- optical and spin properties. A thorough investigation of electron irradiation possibilities is needed to optimize the process and improve the sensitivity of NV-based sensors. In this work, the effect of electron irradiation is examined in a previously unexplored regime: extremely high energy electrons, at 155 MeV. A simulation model is developed to estimate the concentration of created vacancies and an increase of NV- concentration by more than three orders of magnitude following irradiation of a nitrogen-rich HPHT diamond over a very large sample volume is experimentally demonstrated, which translates into an important gain in sensitivity. Moreover, the impact of electron irradiation in this peculiar regime on other figures of merits relevant for NV sensing is discussed, including charge state conversion efficiency and spin relaxation time. Finally, the effect of extremely high energy irradiation is compared with the more conventional low energy irradiation process, employing 200 keV electrons from a transmission electron microscope, for different substrates and irradiation fluences, evidencing 60-fold higher yield of vacancy creation per electron at 155 MeV.

TI Single-photon emitters in WSe2: Critical role of phonons on excitation
   schemes and indistinguishability
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB Within optical quantum information processing, single-photon sources based on a two-level system in a semiconductor material allow for on-demand generation of single photons. To initiate the spontaneous emission process, it is necessary to efficiently populate the excited state. However, reconciling the requirement for on-demand excitation with both high efficiency and high photon indistinguishability remains a challenge due to the presence of charge noise and phonon-induced decoherence in the solid-state environment. Here, we reconstruct the phonon spectral density experienced by WSe2 quantum emitters in the emission process, and we use this information to theoretically analyze the performance of the resonant, phonon-assisted, and Swing-UP of the quantum EmitteR population (SUPER) excitation schemes. Under resonant excitation, we obtain an exciton preparation fidelity limited to 0.80 by the strong phonon coupling, which improves to 0.96 for the SUPER scheme (or 0.89, depending on the type of emitter considered). Under near-resonant phonon-assisted excitation, our theory predicts near-unity excitation fidelity up to 0.976 (0.997). Additionally, we demonstrate that, assuming the suppression of the phonon sidebands, residual dephasing mechanisms such as charge and spin fluctuations are the dominating decoherence mechanisms undermining the photon indistinguishability.

TI Room Temperature Polariton Condensation from Whispering Gallery Modes in
   CsPbBr3 Microplatelets
SO ADVANCED MATERIALS
AB Room temperature (RT) polariton condensate holds exceptional promise for revolutionizing various fields of science and technology, encompassing optoelectronics devices to quantum information processing. Using perovskite materials, like all-inorganic cesium lead bromide (CsPbBr3) single crystal, provides additional advantages, such as ease of synthesis, cost-effectiveness, and compatibility with existing semiconductor technologies. In this work, the formation of whispering gallery modes (WGM) in CsPbBr3 single crystals with controlled geometry is shown, synthesized using a low-cost and efficient capillary bridge method. Through the implementation of microplatelets geometry, enhanced optical properties and performance are achieved due to the presence of sharp edges and a uniform surface, effectively avoiding non-radiative scattering losses caused by defects. This allows not only to observe strong light matter coupling and formation of whispering gallery polaritons, but also to demonstrate the onset of polariton condensation at RT. This investigation not only contributes to the advancement of the knowledge concerning the exceptional optical properties of perovskite-based polariton systems, but also unveils prospects for the exploration of WGM polariton condensation within the framework of a 3D perovskite-based platform, working at RT. The unique characteristics of polariton condensate, including low excitation thresholds and ultrafast dynamics, open up unique opportunities for advancements in photonics and optoelectronics devices.

TI Generation of visible Raman operation laser by a fiber electro-optical
   modulator feedback loop
SO CHINESE OPTICS LETTERS
AB Phase -coherent multi -tone lasers play a critical role in atomic, molecular, and optical physics. Among them, the Raman opeartion laser for manipulating atomic hyperfine qubits requires gigahertz bandwidth and low phase noise to retain long-term coherence. Raman operation lasers generated by directly modulated and frequency-multipled infrared lasers are compact and stable but lack feedback control to actively suppress the phase noise, which limits their performance in practical applications. In this work, we employ a fiber electro-optical modulator driven by a voltage -controlled oscillator (VCO) to modulate a monochromatic laser and employ a second -harmonic generation process to convert it to the visible domain, where the beat note of the Raman operation laser is stabilized by controlling the output frequency of VCO with a digital phase -locked loop (PLL). The low -frequency phase noise is effectively suppressed compared to the scheme without active feedback and it reaches -80 dBc = Hz@5 kHz with a 20 kHz loop bandwidth. Furthermore, this compact and robust scheme effectively reduces the system 's complexity and cost, which is promising for extensive application in atomic, molecular, and optical physics.

TI Hexagonal Boron Nitride on III-V Compounds: A Review of the Synthesis
   and Applications
SO MATERIALS
AB Since the successful separation of graphene from its bulk counterpart, two-dimensional (2D) layered materials have become the focus of research for their exceptional properties. The layered hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN), for instance, offers good lubricity, electrical insulation, corrosion resistance, and chemical stability. In recent years, the wide-band-gap layered h-BN has been recognized for its broad application prospects in neutron detection and quantum information processing. In addition, it has become very important in the field of 2D crystals and van der Waals heterostructures due to its versatility as a substrate, encapsulation layer, and a tunneling barrier layer for various device applications. However, due to the poor adhesion between h-BN and substrate and its high preparation temperature, it is very difficult to prepare large-area and denseh-BN films. Therefore, the controllable synthesis of h-BN films has been the focus of research in recent years. In this paper, the preparation methods and applications of h-BN films on III-V compounds are systematically summarized, and the prospects are discussed.

TI Electric fields and substrates dramatically accelerate spin relaxation
   in graphene
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB Electrons in graphene are theoretically expected to retain spin states much longer than most materials, making graphene a promising platform for spintronics and quantum information technologies. Here, we use first-principles density-matrix (FPDM) dynamics simulations to show that interaction with electric fields and substrates strongly enhances spin relaxation through scattering with phonons. Consequently, the relaxation time at room temperature reduces from microseconds in free-standing graphene to nanoseconds in graphene on the hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) substrate, which is the order of magnitude typically measured in experiments. Further, inversion symmetry breaking by hBN introduces a stronger asymmetry in electron and hole spin lifetimes than predicted by the conventional D???yakonov-Perel??? (DP) model for spin relaxation. Deviations from the conventional DP model are stronger for in-plane spin relaxation, resulting in out-of-plane to in-plane lifetime ratios much greater than 1/2 with a maximum close to the Dirac point. These FPDM results, independent of symmetry-specific assumptions or material-dependent parameters, also validate recent modifications of the DP model to explain such deviations. Overall, our results indicate that spin-phonon relaxation in the presence of substrates may be more important in graphene than typically assumed, requiring consideration for graphenebased spin technologies at room temperature.

TI Formalization of Bohr's Contextuality Within the Theory of Open Quantum
   Systems
SO JOURNAL OF RUSSIAN LASER RESEARCH
AB In quantum physics, the notion of contextuality has a variety of interpretations, which are typically associated with the names of their inventors, say, Bohr, Bell, Kochen, Specker, and recently Dzhafarov. In fact, Bohr was the first who pointed to contextuality of quantum measurements as a part of formulation of his principle of complementarity. (Instead of "contextuality," he considered dependence on "experimental conditions.") Unfortunately, the contextuality counterpart of the complementarity principle was overshadowed by the issue of incompatibility of observables. The interest for contextuality of quantum measurements rose again only in connection with the Bell inequality. The original Bohr's contextuality, as contextuality of each quantum measurement, was practically forgotten. It was highlighted in our works with applications both to physics and cognition. In this note, the theory of open quantum systems is applied to formalization of Bohr's contextuality within the framework of indirect measurements. This scheme is widely used in quantum information theory and leads to the Davis-Lewis-Ozawa theory of quantum instruments. In this scheme, Bohr's viewpoint on contextuality of quantum measurements is represented within the formal mathematical framework.

TI A weakly-interacting many-body system of Rydberg polaritons based on
   electromagnetically induced transparency
SO COMMUNICATIONS PHYSICS
AB The combination of Rydberg atoms and electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) has been extensively studied in the strong-interaction regime. Here we proposed utilizing an EIT medium with a high optical depth (OD) and a Rydberg state of low principal quantum number to create a many-body system of Rydberg polaritons in the weak-interaction regime. The phase shift and attenuation induced by the dipole-dipole interaction (DDI) were still significant, and can be viewed as the consequences of elastic and inelastic collisions among Rydberg polaritons. We further observed that the width of the transverse momentum distribution of Rydberg polaritons at the exit of the system became notably smaller as compared with that at the entrance. The observation demonstrates the cooling effect in this system. The mu s-long interaction time due to the high-OD EIT medium plus the mu m(2)-size collision cross section due to the DDI suggests a feasible platform of polariton Bose-Einstein condensation.
   Rydberg-state atoms are characterized by significant dipole-dipole interaction making them useful for quantum information applications. The authors present experimental results on a high-optical-depth electromagnetically-induced-transparency medium of weakly interacting Rydberg atoms as a way of realizing Bose-Einstein condensates of polaritons.

TI Engineering topological phase transition and Aharonov-Bohm caging in a
   flux-staggered lattice
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS-CONDENSED MATTER
AB A tight binding network of diamond shaped unit cells trapping a staggered magnetic flux distribution is shown to exhibit a topological phase transition under a controlled variation of the flux trapped in a cell. A simple real space decimation technique maps a binary flux staggered network into an equivalent Su-Shrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model. In this way, dealing with a subspace of the full degrees of freedom, we show that a topological phase transition can be initiated by tuning the applied magnetic field that eventually simulates an engineering of the numerical values of the overlap integrals in the paradigmatic SSH model. Thus one can use an external agent, rather than monitoring the intrinsic property of a lattice to control the topological properties. This is advantageous from an experimental point of view. We also provide an in-depth description and analysis of the topologically protected edge states, and discuss how, by tuning the flux from outside one can enhance the spatial extent of the Aharonov-Bohm caging of single particle states for any arbitrary period of staggering. This feature can be useful for the study of transport of quantum information. Our results are exact.

TI Topological Harmonic Generation of Nonlinear Optical Skyrmions
SO ULTRAFAST SCIENCE
AB Skyrmions are quasi-particles with a topologically stable structure, having widespread relevance in fields like condensed matter physics, plasmonics, and photonics. Initially proposed to describe baryons and atomic nuclei, they have since been extensively studied in spintronic devices for their unique magnetic properties. Recently, the exploration of optical skyrmions generation and their interaction of matters has attracted wide interest in optics and photonics. Previous studies have been mostly limited in the linear optical regime. The nonlinear interaction and topological transformation of optical skyrmions with matters has not been well explored. In this work, we report the second and third nonlinear harmonic generation driven by optical skyrmions by interacting with crystals possessing different rotational symmetries. We demonstrate the nonlinear transformation of optical skyrmions with different topological charges in solids. The nonlinear optical harmonic skyrmions are formed with coherent superpositions of higher-order skyrmions, allowing conversions between skyrmions and anti-skyrmions. A quantum urn model is introduced to explain the generation of low-order and high-order harmonic skyrmions. This work presents the nonlinear interaction of the topological light fields with crystalline symmetry and provides novel insights into the efficient generation and robust control of the harmonics of skyrmions. It has implications on the application of secure communication, precise metrology, and quantum information.

TI Polarization-Locked Floquet Higher-Order Topological Insulators in
   Synthetic Dimension
SO LASER & PHOTONICS REVIEWS
AB Floquet engineering provides a powerful tool for exploring topological physics. Systems incorporating Floquet driving can exhibit intriguing topological phenomena without correspondence with static counterparts. Recently, following the development of higher-order topology, Floquet higher-order topological insulators have drawn great attention since its peculiarity in the band structure and topological states. Here the higher-order topological insulator is theoretically demonstrated via Floquet engineering in synthetic frequency dimension. To this end, a 1D Floquet topological insulator is first constructed by introducing periodic driving to the frequency lattice, and the corresponding 0 and pi edge states are demonstrated. On this basis, a Floquet higher-order topological insulator supporting 0 and pi corner states is realized by stacking the chains of the 1D Floquet topological insulators with dimerized couplings. Particularly, it is found that the distributions of 0 and pi modes occupy the frequency lattices with orthogonal polarizations, which indicate polarization-locked topological states and enable selective excitation of the topological edge/corner states with specific polarizations. This work lays the foundation for realizing controllable Floquet systems and opens an avenue for exploring higher-order topological physics with synthetic dimension, which shows great promise for applications in polarization conversion and quantum information processing.

TI Experimental characterization of Spherical Bragg Resonators for
   electromagnetic emission engineering at microwave frequencies
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB This work reports experimental investigation and numerical validation of millimeter-sized Spherical Bragg Resonators (SBRs) fabricated using 3D printing technology. The frequency dependencies of the reflection and transmission coefficients were analyzed, and eigenfrequency values were calculated to examine the density of photonic states in air/PLA-polylactide SBRs, showing the appearance of an eigenmode and an increase in the local density of states in the core of a defect cavity. A decay rate enhancement of similar to 10(2) was obtained for a dipole placed in the core of the defect SBR. The study also investigated the influence of the source position on the resonator's electromagnetic wave energy. Scattering efficiencies up to order twelve of the multipole electric and magnetic contribution in a 10-layer SBR were calculated to validate the presence of the resonant modes observed in the scattering measurements performed for parallel and perpendicular polarizations. The results demonstrate that SBRs can act as omnidirectional cavities to enhance or inhibit spontaneous emission processes by modifying the density of electromagnetic states compared to free space. This finding highlights the potential of SBRs engineering spontaneous electromagnetic emission processes in various applications, including dielectric nanoantennas, optoelectronics devices, and quantum information across the entire electromagnetic spectrum.

TI Nanoscale imaging of super-high-frequency microelectromechanical
   resonators with femtometer sensitivity
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Implementing microelectromechanical system (MEMS) resonators calls for detailed microscopic understanding of the devices, such as energy dissipation channels, spurious modes, and imperfections from microfabrication. Here, we report the nanoscale imaging of a freestanding super-high-frequency (3 - 30GHz) lateral overtone bulk acoustic resonator with unprecedented spatial resolution and displacement sensitivity. Using transmission-mode microwave impedance microscopy, we have visualized mode profiles of individual overtones and analyzed higher-order transverse spurious modes and anchor loss. The integrated TMIM signals are in good agreement with the stored mechanical energy in the resonator. Quantitative analysis with finite-element modeling shows that the noise floor is equivalent to an in-plane displacement of 10fm/root Hz at room temperatures, which can be further improved under cryogenic environments. Our work contributes to the design and characterization of MEMS resonators with better performance for telecommunication, sensing, and quantum information science applications. Implementing MEMS resonators calls for detailed microscopic understanding of the devices and imperfections from microfabrication. Lee et al. imaged super-high-frequency acoustic resonators with a spatial resolution of 100nm and a displacement sensitivity of 10fm/root Hz.

TI Optical Vortex Brillouin Laser
SO LASER & PHOTONICS REVIEWS
AB Optical vortices, which have been extensively studied over the last decades, offer an additional degree of freedom useful in many applications, such as optical tweezers and quantum control. Stimulated Brillouin scattering (SBS), providing a narrow linewidth and a strong nonlinear response, has been used to realize quasi-continuous wave lasers. Here, stable oscillation of optical vortices and acoustic modes in a Brillouin laser based on chiral photonic crystal fiber (PCF) is reported, which robustly supports helical Bloch modes (HBMs) that carry circularly polarized optical vortex and display circular birefringence. A narrow-linewidth Brillouin fiber laser that stably emits 1st-and 2nd-order vortex-carrying HBMs is implemented. Angular momentum conservation selection rules dictate that pump and backward Brillouin signals have opposite topological charge and spin. Additionally, it is shown that when the chiral PCF is placed within a laser ring cavity, the linewidth-narrowing associated with lasing permits the peak of the Brillouin gain that corresponds to acoustic mode to be measured with resolution of 10 kHz and accuracy of 520 kHz. The results pave the way to a new generation of vortex-carrying SBS systems with applications in optical tweezers, quantum information processing, and vortex-carrying nonreciprocal systems.

TI Frustrated Kondo impurity triangle: A simple model of deconfinement
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB The concepts of deconfinement and topological order are of great current interest for quantum information science and for our understanding of quantum materials. Here, we introduce a simple model of three antiferromagnetically coupled Kondo impurities, a Kondo triangle, which can be used to further extend the application of these concepts to electronic systems. We show that, by tuning the magnetic frustration, the Kondo triangle undergoes a quantum phase transition between two phases of unbroken symmetry, signaling a phase transition beyond the Landau paradigm. We demonstrate that the frustrated spin liquid phase is described by a three-channel Kondo (3CK) fixed point and thus displays an irrational ground state degeneracy. Using an Abrikosov pseudofermion representation, this quantum state is categorized by an emergent U(1) gauge field and its projective symmetry group. The gauge theory is deconfining in the sense that a miniature Wilson loop orders and topological defects (instantons in the gauge field) are expelled. This phase persists in the presence of moderate Kondo screening until proliferation of topological defects leads to a quantum phase transition to an unfrustrated Fermi liquid phase. Based on this evidence, we propose that the 3CK phase displays topological order in a similar sense as gapless spin liquids.

TI High-Purity Circularly Polarized Lasing From Chiral VCSELs With Aligned
   Semiconductor Quantum Wells
SO ADVANCED FUNCTIONAL MATERIALS
AB Circularly polarized light (CPL) is vital for optical communication, quantum information, 3D displays, and bioimaging. Traditional CPL generation using linear polarizers and quarter-wave plates suffers from significant energy loss. Here, we present a chiral vertical-cavity surface-emitting laser (VCSEL) by integrating face-down aligned CdSe/CdZnS colloidal quantum wells (CQWs, also known as nanoplatelets) with a cholesteric liquid crystal (CLC)-based distributed Bragg reflectors (DBRs). The CLC reflectors selectively reflect CPL matching their handedness, enhancing lasing, and ensuring a dominant output of the same handedness. The face-down aligned CQWs offer i) directional emission for precise spectral matching with the CLC-DBR stop band and ii) optimized light-matter coupling via dipole alignment with cavity modes. This leads to a lower lasing threshold and high polarization dissymmetry, achieving a |g-factor| of 1.9. The lasing process further amplifies circular polarization asymmetry, increasing the right-CP (R-CP) to left-CP (L-CP) intensity ratio from 0.21 in fluorescence to 41.7 in lasing. Furthermore, we demonstrate flexible chiral VCSELs with mechanically tunable emission wavelengths while maintaining performance. Our approach provides an efficient and customizable strategy for next-generation high-purity CPL sources, paving the way for advanced photonic applications.

TI Genuinely nonlocal sets without entanglement in multipartite systems
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB A set of multipartite orthogonal states is genuinely nonlocal if it is locally indistinguishable in every bipartition of the subsystems. If the set is locally reducible, we say it has genuine nonlocality of type I. Otherwise, we say it has genuine nonlocality of type II. Due to the complexity of the problem, the construction of genuinely nonlocal sets in general multipartite systems has not been completely solved so far. In this paper, we first provide a nonlocal set of product states in bipartite systems. We obtain a genuinely nonlocal set of type I without entanglement in general n-partite systems circle times ni=1CCdi[3 (d1 - 1) d2 <middle dot> <middle dot> <middle dot> dn, n 3]. Then we present two constructions with genuine nonlocality of type II in CCd1 circle times CCd2 circle times CCd3 (3 d1 d2 d3) and circle times ni=1CCdi (3 d1 d2 <middle dot> <middle dot> <middle dot> dn, n 4). Our results further positively answer the open problem that there does exist a genuinely nonlocal set of type II in multipartite systems [M. S. Li, Y. L. Wang, F. Shi, and M. H. Yung, J. Phys. A: Math. Theor. 54, 445301 (2021)] and highlight its related applications in quantum information processing.

TI Random Tensor Networks with Non-trivial Links
SO ANNALES HENRI POINCARE
AB Random tensor networks are a powerful toy model for understanding the entanglement structure of holographic quantum gravity. However, unlike holographic quantum gravity, their entanglement spectra are flat. It has therefore been argued that a better model consists of random tensor networks with link states that are not maximally entangled, i.e., have non-trivial spectra. In this work, we initiate a systematic study of the entanglement properties of these networks. We employ tools from free probability, random matrix theory, and one-shot quantum information theory to study random tensor networks with bounded and unbounded variation in link spectra, and in cases where a subsystem has one or multiple minimal cuts. If the link states have bounded spectral variation, the limiting entanglement spectrum of a subsystem with two minimal cuts can be expressed as a free product of the entanglement spectra of each cut, along with a Marchenko-Pastur distribution. For a class of states with unbounded spectral variation, analogous to semiclassical states in quantum gravity, we relate the limiting entanglement spectrum of a subsystem with two minimal cuts to the distribution of the minimal entanglement across the two cuts. In doing so, we draw connections to previous work on split transfer protocols, entanglement negativity in random tensor networks, and Euclidean path integrals in quantum gravity.

TI Evaporation of microwave-shielded polar molecules to quantum degeneracy
SO NATURE
AB Ultracold polar molecules offer strong electric dipole moments and rich internal structure, which makes them ideal building blocks to explore exotic quantum matter(1-9), implement quantum information schemes(10-12) and test the fundamental symmetries of nature(13). Realizing their full potential requires cooling interacting molecular gases deeply into the quantum-degenerate regime. However, the intrinsically unstable collisions between molecules at short range have so far prevented direct cooling through elastic collisions to quantum degeneracy in three dimensions. Here we demonstrate evaporative cooling of a three-dimensional gas of fermionic sodium-potassium molecules to well below the Fermi temperature using microwave shielding. The molecules are protected from reaching short range with a repulsive barrier engineered by coupling rotational states with a blue-detuned circularly polarized microwave. The microwave dressing induces strong tunable dipolar interactions between the molecules, leading to high elastic collision rates that can exceed the inelastic ones by at least a factor of 460. This large elastic-to-inelastic collision ratio allows us to cool the molecular gas to 21 nanokelvin, corresponding to 0.36 times the Fermi temperature. Such cold and dense samples of polar molecules open the path to the exploration of many-body phenomena with strong dipolar interactions.

   biexciton quantum dots and anisotropic metasurfaces
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB The resonance fluorescence properties in the steady-state regime are investigated for a driven cascaded exciton-biexciton quantum dot coupled to the two-dimensional black phosphorus metasurfaces. It is shown that for the material parameters under consideration, both the elliptic and hyperbolic dispersion patterns of the surface plasmon modes are achievable according to the variation of the carrier concentration. Further study on the Purcell factor indicates unequal enhancements in the spontaneous decay of the orthogonal in-plane dipoles. Motivated by this intriguing phenomenon, we then investigate the steady-state properties of the driven quantum dot, where the populations of the dressed levels are highly tunable by engineering the anisotropy of the surfaces. As a result, the manipulation of the carrier concentration will lead to strong modifications in the resonance fluorescence. Under certain conditions, one can observe the squeezing of two-mode noise spectra with different resonances and polarizations. Although at the expense of declines in the photon-sideband detunings, it is feasible to enhance the two-mode squeezing by gate doping. Our proposal can be easily extended to other hybrid systems containing anisotropic metasurfaces, which are important for the development of quantum information science.

TI Complete crystal-field calculation of Zeeman hyperfine splittings in
   europium
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB Computational crystal-field models have provided consistent models of both electronic and Zeeman-hyperfine structure for several rare-earth ions. However, a computational crystal-field calculation of Eu3+incorporating the lattice electric quadrupole and nuclear Zeeman interactions has not been performed. Here, we include these terms in a computational model to fit the crystal-field levels and the Zeeman-hyperfine structure of the 7F0 and 5D0 states in three Eu3+sites: the C4v and C3v sites in CaF2and the C2 site in EuCl3 middot 6H2O. Close fits are obtained for all three sites which are used to resolve ambiguities in previously published parameters, including quantifying the anomalously large crystal-field-induced state mixing in the C3v site and determining the signs of Zeeman-hyperfine parameters in all three sites. We show that this model allows accurate prediction of properties for Eu3+important for quantum information applications of these ions, such as relative transition strengths. The model could be used to improve crystal-field calculations for other non-Kramers singlet states. We also present a spin Hamiltonian formalism without the normal assumption of no J mixing, suitable for other rare-earth ion energy levels where this effect is important.

TI Quantum-enhanced clock synchronization using prior statistical
   information
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Optical frequency combs (OFCs) are paving the way for an unprecedented level of precision in synchronizing optical clocks over free-space. However, the conventional intensity-based strategy for estimating the timing offset between two OFCs is sub-optimal, whereas a strategy based on temporal modes can achieve the optimal precision bound under ideal conditions. In practice, the performance of both strategies depends on prior information about the relative intensity of the two OFCs, and the timing centroid between the OFCs. Here, for the first time, we quantify the amount of information required about these two parameters to guarantee that the temporal mode strategy is superior. Using tools from quantum estimation theory and numerical simulations, we ascertain the significance of the timing centroid in quantum-enhanced clock synchronization. Most notably, when the prior information on the timing centroid is at anticipated levels, we find the reductions in the timing deviation achieved by the temporal mode strategy, relative to the intensity-based strategy, to be in the range 2-10. Our new insights can also be one-to-one mapped to the problem of super-resolution imaging of incoherent point sources.

TI Entangled universes in dS wedge holography
SO JOURNAL OF HIGH ENERGY PHYSICS
AB We develop a new setting in the framework of braneworld holography to describe a pair of coupled and entangled uniformly accelerated universes. The model consists of two branes embedded into AdS space capping off the UV and IR regions, giving rise to a notion of dS wedge holography. Specializing in a three-dimensional bulk, we show that dS JT gravity can emerge as an effective braneworld theory, provided that fluctuations transverse to the branes are included. We study the holographic entanglement entropy between the branes as well as the holographic complexity within the 'complexity=anything' proposal. We reproduce a Page curve with respect to an observer collecting radiation on the UV brane, as long as we take the limit where gravity decouples in that universe, thus acting as a non-gravitating bath. The Page curve emerges due to momentum-space (UV/IR) entanglement and can be understood as analogous to the 'confinement-deconfinement' transition in theories with a mass gap. Moreover, the analysis of complexity shows that the hyperfast growth phenomenon is displayed within a set of proposals, while late-time linear growth can be recovered for a different set. Our framework thus provides new test grounds for understanding quantum information concepts in dS space and dS holography.

TI Chemomechanical modification of quantum emission in monolayer
   WSe2
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Two-dimensional (2D) materials have attracted attention for quantum information science due to their ability to host single-photon emitters (SPEs). Although the properties of atomically thin materials are highly sensitive to surface modification, chemical functionalization remains unexplored in the design and control of 2D material SPEs. Here, we report a chemomechanical approach to modify SPEs in monolayer WSe2 through the synergistic combination of localized mechanical strain and noncovalent surface functionalization with aryl diazonium chemistry. Following the deposition of an aryl oligomer adlayer, the spectrally complex defect-related emission of strained monolayer WSe2 is simplified into spectrally isolated SPEs with high single-photon purity. Density functional theory calculations reveal energetic alignment between WSe2 defect states and adsorbed aryl oligomer energy levels, thus providing insight into the observed chemomechanically modified quantum emission. By revealing conditions under which chemical functionalization tunes SPEs, this work broadens the parameter space for controlling quantum emission in 2D materials.
   Single-photon emitters (SPEs) in 2D semiconductors are usually affected by complex spectral profiles that limit their understanding and applications. Here, the authors combine a noncovalent surface functionalization method with localized mechanical strain to simplify the spectra and enhance the purity of SPEs in monolayer WSe2.

TI Time-varying orbital angular momentum in tight focusing of ultrafast
   pulses
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB The orbital angular momentum (OAM) of light has important applications in a variety of fields, including optical communication, quantum information, super-resolution microscopic imaging, particle trapping, and others. However, the temporal properties of OAM in ultrafast pulses and in the evolution process of spin-orbit coupling has yet to be revealed. In this work, we theoretically studied the spatiotemporal property of time-varying OAM in the tightly focused field of ultrafast light pulses. The focusing of an incident light pulse composed of two time-delayed femtosecond sub-pulses with the same OAM but orthogonal spin states is investigated, and the ultrafast dynamicsa time delay of OAM variation during the focusing process driven by the spin-orbit coupling is visualized. Temporal properties of three typical examples, including formation, increase, and transformation of topological charge are investigated to reveal the non-uniform evolutions of phase singularities, local topological charges, self-torques, and time-varying OAM per photon. This work could deepen the understanding of spin-orbit coupling in time domain and promote many promising applications such as ultrafast OAM modulation, laser micromachining, high harmonic generation, and manipulation of molecules and nanostructures.

TI Imaging of electrically controlled van der Waals layer stacking in
   1T-TaS2
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Van der Waals materials exhibit a variety of states that can be switched with low power at low temperatures, offering a viable cryogenic 'flash memory' required for the classical control electronics for solid-state quantum information processing. In 1T-TaS2, a non-volatile metallic 'hidden' state can be induced from an insulating equilibrium charge-density wave ground state using either optical or electrical pulses. Given that conventional memristors form localized, filamentary channels which support the current, a key question for design concerns the geometry of the conduction region in highly energy-efficient 1T-TaS2 devices. Here, we report in operando micro-beam X-ray diffraction, fluorescence, and concurrent transport measurements, allowing us to spatially image the non-thermal hidden state induced by electrical switching of 1T-TaS2. The results reveal a long-range ordered switching region that extends well below the electrodes, implying that the self-organized, collective growth of the hidden phase is driven by charge rearrangement and concomitant lattice strain. Our combination of techniques showcases the potential of non-destructive, three-dimensional X-ray imaging to study bulk switching in microscopic detail, exemplified here by electrical control of the charge-density wave state of a van der Waals material.

TI Quantum metrology timing limits of biphoton frequency comb
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Biphoton frequency comb (BFC), which encompasses multiple discrete frequency modes and represents high-dimensional frequency entanglement, is crucial in quantum information processing due to its high information capacity and error resilience. It also holds significant potential for enhancing timing precision in quantum metrology. Here, we examine quantum metrology timing limits using the BFC as a probe state and derive a quantum Cram & eacute;r-Rao bound (QCRB) that depends on the mode number, mode spacing, frequency detuning, and single-mode bandwidth. Our results coincide with previous findings that considered only the latter two factors. Under ideal conditions (zero loss and perfect visibility), this bound can be saturated by both spectrally non-resolved Hong-Ou-Mandel (HOM) interferometry at zero delay and spectrally resolved HOM interferometry at arbitrary delays. In practical scenarios, the Fisher information is below the QCRB but can approach its maximum by increasing the mode number and mode spacing for a fixed delay point, suggesting an optimal strategy for improving the precision of HOM-based sensing in practice. Furthermore, compared to spectrally non-resolved measurement, spectrally resolved measurement is a superior strategy due to its higher Fisher information, shorter measurement times, and ambiguity-free dynamic range.

TI Crystal fields and Zeeman effect for thulium in solid argon
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB Optically active defects suspended in an inert solid are an interesting system for sensing and magnetometry at the nanometer scale, in addition to being a potential source of high-density, identical quantum emitters for quantum information. Beyond their response to external fields, the optical absorption and emission spectra also reflect information about the host matrix, which is critical to understand for either application. For the particular system of thulium atoms implanted in solid argon, high resolution laser spectroscopy reveals narrow ensemble linewidths of the 1140 nm f to f ground state spin-orbit transition, which is split due to crystal field effects and hyperfine coupling. Pump-probe spectroscopy is used to identify crystal field levels in at least two stable trapping sites, and the crystal field is determined to be nearly axial in both sites. Strong selection rules indicate that this transition becomes magnetic-electric in the argon host, most likely due to dielectric effects. In the presence of mT magnetic fields, Zeeman shifts are resolvable by laser fluorescence, allowing crystal axis selective polarized spectroscopy. These results show that all-optical detection schemes for DC magnetic fields are already possible with thulium-doped argon, and point towards more informed strategies for monitoring and improving crystal growth and annealing.

TI Programmable high-dimensional Hamiltonian in a photonic waveguide array
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Waveguide lattices offer a compact and stable platform for a range of applications, including quantum walks, condensed matter system simulation, and classical and quantum information processing. However, to date, waveguide lattice devices have been static and designed for specific applications. We present a programmable waveguide array in which the Hamiltonian terms can be individually electro-optically tuned to implement various Hamiltonian continuous-time evolutions on a single device. We used a single array with 11 waveguides in lithium niobate, controlled via 22 electrodes, to perform a range of experiments that realized the Su-Schriffer-Heeger model, the Aubrey-Andre model, and Anderson localization, which is equivalent to over 2500 static devices. Our architecture's micron-scale local electric fields overcome the cross-talk limitations of thermo-optic phase shifters in other platforms such as silicon, silicon-nitride, and silica. Electro-optic control allows for ultra-fast and more precise reconfigurability with lower power consumption, and with quantum input states, our platform can enable the study of multiple condensed matter quantum dynamics with a single device.
   Photonic waveguide lattices implementing continuous quantum walks have a wide range of applications yet remain based on static devices. Here, the authors demonstrated a fully programmable waveguide array by implementing various Hamiltonians.

TI Measuring Electron Correlation: The Impact of Symmetry and Orbital
   Transformations
SO JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL THEORY AND COMPUTATION
AB In this perspective, the various measures of electron correlation used in wave function theory, density functional theory and quantum information theory are briefly reviewed. We then focus on a more traditional metric based on dominant weights in the f u l l configuration solution and discuss its behavior with respect to the choice of the N-electron and the one-electron basis. The impact of symmetry is discussed, and we emphasize that the distinction among determinants, configuration state functions and configurations as reference functions is usef u l because the latter incorporate spin-coupling into the reference and should thus reduce the complexity of the wave function expansion. The corresponding notions of single determinant, single spin-coupling and single configuration wave functions are discussed and the effect of orbital rotations on t h e multireference character is reviewed by analyzing a simple model system. In molecular systems, the extent of correlation effects should be limited by finite system size and in most cases the appropriate choices of one-electron and N-electron bases should be able to incorporate these into a low-complexity reference function, often a si n g l e configurational one.

TI ESTIMATING THE SHANNON ENTROPY AND (UN)CERTAINTY RELATIONS FOR
   DESIGN-STRUCTURED POVMS
SO SIAM JOURNAL ON APPLIED MATHEMATICS
AB Complementarity relations between various characterizations of a probability distri-bution are at the core of information theory. In particular, lower and upper bounds for the entropic function are of great importance. In applied topics, we often deal with situations where the sums of certain powers of probabilities are known. The main question is how to convert the imposed restrictions into two-sided estimates on the Shannon entropy. It is addressed in two different ways. The more intuitive of them is based on truncated expansions of the Taylor type. Another method is based on the use of coefficients of the shifted Chebyshev polynomials. We propose here a family of polynomials for estimating the Shannon entropy from below. As a result, estimates are more uniform in the sense that errors do not become too large in particular points. The presented method is used for deriving uncertainty and certainty relations for positive operator-valued measures assigned to a quantum design. Quantum designs are currently the subject of active researches due to potential use in quantum information science. It is shown that the derived estimates are applicable in quantum tomography and detecting steerability of quantum states.

TI Low-Charge-Noise Nitrogen-Vacancy Centers in Diamond Created Using Laser
   Writing with a Solid-Immersion Lens
SO ACS PHOTONICS
AB We report on pulsed-laser-induced generation of nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond facilitated by a solid-immersion lens (SIL). The SIL enables laser writing at energies as low as 5.8 nJ per pulse and allows vacancies to be formed close to a diamond surface without inducing surface graphitization. We operate in the previously unexplored regime, where lattice vacancies are created following tunneling breakdown rather than multiphoton ionization. We present three samples in which NV center arrays were laser-written at distances between similar to 1 and 40 mu m from a diamond surface, all presenting narrow distributions of optical linewidths with means between 62.1 and 74.5 MHz. The linewidths include the effect of long-term spectral diffusion induced by a 532 nm repump laser for charge-state stabilization, thereby emphasizing the particularly low-charge-noise environment of the created color centers. Such high-quality NV centers are excellent candidates for practical applications employing two-photon quantum interference with separate NV centers. Finally, we propose a model for disentangling power broadening from inhomogeneous broadening in the NV center optical linewidth.

TI Nonassociative cosmological solitonic R-flux deformations in gauge
   gravity and G. Perelman geometric flow thermodynamics
SO ANNALS OF PHYSICS
AB We elaborate on a model of nonassociative and noncommutative gauge gravity for the de Sitter gauge group SO (4 , 1) embedding extensions of the affine structure group Af (4 , 1) and the Poincar & eacute; group ISO (3 , 1) . Such nonassociative gauge gravity theories are determined by star product R -flux deformations in string theory and can be considered as new avenues to quantum gravity and geometric and quantum information theories. We analyse physically important and geometric thermodynamic properties of new classes of generic off -diagonal cosmological solitonic solutions encoding nonassociative effective sources. Particularly, we focus on modelling by such solutions of locally anisotropic and inhomogeneous dark matter and dark energy structures generated as nonassociative solitonic hierarchies. Such accelerating cosmological evolution scenarios cannot be described in the framework of the Bekenstein-Hawking thermodynamic formalism. This motivates a change in the gravitational thermodynamic paradigm by considering nonassociative and relativistic generalizations of the concept of W -entropy in the theory of Ricci flows. Finally, we compute the corresponding modified G. Perelman's thermodynamic variables and analyse the temperature -like evolution of cosmological constants determined by nonassociative cosmological flows.

TI Modeling temperature-dependent population dynamics in the excited state
   of the nitrogen-vacancy center in diamond
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB The nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond is well known in quantum metrology and quantum information for its favorable spin and optical properties, which span a wide temperature range from near zero to over 600 K. Despite its prominence, the NV center's photophysics is incompletely understood, especially at intermediate temperatures between 10-100 K where phonons become activated. In this paper, we present a rate model able to describe the crossover from the low-temperature to the high-temperature regime. Key to the model is a phonondriven hopping between the two orbital branches in the excited state (ES), which accelerates spin relaxation via an interplay with the ES spin precession. We extend our model to include magnetic and electric fields as well as crystal strain, allowing us to simulate the population dynamics over a wide range of experimental conditions. Our model recovers existing descriptions for the low- and high-temperature limits and successfully explains various sets of literature data. Further, the model allows us to predict experimental observables, in particular the photoluminescence (PL) emission rate, spin contrast, and spin initialization fidelity relevant for quantum applications. Lastly, our model allows probing the electron-phonon interaction of the NV center and reveals a gap between the current understanding and recent experimental findings.

TI Nuclear spin diffusion in the central spin system of a GaAs/AlGaAs
   quantum dot
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB The spin diffusion concept provides a classical description of a purely quantum-mechanical evolution in inhomogeneously polarized many-body systems such as nuclear spin lattices. The central spin of a localized electron alters nuclear spin diffusion in a way that is still poorly understood. Here, spin diffusion in a single GaAs/AlGaAs quantum dot is witnessed in the most direct manner from oscillatory spin relaxation dynamics. Electron spin is found to accelerate nuclear spin relaxation, from which we conclude that the long-discussed concept of a Knight-field-gradient diffusion barrier does not apply to GaAs epitaxial quantum dots. Our experiments distinguish between non-diffusion relaxation and spin diffusion, allowing us to conclude that diffusion is accelerated by the central electron spin. Such acceleration is observed up to unexpectedly high magnetic fields - we propose electron spin-flip fluctuations as an explanation. Diffusion-limited nuclear spin lifetimes range between 1 and 10 s, which is sufficiently long for quantum information storage and processing. Interaction between localized electron spins and nuclear spins causes shifts in nuclear spin energy levels, but how this affects nuclear spin diffusion in quantum dots is not fully understood. Here the authors show that the central electron accelerates nuclear spin diffusion in GaAs/AlGaAs quantum dots.

TI Revisiting Chernoff Information with Likelihood Ratio Exponential
   Families
SO ENTROPY
AB The Chernoff information between two probability measures is a statistical divergence measuring their deviation defined as their maximally skewed Bhattacharyya distance. Although the Chernoff information was originally introduced for bounding the Bayes error in statistical hypothesis testing, the divergence found many other applications due to its empirical robustness property found in applications ranging from information fusion to quantum information. From the viewpoint of information theory, the Chernoff information can also be interpreted as a minmax symmetrization of the Kullback-Leibler divergence. In this paper, we first revisit the Chernoff information between two densities of a measurable Lebesgue space by considering the exponential families induced by their geometric mixtures: The so-called likelihood ratio exponential families. Second, we show how to (i) solve exactly the Chernoff information between any two univariate Gaussian distributions or get a closed-form formula using symbolic computing, (ii) report a closed-form formula of the Chernoff information of centered Gaussians with scaled covariance matrices and (iii) use a fast numerical scheme to approximate the Chernoff information between any two multivariate Gaussian distributions.

TI Double-Electromagnetically-Induced-Transparency Ground-State Cooling of
   Stationary Two-Dimensional Ion Crystals
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB We theoretically and experimentally investigate double-electromagnetically-induced transparency (double-EIT) cooling of two-dimensional ion crystals confined in a Paul trap. The double-EIT ground-state cooling is observed for Yb-171(+) ions with a clock state, for which EIT cooling has not been realized like many other ions with a simple. scheme. A cooling rate of (sic) = 34(+/- 1.8) ms(-1) and a cooling limit of (n) over bar = 0.06(+/- 0.059) are observed for a single ion. The measured cooling rate and limit are consistent with theoretical predictions. We apply double-EIT cooling to the transverse modes of two-dimensional (2D) crystals with up to 12 ions. In our 2D crystals, the micromotion and the transverse mode directions are perpendicular, which makes them decoupled. Therefore, the cooling on transverse modes is not disturbed by micromotion, which is confirmed in our experiment. For the center of mass mode of a 12-ion crystal, we observe a cooling rate and a cooling limit that are consistent with those of a single ion, including heating rates proportional to the number of ions. This method can be extended to other hyperfine qubits, and near ground-state cooling of stationary 2D crystals with large numbers of ions may advance the field of quantum information sciences.

TI On-chip quasi-light storage for long optical delays using Brillouin
   scattering
SO APL PHOTONICS
AB Efficient and extended light storage mechanisms are pivotal in photonics, particularly in optical communications, microwave photonics, and quantum networks, as they offer a direct route to circumvent electrical conversion losses and surmount bandwidth constraints. Stimulated Brillouin Scattering (SBS) is an established method to store optical information by transferring it to the acoustic domain, but current on-chip SBS efforts have limited bandwidth or storage time due to the phonon lifetime of several nanoseconds. An alternate approach known as quasi-light storage (QLS), which involves the creation of delayed replicas of optical data pulses via SBS in conjunction with a frequency comb, has been proposed to lift the storage time constraint; however, its realization has been confined to lengthy optical fibers, constraining integration with on-chip optical elements and form factors. Here, we present an experimental demonstration of QLS on a photonic chip leveraging the large SBS gain of chalcogenide glass, achieving delays of up to 500 ns for 1 ns long signal pulses, surpassing typical Brillouin storage processes' acoustic lifetime by more than an order of magnitude and waveguide transit time by two orders of magnitude. We experimentally and numerically investigate the dynamics of on-chip QLS and reveal that the interplay between the acoustic wave that stores the optical signal and subsequent optical pump pulses leads to a reshaping of the acoustic field. Our demonstrations illustrate the potential for achieving ultra-long storage times of individual pulses by several hundred pulse widths, marking a significant stride toward advancing the field of all-optical storage and delay mechanisms.

TI Noise-induced dynamics and photon statistics in bimodal quantum-dot
   micropillar lasers
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB Emission characteristics of quantum-dot micropillar lasers (QDMLs) are located at the intersection of nanophotonics and nonlinear dynamics, which provides an ideal platform for studying the optical interface between classical and quantum systems. In this work, a noise-induced bimodal QDML with orthogonal dual-mode outputs is modeled, and nonlinear dynamics, stochastic mode jumping and quantum statistics with the variation of stochastic noise intensity are investigated. Noise-induced effects lead to the emergence of two intensity bifurcation points for the strong and the weak mode, and the maximum output power of the strong mode becomes larger as the noise intensity increases. The anti-correlation of the two modes reaches the maximum at the second intensity bifurcation point. The dual-mode stochastic jumping frequency and effective bandwidth can exceed 100 GHz and 30 GHz under the noise-induced effect. Moreover, the noise-induced photon correlations of both modes simultaneously exhibit super-thermal bunching effects (g((2))(0) > 2) in the low injection current region. The g((2))(0)-value of the strong mode can reach over 6 in the high injection current region. Photon bunching (g((2))(0) > 1) of both modes is observed over a wide range of noise intensities and injection currents. In the presence of the noise-induced effect, the photon number distribution of the strong or the weak mode is a mixture of Bose-Einstein and Poisson distributions. As the noise intensity increases, the photon number distribution of the strong mode is dominated by the Bose-Einstein distribution, and the proportion of the Poisson distribution is increased in the high injection current region, while that of the weak mode is reduced. Our results contribute to the development preparation of super-bunching quantum integrated light sources for improving the spatiotemporal resolution of quantum sensing measurements and enhancing the security of optical communication.

TI Near dipole-dipole interaction induced control of high-precision
   three-dimensional atom localization via probe absorption in a four-level
   phase-coherent atomic medium
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB It is newly proposed that the presence of the near dipole-dipole (NDD) interaction effect in an optically dense atomic ensemble may be very useful for controlling high-precision atom localization. In the present work based on observing the NDD effect-induced space-dependent-absorption of a weak probe field operating in a partially closed four-level Y-type atomic system, we have shown the NDD parameter being an efficient control knob along with the other system parameters for easier optimization of the localization pattern with enhanced detection probability in three-dimensional (3D) space. Controlling localization patterns at lower and larger values of NDD parameter is discussed at different physical conditions. In the present model, we mention that the maximum detection probability of the atom is found with the spatial resolution limit having localization volume nearly of the order of \documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$(\lambda /100)<^>3$$\end{document}. The efficacy of the present model is in finding its application in atom nanolithography and atom imaging, which are important for quantum information processing and technology.

TI Complementarity relations for design-structured POVMs in terms of
   generalized entropies of order α ∈(0,2)
SO QUANTUM INFORMATION PROCESSING
AB Information entropies give a genuine way to characterize quantitatively an incompatibility in quantum measurements. Together with the Shannon entropy, few families of parametrized entropies have found use in various questions. It is also known that a possibility to vary the parameter can often provide more restrictions on elements of probability distributions. In quantum information processing, one often deals with measurements having some special structure. Quantum designs are currently the subject of active research, whence the aim to formulate complementarity relations for related measurements occurs. Using generalized entropies of order alpha is an element of(0,2), we obtain uncertainty and certainty relations for POVMs assigned to a quantum design. The structure of quantum designs leads to several restrictions on generated probabilities. We show how to convert these restrictions into two-sided entropic estimates. One of the used ways is based on truncated expansions of the Taylor type. The recently found method to get two-sided entropic estimates uses polynomials with flexible coefficients. We illustrate the utility of this method with respect to both the Renyi and Tsallis entropies. Possible applications of the derived complementarity relations are briefly discussed.

TI Silicon-based optoelectronics for general-purpose matrix computation: a
   review
SO ADVANCED PHOTONICS
AB Conventional electronic processors, which are the mainstream and almost invincible hardware for computation, are approaching their limits in both computational power and energy efficiency, especially in large-scale matrix computation. By combining electronic, photonic, and optoelectronic devices and circuits together, silicon-based optoelectronic matrix computation has been demonstrating great capabilities and feasibilities. Matrix computation is one of the few general-purpose computations that have the potential to exceed the computation performance of digital logic circuits in energy efficiency, computational power, and latency. Moreover, electronic processors also suffer from the tremendous energy consumption of the digital transceiver circuits during high-capacity data interconnections. We review the recent progress in photonic matrix computation, including matrix-vector multiplication, convolution, and multiply-accumulate operations in artificial neural networks, quantum information processing, combinatorial optimization, and compressed sensing, with particular attention paid to energy consumption. We also summarize the advantages of silicon-based optoelectronic matrix computation in data interconnections and photonic-electronic integration over conventional optical computing processors. Looking toward the future of silicon-based optoelectronic matrix computations, we believe that silicon-based optoelectronics is a promising and comprehensive platform for disruptively improving general-purpose matrix computation performance in the post-Moore's law era.

TI Symmetry-resolved dynamical purification in synthetic quantum matter
SO SCIPOST PHYSICS
AB When a quantum system initialized in a product state is subjected to either coherent or incoherent dynamics, the entropy of any of its connected partitions generically increases as a function of time, signalling the inevitable spreading of (quantum) information throughout the system. Here, we show that, in the presence of continuous symmetries and under ubiquitous experimental conditions, symmetry-resolved information spreading is inhibited due to the competition of coherent and incoherent dynamics: in given quantum number sectors, entropy decreases as a function of time, signalling dynamical purification. Such dynamical purification bridges between two distinct short and intermediate time regimes, characterized by a log-volume and log-area entropy law, respectively. It is generic to symmetric quantum evolution, and as such occurs for different partition geometry and topology, and classes of (local) Liouville dynamics. We then develop a protocol to measure symmetry-resolved entropies and negativities in synthetic quantum systems based on the random unitary toolbox, and demonstrate the generality of dynamical purification using experimental data from trapped ion experiments [Bry- dges al., Science 364, 260 (2019)]. Our work shows that symmetry plays a key role as a magnifying glass to characterize many-body dynamics in open quantum systems, and, in particular, in noisy-intermediate scale quantum devices.

TI Tailoring Kerr nonlinearity in a quantum dot-metallic nanoshell-cell
   membrane hybrid system for high-sensitivity cancer cell detection
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB We develop a theory to investigate Kerr nonlinearity in a hybrid nanosystem integrating a semiconductor quantum dot (SQD), a metallic nanoshell (MNS) consisting of a metallic inner core and a dielectric outer shell, and a cell membrane. Beyond the dipole approximation, an analytical expression for the Kerr coefficient is derived, with key findings as follows: (1) The multipole effect enables a significant enhancement of the Kerr coefficient compared to the dipole approximation scenario, whereas increasing the spacing between the SQD and the MNS leads to substantial suppression of this coefficient; (2) The Kerr spectrum can be switched from a two-peaked to a three-peaked structure solely by tuning the exciton-phonon coupling strength; (3) The heights, positions, and full widths at half maximum (FWHM) of the two sideband peaks in the Kerr spectrum exhibit high sensitivity to both pumping intensity and dielectric shell thickness. Importantly, we demonstrate the feasibility of detecting the initiation of normal cell carcinogenesis by monitoring the heights, locations, and frequency shifts of these two sideband peaks. The proposed scheme exhibits promising applications in quantum information networks and biosensing. (c) 2025 Optica Publishing Group under the terms of the Optica Open Access Publishing Agreement

The Creutz ladder exhibits perfectly flat bands, Aharonov-Bohm caging, and topological features arising from its nontrivial hopping structure. By embedding the giant atom at multiple spatially separated sites, we reveal interference-driven emission control and the formation of nonradiative bound states. Using both spectral and time-domain analyses, we uncover strong non-Markovian dynamics characterized by persistent oscillations, long-lived entanglement, and recoherence cycles. The emergence of bound-state poles in the spectral function is accompanied by spatially localized photonic profiles and directionally asymmetric emission, even in the absence of band dispersion. Calculations of von Neumann entropy and atomic purity confirm the formation of coherence-preserving dressed states in the flat-band regime. Furthermore, the spacetime structure of the emitted field displays robust zig-zag interference patterns and synthetic chirality, underscoring the role of geometry and topology in photon transport. Our results demonstrate how flat-band photonic lattices can be leveraged to engineer tunable atom-photon entanglement, suppress radiative losses, and create structured decoherence-free subspaces for quantum information applications.

TI Optimization of the intermediate precooling temperatures for the 2 K
   hybrid cryocooler based on entropy generation analysis
SO CASE STUDIES IN THERMAL ENGINEERING
AB There is an increasing demand for 2 K hybrid cryocoolers, consisting of a multi-stage Stirling-type pulse tube cryocooler (SPTC) coupled with a Joule-Thomson cooler (JTC), due to their critical applications in deep space exploration and quantum information technology. Precooling temperature and the number of precooling stages, as the key parameters of hybrid cryocoolers, are crucial for attaining 2 K cooling performance. In this paper, an entropy model of the JT cryocooler at 2 K temperature is established for the first time. Based on this model, three-stage precooling temperatures under various operating conditions are optimized, minimizing entropy generation and enhancing the energy utilization efficiency of the JTC cycle in the hybrid cryocooler. Results indicate that there is an optimal value for the first stage precooling temperature (Tpre.1) of 105 K, and the second-stage precooling temperature (Tpre.2) should be minimized. The third stage precooling temperature (Tpre.3) varies with the first two stages and is uniquely determined. Increasing precooling stages from two to three cuts entropy generation by about 15.12 %. These findings offer a key theoretical basis for optimizing hybrid cryocooler design and improving its efficiency and performance.

TI A Spectrochemical Series for Electron Spin Relaxation
SO JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY
AB Controlling the rate of electron spin relaxation in paramagnetic molecules is essential for contemporary applications in molecular magnetism and quantum information science. However, the physical mechanisms of spin relaxation remain incompletely understood, and new spectroscopic observables play an important role in evaluating spin dynamics mechanisms and structure-property relationships. Here, we use cryogenic magnetic circular dichroism (MCD) spectroscopy and pulse electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) in tandem to examine the impact of ligand field (d-d) excited states on spin relaxation rates. We employ a broad scope of square-planar Cu(II) compounds with varying ligand field strength, including CuS4, CuN4, CuN2O2, and CuO4 first coordination spheres. An unexpectedly strong correlation exists between spin relaxation rates and the average d-d excitation energy (R 2 = 0.97). The relaxation rate trends as the inverse 11th power of the excited-state energies, whereas simplified theoretical models predict only an inverse second power dependence. These experimental results directly implicate ligand field excited states as playing a critical role in the ground-state spin relaxation mechanism. Furthermore, ligand field strength is revealed to be a particularly powerful design principle for spin dynamics, enabling formation of a spectrochemical series for spin relaxation.

TI Coherent Acoustic Control of Defect Orbital States in the Strong-Driving
   Limit
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB We use a bulk acoustic wave resonator to demonstrate coherent control of the excited orbital states in a diamond nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center at cryogenic temperature. Coherent quantum control is an essential tool for understanding and mitigating decoherence. Moreover, characterizing and controlling orbital states is a central challenge for quantum networking, where optical coherence is tied to orbital coherence. We study resonant multiphonon orbital Rabi oscillations in both the frequency and time domain, extracting the strength of the orbital-phonon interactions and the coherence of the acoustically driven orbital states. We reach the strong-driving limit, where the physics is dominated by the coupling induced by the acoustic waves. We find agreement between our measurements, quantum master-equation simulations, and a Landau-Zener transition model in the strong-driving limit. Using perturbation theory, we derive an expression for the orbital Rabi frequency versus the acoustic drive strength that is nonperturbative in the drive strength and agrees well with our measurements for all acoustic powers. Motivated by continuouswave spin-resonance-based decoherence protection schemes, we model the orbital decoherence and find good agreement between our model and our measured few-to-several-nanoseconds orbital decoherence times. We discuss the outlook for orbital decoherence protection.

TI Coherent optical two-photon resonance tomographic imaging in three
   dimensions
SO COMMUNICATIONS PHYSICS
AB Magnetic resonance imaging is a three-dimensional imaging technique, where a gradient of the magnetic field is used to interrogate spin resonances with spatial resolution. The application of this technique to probe the coherence of atoms with good three-dimensional resolution is a challenging application. We propose and demonstrate an optical method to probe spin resonances via a two-photon Raman transition, reconstructing the 3D-structure of an atomic ensemble's coherence, which is itself subject to external fields. Our method relies on a single time-and-space resolved heterodyne measurement, allowing the reconstruction of a complex 3D coherence profile. Owing to the optical interface, we reach a tomographic image resolution of 14 x 14 x 36 & mu;m(3). The technique allows to probe any transparent medium with a resonance structure and provides a robust diagnostic tool for atom-based quantum information protocols. As such, it is a viable technique for application to magnetometry, electrometry, and imaging of electromagnetic fields.
   Achieving micrometric resolution in 3D magnetic resonance imaging is a standing challenge, and carries the potential of probing atomic coherences. The authors propose an optical method to probe spin resonances and reconstruct the 3D structure of an atomic ensemble's coherence based on a single measurement of a two-photon Raman transition.

TI The fast-slow light transitions induced by Fano resonance in multiple
   nanomechanical resonators
SO OPTICS AND LASER TECHNOLOGY
AB We propose a loop-coupled hybrid nanomechanical resonator (NR) system, in which a two-level quantum dot is embedded into a doubly clamped NR coupled to another two NRs, and each two NRs can interact with each other by the Coulomb interaction. We investigate the absorption spectrum of the quantum dot driven by two-tone fields, which presents multiple Fano resonances in the condition of the NRs with three identical frequencies. With controlling the interaction of the NRs, the absorption spectra can present double Fano resonance or triple Fano resonance, and multiple Fano resonances are accompanied by the rapid normal phase dispersion, which leads to the slow light effect. We demonstrate each Fano resonance peaks in the absorption spectra can result in the optical propagation, and the numerical results manifest that the transition from fast to slow light can be reached by manipulating the interaction of the NRs. The hybrid NRs system can be reached to the network-coupled NRs network system by weaving different NRs and controlling the coupling of NRs, which indicates a promising integration platform to reach potential application in quantum information processing.

TI Nonlinear interferometry beyond classical limit enabled by cyclic
   dynamics
SO NATURE PHYSICS
AB Time-reversed evolution has substantial implications in physics, including applications in refocusing of classical waves or spins and fundamental studies such as quantum information scrambling. In quantum metrology, nonlinear interferometry based on time-reversal protocols supports entanglement-enhanced measurements without requiring low-noise detection. Despite the broad interest in this topic, it remains challenging to reverse the quantum dynamics of an interacting many-body system, which is typically realized by an (effective) sign flip of the system's Hamiltonian. Here we present an approach that is broadly applicable to cyclic systems for implementing nonlinear interferometry without invoking time reversal. As time-reversed dynamics drives a system back to its starting point, we propose to accomplish the same by forcing the system to travel along a 'closed loop' instead of explicitly tracing back its antecedent path. Utilizing the quasiperiodic spin mixing dynamics in a three-mode Rb-87 atomic spinor condensate, we implement such a closed-loop nonlinear interferometer and achieve a metrological gain of 5.01(-0.76)(+0.76) decibels over the classical limit for a total of 26,500 atoms. Our approach unlocks the potential of nonlinear interferometry hy allowing the dynamics to penetrate into the deep nonlinear regime, which gives rise to highly entangled non-Gaussian states.

TI Tantala Kerr nonlinear integrated photonics
SO OPTICA
AB Integrated photonics plays a central role in modern science and technology, enabling experiments from nonlinear science to quantum information, ultraprecise measurements and sensing, and advanced applications such as data communication and signal processing. Optical materials with favorable properties are essential for nanofabrication of integrated photonics devices. Here we describe a material for integrated nonlinear photonics, tantalum pentoxide (Ta2O5, hereafter tantala), which offers low intrinsic material stress, low optical loss, and efficient access to Kerr nonlinear processes. We utilize >800 nm thick tantala films deposited via ion beam sputtering on oxidized silicon wafers. The tantala films contain a low residual tensile stress of 38 MPa, and they offer a Kerr index of n(2) = 6.2 +/- 2.3 x 10(-19) m(2)/W, which is approximately a factor of 3 higher than silicon nitride. We fabricate integrated nonlinear resonators and waveguides without the cracking challenges that are prevalent in stoichiometric silicon nitride. The tantala resonators feature an optical quality factor up to 3.8 x 10(6), which enables us to generate ultrabroad bandwidth Kerr soliton frequency combs with low threshold power. Moreover, we characterize tantala waveguides by supercontinuum generation from low-energy, ultrafast seed pulses. These demonstrations characterize future application directions with tantala integrated nonlinear photonics.

TI New directions for adapting intelligent communication and
   standardization towards 6G
SO EAI ENDORSED TRANSACTIONS ON SCALABLE INFORMATION SYSTEMS
AB Rapid advancements in wireless communication technology have made it easier to transfer digital data globally. With the complete assistance of artificial intelligence, the sixth-generation (6G) system-a new paradigm in wireless communication-is anticipated to be put into use between 2027 and 2030. Faster system capacity, faster data rate, lower latency, higher security, and better quality of service (QoS) in comparison to the 5G system are some of the main concerns that need to be addressed beyond 5G. Combining the growing need for more network coverage, lower latency, and greater data rates is the aim of 6G. It is recommended that to meet these needs and enable new services and applications, intelligent communication be implemented. The main enablers and facilitators for implementing intelligent communication beyond 5G are outlined in this paper. The article provides the horizon of new adaptations and standardization for integrating 6G intelligent communication in future networks and outlines the requirements and use case scenarios for 6G. It also highlights the potential of 6G and key enablers from the standpoint of flexibility. It examines key research gaps like spectrum efficiency, network parameters, infrastructure deployment, and security flaws in past transitions while contrasting 5G and 6G communication. To overcome these challenges, modernizing 6G research domains are essential. Therefore this review article focuses on the importance of 6G wireless communication and its network architecture also provides the technological paradigm shift from 5G to 6G. Furthermore, it highlights popular domains such as Artificial Intelligence, Internet of Things, Managing Big Data, Wireless Mobile networks, and Massive MIMO (Multiple Input Communications and Intelligent Reflecting Surface as research objectives.

TI The Impact of 6G-IoT Technologies on the Development of Agriculture 5.0:
   A Review
SO ELECTRONICS
AB Throughout human history, agriculture has undergone a series of progressive transformations based on ever-evolving technologies in an effort to increase productivity and profitability. Over the years, farming methods have evolved significantly, progressing from Agriculture 1.0, which relied on primitive tools, to Agriculture 2.0, which incorporated machinery and advanced farming practices, and subsequently to Agriculture 3.0, which emphasized mechanization and employed intelligent machinery and technology to enhance productivity levels. To further automate and increase agricultural productivity while minimizing agricultural inputs and pollutants, a new approach to agricultural management based on the concepts of the fourth industrial revolution is being embraced gradually. This approach is referred to as "Agriculture 4.0" and is mainly implemented through the use of Internet of Things (IoT) technologies, enabling the remote control of sensors and actuators and the efficient collection and transfer of data. In addition, fueled by technologies such as robotics, artificial intelligence, quantum sensing, and four-dimensional communication, a new form of smart agriculture, called "Agriculture 5.0," is now emerging. Agriculture 5.0 can exploit the growing 5G network infrastructure as a basis. However, only 6G-IoT networks will be able to offer the technological advances that will allow the full expansion of Agriculture 5.0, as can be inferred from the relevant scientific literature and research. In this article, we first introduce the scope of Agriculture 5.0 as well as the key features and technologies that will be leveraged in the much-anticipated 6G-IoT communication systems. We then highlight the importance and influence of these developing technologies in the further advancement of smart agriculture and conclude with a discussion of future challenges and opportunities.

TI Imaging the photophysics of organic semiconductors using
   polarisation-resolved and near-field optical spectroscopies
SO OPTICS COMMUNICATIONS
AB Imaging techniques that enable the structure of organic semiconductors to be determined across length scales are essential for optimisation of their luminescence properties. In this study, we prepare well-ordered monolayer films of perylene-3,4,9,10-tetracarboxylic-3,4,9,10-diimide (PTCDI) both on the surface of hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) and confined within few-layer thick hBN vertical heterostructures, and apply polarisation-resolved and tip-enhanced optical spectroscopies to image the effects of molecular orientation and dielectric environment on the photoluminescence (PL) exhibited by this prototype organic semiconductor translated at the micro and nano length scales, respectively. Using this combined approach, we show that PTCDI self-assembles into two discrete types of few-micron-sized grains at sub-monolayer coverage, each exhibiting characteristic shifts in PL emission energy related to their registry on hBN surfaces. Through examination of the near-field PL spectra extracted from images of individual grains, we further reveal the existence of nanoscale inhomogeneities within the molecular layer which influence both the energy of PL emission and ratio of vibronic sidebands and provide compelling evidence that variations in the degree of resonant coupling are present on length scales comparable to the resolution of the near-field measurement. Together these imaging tools enable a more comprehensive understanding of the molecular-level photophysics of organic semiconductor aggregates to be established, accessed under ambient conditions and not requiring low temperatures or ultra-high vacuum typical of complementary analytical approaches. Such information will be critical for example for the optimisation of individual single photon emitters in quantum communication devices and understanding how defects impact the efficiency and spectral sharpness of LEDs.

AB Mutual distance bounding (DB) protocols enable two distrusting parties to establish an upper-bound on the distance between them. DB has been so far mainly considered in classical settings and for classical applications, especially in wireless settings, e.g., to prevent relay attacks in wireless authentication and access control systems, and for secure localization. While recent research has started exploring DB in quantum settings, all current quantum DB (QDB) protocols employ quantum-bits (qubits) in the rapid-bit exchange phase, and only perform one-way DB. Specifically, the latest QDB proposals improve initial ones by adding resistance to photon number splitting attacks, and improving round complexity by avoiding communication from the prover to verifier in the last authentication phase. This paper presents two new QDB protocols that differ from previously proposed protocols in several aspects: (1) to the best of our knowledge, our protocols are the first to utilize entangled qubits in the rapid-bit exchange phase, previous protocols relied on sending individual qubits, not those from a pair of entangled ones; (2) our second protocol can perform mutual QDB between two parties in one execution, previous QDB protocols had to be executed twice with the prover and verifier roles reversed in each execution; (3) the use of entangled qubits in our protocols thwarts attacks that previous QDB protocols were prone to; (4) and finally, our protocols also eliminate the need for communication from the prover to the verifier in the last authentication phase, which was necessary in some previous QDB protocols. Our work paves the way for several interesting research directions.

TI Strain-Free GaSb Quantum Dots as Single-Photon Sources in the Telecom
   S-Band
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB Generating single photons in the telecommunication wavelength range from semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) and interfacing them with spins of electrons or holes is of high interest in recent years, with research mainly focusing on indium-based QDs. However, there is not much data on the optical and spin properties of gallium antimonide (GaSb) QDs, despite it being a physically rich system with an indirect to direct bandgap crossover in the telecom wavelength range. This work investigates the (quantum-) optical properties of GaSb QDs, which are fabricated by filling droplet-etched nanoholes in an aluminum gallium antimonide (AlGaSb) matrix. Photoluminescence (PL) features from isolated and highly symmetric QDs are observed that exhibit narrow linewidth in the telecom S-band and show an excitonic fine structure splitting of up to Delta EFSS=(12.0 +/- 0.5)$\mathrm{\Delta}{\mathrm{E}}_{\mathrm{FSS}}= (12.0 \pm 0.5)$ mu eV. Moreover, time-resolved measurements of the decay characteristics of an exciton are performed and the second-order photon autocorrelation function of the charge complex is measured to g2(0)=0.16 +/- 0.02${{\mathrm{g}}}<^>{\mathrm{2}}{\mathrm{(0)}} = 0.16 \pm 0.02$, revealing clear antibunching and thus proving the capability of this material platform to generate non-classical light.
   Strain-free gallium-antimonide quantum dots are fabricated via local droplet etching and subsequent nanohole infilling and investigated for their (quantum-) optical properties. Time-resolved photoluminescence and second-order autocorrelation measurements are conducted on an excitonic transition, showcasing antibunching and thereby highlighting the material platform's potential as a resource for generating non-classical light in the telecom range.image

TI The Large-Error Approximate Degree of AC0
SO THEORY OF COMPUTING
AB We prove two new results about the inability of low-degree polynomials to uniformly approximate constant-depth circuits, even to slightly-better-than-trivial error. First, we prove a tight (Omega) over tilde (n(1/2)) lower bound on the threshold degree of the SURJECTIVITY function on n variables. This matches the best known threshold degree bound for any AC(0) function, previously exhibited by a much more complicated circuit of larger depth (Sherstov, FOCS'15). Our result also extends to a 2((Omega) over tilde (n1/2)) lower bound on the sign-rank of an AC(0) function, improving on the previous best bound of 2(Omega(n2/5)) (Bun and Thaler, ICALP'16).
   Second, for any delta > 0, we exhibit a function f : {-1,1}(n) -> {-1,1} that is computed by a circuit of depth O(1/delta) and is hard to approximate by polynomials in the following sense: f cannot be uniformly approximated to error epsilon = 1-2(-Omega(n1-delta)), even by polynomials of degree n(1-delta). In our FOCS'17 paper we proved a similar lower bound, but which held only for error epsilon = 1/3.
   Our result implies 2(Omega(n1-delta)) lower bounds on the complexity of AC(0) under a variety of measures, including discrepancy, margin complexity, and threshold weight, that are central to communication complexity and learning theory. This nearly matches the trivial upper bound of 2(O(n)) that holds for every function. The previous best lower bound on AC(0) for these measures was 2(Omega(n1/2)) (Sherstov, FOCS'15). Additional applications in learning theory, communication complexity, and cryptography are described.

TI Squashed quantum non-Markovianity: a measure of genuine quantum
   non-Markovianity in states
SO QUANTUM
AB Quantum non-Markovianity in tripartite quantum states rho ABC represents a correlation between systems A and C when conditioned on the system B and is known to have both classical and quantum contributions. However, a systematic characterization of the latter is missing. To address this, we propose a faithful measure for non-Markovianity of genuine quantum origin called squashed quantum non-Markovianity (sQNM). It is based on the quantum conditional mutual information and is defined by the left-over non-Markovianity after squashing out all non-quantum contributions. It is lower bounded by the squashed entanglement between non-conditioning systems in the reduced state and is delimited by the extendibility of either of the non-conditioning systems. We show that the sQNM is monogamous, asymptotically continuous, convex, additive on tensor-product states, and generally super-additive. We characterize genuine quantum non-Markovianity as a resource via a convex resource theory after identifying free states with vanishing sQNM and free operations that do not increase sQNM in states. We use our resource- theoretic framework to bound the rate of state transformations under free operations and to study state transformation under non-free operations; in particular, we find the quantum communication cost from Bob (B) to Alice (A) or Charlie (C) is lower bounded by the change in sQNM in the states. The sQNM finds operational meaning; in particular, the optimal rate of private communication in a variant of conditional one-time pad protocol is twice the sQNM. Also, the minimum deconstruction cost for a variant of quantum deconstruction protocol is given twice the sQNM of the state.

TI Evaluating the coupling efficiency of OAM beams into ring-core optical
   fibers
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB In optical communications, space-division multiplexing is a promising strategy to augment the fiber network capacity. It relies on modern fiber designs that support the propagation of multiple spatial modes. One of these fibers, the ring-core fiber (RCF), is able to propagate modes that carry orbital angular momentum (OAM), and has been shown to enhance not only classical but also quantum communication systems. Typically, the RCF spatial modes are used as orthogonal transmission channels for data streams that are coupled into the fiber using different free space beams. Free space beams commonly used are Laguerre-Gaussian (LG) and perfect vortex (PV) beams. Here, we study the optimal conditions to multiplex information into ring-core fibers in this scheme. We study the beam coupling efficiency using the overlap between free space beams and RCF bound beams and determine which are the most relevant LG beams to be considered and how their coupling efficiency can be maximized by properly adjusting the beam width with respect to the fiber parameters. Our results show that the coupling efficiency depends upon the OAM value and that this can limit the achievable transmission rates in SDM systems. In this regard, we find optimal coupling configurations for LG beams based on the RCF fiber and beam parameters. Further, we study the PV beam that allows for nearly perfect coupling efficiencies for all spatial modes supported by these fibers. PV beams present higher coupling efficiencies than LG beams and negligible dependence on the OAM value, thus offering an attractive solution to multiplex high counts of OAM channels from free space into a ring-core fiber using a single coupling configuration.

   challenges, security challenges and requirements, applications, with
   respect to AI domain
SO IET QUANTUM COMMUNICATION
AB The evolution of wireless communication systems has led to the emergence of the sixth generation (6G) communication architecture, characterised by transformative technologies and novel paradigms that transcend the capabilities of its predecessors. This paper presents an overview of the various aspects of 6G communication architecture, focusing on its technologies, challenges, and applications within the domain of artificial intelligence (AI). The abstract provides an overview of a review on 6G communication, focusing on its architecture, technologies, challenges, security concerns, and requirements within the context of the AI domain. The paper explores the evolving landscape of wireless communication, delving into the anticipated features and capabilities of 6G networks. The architecture emphasises the integration of AI-driven elements, such as intelligent resource allocation and autonomous network management. Various technologies, including terahertz frequencies and integrated satellite networks, are discussed in terms of their potential to reshape connectivity paradigms. However, alongside the promises, a multitude of challenges arise. These encompass spectrum scarcity at terahertz frequencies, energy efficiency concerns, and the need for global standardisation. Addressing security challenges is crucial, considering the expanded attack surface and the integration of AI-powered functionalities. The paper also delineates the stringent requirements that 6G must fulfil, spanning ultra-low latency, high bandwidth, massive device connectivity, and reliable communication. Contextualising these discussions, the review highlights applications within the AI domain that stand to benefit from 6G advancements. These include edge AI, augmented reality, autonomous systems, and IoT-enabled environments. By synergising cutting-edge wireless capabilities with AI-driven intelligence, 6G is poised to revolutionise industries and societal experiences in unprecedented ways.

TI Optimal Quantum Violations of n-Locality Inequalities with
   Conditional Dependence on Inputs
SO ANNALEN DER PHYSIK
AB Bell experiment in a network gives rise to a form of quantum nonlocality which is conceptually different from traditional multipartite Bell nonlocality. In this work, the star-network configuration involving arbitrary n independent sources and (n+1)$(n+1)$ parties, including n edge parties and one central party is considered. Each of the n edge parties shares a physical system with the central party. Each edge party receives 2m-1$2<^>{m-1}$ number of inputs, and the central party receives an arbitrary m number of inputs. The conditional dependence on the inputs of each edge party is imposed so that the local probabilities satisfy a set of constraints. A family of generalized n-locality inequalities is proposed in the arbitrary input scenario by imposing the set of constraints on inputs. The optimal quantum violation of the inequalities is derived by using an elegant sum-of-squares approach without specifying the dimension of the quantum system. Notably, the optimal quantum value is achieved only when the set of linear constraints on inputs is satisfied, which, in turn, self-tests the observables required for each edge party. It shows that while conditional dependence on inputs significantly reduces the n-local bound of the inequalities, the optimal quantum violation remains invariant. It argues that this implies a more robust test of network non-locality, which can be revealed for smaller visibility parameters of the corresponding state. Further, the network nonlocality is characterized and examine its correspondence with suitably derived standard Bell nonlocality.

TI Fiber Bragg grating-electromagnetically induced transparent fast optical
   switch
SO OSA CONTINUUM
AB Here, an all-optical switch is modeled in the form of fiber Bragg grating (FBG) based on electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) phenomena dealing with a three-level EIT silicon (Si) nanocrystalline medium. The EIT consists of two fields, namely a strong control and weak probe fields that interact with the medium. Fast-optical switching of the probe is achieved by applying a pulsed control field, which relies on both steady-state and transient density matrices. The effects of four significant parameters of interest, i.e., Rabi frequency of the control field, EIT nanocrystal density, FBG length, and spontaneous decay rate, have been extensively investigated to optimize the probe transmission. Subsequently, the time-dependent density matrix is solved to obtain the response time of the FBG-EIT switch. Eventually, FBG is modeled such that low index layers contain EIT material and the high index layers do not. The FBG-EIT switch satisfies the criteria of maximum transmission and minimum rise time to give out the optimal operational condition. Despite the optical switching is in OFF mode at Omega(c)=0 THz demonstrating a high FBG reflectance, the reflectance suddenly vanishes at a certain Omega(s)(c) to satisfy the equivalence of low and high refractive indices (switching ON). Therefore, a fast-optical switch is envisaged operating as large as 100 GHz in theory. The future applications of the FBG-EIT include the fast Q-switching of fiber lasers, ultra-fast modulation, optical quantum communication, and high speed optical processing and computation.

TI The small-world effect for interferometer networks
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS-COMPLEXITY
AB Complex network theory has focused on properties of networks with real-valued edge weights. However, in signal transfer networks, such as those representing the transfer of light across an interferometer, complex-valued edge weights are needed to represent the manipulation of the signal in both magnitude and phase. These complex-valued edge weights introduce interference into the signal transfer, but it is unknown how such interference affects network properties such as small-worldness. To address this gap, we have introduced a small-world interferometer network model with complex-valued edge weights and generalized existing network measures to define the interferometric clustering coefficient, the apparent path length, and the interferometric small-world coefficient. Using high-performance computing resources, we generated a large set of small-world interferometers over a wide range of parameters in system size, nearest-neighbor count, and edge-weight phase and computed their interferometric network measures. We found that the interferometric small-world coefficient depends significantly on the amount of phase on complex-valued edge weights: for small edge-weight phases, constructive interference led to a higher interferometric small-world coefficient; while larger edge-weight phases induced destructive interference which led to a lower interferometric small-world coefficient. Thus, for the small-world interferometer model, interferometric measures are necessary to capture the effect of interference on signal transfer. This model is an example of the type of problem that necessitates interferometric measures, and applies to any wave-based network including quantum networks.

TI A Quantum-Enhanced Biometric Fusion Network for Cybersecurity Using Face
   and Voice Recognition
SO CMES-COMPUTER MODELING IN ENGINEERING & SCIENCES
AB Biometric authentication provides a reliable, user-specific approach for identity verification, significantly enhancing access control and security against unauthorized intrusions in cybersecurity. Unimodal biometric systems that rely on either face or voice recognition encounter several challenges, including inconsistent data quality, environmental noise, and susceptibility to spoofing attacks. To address these limitations, this research introduces a robust multi-modal biometric recognition framework, namely Quantum-Enhanced Biometric Fusion Network. The proposed model strengthens security and boosts recognition accuracy through the fusion of facial and voice features. Furthermore, the model employs advanced pre-processing techniques to generate high-quality facial images and voice recordings, enabling more efficient face and voice recognition. Augmentation techniques are deployed to enhance model performance by enriching the training dataset with diverse and representative samples. The local features are extracted using advanced neural methods, while the voice features are extracted using a Pyramid-1D Wavelet Convolutional Bidirectional Network, which effectively captures speech dynamics. The Quantum Residual Network encodes facial features into quantum states, enabling powerful quantum-enhanced representations. These normalized feature sets are fused using an early fusion strategy that preserves complementary spatial-temporal characteristics. The experimental validation is conducted using a biometric audio and video dataset, with comprehensive evaluations including ablation and statistical analyses. The experimental analyses ensure that the proposed model attains superior performance, outperforming existing biometric methods with an average accuracy of 98.99%. The proposed model improves recognition robustness, making it an efficient multimodal solution for cybersecurity applications.

AB As small quantum computers are becoming available on different physical platforms, a benchmarking task known as cross-platform verification has been proposed that aims to estimate the fidelity of states prepared on two quantum computers. This task is fundamentally distributed, as no quantum communication can be performed between the two physical platforms due to hardware constraints, which prohibits a joint SWAP test. In this paper we settle the sample complexity of this task across all measurement and communication settings. The essence of the task, which we call distributed quantum inner product estimation, involves two players Alice and Bob who have.. copies of unknown states rho,sigma (acting on C-d) respectively. Their goal is to estimate Tr(rho sigma) up to additive error epsilon is an element of ( 0, 1), using local quantum operations and classical communication. In the weakest setting where only non-adaptive single-copy measurements and simultaneous message passing are allowed, we show that k = O(max{1/epsilon(2), root d/epsilon}) copies suffice. This achieves a savings compared to full tomography which takes Omega (d(3)) copies with single-copy measurements. Surprisingly, we also show that the sample complexity must be at least Omega (max{1/epsilon(2), root d/epsilon}), even in the strongest setting where adaptive multi-copy measurements and arbitrary rounds of communication are allowed. This shows that the success achieved by shadow tomography, for sample-efficiently learning the properties of a single system, cannot be generalized to the distributed setting. Furthermore, the fact that the sample complexity remains the same with single and multi-copy measurements contrasts with single system quantum property testing, which often demonstrate exponential separations in sample complexity with single and multi-copy measurements.

TI An Overview of Performance Analysis and Optimization in Coexisting
   Satellites and Future Terrestrial Networks
SO IEEE OPEN JOURNAL OF THE COMMUNICATIONS SOCIETY
AB The existing radio frequency band is overcrowded and will soon be unable to accommodate the growing demand for greater data rate services. Consequently, considerable efforts are being undertaken to develop adaptable spectrum-sharing techniques and handle the unprecedented data traffic demands. Using satellite services to enhance terrestrial communications is emerging as a cutting-edge solution for future application-aware networks. The coexistence of space and ground communications infrastructures, however, introduces exacerbated levels of wireless interference. Hence, intelligent resource allocation strategies are essential to ensure dependable communication and high-capacity broadband access globally. To this end, this manuscript surveys the advances in optimization and performance analysis methods in coexisting satellites networks and future wireless systems. The paper first presents an overview of the existing papers related to the more general scope of space-air-ground communications. The survey then highlights optimization frameworks for coexisting satellites and sixth-generation communication systems (6G), focusing on maximizing sum rate, maximizing energy efficiency,and minimizing transmit power. Additionally, the survey presents a number of papers dealing with performance analysis, namely outage probability, ergodic capacity, average symbol error rate, and effective capacity. The paper further discusses the critical challenges imposed by such integrated systems, e.g., backhaul-access cross-interference, resource coordination, channel modeling, and algorithmic complexity. Finally, we identify several open research issues, e.g., a cognitive radio approach to the considered network, integrated backhaul-access system, integration with emerging disruptive systems, artificial intelligence, and quantum communication technologies for coexisting satellites and future terrestrial networks.

SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB This paper discovers new quantum physics, and gives solutions to puzzles of Wheeler's delayed choice and a particle's passing many slits simultaneously by exact quantum physics expressions. We further show new quantum control, new quantum oscillation, new quantum control experiments and new quantum oscillator being able to be installed in quantum communication network etc. We discover that the ability of a photon to hit electrons out in photoelectric effect is complementarily equivalent to the ability of wave of a photon to simultaneously pass through many slits in wave-particle duality. Objective criterion for distinguishing classical and quantum particles is found, and this paper gives applicable realm of quantum theories and new quantum physics expressions of wave-particle duality. All these studies above should be classified as classical and quantum particles, then classical particle and quantum particle wave cannot and can pass many slits, respectively. This paper discovers wave-particle duality's origin of displaying both wave property from plane wave part of the general Fourier expansion and particle property from the general Fourier expansion coefficients with the particle's global property and spins etc. We give the superposition state representation of wave-particle duality, further find the collapse of the duality superposition state to wave or particle state. The collapsed wave or particle state is related to the measure of wave or particle property. Then, we explain why sometimes it's a wave or a particle. Our achieved results are truly tested, and we discover new measured attractive state and quantum wave collapse velocity expression.

TI Realization of a doped quantum antiferromagnet in a Rydberg tweezer
   array
SO NATURE
AB Doping an antiferromagnetic (AFM) Mott insulator is central to our understanding of a variety of phenomena in strongly correlated electrons, including high-temperature superconductors(1,2). To describe the competition between tunnelling t of hole dopants and AFM spin interactions J, theoretical and numerical studies often focus on the paradigmatic t-J model(3) and the direct analogue quantum simulation of this model in the relevant regime of high-particle density has long been sought(4,5). Here we realize a doped quantum antiferromagnet with next-nearest-neighbour (NNN) tunnellings t (refs.(6, 7, 8, 9-10)) and hard-core bosonic holes(11) using a Rydberg tweezer platform. We use coherent dynamics between three Rydberg levels, encoding spins and holes(12), to implement a tunable bosonic t-J-V model allowing us to study previously inaccessible parameter regimes. We observe dynamical phase separation between hole and spin domains for |t/J|<< 1 and demonstrate the formation of repulsively bound hole pairs in a variety of spin backgrounds. The interference between NNN tunnellings t ' and perturbative pair tunnelling gives rise to light and heavy pairs depending on the sign of t. Using the single-site control allows us to study the dynamics of a single hole in 2D square lattice (anti)ferromagnets. The model we implement extends the toolbox of Rydberg tweezer experiments beyond spin-1/2 models(13) to a larger class of t-J and spin-1 models(14,15).

TI Achieving Heisenberg scaling by probe-ancilla interaction in quantum
   metrology
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB The Heisenberg scaling is an ultimate precision limit of parameter estimation allowed by the principles of quantum mechanics, with no counterpart in the classical realm, and has been a long-pursued goal in quantum metrology. It has been known that interactions between the probes can help reach the Heisenberg scaling without entanglement. In this paper, we show that interactions between the probes and the additional dimensions of an ancillary system may also increase the precision of parameter estimation to surpass the standard quantum limit and attain the Heisenberg scaling without entanglement, if the measurement scheme is properly designed. The quantum Fisher information exhibits periodic patterns over the evolution time, implying the existence of optimal time points for measurements that can maximize the quantum Fisher information. By implementing optimizations over the Hamiltonian, the initial states of the probes and the ancillary system, the interaction strength, and the time points for measurements, our protocol achieves the Heisenberg scaling for the parameter of the probe Hamiltonian, in terms of both evolution time and probe number. Our protocol features two aspects: (i) the Heisenberg scaling can be achieved by a product state of the probes and (ii) mere local measurement on the ancilla is sufficient, both of which reduce the quantum resources and the implementation complexity to achieve the Heisenberg scaling. The paper is concluded by the investigation of the effects of noise on this protocol.

TI GRAPE optimization for open quantum systems with time-dependent
   decoherence rates driven by coherent and incoherent controls
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS A-MATHEMATICAL AND THEORETICAL
AB The GRadient Ascent Pulse Engineering (GRAPE) method is widely used for optimization in quantum control. GRAPE is gradient search method based on exact expressions for gradient of the control objective. It has been applied to various coherently controlled closed and open quantum systems. In this work, we adopt the GRAPE method for optimizing objective functionals in open quantum systems driven by both coherent and incoherent controls. In our case, a tailored or engineered environment acts on the controlled system as control via time-dependent decoherence rates(gamma i)(t) or, equivalently, via spectral density n(omega)(t) of the environment. To develop the GRAPE approach for this problem, we compute gradient of various objectives for general Nlevel open quantum systems for the piecewise constant class of control. The case of a single qubit is considered in details and solved analytically. For this case, an explicit analytical expression for evolution and objective gradient is obtained via diagonalization of a 3x3 matrix determining the system's dynamics in the Bloch ball. The diagonalization is obtained by solving a cubic equation via Cardano ' s method. The efficiency of the algorithm is demonstrated through numerical simulations for the state-to-state transition problem and its complexity is estimated. Robustness of the optimal controls is also studied.

TI Experimental Limit on Nonlinear State-Dependent Terms in Quantum Theory
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Linear time evolution is one of the fundamental postulates of quantum theory. Past theoretical attempts to introduce nonlinearity into quantum evolution have violated causality. However, a recent theory has introduced nonlinear state-dependent terms in quantum field theory, preserving causality [D. E. Kaplan and S. Rajendran, Phys. Rev. D 105, 055002 (2022)]. We report the results of an experiment that searches for such terms. Our approach, inspired by the Everett many-worlds interpretation of quantum theory, correlates a binary macroscopic classical voltage with the outcome of a projective measurement of a quantum bit, prepared in a coherent superposition state. Measurement results are recorded in a bit string, which is used to control a voltage switch. Presence of a nonzero voltage reading in cases of no applied voltage is the experimental signature of a nonlinear state-dependent shift of the electromagnetic field operator. We implement blinded measurement and data analysis with three control bit strings. Control of systematic effects is realized by producing one of the control bit strings with a classical random-bit generator. The other two bit strings are generated by measurements performed on a superconducting qubit in an IBM Quantum processor and on a 15N nuclear spin in a nitrogen-vacancy center in diamond. Our measurements find no evidence for electromagnetic quantum state-dependent nonlinearity. We set a bound on the parameter that quantifies this nonlinearity j epsilon gamma j < 4.7 x 10-11, at 90% confidence level.

AB Secure software leasing (SSL) is a quantum cryptographic primitive that enables an authority to lease software to a user by encoding it into a quantum state. SSL prevents users from generating authenticated pirated copies of leased software, where authenticated copies indicate those run on legitimate platforms. Although SSL is a relaxed variant of quantum copy protection that prevents users from generating any copy of leased softwares, it is still meaningful and attractive. Recently, Ananth and La Placa proposed the first SSL scheme. It satisfies a strong security notion called infinite-term security. On the other hand, it has a drawback that it is based on public key quantum money, which is not instantiated with standard cryptographic assumptions so far. Moreover, their scheme only supports a subclass of evasive functions.
   In this work, we present SSL schemes that satisfy a security notion called finite-term security based on the learning with errors assumption (LWE). Finite-term security is weaker than infinite-term security, but it still provides a reasonable security guarantee. Specifically, our contributions consist of the following.
   - We construct a finite-term secure SSL scheme for pseudorandom functions from the LWE assumption against quantum adversaries.
   - We construct a finite-term secure SSL scheme for a subclass of evasive functions from the LWE assumption against sub-exponential quantum adversaries.
   - We construct finite-term secure SSL schemes for the functionalities above with classical communication from the LWE assumption against (sub-exponential) quantum adversaries.
   SSL with classical communication means that entities exchange only classical information though they run quantum computation locally.
   Our crucial tool is two-tier quantum lightning, which is introduced in this work and a relaxed version of quantum lighting. In two-tier quantum lightning schemes, we have a public verification algorithm called semiverification and a private verification algorithm called full-verification. An adversary cannot generate possibly entangled two quantum states whose serial numbers are the same such that one passes the semiverification, and the other also passes the full-verification. We show that we can construct a two-tier quantum lightning scheme from the LWE assumption.

TI Toward a linear-ramp QAOA protocol: evidence of a scaling advantage in
   solving some combinatorial optimization problems
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB The quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) is a promising algorithm for solving combinatorial optimization problems (COPs), with performance governed by variational parameters {gamma i,beta i}i=0p-1\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$${\{{\gamma }_{i},{\beta }_{i}\}}_{i = 0}<^>{p-1}$$\end{document}. While most prior work has focused on classically optimizing these parameters, we demonstrate that fixed linear ramp schedules, linear ramp QAOA (LR-QAOA), can efficiently approximate optimal solutions across diverse COPs. Simulations with up to Nq = 42 qubits and p = 400 layers suggest that the success probability scales as P(x*)approximate to 2-eta(p)Nq+C\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$P({x}<^>{* })\approx {2}<^>{-\eta (p){N}_{q}+C}$$\end{document}, where eta(p) decreases with increasing p. For example, in Weighted Maxcut instances, eta(10) = 0.22 improves to eta(100) = 0.05. Comparisons with classical algorithms, including simulated annealing, Tabu Search, and branch-and-bound, show a scaling advantage for LR-QAOA. We show results of LR-QAOA on multiple QPUs (IonQ, Quantinuum, IBM) with up to Nq = 109 qubits, p = 100, and circuits requiring 21,200 CNOT gates. Finally, we present a noise model based on two-qubit gate counts that accurately reproduces the experimental behavior of LR-QAOA.

TI Dynamics of a strongly coupled quantum heat engine-Computing bath
   observables from the hierarchy of pure states
SO JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS
AB We present a fully quantum dynamical treatment of a quantum heat engine and its baths based on the Hierarchy of Pure States (HOPS), an exact and general method for open quantum system dynamics. We show how the change of the bath energy and the interaction energy can be determined within HOPS for arbitrary coupling strength and smooth time dependence of the modulation protocol. The dynamics of all energetic contributions during the operation can be carefully examined both in its initial transient phase and, also later, in its periodic steady state. A quantum Otto engine with a qubit as an inherently nonlinear work medium is studied in a regime where the energy associated with the interaction Hamiltonian plays an important role for the global energy balance and, thus, must not be neglected when calculating its power and efficiency. We confirm that the work required to drive the coupling with the baths sensitively depends on the speed of the modulation protocol. Remarkably, departing from the conventional scheme of well-separated phases by allowing for temporal overlap, we discover that one can even gain energy from the modulation of bath interactions. We visualize these various work contributions using the analog of state change diagrams of thermodynamic cycles. We offer a concise, full presentation of HOPS with its extension to bath observables, as it serves as a universal tool for the numerically exact description of general quantum dynamical (thermodynamic) scenarios far from the weak-coupling limit.

TI Excited States of Coherent Harmonic Qubits With Long-Range Photon
   Coupling and Dissipation
SO ANNALEN DER PHYSIK
AB It is known that ensembles of interacting oscillators or qubits can exhibit the phenomenon of quantum synchronization. In this work, a set of identical two-state systems that we call "harmonic qubits" is considered, because the kinetic part of their Hamiltonian is of the form , coupled through a multi-state "photon" mode subject to dissipation. It has been proven numerically that when the coupling between the qubits and the photon is sufficiently strong, the ensemble condenses into a ground state with negative energy, the energy gap is proportional to and there are clear cross correlations . Here, the energy spectrum of the excited states of this system is the point of interest. In order to obtain information on the coherent transitions, a weak coupling of each qubit is introduced with an external oscillator of variable frequency and it is checked via Monte Carlo time evolution for which values of variations in the occupation of the external oscillator occur. After adding a second external oscillator coupled to the first only through the qubits, the energy transfer is also considered between the two external oscillators in dependence on their frequency, a transfer which is possible only through the excited states of the qubits. Above threshold (when ), resonant transfer is found at frequencies that are definitely higher, and growing with . This signals the presence of collective excited states, separated by large energy gaps, which are absent below threshold.

TI Quantum Theory in Finite Dimension Cannot Explain Every General Process
   with Finite Memory
SO COMMUNICATIONS IN MATHEMATICAL PHYSICS
AB Arguably, the largest class of stochastic processes generated by means of a finite memory consists of those that are sequences of observations produced by sequential measurements in a suitable generalized probabilistic theory (GPT). These are constructed from a finite-dimensional memory evolving under a set of possible linear maps, and with probabilities of outcomes determined by linear functions of the memory state. Examples of such models are given by classical hidden Markov processes, where the memory state is a probability distribution, and at each step it evolves according to a non-negative matrix, and hidden quantum Markov processes, where the memory is a finite-dimensional quantum system, and at each step it evolves according to a completely positive map. Here we show that the set of processes admitting a finite-dimensional explanation do not need to be explainable in terms of either classical probability or quantum mechanics. To wit, we exhibit families of processes that have a finite-dimensional explanation, defined manifestly by the dynamics of an explicitly given GPT, but that do not admit a quantum, and therefore not even classical, explanation in finite dimension. Furthermore, we present a family of quantum processes on qubits and qutrits that do not admit a classical finite-dimensional realization, which includes examples introduced earlier by Fox, Rubin, Dharmadikari and Nadkarni as functions of infinite-dimensional Markov chains, and lower bound the size of the memory of a classical model realizing a noisy version of the qubit processes.

TI Evaluation of the Impact of Concentration and Extraction Methods on the
   Targeted Sequencing of Human Viruses from Wastewater
SO ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY
AB Sequencing human viruses in wastewater is challenging due to their low abundance compared to the total microbial background. This study compared the impact of four virus concentration/extraction methods (Innovaprep, Nanotrap, Promega, and Solids extraction) on probe-capture enrichment for human viruses followed by sequencing. Different concentration/extraction methods yielded distinct virus profiles. Innovaprep ultrafiltration (following solids removal) had the highest sequencing sensitivity and richness, resulting in the successful assembly of several near-complete human virus genomes. However, it was less sensitive in detecting SARS-CoV-2 by digital polymerase chain reaction (dPCR) compared to Promega and Nanotrap. Across all preparation methods, astroviruses and polyomaviruses were the most highly abundant human viruses, and SARS-CoV-2 was rare. These findings suggest that sequencing success can be increased using methods that reduce nontarget nucleic acids in the extract, though the absolute concentration of total extracted nucleic acid, as indicated by Qubit, and targeted viruses, as indicated by dPCR, may not be directly related to targeted sequencing performance. Further, using broadly targeted sequencing panels may capture viral diversity but risks losing signals for specific low-abundance viruses. Overall, this study highlights the importance of aligning wet lab and bioinformatic methods with specific goals when employing probe-capture enrichment for human virus sequencing from wastewater.

TI Finite-Frequency Noise and Dynamical Charge Susceptibility in Single and
   Double Quantum Dot Systems
SO ANNALEN DER PHYSIK
AB This study reports on finite-frequency noise and dynamical charge susceptibility in out-of-equilibrium quantum dot systems. Both single and double quantum dots connected to one or two reservoirs of electrons are considered, and these quantities are calculated by using the non-equilibrium Green function technique. The results are discussed in the light of experimental results, particularly in the low-frequency limit for which an interpretation in terms of an equivalent RC-circuit is made. Anti-symmetrized noise is also studied, defined as the difference between absorption and emission noises, and its relationship with the dynamical charge susceptibility in single quantum dots is established. In double quantum dots, the similarities between the dynamical charge susceptibility, the absorption noise, and the dot occupancy, are highlighted by comparing their respective variations with the bias voltage applied between the two reservoirs, and the detuning energy defined as the difference between the lowest level energies in the two dots.
   The similarities between finite-frequency noise and dynamical charge susceptibility in quantum dots, the qubit building block, have been studied. In a single-level dot system, an explicit relationship between these quantities has been established. In multi-level dot or double dot systems, studies of the variation of finite-frequency noise and dynamical charge susceptibility with bias voltage and detuning energy show similarities that have been characterized.image

TI Quantum limits of superconducting-photonic links and their extension to
   millimeter waves
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB Photonic addressing of superconducting circuits has been proposed to overcome wiring complexity and heat-load challenges. However, such superconducting-photonic links suffer from an efficiency-noise trade-off that limits scalability. This trade-off arises because increasing power conversion efficiency entails reducing optical power, which makes the converted signal susceptible to shot noise. We analyze this trade-off and find that the laser-driven qubit gate infidelity scales inversely with the number of photons used. While methods such as nonlinear detection or squeezed light could mitigate this effect, we consider generating higher-frequency electrical signals, such as millimeter waves (100 GHz), using laser light. At these higher frequencies, circuits have higher operating temperatures and cooling power budgets and alleviate constraints posed by the trade-off. Therefore, we demonstrate an optically driven cryogenic millimeter-wave source with a maximum power efficiency of 8 x 10-5 that can generate a maximum of 0.7 mu W of 80 GHz power, with a 1200-thermal-photon equivalent of added noise at 4 K. Using this source, we perform frequency-domain spectroscopy of superconducting NbTiN resonators at 80-90 GHz. Our results show a promising approach to lessen the efficiency-noise constraints on superconducting-photonic links, while leveraging the benefits of photonic signal delivery. Further optimization of power efficiency and noise at high frequencies could make scalable photonic control of superconducting qubits viable at temperatures exceeding 1 K.

TI Logical rotation of non-separable states via uniformly self-assembled
   chiral superstructures
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB The next generation of high-capacity, multi-task optical informatics requires sophisticated manipulation of multiple degrees of freedom (DoFs) of light, especially when they are coupled in a non-separable way. Vector beam, as a typical non-separable state between the spin and orbital angular momentum DoFs, mathematically akin to entangled qubits, has inspired multifarious theories and applications in both quantum and classical regimes. Although qubit rotation is a vital and ubiquitous operation in quantum informatics, its classical analogue is rarely studied. Here, we demonstrate the logical rotation of vectorial non-separable states via the uniform self-assembled chiral superstructures, with favorable controllability, high compactness and exemption from formidable alignment. Photonic band engineering of such 1D chiral photonic crystal renders the incident-angle-dependent evolution of the spatially-variant polarizations. The logical rotation angle of a non-separable state can be tuned in a wide range over 4 pi by this single homogeneous device, flexibly providing a set of distinguished logic gates. Potential applications, including angular motion tracking and proof-of-principle logic network, are demonstrated by specific configuration. This work brings important insight into soft matter photonics and present an elegant strategy to harness high-dimensional photonic states.
   The logical rotation of non-separable states with a large tunable range is demonstrated by the uniformly self-assembled chiral superstructures, which enables a set of logic gates, proof-of-principle logic network, and angular motion tracking.

TI Enhanced steady-state coherence via repeated system-bath interactions
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB The appearance of steady-state coherence (SSC) from system-bath interactions proves that quantum effects can appear without an external drive. Such SSC could become a resource to demonstrate a quantum advantage in the applications. We predict the generation of SSC if the target system repeatedly interacts with independent and noncorrelated bath elements. To describe their behavior, we use the collision model approach of systembath interactions, where the system interacts with one bath element (initially in an incoherent state) at a time, asymptotically (in the fast-collision regime) mimicking a macroscopic Markovian bath coupled to the target system. Therefore, the SSC qualitatively appears to be the same as if the continuous Markovian bath were used. We confirm that the presence of composite system-bath interactions under the rotating-wave approximation is the necessary condition for the generation of SSC using thermal resources in collision models. Remarkably, we show that SSC substantially increases if the target system interacts collectively with more than one bath element at a time. A few bath elements collectively interacting with the target system is sufficient to increase SSC at nonzero temperatures at the cost of a tolerable lowering of the final state purity. From the thermodynamic perspective, the SSC generation in our collision models is inevitably linked to a nonzero power input (and thus heat dissipated to the bath) necessary to reach the steady state, although such energetic cost can be lower compared to cases relying on SSC nongenerating interactions.

This platform uniquely combines high-T-c superconductivity, a topological band structure, and electron correlations into a single material, successfully avoiding the difficulties of achieving intrinsic p-wave topological superconductors and superconductor/topological insulator heterojunction systems. The most important advantages of the iron-Majorana platform are its wide topological region and large quasiparticle gap, which provide strong topological protection for pure Majorana zero modes (MZMs). When the superconductor/topological insulator heterojunction systems, e.g., InAs/Al nanowire, have the controversies of being trivial Majorana-like states, the iron-Majorana platform, which possesses well-understood physics and clear experimental evidence of vortex MZMs, is more likely to be a true MZM. However, unlike the nanowire Majorana systems with clear theoretical proposals for braiding schemes, the iron-Majorana system has no concrete method for exchanging the vortex MZMs or constructing a topological qubit. In this article, we propose a roadmap of the future efforts required for more physical exploration and achieving the non-Abelian exchange statistics of MZMs based on the iron-Majorana platform.

TI Survey of the hierarchical equations of motion in tensor-train format
   for non-Markovian quantum dynamics
SO EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL-SPECIAL TOPICS
AB This work is a pedagogical survey about the hierarchical equations of motion and their implementation with the tensor-train format. These equations are a great standard in non-perturbative non-Markovian open quantum systems. They are exact for harmonic baths in the limit of relevant truncation of the hierarchy. We recall the link with the perturbative second-order time convolution equations also known as the Bloch-Redfield equations. Some theoretical tools characterizing non-Markovian dynamics such as the non-Markovianity measures or the dynamical map are also briefly discussed in the context of HEOM simulations. The main points of the tensor-train expansion are illustrated in an example with a qubit interacting with a bath described by a Lorentzian spectral density. Finally, we give three illustrative applications in which the system-bath coupling operator is similar to that of the analytical treatment. The first example revisits a model in which population-to-coherence transfer via the bath creates a long-lasting coherence between two states. The second one is devoted to the computation of stationary absorption and emission spectra. We illustrate the link between the spectral density and the Stokes shift in situations with and without nonadiabatic interaction. Finally, we simulate an excitation transfer when the spectral density is discretized by undamped modes to illustrate a situation in which the TT formulation is more efficient than the standard one.

TI Deterministic Shallow Dopant Implantation in Silicon with Detection
   Confidence Upper-Bound to 99.85% by Ion-Solid Interactions
SO ADVANCED MATERIALS
AB Silicon chips containing arrays of single dopant atoms can be the material of choice for classical and quantum devices that exploit single donor spins. For example, group-V donors implanted in isotopically purified Si-28 crystals are attractive for large-scale quantum computers. Useful attributes include long nuclear and electron spin lifetimes of P-31, hyperfine clock transitions in Bi-209 or electrically controllable Sb-123 nuclear spins. Promising architectures require the ability to fabricate arrays of individual near-surface dopant atoms with high yield. Here, an on-chip detector electrode system with 70 eV root-mean-square noise (approximate to 20 electrons) is employed to demonstrate near-room-temperature implantation of single 14 keV P-31(+) ions. The physics model for the ion-solid interaction shows an unprecedented upper-bound single-ion-detection confidence of 99.85 +/- 0.02% for near-surface implants. As a result, the practical controlled silicon doping yield is limited by materials engineering factors including surface gate oxides in which detected ions may stop. For a device with 6 nm gate oxide and 14 keV P-31(+) implants, a yield limit of 98.1% is demonstrated. Thinner gate oxides allow this limit to converge to the upper-bound. Deterministic single-ion implantation can therefore be a viable materials engineering strategy for scalable dopant architectures in silicon devices.

TI Topological spin-orbit-coupled fermions beyond rotating wave
   approximation
SO SCIENCE BULLETIN
AB The realization of spin-orbit-coupled ultracold gases has driven a wide range of research and is typically based on the rotating wave approximation (RWA). By neglecting the counter -rotating terms, RWA characterizes a single near -resonant spin-orbit (SO) coupling in a two -level system. Here, we propose and experimentally realize a new scheme for achieving a pair of two-dimensional (2D) SO couplings for ultracold fermions beyond RWA. This work not only realizes the first anomalous Floquet topological Fermi gas beyond RWA, but also significantly improves the lifetime of the 2D -SO -coupled Fermi gas. Based on pump-probe quench measurements, we observe a deterministic phase relation between two sets of SO couplings, which is characteristic of our beyond-RWA scheme and enables the two SO couplings to be simultaneously tuned to the optimum 2D configurations. We observe intriguing band topology by measuring two -ring band -inversion surfaces, quantitatively consistent with a Floquet topological Fermi gas in the regime of high Chern numbers. Our study can open an avenue to explore exotic SO physics and anomalous topological states based on long-lived SO -coupled ultracold fermions. (c) 2024 Science China Press.

TI Generation of full-length circular RNA libraries for Oxford Nanopore
   long-read sequencing
SO PLOS ONE
AB Circular RNA (circRNA) is a noncoding RNA class with important implications for gene expression regulation, mostly by interaction with other RNA species or RNA-binding proteins. While the commonly applied short-read Illumina RNA-sequencing techniques can be used to detect circRNAs, their full sequence is not revealed. However, the complete sequence information is needed to analyze potential interactions and thus the mechanism of action of circRNAs. Here, we present an improved protocol to enrich and sequence full-length circRNAs by using the Oxford Nanopore long-read sequencing platform. The protocol involves an enrichment of lowly abundant circRNAs by exonuclease treatment and negative selection of linear RNAs. Then, a cDNA library is created and amplified by PCR. This protocol provides enough material for several sequencing runs. The library is used as input for ligation-based sequencing together with native barcoding. Stringent quality control of the libraries is ensured by a combination of Qubit, Fragment Analyzer and qRT-PCR. Multiplexing of up to 4 libraries yields in total more than 1-2 Million reads per library, of which 1-2% are circRNA-specific reads with >99% of them full-length. The protocol works well with human cancer cell lines. We further provide suggestions for the bioinformatic analysis of the created data, as well as the limitations of our approach together with recommendations for troubleshooting and interpretation. Taken together, this protocol enables reliable full-length analysis of circRNAs, a noncoding RNA type involved in a growing number of physiologic and pathologic conditions.

TI Quantum true random number generation on IBM?s cloud platform
SO JOURNAL OF KING SAUD UNIVERSITY COMPUTER AND INFORMATION SCIENCES
AB Random numbers are the lifeline of any cryptographic operation in modern computing. Quantum True Random Number Generator (QTRNG) can yield real random data to replace random-looking periodic sequences. Here, we present the fastest QTRNG on factual Quantum Computational Devices (QCD) locally on our device to save time. To construct a random number generator, the IBM Q Experience called Qiskit is used. The ease of our source Hadamard gate pooled with its verifiably sole randomness is imperative for attaining quantum random number generators at no cost. The inner matrix product of the square of the Hadamard gate is proved to be identified in the quantum lab. Applying the H gate twice on the quan-tum register cancelled out the H gate pair. It acted as a single Hadamard gate that was practically visu-alised using the IMB Q experience. The 24-qubit random number is experimented with and investigated in this work. The min-entropy of such generated random numbers is 0.0007244 with the worst-case entropy value of 0.999507. Besides, subsequent verification of genuine randomness was confirmed by steering restart experimentation, & the statistical properties of TRNG were evaluated over autocorrela-tion study, National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) SP 800-90B & 800-22 tests.

TI Exact amplitudes of parametric processes in driven Josephson circuits
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB We present a general approach for analyzing arbitrary parametric processes in Josephson circuits within a single-degree-of-freedom approximation. Introducing a systematic normal-ordered expansion for the Hamiltonian of parametrically driven superconducting circuits, we present a flexible procedure to describe parametric processes and to compare and optimize different circuit designs for particular applications. We obtain formally exact amplitudes ["supercoefficients" (SCs)] of these parametric processes for driven circuits based on superconducting nonlinear asymmetric inductive elements and superconducting quantum interference devices. The corresponding amplitudes contain complete information about the circuit topology, the form of the nonlinearity, and the parametric drive, making them, in particular, well suited for the study of the strong-drive regime. We present a closed-form expression for SCs describing circuits without stray inductors and a tractable formulation for those with it. We demonstrate the versatility of the approach by applying it to the estimation of Kerr-cat qubit Hamiltonian parameters and by examining the criterion for the emergence of chaos in Kerr-cat qubits. Additionally, we extend the approach to multipledegree-of-freedom circuits comprising multiple linear modes weakly coupled to a single nonlinear mode. We apply this generalized framework to study the activation of a beam-splitter interaction between two cavities coupled via driven nonlinear elements. Finally, utilizing the flexibility of the proposed approach, we separately derive SCs for the higher-harmonics model of Josephson junctions, circuits with multiple drives, and the expansion of the Hamiltonian in the exact eigenstate basis for Josephson circuits with specific symmetries.

TI Quantifying channel coherence via the norm distance
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS A-MATHEMATICAL AND THEORETICAL
AB Quantifying the number of resources contained in a physical object has been one of the core topics in the resource theory of coherence. In this paper, we introduce the dynamical coherence measures based on a class of norms in the classical channel setting. It is proved that it satisfies faithfulness, decreases monotonically under the maximally incoherent superchannels, and is convex. Moreover, we show that it satisfies subadditivity under both the composition and tensor product of channels. Especially, the diamond measure as a special case is discussed in detail, it can reduce to trace norm of coherence, satisfies amortization inequality, and can be calculated efficiently using a semidefinite program. In addition, we introduce the creation-coherent diamond measure and find that neither the detection coherence nor the creation coherence of a channel exceeds the coherence of the channel, which does not exceed the purity of the channel. Second, we introduce the corresponding dephasing measure, which is a dynamical coherence measure under the dephasing-covariant incoherent superchannels. Meanwhile, we also introduce the dephasing diamond measure as a special case. Third, we use the dephasing diamond measure to accurately calculate the coherence values of some important noisy channels such as amplitude damping channel, phase damping channel, and depolarizing channel, respectively, and give the sufficient and necessary conditions for an unital qubit channel with a parameter probability vector to be a coherent channel. Finally, the operational interpretation of our diamond measure in the binary channel discrimination task is investigated.

TI Rapid Identification of Lineage and Drug Resistance in Clinical Samples
   of Mycobacterium tuberculosis
SO MICROORGANISMS
AB Background: Mycobacterium tuberculosis is a slow-growing bacterium, which could delay its diagnosis and, therefore, promote the spread of the disease. Whole-genome sequencing allows us to obtain the complete drug-resistance profile of the strain; however, bacterial cultivation of clinical samples, along with complex processing, is required. Methods: In this work, we explore AmpliSeq, an amplicon-based enrichment method for preparing libraries for targeted next-generation sequencing, to identify lineage and drug resistance directly from clinical samples. Results: In our study, 111 clinical samples were tested. The lineage was identified in 100% of the culture-derived samples (52/52), in 95% of the smear (BK)-positive clinical samples (38/40) and in 42.1% of the BK-negative clinical samples (8/19). The drug-resistance profile was accurately identified in all but 11 samples, in which some phenotypic and genotypic discrepancies were found. In this respect, our panels were not exact in the detection of streptomycin resistance for isolates derived from clinical samples, as an extremely high number of SNPs in the rrs and rrl genes were detected due to cross-contamination. Conclusion: This technique has demonstrated high sensitivity in obtaining the drug-resistance profile of the isolates, as even those samples with DNA concentrations below the detection limit of Qubit produced a result. AmpliSeq technology is cheaper than whole-genome sequencing, easy to perform by laboratory technicians and applicable to any microorganism using the Ion Torrent platform.

TI Moiré excitons and exciton-polaritons: a review
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS-CONDENSED MATTER
AB Distinguished by their long lifetimes, strong dipolar interactions, and periodic confinement, moir & eacute; excitons are fertile ground for realising interaction-driven excitonic phases beyond conventional semiconductor systems. Formed in twisted or lattice-mismatched van der Waals heterostructures, these excitons are shaped by a periodic potential landscape that enables the engineering of flat bands, strong interactions, and long-lived localised states. This has opened pathways to explore strongly correlated phases, including excitonic insulators, superfluids, and supersolids, potentially stable even at room temperature. When embedded in optical cavities, moir & eacute; excitons hybridise with photons to form moir & eacute; exciton-polaritons, a new class of quasiparticles exhibiting enhanced optical nonlinearities and novel topological features. In this review, we survey the theoretical foundations and experimental progress in the field of moir & eacute; excitons and polaritons. We begin by introducing the formation mechanisms of moir & eacute; patterns in two-dimensional semiconductors, and describe their impact on exciton confinement, optical selection rules, and spin-valley physics. We then discuss recent advances in the realisation of many-body excitonic phases and exciton-based probes of electronic correlations. Finally, we explore the novel aspects of moir & eacute; polaritons, highlighting their unique nonlinear and topological properties. By bridging quantum optics, nanophotonics, and correlated electron systems, moir & eacute; excitons offer a powerful solid-state platform for quantum simulation, optoelectronic applications, and many-body photonics.

TI Confinement induced frustration in a one-dimensional Z2 lattice gauge
   theory
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB Coupling dynamical charges to gauge fields can result in highly non-local interactions with a linear confining potential. As a consequence, individual particles bind into mesons which, in one dimension, become the new constituents of emergent Luttinger liquids (LLs). Furthermore, at commensurate fillings, different Mott-insulating states can be stabilized by including nearest-neighbour (NN) interactions among charges. However, rich phase diagrams expected in such models have not been fully explored and still lack comprehensive theoretical explanation. Here, by combining numerical and analytical tools, we study a simple one-dimensional Z2 lattice gauge theory at half-filling, where U(1) matter is coupled to gauge fields and interacts through NN repulsion. We uncover a rich phase diagram where the local NN interaction stabilizes a Mott state of individual charges (or partons) on the one hand, and an LL of confined mesons on the other. Furthermore, at the interface between these two phases, we uncover a highly frustrated regime arising due to the competition between the local NN repulsion and the non-local confining interactions, realizing a pre-formed parton plasma. Our work is motivated by the recent progress in ultracold atom experiments, where such simple model could be readily implemented. For this reason we calculate the static structure factor which we propose as a simple probe to explore the phase diagram in an experimental setup.

TI Initial longitudinal velocity resolved spiderlike photoelectron momentum
   distributions in hydrogen
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB Tunneling ionization of atoms is the basis of many phenomena and techniques, which requires people to be able to comprehensively understand this crucial physical process. Recent experiments have demonstrated the existence of the nonzero initial longitudinal momentum spread at the tunnel exit. However, the initial longitudinal velocity is usually set to be zero in the adiabatic regime. In this work, we numerically study that the initial longitudinal velocity of ionized-out electrons plays the role in the spiderlike photoelectron momentum distributions in hydrogen atom by using the semiclassical rescattering model and the time-dependent Schrodinger equation. Nonzero longitudinal initial velocity, no matter whether it is an offset or an offset distribution, is considered in the semiclassical rescattering model. Longitudinal cut-plot and transverse cut-plot of the photoelectron momentum distribution are discussed. The final longitudinal momentum of the electron is found to be sensitive to the initial longitudinal velocity, which offers us a method of determining the information about the initial longitudinal velocity from a photoelectron momentum distribution according to this linear relationship. We unveil that either an offset or an offset distribution for the initial longitudinal velocity can perfectly reproduce the same spiderlike photoelectron momentum distributions. The semiclassical results are backed by the full quantum simulation. It is expected that more precise research is required to deepen the knowledge of the initial longitudinal velocity in strong field ionization of atoms.

TI Gauge protection in non-abelian lattice gauge theories
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB Protection of gauge invariance in experimental realizations of lattice gauge theories based on energy-penalty schemes has recently stimulated impressive efforts both theoretically and in setups of quantum synthetic matter. A major challenge is the reliability of such schemes in non-abelian gauge theories where local conservation laws do not commute. Here, we show through exact diagonalization (ED) that non-abelian gauge invariance can be reliably controlled using gauge-protection terms that energetically stabilize the target gauge sector in Hilbert space, suppressing gauge violations due to unitary gauge-breaking errors. We present analytic arguments that predict a volume-independent protection strength V, which when sufficiently large leads to the emergence of an adjusted gauge theory with the same local gauge symmetry up to least a timescale proportional to root V / V-0(3). Thereafter, a renormalized gauge theory dominates up to a timescale proportional to exp(V/ V-0)/ V-0 with V-0 a volume-independent energy factor, similar to the case of faulty abelian gauge theories. Moreover, we show for certain experimentally relevant errors that single-body protection terms robustly suppress gauge violations up to all accessible evolution times in ED, and demonstrate that the adjusted gauge theory emerges in this case as well. These single-body protection terms can be readily implemented with fewer engineering requirements than the ideal gauge theory itself in current ultracold-atom setups and noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices.

TI Comparison of Matrix Product State and Multiconfiguration Time-Dependent
   Hartree Methods for Nonadiabatic Dynamics of Exciton Dissociation
SO JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL THEORY AND COMPUTATION
AB The excited-state dynamics of organic molecules, molecular aggregates, and donor-acceptor clusters is typically governed by the interplay of electronic excitations and, due to their flexibility and soft bonding, by the interaction with their vibrations. This interaction in these systems can be characterized by a few relevant electronic states that are coupled to numerous vibrational normal modes, encompassing a vast configurational space of the molecules. The full quantum simulation of these type of systems has been long dominated by the multiconfiguration time-dependent Hartree (MCTDH) approach and its multilayer variants, which are considered the gold standard in the presence of electron-vibration coupling with a large number of modes. Recently, also the matrix product state ansatz (MPS) with appropriate time-evolution schemes has been applied to these types of Hamiltonians. In this article, we provide a numerical comparison of excited-state dynamics between the MCTDH and MPS approaches for two electron-vibration coupled systems. Notably, we consider two models for exciton dissociation at a P3HT:PCBM heterojunction, comprising two electronic states and 100 vibrational modes, and 26 electronic states and 113 vibrational modes, respectively. While both methods agree very well for the first model, more pronounced deviations are found for the second model. We trace back the divergence between the methods to the different way entanglement is treated.

TI Optical-Comb-Based Frequency Stability Transfer Across the Spectrum With
   a Multichannel FPGA
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ULTRASONICS FERROELECTRICS AND FREQUENCY CONTROL
AB Using the optical comb as a transfer oscillator is an effective approach to convert the spectral properties of ultrastable lasers to other wavelength domains. We describe a digital locking system that enables this process to be replicated for several lasers at a time, supporting the simultaneous and independent lock of up to six lasers to a single, high-performance reference oscillator. The locks are robust, easily reconfigured, and contribute a short-term instability lower than 3x10(-18) at 1 s, even when the comb is operated in the broad-linewidth regime and with no need for lasers prestabilization. With this system, we transfer the coherence of the ultrastable clock laser of a Yb optical lattice clock at 1156 nm to various lasers in the 1550 nm region, including the one used for frequency dissemination with long-distance fibers, with less than 1x10(-17) instability at 1 s. The digital implementation enables a modular approach with enhanced control over operational parameters, minimizing setup complexity and hardware-related undesired effects. It also allows for immediate reconfiguration and seamless upgrades, being suitable for applications requiring multiple ultrastable lasers at different wavelengths, such as local or distributed optical clock ensembles, coherent spectroscopy, and quantum simulation.

TI Heat transfer in transversely coupled qubits: optically controlled
   thermal modulator with common reservoirs
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS A-MATHEMATICAL AND THEORETICAL
AB This paper systematically studied heat transfer through two transversely coupled qubits in contact with two types of heat reservoirs. One is the independent heat reservoir which essentially interacts with only a single qubit, the other is the common heat reservoir which is allowed to simultaneously interact with two qubits. Compared to independent heat reservoirs, common reservoirs always suppress heat current in most cases. However, the common environment could enhance heat current, if the dissipation rate corresponding to the higher eigenfrequency is significantly higher than that corresponding to the lower eigenfrequency. In particular, in the case of resonant coupling of two qubits and the proper dissipations, the steady state can be decomposed into a stationary dark state which does not evolve and contributes zero heat current, and a residual steady state which corresponds to the maximal heat current. This dark state enables us to control steady-state heat current with an external control field and design a thermal modulator. In addition, we find that inverse heat currents could be present in the dissipative subchannels between the system and reservoirs, which interprets the suppression roles of common heat reservoirs. We also calculate the concurrence of assistance (COA) of the system and find that heat current and COA have the same trend with temperature, which further indicates that entanglement can be regarded as a resource to regulate heat transport.

TI Enhancing Disorder-Free Localization through Dynamically Emergent Local
   Symmetries
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Disorder-free localization is a recently discovered phenomenon of nonergodicity that can emerge in quantum many-body systems hosting gauge symmetries when the initial state is prepared in a superposition of gauge superselection sectors. Thermalization is then prevented up to all accessible evolution times despite the model being nonintegrable and translation invariant. In a recent work [Halimeh et al., arXiv:2111.02427 (2021)], it has been shown that terms linear in the gauge-symmetry generator stabilize disorder-free localization in U(1) gauge theories against gauge errors that couple different superselection sectors. Here, we show in the case of Z2 gauge theories that disorder-free localization can not only be stabilized, but also enhanced by the addition of translation-invariant terms linear in a local Z2 pseudogenerator that acts identically to the full generator in a single superselection sector, but not necessarily outside of it. We show analytically and numerically how this leads through the quantum Zeno effect to the dynamical emergence of a renormalized gauge theory with an enhanced local symmetry, which contains the Z2 gauge symmetry of the ideal model, associated with the Z2 pseudogenerator. The resulting proliferation of superselection sectors due to this dynamically emergent gauge theory creates an effective disorder greater than that in the original model, thereby enhancing disorder-free localization. We demonstrate the experimental feasibility of the Z2 pseudogenerator by providing a detailed readily implementable experimental proposal for the observation of disorder-free localization in a Rydberg setup.

TI Entropy production and statistical relaxation of dipolar bosons and
   fermions in interaction quench dynamics
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW E
AB We study the out-of-equilibrium dynamics of dipolar bosons and fermions after a sudden change in the interaction strength from zero to a finite repulsive value. We simulate the interaction quench on the initial state which is the ground state of harmonic potential with noninteracting bosons and fermions. We solve the timedependent many-boson Schr & ouml;dinger equation exactly using numerical methods. To understand the many-body dynamics we analyze several measures of many-body information entropy, monitoring their time evolution and assessing their dependence on interaction strength. We establish that for weak interaction quench the dynamics is statistics independent, both dipolar bosons and fermions do not relax, whereas it is significantly different for dipolar bosons from that of dipolar fermions in the stronger interaction quench. While dipolar bosons exhibit concurrent signature of relaxation in all entropy measures, dipolar fermions fail to relax, exhibiting modulated oscillation in all entropy dynamics. For dipolar bosons and larger interaction quench, the many-body information entropy measures dynamically approach the value predicted for the Gaussian orthogonal ensemble of random matrices, implying statistical relaxation and ergodicity. The entire relaxation process and signature of ergodicity are established by three unique features: dynamical delocalization in Hilbert space, violent orbital fragmentation, and saturation of all entropy measures to the maximum entropy states in the long-time dynamics. It highlights the importance of many-body effects with a possible exploration in quantum simulation with ultracold atoms.

TI Phase Transitions and Remnants of Fractionalization at Finite
   Temperature in the Triangular Lattice Quantum Loop Model
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB The quantum loop and dimer models are archetypal correlated systems with local constraints. With natural foundations in statistical mechanics, they are of direct relevance to various important physical concepts and systems, such as topological order, lattice gauge theories, geometric frustrations, or more recently Rydberg array quantum simulators. However, how the thermal fluctuations interact with constraints has not been explored in the important class of nonbipartite geometries. Here we study, via unbiased quantum Monte Carlo simulations and field theoretical analysis, the finite-temperature phase diagram of the quantum loop model on the triangular lattice. We discover that the recently identified, "hidden" vison plaquette (VP) quantum crystal [X. Ran et al., Hidden orders and phase transitions for the fully packed quantum loop model on the triangular lattice, Commun. Phys. 7, 207 (2024)] experiences a finite-temperature continuous transition, which smoothly connects to the (2 + 1)d Cubic* quantum critical point separating the VP and Z2 quantum spin liquid phases. This finite-temperature phase transition acquires a unique property of "remnants of fractionalization" at finite temperature, in that, both the cubic order parameter-the plaquette loop resonance-and its constituent-the vison field-exhibit independent criticality signatures. This phase transition is connected to a three-state Potts transition between the lattice nematic phase and the high-temperature disordered phase. We discuss the relevance of our results for current experiments on quantum simulation platforms.

TI Topological prethermal strong zero modes on superconducting processors
SO NATURE
AB Symmetry-protected topological phases1, 2, 3-4 cannot be described by any local order parameter and are beyond the conventional symmetry-breaking model5. They are characterized by topological boundary modes that remain stable under symmetry respecting perturbations1, 2, 3-4,6, 7-8. In clean, gapped systems without disorder, the stability of these edge modes is restricted to the zero-temperature manifold; at finite temperatures, interactions with mobile thermal excitations lead to their decay9, 10-11. Here we report the observation of a distinct type of topological edge mode12, 13-14, which is protected by emergent symmetries and persists across the entire spectrum, in an array of 100 programmable superconducting qubits. Through digital quantum simulation of a one-dimensional disorder-free stabilizer Hamiltonian, we observe robust long-lived topological edge modes over up to 30 cycles for a wide range of initial states. We show that the interaction between these edge modes and bulk excitations can be suppressed by dimerizing the stabilizer strength, leading to an emergent U(1) x U(1) symmetry in the prethermal regime of the system. Furthermore, we exploit these topological edge modes as logical qubits and prepare a logical Bell state, which exhibits persistent coherence, despite the system being disorder-free and at finite temperature. Our results establish a viable digital simulation approach15, 16, 17-18 to experimentally study topological matter at finite temperature and demonstrate a potential route to construct long-lived, robust boundary qubits in disorder-free systems.

TI Monte Carlo Simulations in Nanomedicine: Advancing Cancer Imaging and
   Therapy
SO NANOMATERIALS
AB Monte Carlo (MC) simulations have become important in advancing nanoparticle (NP)-based applications for cancer imaging and therapy. This review explores the critical role of MC simulations in modeling complex biological interactions, optimizing NP designs, and enhancing the precision of therapeutic and diagnostic strategies. Key findings highlight the ability of MC simulations to predict NP bio-distribution, radiation dosimetry, and treatment efficacy, providing a robust framework for addressing the stochastic nature of biological systems. Despite their contributions, MC simulations face challenges such as modeling biological complexity, computational demands, and the scarcity of reliable nanoscale data. However, emerging technologies, including hybrid modeling approaches, high-performance computing, and quantum simulation, are poised to overcome these limitations. Furthermore, novel advancements such as FLASH radiotherapy, multifunctional NPs, and patient-specific data integration are expanding the capabilities and clinical relevance of MC simulations. This topical review underscores the transformative potential of MC simulations in bridging fundamental research and clinical translation. By facilitating personalized nanomedicine and streamlining regulatory and clinical trial processes, MC simulations offer a pathway toward more effective, tailored, and accessible cancer treatments. The continued evolution of simulation techniques, driven by interdisciplinary collaboration and technological innovation, ensures that MC simulations will remain at the forefront of nanomedicine's progress.

TI Accelerated quantum Monte Carlo with probabilistic computers
SO COMMUNICATIONS PHYSICS
AB Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) techniques have been very successful in quantum simulation. This paper shows a pathway to provide orders of magnitude speedup to QMC simulations through massively parallel architectures (both digital and mixed signal) while maintaining a scaling advantage over QMC implemented in software.
   Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) techniques are widely used in a variety of scientific problems and much work has been dedicated to developing optimized algorithms that can accelerate QMC on standard processors (CPU). With the advent of various special purpose devices and domain specific hardware, it has become increasingly important to establish clear benchmarks of what improvements these technologies offer compared to existing technologies. In this paper, we demonstrate 2 to 3 orders of magnitude acceleration of a standard QMC algorithm using a specially designed digital processor, and a further 2 to 3 orders of magnitude by mapping it to a clockless analog processor. Our demonstration provides a roadmap for 5 to 6 orders of magnitude acceleration for a transverse field Ising model (TFIM) and could possibly be extended to other QMC models as well. The clockless analog hardware can be viewed as the classical counterpart of the quantum annealer and provides performance within a factor of < 10 of the latter. The convergence time for the clockless analog hardware scales with the number of qubits as similar to N, improving the similar to N-2 scaling for CPU implementations, but appears worse than that reported for quantum annealers by D-Wave.

TI Linear response for pseudo-Hermitian Hamiltonian systems: Application to
   PT-symmetric qubits
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB Motivated by recent advances in modeling pseudo-Hermitian Hamiltonian (pHH) systems using superconducting qubits, we analyze their quantum dynamics subject to a small time-dependent perturbation. In particular, we develop the linear response theory formulation suitable for application to various pHH systems and compare it to the ones available in the literature. We derive analytical expressions for the generalized temporal quantum-mechanical correlation function C(t) and the time-dependent dynamic susceptibility chi(t) proportional to Im C(t). We apply our results to two PT-symmetric non-Hermitian quantum systems: a single qubit and two unbiased/biased qubits coupled by the exchange interaction. For both systems, we obtain the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the Hamiltonian and identify PT-symmetry unbroken and broken quantum phases and quantum phase transitions between them. The temporal oscillations of the dynamic susceptibility of the qubits polarization (z projection of the total spin), chi(t), relate to ac-induced transitions between different eigenstates and we analyze the dependencies of the oscillation frequency and the amplitude on the gain/loss parameter gamma and the interaction strength g. Studying the time dependence of chi(t), we observe different types of oscillations, i.e., undamped, heavily damped, and amplified ones, related to the transitions between eigenstates with broken (unbroken) PT symmetry. These predictions can be verified in the microwave transmission experiments allowing controlled simulation of the pHH systems.

TI Entanglement maximization and mirror symmetry in two-Higgs-doublet
   models
SO JOURNAL OF HIGH ENERGY PHYSICS
AB We consider 2-to-2 scatterings of Higgs bosons in a CP-conserving two-Higgs-doublet model (2HDM) and study the implication of maximizing the entanglement in the flavor space, where the two doublets Phi a, a = 1, 2, can be viewed as a qubit: Phi 1 = |0 > and Phi 2 = |1 >. More specifically, we compute the scattering amplitudes for Phi a Phi b -> Phi c Phi d and require the outgoing flavor entanglement to be maximal for a full product basis such as the computational basis, which consists of {|00 >, |01 >, |10 >, |11 >}. In the unbroken phase and turning off the gauge interactions, entanglement maximization results in the appearance of an U(2) x U(2) global symmetry among the quartic couplings, which in general is broken softly by the mass terms. Interestingly, once the Higgs bosons acquire vacuum expectation values, maximal entanglement enforces an exact U(2) x U(2) symmetry, which is spontaneously broken to U(1) x U(1). As a byproduct, this gives rise to Higgs alignment as well as to the existence of 6 massless Nambu-Goldstone bosons. The U(2) x U(2) symmetry can be gauged to lift the massless Goldstones, while maintaining maximal entanglement demands the presence of a discrete Z2 symmetry interchanging the two gauge sectors. The model is custodially invariant in the scalar sector, and the inclusion of fermions requires a mirror dark sector, related to the standard one by the Z2 symmetry.

TI Impedancemetry of multiplexed quantum devices using an on-chip cryogenic

AB In the pursuit for scalable quantum processors, signi fi cant effort has been devoted to the development of cryogenic classical hardware for the control and readout of a growing number of qubits. The current work presented a novel approach called impedancemetry that is suitable for measuring the quantum capacitance of semiconductor qubits connected to a resonant LC-circuit. The impedancemetry circuit exploits the integration of a complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) active inductor in the resonator with tunable resonance frequency and quality factor, enabling the optimization of readout sensitivity for quantum devices. The realized cryogenic circuit allows fast impedance detection with a measured capacitance resolution down to 10 aF and an input-referred p ffiffiffiffiffiffi noise of 3.7 aF/ Hz. At 4.2 K, the power consumption of the active inductor amounts to 120 mu W, with an additional dissipation for on-chip current excitation (0.15 mu W) and voltage ampli fi cation (2.9 mW) of the impedance measurement. Compared to the commonly used schemes based on dispersive RF re fl ectometry which require millimeter-scale passive inductors, the circuit exhibits a notably reduced footprint (50 mu m 3 60 mu m), facilitating its integration in a scalable quantumclassical architecture. The impedancemetry method has been applied at 4.2 K to the detection of quantum effects in the gate capacitance of on-chip nanometric CMOS transistors that are individually addressed via multiplexing.

TI Hybrid Quantum-Classical Stochastic Approach to Dissipative Spin-Boson
   Models
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW X
AB Spin-boson models involving many interacting spins and bosons are ubiquitous in quantum simulation platforms. At the same time, characterizing the dynamics of these quantum systems represents a significant challenge. Here, we consider general spin-boson models where bosons are subject to Markovian dissipation (e.g., due to cavity loss). We present an exact hybrid quantum-classical stochastic approach where the solution of a classical stochastic equation-mimicking the bosonic modes-is input into a quantum stochastic equation for the spins. Furthermore, the spins are effectively decoupled for each stochastic realization, which nevertheless comes at the expense of sampling over unphysical states. In contrast with existing stochastic approaches based on the influence functional formalism, we place no restriction (factorizability or Gaussianity) on the initial state, or the spin-boson coupling (except that it be linear in the bosonic operator). Markovian dissipation, being at the heart of our approach, renders the stochastic equations Markovian even in the strong coupling regime. Furthermore, it ensures hermiticity (though not positivity) of the density matrix for each realization, thus improving the convergence of stochastic sampling. Interestingly, we find a condition on the classical simulability of the system based solely on the single atom cooperativity even in a many-body setting. We benchmark and showcase the utility of our approach in several examples, specifically in cases where a direct numerical computation is unfeasible.

TI Gauge-Symmetry Protection Using Single-Body Terms
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Quantum-simulator hardware promises new insights into problems from particle and nuclear physics. A major challenge is to reproduce gauge invariance, as violations of this quintessential property of lattice gauge theories can have dramatic consequences, e.g., the generation of a photon mass in quantum electrodynamics. Here, we introduce an experimentally friendly method to protect gauge invariance in U(1) lattice gauge theories against coherent errors in a controllable way. Our method employs only single-body energy-penalty terms, thus enabling practical implementations. As we derive analytically, some sets of penalty coefficients render undesired gauge sectors inaccessible by unitary dynamics for exponentially long times. Further, for few-body error terms, we show numerically that this is achieved with resources exhibiting little dependence on system size. These findings constitute an exponential improvement over previously known results from energy-gap protection or perturbative treatments. In our method, the gauge-invariant subspace is protected by an emergent global symmetry, meaning it can be immediately applied to other symmetries. In our numerical benchmarks for continuous-time and digital quantum simulations, gauge protection holds for all calculated evolution times (up to t > 10(10)/ J for continuous time, with J the relevant energy scale). Crucially, our gauge-protection technique is simpler to realize than the associated ideal gauge theory, and can thus be readily implemented in current ultracold-atom analog simulators as well as digital noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices.

TI Saturation of the quantum Cramér-Rao bound for distributed sensing via
   error sensitivity in SU(1,1)-SU(m) interferometry
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Breaking the standard quantum limit in the sensing of parameters at different spatial locations, such as in a quantum network, is of great importance. Using the framework of quantum Fisher information, many strategies based on squeezed quantum probes and multipath multiphoton or multiqubit entangled states have been considered. In this context there is always the question of what the simplest measurement is that would saturate the quantum Cram & eacute;r-Rao bound (QCRB). The simplest quantity to measure would be characteristics of photon flux or population distribution in the case of qubits. Previous studies have shown that the error sensitivity in SU(1,1) interferometry, also known by several other terms such as nonlinear interferometry and time-reversed measurements, does saturate the QCRB for single parameters such as phase, displacement, and loss. In this work we reveal the great utility of generalized SU(1,1) interferometry in distributed sensing. Generalized SU(1,1) interferometry is a combination of SU(m) and SU(1,1) elements, where m is the number of nodes in the network. The SU(m) element is used to produce distributed entanglement starting from a squeezed photonic or matter probe. We demonstrate how error sensitivity measurement or more precisely the method of moment sensitivity at just one output port can saturate or nearly saturate the QCRB and thus results in Heisenberg sensitivity of network sensing.

TI Role of Dilations in Reversing Physical Processes: Tabletop
   Reversibility and Generalized Thermal Operations
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Irreversibility, crucial in both thermodynamics and information theory, is naturally studied by comparing the evolution-the (forward) channel-with an associated reverse-the reverse channel. There are two natural ways to define this reverse channel. Using logical inference, the reverse channel is the Bayesian retrodiction (the Petz recovery map in the quantum formalism) of the original one. Alternatively, we know from physics that every irreversible process can be modeled as an open system: one can then define the corresponding closed system by adding a bath ("dilation"), trivially reverse the global reversible process, and finally remove the bath again. We prove that the two recipes are strictly identical, both in the classical and in the quantum formalism, once one accounts for correlations formed between system and the bath. Having established this, we define and study special classes of maps: product-preserving maps (including generalized thermal maps), for which no such system-bath correlations are formed for some states; and tabletop time-reversible maps, when the reverse channel can be implemented with the same devices as the original one. We establish several general results connecting these classes, and a very detailed characterization when both the system and the bath are one qubit. In particular, we show that, when reverse channels are well defined, product preservation is a sufficient but not necessary condition for tabletop reversibility; and that the preservation of local energy spectra is a necessary and sufficient condition to generalized thermal operations.

TI Quantum transport through a quantum dot side-coupled to a Majorana bound
   state pair in the presence of electron-phonon interaction
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB We theoretically study quantum transport through a quantum dot coupled to Majorana bound states confined at the ends of a topological superconducting nanowire. The topological superconductor forms a loop and is threaded by a tunable magnetic flux, which allows one to control the electron transport in the system. In particular, we investigate phonon-assisted transport properties in the device when the central quantum dot interacts with a single long-wave optical phonon mode. We find that when the two Majorana bound states are unhybridized, the zero-temperature linear conductance has a 2 pi periodicity as a function of magnetic flux phase, independent of the electron-phonon interaction, the quantum dot energy, or the finite values of dot-Majorana couplings. For a finite overlap between the Majorana bound states, the linear conductance periodicity generally changes to 4 pi either due to a finite electron-phonon coupling strength, or a dot energy level that is tuned away from the Fermi level. Additionally, the differential conductance periodicity changes from 2 pi to 4 pi when the Majorana bound states hybridize and the electron-phonon coupling is finite. Our results provide insight into transport signatures expected in topological quantum computational platforms that integrate quantum dots as a means for Majorana qubit readout. The energy exchange with an environmental bath, here a single phonon mode, significantly alters the current signatures expected from Majorana modes.

TI Hamiltonian Operator Approximation for Energy Measurement and
   Ground-State Preparation
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB The Hamiltonian operator plays a central role in quantum theory being a generator of unitary quantum dynamics. Its expectation value describes the energy of a quantum system. Typically being a nonunitary operator, the action of the Hamiltonian is either encoded using complex ancilla-based circuits, or implemented effectively as a sum of Pauli string terms. Here, we show how to approximate the Hamiltonian operator as a sum of propagators using a differential representation. The proposed approach, named the Hamiltonian operator approximation (HOA), is designed to benefit analog quantum simulators, where one has direct access to simulation of quantum dynamics, but measuring separate circuits is not possible. We describe how to use this strategy in the hybrid quantum-classical workflow for performing energy measurements. Benchmarking the measurement scheme, we discuss the relevance of the discretization step size, stencil order, number of shots, and noise. We also use HOA to prepare ground states of complex material science models with direct iteration and quantum filter diagonalization, finding the lowest energy for the 12-qubit Hamiltonian of hydrogen chain H-6 with 10(-5) Hartree precision using 11 time-evolved reference states. The approach is compared to the variational quantum eigensolver, proving that HOA is beneficial for systems at increasing size, corresponding to noisy large-scale quantum devices. We find that, for the Heisenberg model with 12 or more spins, our approach may outperform variational methods, both in terms of the gate depth and the total number of measurements.

TI Nonlinear chiral magnetic waves
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
AB The chiral magnetic wave (CMW) is a macroscopic quantum phenomenon that arises due to the mixing of the electric and chiral charge oscillations induced by the chiral anomaly. In this study we report the first quantum simulation (on classical hardware) of the real-time dynamics of CMWs in the Schwinger model. Our quench protocol is the following; at t = 0 we suddenly place an electric dipole at the middle of our lattice. Due to chiral anomaly, this dipole excites the CMW that propagates towards the edges of the lattice. In the Schwinger model tuned to the conformal critical point (at theta = pi, m/g similar or equal to 0.2), we find a gapless linear CMW that propagates with the speed of light. For a massless Schwinger model (theta = 0, m = 0), we find a gapped linear CMW, in accord with previous analytical analyses. For a massive Schwinger model (that is dual to strongly interacting bosonic theory), we enter the new regime of nonlinear CMWs, where we find a surprise. Specifically, for m/g > 1, the frequency of electric charge oscillations becomes much smaller than the frequency of the oscillations of the chiral charge. For m/g = 4, we find a solution corresponding to a nearly static electric dipole with fast oscillations of the chiral charge confined within. We call this solution a "thumper" and study its properties in detail. We speculate that thumpers might be relevant for CMWs in the strange quark sector of quark-gluon plasma and narrow gap semiconductors.

TI Universal pair polaritons in a strongly interacting Fermi gas
SO NATURE
AB Directly coupling cavity photons to the photo-association resonances of pairs of atoms in a strongly interacting Fermi gas generates pair polaritons-hybrid excitaions coherently mixing photons, atom pairs and molecules.
   Cavity quantum electrodynamics (QED) manipulates the coupling of light with matter, and allows several emitters to couple coherently with one light mode(1). However, even in a many-body system, the light-matter coupling mechanism has so far been restricted to one-body processes. Leveraging cavity QED for the quantum simulation of complex, many-body systems has thus far relied on multi-photon processes, scaling down the light-matter interaction to the low energy and slow time scales of the many-body problem(2-5). Here we report cavity QED experiments using molecular transitions in a strongly interacting Fermi gas, directly coupling cavity photons to pairs of atoms. The interplay of strong light-matter and strong interparticle interactions leads to well-resolved pair polaritons-hybrid excitations coherently mixing photons, atom pairs and molecules. The dependence of the pair-polariton spectrum on interatomic interactions is universal, independent of the transition used, demonstrating a direct mapping between pair correlations in the ground state and the optical spectrum. This represents a magnification of many-body effects by two orders of magnitude in energy. In the dispersive regime, it enables fast, minimally destructive measurements of pair correlations, and opens the way to their measurement at the quantum limit and their coherent manipulation using dynamical, quantized optical fields.

TI Hole spin splitting in a Ge quantum dot with finite barriers
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB We study the low-energy spectrum of a single hole confined in a planar Ge quantum dot (QD) within the effective-mass formalism. The QD is sandwiched between two GeSi barriers of finite potential height grown along the [001] direction. To treat this finite barrier problem, we adopt an independent-band approach in dealing with the boundary conditions. The effects of different system parameters are investigated, including the width of the out-of-plane confining well, the size of the dot, and silicon concentration in the confining layers. The more accurate finite-barrier model results in a nontrivial dependence of the anisotropic g factor on the silicon concentration in the barrier, and the choice of boundary conditions can have a non-negligible impact on its predicted value. On the other hand, the corresponding g factor predicted by the hard-wall model only depends on the silicon concentration monotonically. The comparison shows that the hard-wall model falls short in capturing the interplay between strain and band offset. Furthermore, while the ideal model of a planar dot with a square-well heterostructure already has an intrinsic spin-orbit coupling, realistic effects arising from the experimental setup may give rise to additional contributions. We investigate the impact of the top-gate electric field and the residual tensile strain on the qubit states. The results indicate that these effects are important contributions to the total spin-orbit coupling, which enables fast electric control.

TI Noncontact Layer Stabilization of Azafullerene Radicals: Route toward
   High-Spin-Density Surfaces
SO ACS NANO
AB We deposit azafullerene C59N center dot radicals in a vacuum on the Au(111) surface for layer thicknesses between 0.35 and 2.1 monolayers (ML). The layers are characterized using X-ray photoemission (XPS) and X-ray absorption fine structure (NEXAFS) spectroscopy, low-temperature scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), and by density functional calculations (DFT). The singly unoccupied C59N orbital (SUMO) has been identified in the N 1s NEXAFS/XPS spectra of C59N layers as a spectroscopic fingerprint of the molecular radical state. At low molecular coverages (up to 1 ML), films of monomeric C59N are stabilized with the nonbonded carbon orbital neighboring the nitrogen oriented toward the Au substrate, whereas in-plane intermolecular coupling into diamagnetic (C59N)(2) dimers takes over toward the completion of the second layer. By following the C59N center dot SUMO peak intensity with increasing molecular coverage, we identify an intermediate high-spin-density phase between 1 and 2 ML, where uncoupled C59N center dot monomers in the second layer with pronounced radical character are formed. We argue that the C59N center dot radical stabilization of this supramonolayer phase of monomers is achieved by suppressed coupling to the substrate. This results from molecular isolation on top of the passivating azafullerene contact layer, which can be explored for molecular radical state stabilization and positioning on solid substrates.

TI A cost effective alternative method to ddRADseq library construction
   during size selection
SO SU URUNLERI DERGISI
AB Next generation sequencing (NGS) technologies constitute the most powerful scientific advance of 21(st) century with a promise of fast and cost effective data generation in biology. Yet, up to date NGS studies remain often limited to laboratories with established resources. In the present study, we employed construction of ddRADseq library by using routine lab consumables (agarose gel electrophoresis: AGE thereafter) compared to high-tech NGS consumables (paramagnetic beads) during size selection. The ddRADseq library was constructed for sequencing size selected based on universally used paramagnetic beads, while remaining aliquot was used as a template to assess the feasibility of ddRADseq library construction using AGE for labs with limited resources. Both libraries were optimised for 15 PCR cycles indicating similarity in template intensity. Post-PCR quantification of the libraries was comparable (similar to 10 ng.mu L-1). Size distribution assessment revealed a cleaner pick at the ddRADseq library size selected manually based on AGE. Similarly, intercalating agent of Qubit confirmed the quantity of libraries was similar (>3 ng.mu L-1). Although being more time consuming due to pre-electrophoresis preparations, serial wash and staining steps, ddRADseq library construction is achievable using routine lab consumables provided to supply the adaptors and PCR primers for the initial wet-lab work. These results manifest the feasibility of ddRADseq library generation for labs with limited resources.

TI ddPCR allows 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing of very small DNA amounts
   from low-biomass samples
SO BMC MICROBIOLOGY
AB Background: One limiting factor of short amplicon 16S rRNA gene sequencing approaches is the use of low DNA amounts in the amplicon generation step. Especially for low-biomass samples, insufficient or even commonly undetectable DNA amounts can limit or prohibit further analysis in standard protocols.
   Results: Using a newly established protocol, very low DNA input amounts were found sufficient for reliable detection of bacteria using 16S rRNA gene sequencing compared to standard protocols. The improved protocol includes an optimized amplification strategy by using a digital droplet PCR. We demonstrate how PCR products are generated even when using very low concentrated DNA, unable to be detected by using a Qubit. Importantly, the use of different 16S rRNA gene primers had a greater effect on the resulting taxonomical profiles compared to using high or very low initial DNA amounts.
   Conclusion: Our improved protocol takes advantage of ddPCR and allows faithful amplification of very low amounts of template. With this, samples of low bacterial biomass become comparable to those with high amounts of bacteria, since the first and most biasing steps are the same. Besides, it is imperative to state DNA concentrations and volumes used and to include negative controls indicating possible shifts in taxonomical profiles. Despite this, results produced by using different primer pairs cannot be easily compared.

Finding BIs tailored to many-body correlations as prepared in present-day quantum computers and simulators is however a highly challenging endeavor. In this work, we focus on BIs violated by very coarse-grain features of the system: two-body correlations averaged over all permutations of the parties. For two-outcome measurements, specific BIs of this form have been theoretically and experimentally studied in the past, but it is practically impossible to explic- itly test all such BIs. Data-driven methods reconstructing a violated BI from the data themselves have therefore been considered. Here, inspired by statistical physics, we develop a novel data-driven approach specifically tailored to such coarse-grain data. Our approach offers two main improvements over the existing literature: (1) it is directly designed for any number of outcomes and settings; (2) the obtained BIs are quadratic in the data, offering a fundamental scaling advantage for the precision required in experiments. This very flexible method, whose complexity does not scale with the system size, allows us to systematically improve over all previously known Bell inequalities robustly violated by ensembles of quantum spin 1/2; and to discover novel families of Bell inequalities, tailored to spin-squeezed states and many-body spin singlets of arbitrary spin-j ensembles.

TI Parallel detection and spatial mapping of large nuclear spin clusters
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at the atomic scale offers exciting prospects for determining the structure and function of individual molecules and proteins. Quantum defects in diamond have recently emerged as a promising platform towards reaching this goal, and allowed for the detection and localization of single nuclear spins under ambient conditions. Here, we present an efficient strategy for extending imaging to large nuclear spin clusters, fulfilling an important requirement towards a single-molecule MRI technique. Our method combines the concepts of weak quantum measurements, phase encoding and simulated annealing to detect three-dimensional positions from many nuclei in parallel. Detection is spatially selective, allowing us to probe nuclei at a chosen target radius while avoiding interference from strongly-coupled proximal nuclei. We demonstrate our strategy by imaging clusters containing more than 20 carbon-13 nuclear spins within a radius of 2.4 nm from single, near-surface nitrogen-vacancy centers at room temperature. The radius extrapolates to 5-6 nm for H-1. Beside taking an important step in nanoscale MRI, our experiment also provides an efficient tool for the characterization of large nuclear spin registers in the context of quantum simulators and quantum network nodes.
   Nuclear magnetic resonance imaging at the atomic scale has been limited to detection and localisation of single nuclear spins. Here, the authors extend imaging to large nuclear spin clusters in 3D by combining weak quantum measurements, phase encoding and simulated annealing.

TI Toward a Theory of Phase Transitions in Quantum Control Landscapes
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW X
AB Control landscape phase transitions (CLPTs) occur as abrupt changes in the cost function landscape upon varying a control parameter and can be revealed by nonanalytic points in statistical order parameters. A prime example are quantum speed limits, which mark the onset of controllability as the protocol duration is increased. Here, we lay the foundations of an analytical theory for CLPTs by developing Dyson, Magnus, and cumulant expansions for the cost function that capture the behavior of CLPTs with a controlled precision. Using linear and quadratic stability analysis, we reveal that CLPTs can be associated with different types of instabilities of the optimal protocol. This allows us to explicitly relate CLPTs to critical structural rearrangements in the extrema of the control landscape: Utilizing path-integral methods from statistical field theory, we trace back the critical scaling of the order parameter at the quantum speed limit to the topological and geometric properties of the set of optimal protocols, such as the number of connected components and its dimensionality. We verify our predictions by introducing a numerical sampling algorithm designed to explore this optimal set via a homotopic stochastic update rule. We apply this new toolbox explicitly to analyze CLPTs in the single- and two-qubit control problems whose landscapes are analytically tractable and compare the landscapes for bang-bang and piecewise continuous protocols. Our work provides the first steps toward a systematic theory of CLPTs and paves the way for utilizing statistical field theory techniques for generic complex control landscapes.

TI Quantum phase transitions between symmetry-enriched fracton phases
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB Topologically ordered phases exhibit further complexity in the presence of global symmetries: Their anyonic excitations may exhibit different transformation patterns under these symmetries, leading to a classification in terms of symmetry-enriched topological orders. We develop a generic scheme to study an analogous situation for three-dimensional fracton phases by means of isometric tensor network states (isoTNS) with finite bond dimension, which allow us to tune phase transitions between different symmetry fractionalization patterns. We focus on the X-Cube model, a paradigmatic fracton model hosting two types of excitations: lineons, which are mobile in a single direction only, and fractons that are immobile on their own. By deforming the local tensors of the fixed point ground state, we find a family of exact wavefunctions for which the symmetry fractionalization under an anti-unitary symmetry on both types of excitations is directly visible. These wavefunctions are nonstabilizer states and have nonvanishing correlation lengths. They even exhibit power-law correlations at criticality between two symmetry-enriched topological orders. Furthermore, the isoTNS description allows for the explicit construction of a linear-depth quantum circuit to sequentially realize these exotic 3D states on a quantum processor, including a holographic scheme using only a pair of two-dimensional qubit arrays alongside measurements. Our approach provides a construction to enrich phases with exotic topological or fracton order and to study 3D quantum phase transitions with exact wavefunctions, and offers a tractable route to implement and characterize fracton order on quantum devices.

TI An integrated framework for COVID-19 classification based on classical
   and quantum transfer learning from a chest radiograph
SO CONCURRENCY AND COMPUTATION-PRACTICE & EXPERIENCE
AB COVID-19 is a quickly spreading over 10 million persons globally. The overall number of infected patients worldwide is estimated to be around 133,381,413 people. Infection rate is being increased on daily basis. It has also caused a devastating effect on the world economy and public health. Early stage detection of this disease is mandatory to reduce the mortality rate. Artificial intelligence performs a vital role for COVID-19 detection at an initial stage using chest radiographs. The proposed methods comprise of the two phases. Deep features (DFs) are derived from its last fully connected layers of pre-trained models like AlexNet and MobileNet in phase-I. Later these feature vectors are fused serially. Best features are selected through feature selection method of PCA and passed to the SVM and KNN for classification. In phase-II, quantum transfer learning model is utilized, in which a pre-trained ResNet-18 model is applied for DF collection and then these features are supplied as an input to the 4-qubit quantum circuit for model training with the tuned hyperparameters. The proposed technique is evaluated on two publicly available x-ray imaging datasets. The proposed methodology achieved an accuracy index of 99.0% with three classes including corona virus-positive images, normal images, and pneumonia radiographs. In comparison to other recently published work, the experimental findings show that the proposed approach outperforms it.

TI A diamond-confined open microcavity featuring a high quality-factor and
   a small mode-volume
SO JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS
AB With a highly coherent, optically addressable electron spin, the nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond is a promising candidate for a node in a quantum network. A resonant microcavity can boost the flux of coherent photons emerging from single NV centers. Here, we present an open Fabry-Perot microcavity geometry containing a single-crystal diamond membrane, which operates in a regime where the vacuum electric field is strongly confined to the diamond membrane. There is a field anti-node at the diamond-air interface. Despite the presence of surface losses, a finesse of F = 11 500 was observed. The quality ( Q) factor for the lowest mode number is 120 000; the mode volume V is estimated to be 3.9 lambda(3)(0), where lambda(0) is the free-space wavelength. We investigate the interplay between different loss mechanisms and the impact these loss channels have on the performance of the cavity. This analysis suggests that the surface waviness (roughness with a spatial frequency comparable to that of the microcavity mode) is the mechanism preventing the Q / V ratio from reaching even higher values. Finally, we apply the extracted cavity parameters to the NV center and calculate a predicted Purcell factor exceeding 150. (c) 2022 Author(s).

TI A Quantum-Classical Method Applied to Material Design: Photochromic
   Materials Optimization for Photopharmacology Applications
SO INTELLIGENT COMPUTING
AB The integration of quantum chemistry, machine learning, and optimization calculations is expected to accelerate materials discovery by making large chemical spaces amenable to computational study, a challenging task for classical computers. In this study, we develop a quantum-classical computing scheme involving the computational-basis variational quantum deflation (cVQD) method for calculating the excited states of a general classical Hamiltonian, such as an Ising Hamiltonian. We apply this scheme to the practical use case of generating photochromic diarylethene (DAE) derivatives for photopharmacology applications. Using a dataset of 384 DAE derivatives from quantum chemistry calculation results, we show that machine learning can accurately predict the wavelength of maximum absorbance, lambda max, of 4,096 DAE derivatives. After screening over 4,096 molecules using the computing scheme, we identified 5 DAE candidates that have important applications in photopharmacology. In detail, a 12-qubit cVQD calculation provides the ground state and 4 excited states of an Ising Hamiltonian corresponding to DAE candidates possessing large lambda max. On a quantum simulator, results are found to be in excellent agreement with those obtained by an exact eigensolver. Utilizing error suppression and mitigation techniques, cVQD on a real quantum device produces results with accuracy comparable to calculations on the simulator. Finally, we show that quantum chemistry calculations for the DAE candidates provides a path to achieving large lambda max and oscillator strengths by means of the molecular engineering of DAE derivatives.

TI Active learning of quantum system Hamiltonians yields query advantage
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Hamiltonian learning is an important procedure in quantum system identification, calibration, and successful operation of quantum computers. Through queries to the quantum system, this procedure seeks to obtain the parameters of a given Hamiltonian model and description of noise sources. Standard techniques for Hamiltonian learning require careful design of queries and O(e-2) queries in achieving learning error e due to the standard quantum limit. With the goal of efficiently and accurately estimating the Hamiltonian parameters within learning error e through minimal queries, we introduce an active learner that is given an initial set of training examples and the ability to interactively query the quantum system to generate new training data. To ensure applicability on near-term quantum hardware, the active learner operates in batch mode as opposed to sequentially, proposing batches of queries to be made during learning. We formally specify and experimentally assess the performance of this Hamiltonian active learning (HAL) algorithm for learning the six parameters of a two-qubit cross-resonance Hamiltonian on four different superconducting IBM quantum devices. Compared with standard techniques for the same problem and a specified learning error, HAL achieves more than a 95% reduction in queries required, and upwards of 33% reduction over a sequential active learner. Moreover, with access to prior information on a subset of Hamiltonian parameters and given the ability to select queries with linearly (or exponentially) longer system interaction times during learning, HAL can exceed the standard quantum limit and achieve Heisenberg (or super-Heisenberg) limited convergence rates during learning.

TI Effect of Antigen Retrieval on Genomic DNA From Immunodissected Samples
SO JOURNAL OF HISTOCHEMISTRY & CYTOCHEMISTRY
AB Immunohistochemical (IHC) staining is an established technique for visualizing proteins in tissue sections for research studies and clinical applications. IHC is increasingly used as a targeting strategy for procurement of labeled cells via tissue microdissection, including immunodissection, computer-aided laser dissection (CALD), expression microdissection (xMD), and other techniques. The initial antigen retrieval (AR) process increases epitope availability and improves staining characteristics; however, the procedure can damage DNA. To better understand the effects of AR on DNA quality and quantity in immunodissected samples, both clinical specimens (KRAS gene mutation positive cases) and model system samples (lung cancer patient-derived xenograft tissue) were subjected to commonly employed AR methods (heat induced epitope retrieval [HIER], protease digestion) and the effects on DNA were assessed by Qubit, fragment analysis, quantitative PCR, digital droplet PCR (ddPCR), library preparation, and targeted sequencing. The data showed that HIER resulted in optimal IHC staining characteristics, but induced significant damage to DNA, producing extensive fragmentation and decreased overall yields. However, neither of the AR methods combined with IHC prevented ddPCR amplification of small amplicons and gene mutations were successfully identified from immunodissected clinical samples. The results indicate for the first time that DNA recovered from immunostained slides after standard AR and IHC processing can be successfully employed for genomic mutation analysis via ddPCR and next-generation sequencing (NGS) short-read methods.

TI High-order exceptional point in a quantum system of two qubits with
   interaction
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB As one of the essential features in non-Hermitian systems coupled with environment, the exceptional pointhas attracted much attention in many physical fields. The phenomena that eigenvalues and eigenvectors of thesystem simultaneously coalesce at the exceptional point are also one of the important properties to distinguishfrom Hermitian systems. In non-Hermitian systems with parity-time reversal symmetry, the eigenvalues can becontinuously adjusted in parameter space from all real spectra to pairs of complex-conjugate values by crossingthe phase transition from the parity-time reversal symmetry preserving phase to the broken phase. The phase transition point is called an exceptional point of the system, which occurs in company with the spontaneoussymmetry broken and many novel physical phenomena, such as sensitivity-enhanced measurement and lossinduced transparency or lasing. Here, we focus on a two-qubit quantum system with parity-time reversalsymmetry and construct an experimental scheme, prove and verify the features at its third-order exceptionalpoint, including high-order energy response induced by perturbation and the coalescence of eigenvectors. We first theoretically study a two-qubit non-Hermitian system with parity-time reversal symmetry,calculate the properties of eigenvalues and eigenvectors, and prove the existence of a third-order exceptionalpoint. Then, in order to study the energy response of the system induced by perturbation, we introduce anIsing-type interaction as perturbation and quantitatively demonstrate the response of eigenvalues. Inlogarithmic coordinates, three of the eigenvalues are indeed in the cubic root relationship with perturbationstrength, while the fourth one is a linear function. Moreover, we study the eigenvectors around exceptionalpoint and show the coalescence phenomenon as the perturbation strength becomes smaller. The characterization of the response of eigenvalues at high-order exceptional points is a quite difficult taskas it is in general difficult to directly measure eigenenergies in a quantum system composed of a few qubits. Inpractice, the time evolution of occupation on a particular state is used to indirectly fit the eigenvalues. In orderto make the fitting of experimental data more reliable, we want to determine an accurate enough expressions forthe eigenvalues and eigenstates. To this aim, we employ a perturbation treatment and show good agreementwith the numerical results of states occupation obtained by direct evolution. Moreover, we find that after thesystem evolves for a long enough time, it will end up to one of the eigenstates, which gives us a way todemonstrate eigenvector coalescence by measuring the density matrix via tomography and parity-time reversaltransformation. To show our scheme is experimentally applicable, we propose an implementation using trapped ions. We can map the parity-time reversal symmetric Hamiltonian to a purely dissipative two-ion system: use microwave to achieve spin state inversion, shine a 370 nm laser to realize dissipation of spin-up state, and apply Raman operation for Molmer-Sorensen gates to implement Ising interaction. By adjusting the corresponding microwave and laser intensity, the spin coupling strength, the dissipation rate and the perturbation strengthcan be well controlled. We can record the probability distribution of the four product states of the two ions and measure the density matrix by detecting the fluorescence of each ion on different Pauli basis

TI Machine learning approach to the Floquet-Lindbladian problem
SO CHAOS
AB Similar to its classical version, quantum Markovian evolution can be either time-discrete or time-continuous. Discrete quantum Markovian evolution is usually modeled with completely positive trace-preserving maps, while time-continuous evolution is often specified with superoperators referred to as "Lindbladians. " Here, we address the following question: Being given a quantum map, can we find a Lindbladian that generates an evolution identical-when monitored at discrete instances of time-to the one induced by the map? It was demonstrated that the problem of getting the answer to this question can be reduced to an NP-complete (in the dimension N of the Hilbert space, the evolution takes place in) problem. We approach this question from a different perspective by considering a variety of machine learning (ML) methods and trying to estimate their potential ability to give the correct answer. Complimentarily, we use the performance of different ML methods as a tool to validate a hypothesis that the answer to the question is encoded in spectral properties of the so-called Choi matrix, which can be constructed from the given quantum map. As a test bed, we use two single-qubit models for which the answer can be obtained using the reduction procedure. The outcome of our experiment is that, for a given map, the property of being generated by a time-independent Lindbladian is encoded both in the eigenvalues and the eigenstates of the corresponding Choi matrix.

TI Accurate Methods for the Analysis of Strong-Drive Effects in Parametric
   Gates
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB The ability to perform fast, high-fidelity entangling gates is a requirement for a viable quantum pro-cessor. In practice, achieving fast gates often comes with the penalty of strong-drive effects that are not captured by the rotating-wave approximation. These effects can be analyzed in simulations of the gate protocol, but those are computationally costly and often hide the physics at play. Here, we show how to efficiently extract gate parameters by directly solving a Floquet eigenproblem using exact numerics and a perturbative analytical approach. As an example application of this toolkit, we study the space of paramet-ric gates generated between two fixed-frequency transmon qubits connected by a parametrically driven coupler. Our analytical treatment, based on time-dependent Schrieffer-Wolff perturbation theory, yields closed-form expressions for gate frequencies and spurious interactions, and is valid for strong drives. From these calculations, we identify optimal regimes of operation for different types of gates including iSWAP , controlled-Z, and CNOT. These analytical results are supplemented by numerical Floquet computa-tions from which we directly extract drive-dependent gate parameters. This approach has a considerable computational advantage over full simulations of time evolutions. More generally, our combined ana-lytical and numerical strategy allows us to characterize two-qubit gates involving parametrically driven interactions, and can be applied to gate optimization and cross-talk mitigation such as the cancelation of unwanted ZZ interactions in multiqubit architectures.

TI Ultralow-Noise Single-Frequency Fiber Laser and Application in
   High-Resolution Fiber-Optic Dynamic Strain Sensing
SO ADVANCED PHOTONICS RESEARCH
AB A 1.5 mu m ultralow-noise single-frequency fiber laser (SFFL) is realized based on a delay fiber phase-locked method and the nonlinear amplification effect of a semiconductor optical amplifier (SOA). Via feedback locking of the phase jitter signal, the phase noise achieves the minimum value of -160 dB rad Hz(-1/2)m(-1) with a maximum reduction of 50 dB. Meanwhile, SOA reduces the intensity noise by a maximum of 65 dB, making it near the shot-noise limit for frequencies above 40 kHz. To demonstrate this state-of-art SFFL with ultralow-noise property, a high-resolution fiber-optic dynamic strain sensing based on a fiber-based Michelson interferometer (FMI) is performed. As a result, the strain resolution reaches 26 f epsilon Hz(-1/2) in the 30-200 Hz band, which is improved by almost three orders of magnitude than that realized by a free-running SFFL. To the best of the knowledge, this is the first time to achieve such a high-resolution fiber-optic dynamic strain sensor in the low-frequency range utilizing the FMI system. This high-resolution fiber-optic strain sensing has promising applications in geophysics and biophotonics. Moreover, this ultralow-noise SFFL is competitive for sophisticated applications, such as precise absolute distance measurement, quantum key distribution, and generating squeezed light.

TI Scabbard: An Exploratory Study on Hardware Aware Design Choices of
   Learning with Rounding-based Key Encapsulation Mechanisms
SO ACM TRANSACTIONS ON EMBEDDED COMPUTING SYSTEMS
AB Recently, the construction of cryptographic schemes based on hard lattice problems has gained immense popularity. Apart from being quantum resistant, lattice-based cryptography allows a wide range of variations in the underlying hard problem. As cryptographic schemes can work in different environments under different operational constraints such as memory footprint, silicon area, efficiency, power requirement, and so on, such variations in the underlying hard problem are very useful for designers to construct different cryptographic schemes. In this work, we explore various design choices of lattice-based cryptography and their impact on performance in the real world. In particular, we propose a suite of key-encapsulation mechanisms based on the learning with rounding problem with a focus on improving different performance aspects of lattice-based cryptography. Our suite consists of three schemes. Our first scheme is Florete, which is designed for efficiency. The second scheme is Espada, which is aimed at improving parallelization, flexibility, and memory footprint. The last scheme is Sable, which can be considered an improved version in terms of key sizes and parameters of the Saber key-encapsulation mechanism, one of the finalists in the National Institute of Standards and Technology's post-quantum standardization procedure. In this work, we have described our design rationale behind each scheme. Furthermore, to demonstrate the justification of our design decisions, we have provided software and hardware implementations. Our results show Florete is faster than most state-of-the-art KEMs on software platforms. For example, the key-generation algorithm of high-security version Florete outperforms the National Institute of Standards and Technology's standard Kyber by 47%, the Federal Office for Information Security's standard Frodo by 99%, and Saber by 57% on the ARM Cortex-M4 platform. Similarly, in hardware, Florete outperforms Frodo and NTRU Prime for all KEM operations. The scheme Espada requires less memory and area than the implementation of most state-of-the-art schemes. For example, the encapsulation algorithm of high-security version Espada uses 30% less stack memory than Kyber, 57% less stack memory than Frodo, and 67% less stack memory than Saber on the ARM Cortex-M4 platform. The implementations of Sable maintain a tradeoff between Florete and Espada regarding software performance and memory requirements. Sable outperforms Saber at least by 6% and Frodo by 99%. Through an efficient polynomial multiplier design, which exploits the small secret size, Sable outperforms most state-of-the-art KEMs, including Saber, Frodo, and NTRU Prime. The implementations of Sable that use number theoretic transform-based polynomial multiplication (SableNTT) surpass all the state-of-the-art schemes in performance, which are optimized for speed on the Cortext M4 platform. The performance benefit of SableNTT against Kyber lies in between 7 - 29%, 2 - 13% for Saber, and around 99% for Frodo.

AB SIDH is a post-quantum key exchange algorithm based on the presumed difficulty of finding isogenies between supersingular elliptic curves. However, SIDH and related cryptosystems also reveal additional information: the restriction of a secret isogeny to a subgroup of the curve (torsion-point information). Petit [31] was the first to demonstrate that torsion-point information could noticeably lower the difficulty of finding secret isogenies. In particular, Petit showed that "overstretched" parameterizations of SIDH could be broken in polynomial time. However, this did not impact the security of any cryptosystems proposed in the literature. The contribution of this paper is twofold: First, we strengthen the techniques of [31] by exploiting additional information coming from a dual and a Frobenius isogeny. This extends the impact of torsion-point attacks considerably. In particular, our techniques yield a classical attack that completely breaks the n-party group key exchange of [2], first introduced as GSIDH in [17], for 6 parties or more, and a quantum attack for 3 parties or more that improves on the best known asymptotic complexity. We also provide a Magma implementation of our attack for 6 parties. We give the full range of parameters for which our attacks apply. Second, we construct SIDH variants designed to be weak against our attacks; this includes backdoor choices of starting curve, as well as backdoor choices of base-field prime. We stress that our results do not degrade the security of, or reveal any weakness in, the NIST submission SIKE [20].

TI Optimizing superconducting Nb film cavities by mitigating medium-field
   Q-slope through annealing
SO SUPERCONDUCTOR SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY
AB Niobium films are of interest in applications in various superconducting devices, such as superconducting radiofrequency cavities for particle accelerators and superconducting qubits for quantum computing. In this study, we address the persistent medium-field Q-slope issue in Nb film cavities, which, despite their high-quality factor at low RF fields, exhibit a significant Q-slope at medium RF fields compared to bulk Nb cavities. Traditional heat treatments, effective in reducing surface resistance and mitigating the Q-slope in bulk Nb cavities, are challenging for Nb-coated copper cavities. To overcome this challenge, we employed DC bias high-power impulse magnetron sputtering to deposit Nb film onto a 1.3 GHz single-cell elliptical bulk Nb cavity, followed by annealing treatments aimed at modifying the properties of the Nb film. In-situ annealing at 340 degrees C increased the quench field from 10.0 to 12.5 MV m-1. Vacuum furnace annealing at 600 degrees C and 800 degrees C for 3 h resulted in a quench field increase of 13.5 and 15.3 MV m-1, respectively. Further annealing at 800 degrees C for 6 h boosted the quench field to 17.5 MV m-1. Additionally, the annealing treatments significantly reduced the field dependence of the surface resistance. However, increasing the annealing temperature to 900 degrees C induced a Q-switch phenomenon in the cavity. The analysis of RF performance and material characterization before and after annealing has provided critical insights into how the microstructure and impurity levels in Nb films influence the evolution of the Q-slope in Nb film cavities. Our findings highlight the significant roles of hydrides, high local misorientation, and lattice and surface defects in driving field-dependent losses. By strategically optimizing film properties and controlling impurity levels, we demonstrate a promising pathway to mitigate the medium-field Q-slope, paving the way for more efficient superconducting RF technologies.

TI Influence of Industry 4.0 technologies on strategic agility
SO MANAGEMENT-POLAND
AB Research background and purpose: Amidst escalating market volatility, manufacturers are increasingly leveraging Industry 4.0 technologies to enhance strategic agility. However, a nuanced understanding of their influence on core agility dimensions-strategic sensitivity, entrepreneurial dynamism, operational flexibility, and strategic leadership-remains limited. The purpose of the study is to evaluate how Industry 4.0 technologies support various aspects of strategic agility in manufacturing companies. Design/methodology/approach: The study employs a qualitative methodology, involving in-depth interviews with 11 informants from three selected manufacturing industry sectors. Data analysis was conducted using research triangulation, thereby increasing the credibility. Findings: The results indicate that Industry 4.0 technologies significantly support the strategic agility of companies, particularly in the areas of strategic sensitivity and strategic entrepreneurship by enabling faster identification and response to market changes and improving collaboration and innovation. Operational flexibility is also strongly enhanced by automation and improved data analytics, allowing companies to adapt more quickly to changing market demands. The impact of technologies on strategic leadership is less noticeable, as it still largely depends on human factors. Value added and limitations: This study advances understanding of Industry 4.0's impact on strategic agility in manufacturing. The study expands existing theoretical frameworks by integrating concepts co-creating strategic agility, such as dynamic capabilities and the resource-based view, with the Industry 4.0 perspective. Additionally, it highlights the complementary role of human leadership in effectively deploying these technologies, offering a nuanced understanding of the interplay between technological innovation and strategic management. For practitioners, the study offers actionable insights into leveraging Industry 4.0 technologies to boost strategic agility. By understanding these dynamics, companies can optimize production processes, reduce errors, and sustain a competitive edge. Our study's limitations include its focus on Polish manufacturing firms, potential biases from qualitative methods, and a narrow scope of technologies, highlighting the need for broader, quantitative research across industries and Industry 4.0 solutions like blockchain and quantum computing.

TI Theoretical and experimental analysis of phase noise in semiconductor
   lasers biased below threshold
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS-PHOTONICS
AB We report a theoretical and experimental study of phase noise in semiconductor lasers when the bias current is below the threshold value. The theoretical study is performed by using two types of rate equations, with additive and multiplicative noise terms. We find the conditions for which the evolution in those rate equations can be described by 1-dimensional and two dimensional Brownian motions, respectively. The main statistical differences between the additive and multiplicative noise models are then illustrated by using the simplified Brownian motion models. Additive and multiplicative noise models predictions are compared with measurements of the phase noise with a coherent receiver using a 90 degrees optical hybrid. We develop a novel method to extract the phase noise directly from our measurements, that in contrast to the usual direct method is not based on the analysis of the phase noise difference. The method permits a direct visualization of the phase noise trajectories and a calculation of the averages and the distribution that is valid in the short-time limit. Our results are in very good agreement with the results obtained with the method based on the phase noise difference. Our experimental results show that the variance of the phase noise grows linearly in time and has Gaussian statistics, supporting the modelization of the phase noise statistics with the additive noise model.

TI Learning the matrix of few-mode fibers for high-fidelity spatial mode
   transmission
SO APL PHOTONICS
AB Few-mode fibers (FMFs) are promising for advancements in transmission capacity in classical and quantum communications. However, the inherent modal crosstalk limits the practical application of FMF. One reliable way to overcome this obstacle is the measurement of the complex transmission matrix (TM), describing the light propagation behavior of fiber. The TM can be obtained by performing mode decomposition (MD) of the spatial modes at the output of the fiber. MD techniques require the retrieval of both the amplitude and phase components of the detected light field, which is commonly done by using holography. However, the provision of a reference wave is highly unfavorable for the implementation of a holography-based MD in communication technology, especially for long fibers. Using deep neural networks to process intensity-only images, this drawback can be overcome. We introduce the mode transformer network, which can perform MD on 23 modes and has been trained offline using synthetic data. Experimentally, we demonstrate, for the first time, not only the measurement of complex TM of an FMF but also the inversion of the TM using a deep learning-based MD method. For mode transmission, we achieve an average fidelity of 97%. The short duration of the determination of TM allows for overcoming time-varying effects due to, e.g., mechanical stress or temperature fluctuations. The proposed reference-less calibration is promising for fiber communication with classical light and single photons, such as at quantum key distribution. (C) 2022 Author(s).

TI Self-optimized single-nanowire photoluminescence thermometry
SO LIGHT-SCIENCE & APPLICATIONS
AB Nanomaterials-based photoluminescence thermometry (PLT) is a new contact-free photonic approach for temperature sensing, important for applications ranging from quantum technology to biomedical imaging and diagnostics. Even though numerous new materials have been explored, great challenges and deficiencies remain that hamper many applications. In contrast to most of the existing approaches that use large ensembles of rare-earth doped nanomaterials with large volumes and unavoidable inhomogeneity, we demonstrate the ultimate size reduction and simplicity of PLT by using only a single erbium-chloride-silicate (ECS) nanowire. Importantly, we propose and demonstrate a novel strategy that contains a self-optimization or smart procedure to automatically identify the best PL intensity ratio for temperature sensing. The automated procedure is used to self-optimize key sensing metrics, such as sensitivity, precision, or resolution to achieve an all-around superior PLT including several record-setting metrics including the first sensitivity exceeding 100% K-1 (similar to 138% K-1), the highest resolution of 0.01 K, and the largest range of sensible temperatures 4-500 K operating completely within 1500-1800 nm (an important biological window). The high-quality ECS nanowire enables the use of well-resolved Stark-sublevels to construct a series of PL intensity ratios for optimization in infrared, allowing the completely Boltzmann-based sensing at cryogenic temperature for the first time. Our single-nanowire PLT and the proposed optimization strategy overcome many existing challenges and could fundamentally impact PL nano-thermometry and related applications such as single-cell thermometry.

TI Study of Size, Shape, and Etch pit formation in InAs/InP Droplet Epitaxy
   Quantum Dots
SO NANOTECHNOLOGY
AB We investigated metal-organic vapor phase epitaxy grown droplet epitaxy (DE) and Stranski-Krastanov (SK) InAs/InP quantum dots (QDs) by cross-sectional scanning tunneling microscopy (X-STM). We present an atomic-scale comparison of structural characteristics of QDs grown by both growth methods proving that the DE yields more uniform and shape-symmetric QDs. Both DE and SKQDs are found to be truncated pyramid-shaped with a large and sharp top facet. We report the formation of localized etch pits for the first time in InAs/InP DEQDs with atomic resolution. We discuss the droplet etching mechanism in detail to understand the formation of etch pits underneath the DEQDs. A summary of the effect of etch pit size and position on fine structure splitting (FSS) is provided via the k center dot p theory. Finite element (FE) simulations are performed to fit the experimental outward relaxation and lattice constant profiles of the cleaved QDs. The composition of QDs is estimated to be pure InAs obtained by combining both FE simulations and X-STM results. The preferential formation of {136} and {122} side facets was observed for the DEQDs. The formation of a DE wetting layer from As-P surface exchange is compared with the standard SKQDs wetting layer. The detailed structural characterization performed in this work provides valuable feedback for further growth optimization to obtain QDs with even lower FSS for applications in quantum technology.

AB InGaAs/InP Single-Photon Avalanche Diodes ( SPADs) can achieve high photon detection efficiency (PDE) with a thick absorber, but at the expense of higher dark count rate ( DCR). PDE and DCR also depend on the electric field inside the structure, which can be tailored in the design phase and influences the overall performance. We present the design and the experimental characterization of two different 10 mu m-diameter InGaAs/InP SPADs. The first one is intended for applications where low noise is the key requirement: at 225 K and 5 V excess bias, it features 1 kcps DCR, 25% PDE at 1550 nm and a timing jitter of 100 ps (FWHM). The second device is an InGaAs/InP SPAD optimized for PDE-enhanced applications, having a PDE up to 50% at 1550 nm, with a DCR of 20 kcps and a timing jitter of 70 ps (FWHM) at 225 K. Alternatively, it features a PDE of 37% at 1550 nm, with a DCR of just 3 kcps and a timing jitter of 100 ps (FWHM). When combined with a custom integrated circuit we developed, both devices show an afterpulsing probability as low as few percent with a gating frequency of 1 MHz and hold-off time of few microseconds at 225 K, allowing to achieve a photon count rate towards 1 Mcps.

TI Distributed-HISQ: A Distributed Quantum Control Architecture

AB The design of a scalable Quantum Control Architecture (QCA) faces two primary challenges. First, the continuous growth in qubit counts has rendered distributed QCA inevitable, yet the nondeterministic latencies inherent in feedback loops demand cycleaccurate synchronization across multiple controllers. Existing synchronization strategies - whether lock-step or demand-driven-introduce significant performance penalties. Second, existing quantum instruction set architectures are polarized, being either too abstract or too granular. This lack of a unifying design necessitates recurrent hardware customization for each new control requirement, which limits the system's reconfigurability and impedes the path toward a scalable and unified digital microarchitecture.
   Addressing these challenges, we propose Distributed-HISQ, featuring: (i) HISQ, A universal instruction set that redefines quantum control with a hardware-agnostic design. By decoupling from quantum operation semantics, HISQ provides a unified language for control sequences, enabling a single microarchitecture to support various control methods and enhancing system reconfigurability. (ii) BISP, a booking-based synchronization protocol that can potentially achieve zero-cycle synchronization overhead. The feasibility and adaptability of Distributed-HISQ are validated through its implementation on a commercial quantum control system targeting superconducting qubits. We performed a comprehensive evaluation using a customized quantum software stack. Our results show that BISP effectively synchronizes multiple control boards, leading to a 22.8% reduction in average program execution time and a similar to 5x reduction in infidelity when compared to an existing lock-step synchronization scheme.

TI Kinetic Inductance Traveling Wave Amplifier Designs for Practical
   Microwave Readout Applications
SO JOURNAL OF LOW TEMPERATURE PHYSICS
AB A Kinetic Inductance Traveling Wave Amplifier (KIT) utilizes the nonlinear kinetic inductance of superconducting films, particularly niobium titanium nitride (NbTiN), for parametric amplification. These amplifiers achieve remarkable performance in terms of gain, bandwidth, and compression power and frequently approach the quantum limit for noise. However, most KIT demonstrations have been isolated from practical device readout systems. Using a KIT as the first amplifier in the readout chain of an unoptimized microwave SQUID multiplexer coupled to a transition-edge sensor microcalorimeter, we see an initial improvement in the flux noise [1]. One challenge in KIT integration is the considerable microwave pump power required to drive the non-linearity. To address this, we have initiated efforts to reduce the pump power by using thinner NbTiN films and an inverted microstrip transmission line design. In this article, we present the new transmission line design, fabrication procedure, and initial device characterization-including gain and added noise. These devices exhibit over 10 dB of gain with a 3 dB bandwidth of approximately 5.5-7.25 GHz, a maximum practical gain of 12 dB, and typical gain ripple under 4 dB peak to peak. We observe an appreciable impedance mismatch in the NbTiN transmission line, which is likely the source of the majority of the gain ripple. Finally, we perform an initial noise characterization and demonstrate system-added noise of three quanta or less over nearly the entire 3 dB bandwidth.

TI Tightening Continuity Bounds for Entropies and Bounds on Quantum
   Capacities
SO IEEE JOURNAL ON SELECTED AREAS IN INFORMATION THEORY
AB Uniform continuity bounds on entropies are generally expressed in terms of a single distance measure between probability distributions or quantum states, typically, the total variation- or trace distance. However, if an additional distance measure is known, the continuity bounds can be significantly strengthened. Here, we prove a tight uniform continuity bound for the Shannon entropy in terms of both the local- and total variation distances, sharpening an inequality in (Sason, 2013). We also obtain a uniform continuity bound for the von Neumann entropy in terms of both the operator norm- and trace distances. We then apply our results to compute upper bounds on channel capacities. We first refine the concept of approximate degradable channels by introducing $(\varepsilon ,\nu)$ -degradable channels. These are $\varepsilon $ -close in diamond norm and $\nu $ -close in completely bounded spectral norm to their complementary channel when composed with a degrading channel. This leads to improved upper bounds to the quantum- and private classical capacities of such channels. Moreover, these bounds can be further improved by considering certain unstabilized versions of the above norms. We show that upper bounds on the latter can be efficiently expressed as semidefinite programs. As an application, we obtain a new upper bound on the quantum capacity of the qubit depolarizing channel.

TI A Four-Channel BiCMOS Transmitter for a Quantum Magnetometer Based on
   Nitrogen-Vacancy Centers in Diamond
SO IEEE JOURNAL OF SOLID-STATE CIRCUITS
AB Quantum sensors based on solid-state defects, such as the nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond, offer very good room-temperature sensitivity, long-term stability, and the potential for calibration-free measurements. However, most quantum sensors still suffer from a bulky size and weight, low energy efficiency, and high costs, prohibiting their widespread use. Here, we present custom-designed chip-integrated microwave (MW) electronics for a miniaturized, low-cost, and highly scalable quantum magnetometer based on NV centers in diamond. The presented electronics include a quadrature phase-locked loop (QPLL) chip to generate the required local oscillator signal at around 7 GHz with a wide tuning range of 22% and a low phase noise (PN) of - 122 dBc/Hz at 1-MHz offset from a 7-GHz carrier for broadband low-noise magnetometry. In addition, the magnetometer electronics comprise a 4-channel transmitter chip, which can provide currents up to 412 mA(pp) into a custom-designed inductor over a wide frequency range from 6.4 to 8 GHz. In combination with a custom-designed coil, manufactured on a glass substrate for optical transparency, which features a large active area of ( pi x 180 x 180 mu m(2) ), this current is sufficient to produce strong MW magnetic fields up to B-1=(1/2)& sdot;B-ac=170 mu T , enabling pulsed optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) experiments. In proof-of-concept ODMR experiments, the presented chip-based spin control system produces fast Rabi oscillations of 5.49 MHz. The measured dc and ac magnetic field limits of detection (LOD) of the presented magnetometer are 32 nT/Hz (1/2) and 300 pT/Hz (1/2) , respectively.

TI Towards merged-element transmons using silicon fins: The FinMET
SO APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS
AB A merged-element transmon (MET) device based on silicon (Si) fins is proposed, and the first steps to form such a "FinMET " are demonstrated. This new application of fin technology capitalizes on the anisotropic etch of Si(111) relative to Si(110) to define atomically flat, high aspect ratio Si tunnel barriers with epitaxial superconductor contacts on parallel sidewall surfaces. This process circumvents the challenges associated with the growth of low-loss insulating barriers on lattice matched superconductors. By implementing low-loss, intrinsic float-zone Si as the barrier material rather than commonly used, potentially lossy AlOx, the FinMET is expected to overcome problems with standard transmons by (1) reducing dielectric losses; (2) minimizing the formation of two-level system spectral features; (3) exhibiting greater control over barrier thickness and qubit frequency spread, especially when combined with commercial fin fabrication and atomic-layer or digital etching; (4) potentially reducing the footprint by several orders of magnitude; and (5) allowing scalable fabrication. Here, as a first step to making such a device, the fabrication of Si fin capacitors on Si(110) substrates with shadow-deposited Al electrodes is demonstrated. These fin capacitors are then fabricated into lumped element resonator circuits and probed using low-temperature microwave measurements. Further thinning of silicon junctions toward the tunneling regime will enable the scalable fabrication of FinMET devices based on existing silicon technology while simultaneously avoiding lossy amorphous dielectrics for the tunnel barriers.

TI Continuous measurement boosted adiabatic quantum thermal machines
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB We present a unified approach to study continuous measurement-based quantum thermal machines in static as well as adiabatically driven systems. We investigate both steady-state and transient dynamics for the time-independent case. In the adiabatically driven case, we show how measurement-based thermodynamic quantities can be attributed geometric characteristics. We also provide the appropriate definition for heat transfer and dissipation owing to continuous measurement in the presence and absence of adiabatic driving. We illustrate the aforementioned ideas and study the phenomenon of refrigeration in two different paradigmatic examples: a coupled quantum dot and a coupled qubit system, both undergoing continuous measurement and slow driving. In the time-independent case, we show that quantum coherence can improve the cooling power of measurement-based quantum refrigerators. Exclusively for the case of coupled qubits, we consider linear as well as nonlinear system-bath couplings. We observe that nonlinear coupling produces cooling effects in certain regimes where otherwise heating is expected. In the adiabatically driven case, we observe that quantum measurement can provide significant boost to the power of adiabatic quantum refrigerators. We also observe that the obtained boost can be larger than the sum of power due to individual effects. The measurement-based refrigerators can have similar or better coefficient of performance in the driven case compared to the static one in the regime where heat extraction is maximum. Our results have potential significance for future application in devices ranging from measurement-based quantum thermal machines to refrigeration in quantum processing networks.

TI GABA Receptors Can Depolarize the Neuronal Membrane Potential via
   Quantum Tunneling of Chloride Ions: A Quantum Mathematical Study
SO CELLS
AB GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid) receptors represent the major inhibitory receptors in the nervous system and their inhibitory effects are mediated by the influx of chloride ions that tends to hyperpolarize the resting membrane potential. However, GABA receptors can depolarize the resting membrane potential and thus can also show excitatory effects in neurons. The major mechanism behind this depolarization is mainly attributed to the accumulation of chloride ions in the intracellular compartment. This accumulation leads to increase in the intracellular chloride concentration and depolarize the Nernst potential of chloride ions. When the membrane potential is relatively hyperpolarized, this will result in a chloride efflux instead of influx trying to reach their depolarized equilibrium potential. Here, we propose different mechanism based on a major consequence of quantum mechanics, which is quantum tunneling. The quantum tunneling model of ions is applied on GABA receptors and their corresponding chloride ions to show how chloride ions can depolarize the resting membrane potential. The quantum model states that intracellular chloride ions have higher quantum tunneling probability than extracellular chloride ions. This is attributed to the discrepancy in the kinetic energy between them. At physiological parameters, the quantum tunneling is negligible to the degree that chloride ions cannot depolarize the membrane potential. Under certain conditions such as early neuronal development, gain-of-function mutations, stroke and trauma that can lower the energy barrier of the closed gate of GABA receptors, the quantum tunneling is enhanced so that the chloride ions can depolarize the resting membrane potential. The major unique feature of the quantum tunneling mechanism is that the net efflux of chloride ions is attained without the need for intracellular accumulation of chloride ions as long as the energy barrier of the gate is reduced but still higher than the kinetic energy of the chloride ion as a condition for quantum tunneling to take place.

TI Ultrafast atomic-scale scanning tunnelling spectroscopy of a single
   vacancy in a monolayer crystal
SO NATURE PHOTONICS
AB Defects in atomically thin semiconductors and their moire heterostructures have emerged as a unique testbed for quantum science. Strong light-matter coupling, large spin-orbit interaction and enhanced Coulomb correlations facilitate a spin-photon interface for future qubit operations and efficient single-photon quantum emitters. Yet, directly observing the relevant interplay of the electronic structure of a single defect with other microscopic elementary excitations on their intrinsic length, time and energy scales remained a long-held dream. Here we directly resolve in space, time and energy how a spin-orbit-split energy level of an isolated selenium vacancy in a moire-distorted WSe2 monolayer evolves under the controlled excitation of lattice vibrations, using lightwave scanning tunnelling microscopy and spectroscopy. By locally launching a phonon oscillation and taking ultrafast energy-resolved snapshots of the vacancy's states faster than the vibration period, we directly measure the impact of electron-phonon coupling in an isolated single-atom defect. The combination of atomic spatial, sub-picosecond temporal and millielectronvolt energy resolution marks a disruptive development towards a comprehensive understanding of complex quantum materials, where the key microscopic elementary interactions can now be disentangled, one by one.
   Time-resolved lightwave-driven scanning tunnelling spectroscopy is developed to investigate how the spin-orbit-split energy levels of a selenium vacancy within a WSe2 monolayer shift under phonon displacement. Ultrafast snapshots of the electronic tunnelling spectra reveal transient energy shifts up to 40 meV.

TI Efficient fault-tolerant quantum dialogue protocols using a quantum
   reordering circuit of EPR pairs
SO PHYSICA SCRIPTA
AB This study proposes two efficient fault-tolerant quantum dialogue (QD) protocols that are robust against the collective-dephasing and collective-rotation noises, respectively. In the proposed protocol, the message carriers are decoherence-free quantum states that are resistant to the corresponding collective noise, provided that all quantum photon pairs of a transmitted unit remain within the same time window. These quantum states and their combinations are used to compose the decoy photon pairs to ensure the security of the transmission. An observation on the Bell measurement has allowed an EPR pair as a message carrier to Require only one of its photons for protection. That is, the measurement of one single photon in an EPR pair will gain no information on its actual Bell state. This property has effectively reduced the number of decoy photons in quantum transmission. Since the photons used in the message carriers are particles of EPR pairs, the proposed two fault-tolerant QD protocols required only half of the decoy photons to ensure the same level of security. In the transmission, one photon of each EPR pair is separated using a reordering mechanism, and a quantum logic circuit is designed and implemented to demonstrate the concept in practice. The reduction of decoy photons has significantly improved the qubit efficiency of the proposed QD protocols compared with other relevant existing works. Furthermore, the proposed schemes also have no information leakage problem.

TI Entanglement and Sudden Death for a Two-Mode Radiation Field Two Atoms
SO CMC-COMPUTERS MATERIALS & CONTINUA
AB The effect of the field-field interaction on a cavity containing two qubit (TQ) interacting with a two mode of electromagnetic field as parametric amplifier type is investigated. After performing an appropriate transformation, the constants of motion are calculated. Using the Schrodinger differential equation a system of differential equations was obtained, and the general solution was obtained in the case of exact resonance. Some statistical quantities were calculated and discussed in detail to describe the features of this system. The collapses and revivals phenomena have been discussed in details. The Shannon information entropy has been applied for measuring the degree of entanglement (DE) between the qubits and the electromagnetic field. The normal squeezing for some values of the parameter of the field-field interaction is studied. The results showed that the collapses disappeared after the field-field terms were added and the maximum values of normal squeezing decrease when increasing of the field-field interaction parameter. While the revivals and amplitudes of the oscillations increase when the parameter of the field-field interaction increases. Degree of entanglement is partially more entangled with increasing of the field-field interaction parameter. The relationship between revivals, collapses and the degree of entanglement (Shannon information entropy) was monitored and discussed in the presence and absence of the field-field interaction.

TI Detection of dielectric screening effect by excitons in two-dimensional
   semiconductors and its application
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB Atomically thin transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) like MX2 (M = W or Mo, X = S or Se) arewell-known examples of two-dimensional (2D) semiconductors. They have attracted wide and long-lastingattention due to the strong light-matter interaction and unique spin-valley locking characteristics. In the 2Dlimit, the reduced dielectric screening significantly enhances the Coulomb interaction. The optical properties ofmonolayer TMDCs are thus dominated by excitons, the tightly bound electron-hole pairs. In this work, webriefly overview the history and recent research progress of optical spectroscopy studies on TMDCs. We firstintroduce the layer-dependent band structure and the corresponding modifications on optical transitions, andbriefly mention the effects of external magnetic fields and the charge doping on excitons. We then introduce anovel sensing technique enabled by the sensitivity of excitons to the dielectric environment. The exciton excitedstates (Rydberg states) observed in monolayer TMDCs have large Bohr radii (> few nm), where the electricfield lines between electron-hole pairs well extends out of the material. Hence the Coulomb interaction (whichaffects the quasiparticle band gap and exciton binding energies) in the monolayer TMDC is sensitive to thedielectric environment, making the excitons in 2D semiconductor an efficient quantum sensor in probingdielectric properties of the surroundings. The method is of high spatial resolution and only diffraction limited.We enumerate the applications of monolayer WSe2 dielectric sensor in detecting the secondary Dirac point ofgraphene induced by the graphene-hBN superlattice potential, as well as the fractional correlated insulatingstates emerging in WS2/WSe2 moire superlattices. Meanwhile, a unified framework for describing the many-body interactions and dynamical screenings in the system is still lacking. Future theoretical and experimentalefforts are needed for a complete understanding. Finally, we further discuss the perspectives and potentialapplications of this non-destructive and efficient dielectric sensing method

TI Spatial and pulse efficiency constraints in atom interferometric
   gravitational wave detectors
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Currently planned and constructed terrestrial detectors for gravitational waves and dark matter based on differential light-pulse atom interferometry are designed around three primary strategies to enhance their sensitivity: (i) Resonant-mode enhancement using multiple diamonds, (ii) large-momentum-transfer (LMT) techniques to increase arm separation within the interferometer, and (iii) very-long baseline schemes that increase the distance between the two interferometers. Both resonant-mode enhancement and LMT techniques result in a greater number of light pulses, making high pulse fidelity during atom-light interactions imperative. At the same time, increasing the number of diamonds in vertical configurations leads to taller atomic fountains, which consequently reduces the available distance between interferometers. As a result, the number of diamonds, LMT pulses, and the fountain height are interdependent parameters that must be carefully balanced. In this work, we present optimal configurations for multi-diamond geometries in resonant mode, explicitly accounting for the spatial extent of a single interferometer, considering constraints imposed by the baseline dimensions and atomic losses due to imperfect pulses. For this optimization, we numerically scan the relevant parameters such as initial position and momentum of the atomic cloud, transferred momenta, and number of loops. For each parameter set, we verify whether the imposed conditions are met and evaluate the resulting sensitivities to identify optimal configurations. We provide practical analytical relations to estimate the optimal number of pulses that should be applied. Many proposals beyond demonstrator experiments require pulse numbers that demand efficiencies not yet demonstrated with state-of-the-art momentum transfer techniques. As a result, the observed sensitivity falls short of expectations-an effect caused by both arm separation and atom loss per pulse-highlighting the urgent need for research aimed at improving pulse fidelities.

TI High-Tc superconducting quantum devices for
   cutting-edge terahertz technology
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS D-APPLIED PHYSICS
AB Terahertz (THz) technology is a rapidly developing field that explores the use of electromagnetic waves in the THz frequency range. The unique properties of THz waves have great application prospects in electromagnetic sensing, security inspection, non-destructive testing, medical diagnostics, biology, high-speed wireless communication, space science and so on. At present, the application of THz technology is still under continuous research and development, and its broad scientific prospects are recognized worldwide. THz frequency falls into the gap on the electromagnetic spectrum of electronics and optics, thus both classic microwave and optical technologies cannot be directly applied to the THz systems. New components, circuits and application systems are being developed for THz technology. Superconductivity is a quantum mechanical phenomenon and offers unique advantages for applications in high-frequency electromagnetic domains. Novel superconducting quantum devices are being exploited for THz wave radiation and detection, and many THz application systems. The high-T-c superconducting (HTS) electronic devices have great potential in emerging THz technologies due to its very high-energy bandgap (well into THz regions) and much relaxed cooling requirement, and they offer strong prospect for the development of practical and portable THz systems. This paper provides an overview of the state-of-art development of HTS THz quantum devices and their application for THz sensing, imaging and communication. The review will start with a brief introduction about cutting-edge THz technology, the fundamental of superconductivity, Josephson effects and the HTS Josephson junctions. Then, the research progress and the latest achievement of HTS Josephson THz emitters, detectors and mixers will be reviewed, followed by their application examples in some THz systems. Finally, the conclusion, challenges and outlooks of the HTS technologies in THz applications are discussed.

TI Hybrid Electrostatic-Atomic Accelerometer for Future Space Gravity
   Missions
SO REMOTE SENSING
AB Long-term observation of Earth's temporal gravity field with enhanced temporal and spatial resolution is a major objective for future satellite gravity missions. Improving the performance of the accelerometers present in such missions is one of the main paths to explore. In this context, we propose to study an original concept of a hybrid accelerometer associating a state-of-the-art electrostatic accelerometer (EA) and a promising quantum sensor based on cold atom interferometry. To assess the performance potential of such an instrument, numerical simulations were performed to determine its impact in terms of gravity field retrieval. Taking advantage of the long-term stability of the cold atom interferometer (CAI), it is shown that the reduced drift of the hybrid sensor could lead to improved gravity field retrieval. Nevertheless, this gain vanishes once temporal variations of the gravity field and related aliasing effects are taken into account. Improved de-aliasing models or some specific satellite constellations are then required to maximize the impact of the accelerometer performance gain. To evaluate the achievable acceleration performance in-orbit, a numerical simulator of the hybrid accelerometer was developed and preliminary results are given. The instrument simulator was in part validated by reproducing the performance achieved with a hybrid lab prototype operating on the ground. The problem of satellite rotation impact on the CAI was also investigated both with instrument performance simulations and experimental demonstrations. It is shown that the proposed configuration, where the EA's proof-mass acts as the reference mirror for the CAI, seems a promising approach to allow the mitigation of satellite rotation. To evaluate the feasibility of such an instrument for space applications, a preliminary design is elaborated along with a preliminary error, mass, volume, and electrical power consumption budget.

TI Development and Proof of Concept of a Miniaturized MEMS Quantum
   Tunneling Accelerometer Based on PtC Tips by Focused Ion Beam 3D
   Nano-Patterning
SO SENSORS
AB Most accelerometers today are based on the capacitive principle. However, further miniaturization for micro integration of those sensors leads to a poorer signal-to-noise ratio due to a small total area of the capacitor plates. Thus, other transducer principles should be taken into account to develop smaller sensors. This paper presents the development and realization of a miniaturized accelerometer based on the tunneling effect, whereas its highly sensitive effect regarding the tunneling distance is used to detect small deflections in the range of sub-nm. The spring-mass-system is manufactured by a surface micro-machining foundry process. The area of the shown polysilicon (PolySi) sensor structures has a size smaller than 100 mu m x 50 mu m (L x W). The tunneling electrodes are placed and patterned by a focused ion beam (FIB) and gas injection system (GIS) with MeCpPtMe3 as a precursor. A dual-beam system enables maximum flexibility for post-processing of the spring-mass-system and patterning of sharp tips with radii in the range of a few nm and initial distances between the electrodes of about 30-300 nm. The use of metal-organic precursor material platinum carbon (PtC) limits the tunneling currents to about 150 pA due to the high inherent resistance. The measuring range is set to 20 g. The sensitivity of the sensor signal, which depends exponentially on the electrode distance due to the tunneling effect, ranges from 0.4 pA/g at 0 g in the sensor operational point up to 20.9 pA/g at 20 g. The acceleration-equivalent thermal noise amplitude is calculated to be 2.4-3.4 mg/root Hz. Electrostatic actuators are used to lead the electrodes in distances where direct quantum tunneling occurs.

TI First evaluation of an absolute quantum gravimeter (AQG#B01) for future
   field experiments
SO GEOSCIENTIFIC INSTRUMENTATION METHODS AND DATA SYSTEMS
AB Quantum gravimeters are a promising new development allowing for continuous absolute gravity monitoring while remaining user-friendly and transportable. In this study, we present experiments carried out to assess the capacity of the AQG#B01 in view of future deployment as a field gravimeter for hydrogeophysical applications. The AQG#B01 is the field version follow-up of the AQG#A01 portable absolute quantum gravimeter developed by the French quantum sensor company Muquans. We assess the instrument's performance in terms of stability (absence of instrumental drift) and sensitivity in relation to other gravimeters. No significant instrumental drift was observed over several weeks of measurement. We discuss the observations concerning the accuracy of the AQG#B01 in comparison with a state-of-the-art absolute gravimeter (Micro-g-LaCoste, FG5#228). We report the repeatability to be better than 50 nm s(-2). This study furthermore investigates whether changes in instrument tilt and external temperature and a combination of both, which are likely to occur during field campaigns, influence the measurement of gravitational attraction. We repeatedly tested external temperatures between 20 and 30 degrees C and did not find any significant effect. As an example of a geophysical signal, a 100 nm s(-2) gravity change is detected with the AQG#B01 after a rainfall event at the Larzac geodetic observatory (southern France). The data agreed with the gravity changes measured with a superconducting relative gravimeter (GWR, iGrav#002) and the expected gravity change simulated as an infinite Bouguer slab approximation. We report 2 weeks of stable operation under semi-terrain conditions in a garage without temperature-control. We close with operational recommendations for potential users and discuss specific possible future field applications. While not claiming completeness, we nevertheless present the first characterization of a quantum gravimeter carried out by future users. Selected criteria for the assessment of its suitability in field applications have been investigated and are complemented with a discussion of further necessary experiments.

TI Performance of Summer Greengram (Vigna radiate L.) under Various
   Orientations in Semi-arid Region, Haryana (India)
SO LEGUME RESEARCH
AB Background: Summer green gram (Vigna radiata L.) commonly known as "moong" belongs to the Fabaceae family that currently is grown in different parts of the world and it has a significant role in nutrition in developing countries. It is a short-duration crop grown over a wide range of environments in India. Light interception and penetration as well as albedo are affected by row orientation. Methods: Line Quantum sensor (Model L1-191 R) was used to measure PAR (400 nm-700 nm) at important phenophases at different orientations. In order to better understand how plants absorb light in different row orientations, such as North-South (NS), East-West (EW) and North-West-Southeast (NW-SE), a study was carried out at the Chaudhary Charan Singh Research Farm of Agricultural Meteorology at the Haryana Agricultural University in Hisar India during summer 2020 and 2021. Heat and radiation use efficiency measure at flowering, pod and physiological maturity by using weather data and other indices. Result: It was found that moong variety MH 421's pod initiation stage was when PAR absorption was greatest, along with other factors including NW-SE orientation. Row orientation heat use efficiency ranges between (2.6 to 7.6 kg ha-1 degrees C day-1) and in variety (1.4 to 2.7 g MJ-1) and radiation use efficiency ranges between (1.4 to 2.8 g MJ-1) and in row orientation (1.4 to 2.7 g MJ-1) (2.7 to 7.7 kg ha-1 degrees C day-1). As a consequence, it was determined that diagonal row orientations generated better yield and yield attributes because PAR absorption was higher in such orientations. In dry and semi-arid areas, it can be used to produce food and forage.

TI The Quantum Tunneling of Ions Model Can Explain the Pathophysiology of
   Tinnitus
SO BRAIN SCIENCES
AB Tinnitus is a well-known pathological entity in clinical practice. However, the pathophysiological mechanisms behind tinnitus seem to be elusive and cannot provide a comprehensive understanding of its pathogenesis and clinical manifestations. Hence, in the present study, we explore the mathematical model of ions' quantum tunneling to propose an original pathophysiological mechanism for the sensation of tinnitus. The present model focuses on two major aspects: The first aspect is the ability of ions, including sodium, potassium, and calcium, to depolarize the membrane potential of inner hair cells and the neurons of the auditory pathway. This membrane depolarization is induced via the quantum tunneling of ions through closed voltage-gated channels. The state of membrane depolarization can be a state of hyper-excitability or hypo-excitability, depending on the degree of depolarization. Both of these states aid in understanding the pathophysiology of tinnitus. The second aspect is the quantum tunneling signals between the demyelinated neurons of the auditory pathway. These signals are mediated via the quantum tunneling of potassium ions, which exit to the extracellular fluid during an action potential event. These quantum signals can be viewed as a "quantum synapse" between neurons. The formation of quantum synapses results in hyper-excitability among the demyelinated neurons of the auditory pathway. Both of these aspects augment and amplify the electrical signals in the auditory pathway and result in a loss of the spatiotemporal fidelity of sound signals going to the brain centers. The brain interprets this hyper-excitability and loss of spatiotemporal fidelity as tinnitus. Herein, we show mathematically that the quantum tunneling of ions can depolarize the membrane potential of the inner hair cells and neurons of the auditory pathway. Moreover, we calculate the probability of action potential induction in the neurons of the auditory pathway generated by the quantum tunneling signals of potassium ions.

TI Submegahertz spectral width photon pair source based on fused silica
   microspheres
SO PHOTONICS RESEARCH
AB High-efficiency submegahertz bandwidth photon pair generators will enable the field of quantum technology to transition from laboratory demonstrations to transformational applications involving information transfer from photons to atoms. While spontaneous parametric processes are able to achieve high-efficiency photon pair generation, the spectral bandwidth tends to be relatively large, as defined by phase-matching constraints. To solve this fundamental limitation, we use an ultrahigh quality factor (Q) fused silica microsphere resonant cavity to form a photon pair generator. We present the full theory for the spontaneous four-wave mixing (SFWM) process in these devices, fully taking into account all relevant source characteristics in our experiments. The exceptionally narrow (down to kilohertz-scale) linewidths of these devices result in a reduction in the bandwidth of the photon pair generation, allowing submegahertz spectral bandwidth to be achieved. Specifically, using a pump source centered around 1550 nm, photon pairs with the signal and idler modes at wavelengths close to 1540 and 1560 nm, respectively, are demonstrated. We herald a single idler-mode photon by detecting the corresponding signal photon, filtered via transmission through a wavelength division multiplexing channel of choice. We demonstrate the extraction of the spectral profile of a single peak in the single-photon frequency comb from a measurement of the signal-idler time of emission distribution. These improvements in device design and experimental methods enabled the narrowest spectral width (Delta nu = 366 kHz) to date in a heralded single-photon source based on SFWM.

TI A cavity-based optical antenna for color centers in diamond
SO APL PHOTONICS
AB An efficient atom-photon interface is a key requirement for the integration of solid-state emitters, such as color centers in diamond, into quantum technology applications. As other solid-state emitters, however, their emission into free space is severely limited due to the high refractive index of the bulk host crystal. In this work, we present a planar optical antenna based on two silver mirrors coated on a thin single crystal diamond membrane, forming a planar Fabry-Perot cavity that improves the photon extraction from single tin vacancy (SnV) centers and their coupling to an excitation laser. Upon numerical optimization of the structure, we find theoretical enhancements in the collectible photon rate by a factor of 60 as compared to the bulk case. As a proof-of-principle demonstration, we fabricate single crystal diamond membranes with sub-mu m thickness and create SnV centers by ion implantation. Employing off-resonant excitation, we show a sixfold enhancement of the collectible photon rate, yielding up to half a million photons per second from a single SnV center. At the same time, we observe a significant reduction of the required excitation power in accordance with theory, demonstrating the functionality of the cavity as an optical antenna. Due to its planar design, the antenna simultaneously provides similar enhancements for a large number of emitters inside the membrane. Furthermore, the monolithic structure provides high mechanical stability and straightforwardly enables operation under cryogenic conditions as required in most spin-photon interface implementations.

TI QuDASH: Quantum-Inspired Rate Adaptation Approach for DASH Video
   Streaming
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Internet traffic is dramatically increasing with the development of network technologies and video streaming traffic accounts for large amount within the total traffic, which reveals the importance to guarantee the quality of content delivery service. Based on the network conditions, adaptive bitrate (ABR) control is utilized as a common technique which can choose the proper bitrate to ensure the video streaming quality. In this paper, new bitrate control method, QuDASH is proposed by taking advantage of the emerging quantum technology. In QuDASH, the adaptive control model is developed using the quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO), which aims at increasing the average bitrate and decreasing the video rebuffering events to maximize the user quality of experience (QoE). In order to formulate the video control model, first the QUBO terms of different factors are defined regarding video quality, bitrate change, and buffer condition. Then, all the individual QUBO terms are merged to generate an objective function. By minimizing the QUBO objective function, the bitrate choice is determined from the solution. The control model is solved by Digital Annealer, which is a quantum-inspired computing technology. The evaluation of the proposed method is carried out by simulation with the throughput traces obtained in real world under different scenarios and the comparison with other methods is conducted. Experiment results demonstrated that the proposed QuDASH method has better performance in terms of QoE compared with other advanced ABR methods. In 68.2% of the examined cases, QuDASH achieves the highest QoE results, which shows the superiority of the QuDASH over conventional methods.

TI On the Czochralski growth of
   SixGe1-x crystals as substrates for
   strained Ge quantum well heterostructures
SO JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS
AB This investigation showcases the viability of producing SixGe1-x bulk single crystals via the Czochralski technique. A high Si content in Ge-rich SiGe wafers is highly desirable for various applications in quantum technology, particularly as strain-relaxed buffers for the realization of hole spin qubits in strained Ge quantum well heterostructures. The focus lies on the bulk crystal growth of such materials and their chemical and structural quality. For this, the Czochralski process, starting from a highly pure Ge seed and melt, utilizing continuous feeding by dissolution of Si rods was performed.Si0.16Ge0.86 wafers with a diameter of up to 15 mm obtained from the bulk crystal exhibited homogeneous structural quality in contrast to the conventionally used epitaxial strain-relaxed SiGe buffers. The compositional fluctuations of Si measured throughout the wafer were below 0.4 at. % in addition to a dislocation density below 3 x 10(6) dislocations/cm(2). Interestingly, the central region of the wafer displayed no measurable compositional fluctuations and contained less than 10(5) dislocations/cm(2). Furthermore, the difficulties and limits of growing such SiGe crystals are discussed, such as the continuous dissolution of Si during growth and the formation of oxides in the melt during growth. The current observations indicate significant potential for further enhancement of the crystal quality and to realize higher Si concentrations using the Czochralski technique. (c) 2025 Author(s).

TI Deep Learning Enabled Transmission of Full-Stokes Polarization Images
   Through Complex Media
SO LASER & PHOTONICS REVIEWS
AB Polarization images offer crucial functionalities across multiple scientific domains, providing access to physical information beyond conventional measures such as intensity, phase, and spectrum of light. However, the challenge of transmitting polarization images through complex media has restricted their application in optical communication and imaging. Here, a novel approach utilizing deep learning for the transmission of full-Stokes polarization images through scattering media is presented. It is demonstrated that any input polarization image can be reconstructed in a single shot by employing only an intensity sensor. By supervised training of a deep neural network, high-accuracy full-Stokes reconstruction is achieved from the speckle pattern detected by an intensity camera. Leveraging the deep learning based polarization decoder, a polarization-colored encoding scheme is devised to enable increased-capacity data transmission through disordered channels. Fast, wavelength-independent, on-chip, polarization imaging in complex media enables the utilization of polarization-structured light in multimode fibres and opaque materials, unlocking new possibilities in optical communication, cryptography, and quantum technology.
   Polarization images offer enhanced functionalities in many photonics applications but do not transmit through inhomogeneous media. This novel approach exploits deep learning for full-Stokes reconstruction of polarization images scrambled through complex media. Employing only a CMOS intensity sensor, the method is single-shot, on-chip, and broadband. Leveraging deep learning polarization imaging, an increased-capacity communication based on polarization colors is demonstrated. The results empower the utilization of polarization-structured light in imaging, communication, and cryptography. image

TI Superconducting proximity effect in two-dimensional hole gases
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB Technology involving hybrid superconductor-semiconductor materials is a promising avenue for engineering quantum devices for information storage, manipulation, and transmission. Proximity-induced superconducting correlations are an essential part of such devices. While the proximity effect in the conduction band of common semiconductors is well understood, its manifestation in confined hole gases, realized for instance in germanium, is an active area of research. Lower-dimensional hole-based systems, particularly in germanium, are emerging as an attractive platform for a variety of solid-state quantum devices, due to their combination of efficient spin and charge control and long coherence times. The recent experimental realization of the proximity effect in germanium thus calls for a theoretical description that is tailored to hole gases. In this work, we propose a simple model to describe proximity-induced superconductivity in two-dimensional hole gases, incorporating both the heavy-hole (HH) and light-hole (LH) bands. We start from the Luttinger-Kohn model, introduce three parameters that characterize hopping across the superconductor-semiconductor interface, and derive explicit intraband and interband effective pairing terms for the HH and LH bands. Unlike previous approaches, our theory provides a quantitative relationship between induced pairings and interface properties. Restricting our general model to an experimentally relevant case where only the HH band crosses the chemical potential, we predict the coexistence of s-wave and d-wave singlet pairings, along with triplet-type pairings, and modified Zeeman and Rashba spin-orbit couplings. Our results thus present a starting point for theoretical modeling of quantum devices based on proximitized hole gases, fueling further progress in quantum technology.

TI Fast generation of entanglement between coupled spins using optimization
   and deep learning methods
SO EPJ QUANTUM TECHNOLOGY
AB Coupled spins form composite quantum systems which play an important role in many quantum technology applications, with an essential task often being the efficient generation of entanglement between two constituent qubits. The simplest such system is a pair of spins-1/2\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$1/2$\end{document} coupled with Ising interaction, and in previous works various quantum control methods such as adiabatic processes, shortcuts to adiabaticity and optimal control have been employed to quickly generate there one of the maximally entangled Bell states. In this study, we use machine learning and optimization methods to produce maximally entangled states in minimum time, with the Rabi frequency and the detuning used as bounded control functions. We do not target a specific maximally entangled state, like the preceding studies, but rather find the controls which maximize the concurrence, leading thus automatically the system to the closest such state in shorter time. By increasing the bounds of the control functions we observe that the corresponding optimally selected maximally entangled state also changes and the necessary time to reach it is reduced. The present work demonstrates also that machine learning and optimization offer efficient and flexible techniques for the fast generation of entanglement in coupled spin systems, and we plan to extent it to systems involving more spins, for example spin chains.

TI Rutherford Backscattering Spectrometry analysis of the formation of
   superconducting V3Si thin films
SO NUCLEAR INSTRUMENTS & METHODS IN PHYSICS RESEARCH SECTION B-BEAM
   INTERACTIONS WITH MATERIALS AND ATOMS
AB Vanadium silicide, V3Si, is a promising superconductor for silicon-based superconducting (SC) devices due to its compatibility with silicon substrates and its potential for integration into existing semiconductor technologies. However, to date there have been only a limited number of studies of the formation of SC V3Si thin films and the associated structural and superconducting properties. This work aims to explore the structural characteristics and SC properties of V3Si films, paving the way for the development of functional SC devices for quantum technology applications. We have investigated the formation of V3Si films by directly depositing vanadium (V) onto thermally grown SiO2 on Si, followed by high-vacuum annealing to induce the phase transformation into V3Si. Rutherford Backscattering Spectrometry (RBS) was employed throughout the sample growth process to analyze the material composition as a function of depth using a He-4(+) ion beam. Analysis of the RBS data confirmed that the V layer fully reacted with the SiO2 substrate to form V3Si at the interface, in addition to a vanadium oxide (VOx) layer forming atop the V3Si film. The thickness of the V3Si layer ranges from 63 to 130 nm, with annealing temperatures between 750 degrees C and 800 degrees C. A sharp SC transition was observed at T-c = 13 K in the sample annealed at 750 degrees C, with a narrow transition width (Delta T-c)of0.6 K. Initial reactive ion etching (RIE) studies yielded promising results for local removal of the (VOx) to facilitate electrical contact formation to the SC layer.

TI Growth optimization of TaN for superconducting spintronics
SO MATERIALS FOR QUANTUM TECHNOLOGY
AB We have optimized the growth of superconducting TaN thin films on SiO2 substrates via dc magnetron sputtering and extract a maximum superconducting transition temperature of T c = 5 K as well as a maximum critical field mu 0 H c2 = (13.8 +/- 0.1) T. This material is of interest for both different fields of quantum technology and superconducting spintronics as it represents a magnetic field-robust superconductor with strong spin-orbit interaction (SOI). After presenting the results of the growth optimization, we investigate in the second part the impact of the strong SOI in TaN on superconductor/ferromagnet heterostructures. To this end, we analyze the magnetization dynamics of both normal state and superconducting TaN/Ni80Fe20 (permalloy, Py)-bilayers as a function of temperature using broadband ferromagnetic resonance spectroscopy. In particular, we quantify the inverse current-induced torques of the bilayers and compare these results to NbN/Py-bilayers. In the normal state of TaN, we detect a positive damping-like current-induced torque sigma d from the inverse spin Hall effect and a small field-like torque sigma f attributed to the inverse Rashba-Edelstein effect at the TaN/Py-interface. In the superconducting state of TaN, we detect a negative sigma d attributed to the quasiparticle mediated inverse spin Hall effect (QMiSHE) and the unexpected manifestation of a large positive field-like sigma f of unknown origin matching our previous results for NbN/Py-bilayers. The QMiSHE can be used to probe spin currents in emergent quantum materials.

TI Rydberg atom-based AM receiver with a weak continuous frequency carrier
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB We demonstrate an atom-based amplitude-modulation (AM) receiver for digital communication with a weak continuous frequency carrier using a Rydberg AC Stark effect in a vapor cell and achieve the operating carrier frequency continuously from 0.1 GHz to 5 GHz at a single Rydberg state. A strong local oscillator (LO) field E-LO acts as a gain to shift the Rydberg level to a high sensitivity region, and a weak carrier field E-carr keeps the same frequency with the LO field. The digital baseband signals are encoded onto the E-carr using the amplitude modulation technique with the different modulation frequency. The response of Rydberg atom to the baseband signal is probed via a Rydberg electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT). The measured instantaneous bandwidth of the system is about 230 kHz. To demonstrate the performance of our system for an actual communication, we consider a color image as an example, the received image displays that the bit error rate (BER) is less than 5% when the maximum data transfer rate is about 238 kbps. Meanwhile, our system shows the weak carrier field of E-carr >= 13.52 mu V/cm can be used for the practical communication with BER less than 5%. Our works break the limitation that EIT-AT based atomic receivers only operate at the near resonant frequencies of the Rydberg transitions, making this emerging of quantum technology close to the practical application with high sensitivity and broad bandwidth.

TI Enhancing high school students' understanding and attitude towards
   quantum mechanics through discipline-culture framework and cognitive
   apprenticeship
SO EPJ QUANTUM TECHNOLOGY
AB BackgroundIntroducing advanced quantum mechanics (QM) and quantum technology (QT) concepts to high school students is a global priority aimed at developing a quantum-literate workforce for the growing QT industry. However, high school-initiated QT outreach programs embedded in sustainable, school-led activities remain rare, with most researcher-led programs treating classroom integration as an afterthought. This study addresses this gap by reporting findings from a school-initiated, fully online quantum education STEM & Research Internship Program (SRIP) for Filipino high school students.Method and Theoretical FrameworkWe employed a single-group quasi-experimental pre-post research design, collecting data via a mixed-methods approach using validated concept inventories and students' daily journal entries. The program was guided by a theoretical framework integrating the discipline-culture paradigm of physics knowledge (for curriculum design) with the cognitive apprenticeship model (for curriculum implementation). Twenty high-achieving students (11 males, 9 females; Grades 9-11) from a STEM-focused Philippine high school participated.Results and ConclusionResults indicate increased knowledge of QM and QT concepts and improved attitudes towards QM among students following completion of the quantum education SRIP. Findings highlight the program's positive educational impact and its novelty as the first school-initiated, fully online quantum outreach initiative in the Philippines, with potential for global adoption.

TI Optimal satellite selection using quantum convolutional autoencoder for
   low-cost GNSS receiver applications
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB The increasing reliance on global navigation satellite systems for diverse applications necessitates the development of efficient satellite selection methods to optimize positioning accuracy and system performance. In particular, low-cost global navigation satellite systems receivers face challenges in managing data from multiple visible satellites, often resulting in suboptimal performance due to high geometric dilution of precision values. Effective satellite selection is crucial for improving the accuracy and reliability of positioning solutions in these systems. Quantum computing and machine learning provide promising solutions by using data patterns for complex optimization problems. This work proposes the quantum convolutional autoencoder-based optimal satellite selection method. This new satellite selection method examined the data collected from the receiver located at latitude 16.33 degrees N and longitude 80.62 degrees E, collected on March 10, 2022. The main aim is to enhance the performance of low-cost receivers by minimizing the geometric dilution of precision values and optimizing the tetrahedron volume function. Quantum convolutional autoencoders process the satellite data to balance the navigational solution's computational burden and the navigational algorithm's accuracy. The model aims to identify the most optimal satellites for positioning by setting geometric dilution of precision as the cost function. The QCAE-based method achieves a CEP of 1.384 m and SEP of 1.759 m for four selected satellites, compared to 5.937 m and 6.691 m for PSOSSM. For nine satellites, QCAE achieves a CEP of 1.287 m and SEP of 1.713 m, while PSOSSM results in 5.725 m and 6.385 m, respectively. Additionally, QCAE reduces computations by over 64%, requiring 730 multiplications and 713 additions, compared to 2034 multiplications and 2017 additions for all visible satellites. This proposed approach provides the optimal navigation solution for cost-effective implementations in a real-time environment. This research provides new insights into satellite selection strategies using machine learning approaches.

TI Simulation of Coulomb crystal structure and motion trajectory of calcium
   ions in linear ion trap
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB Coulomb crystals have applications in many areas such as quantum computing and simulation, quantum logic spectroscopy, nonlinear dynamics and chaos, phase transitions, and chemical reaction process. The structure of the Coulomb crystal and the trajectory of each trapped ion are typically determined by the parameters of the trap and the ion species. However, dark ions are often inevitable in experiment, which introduces uncertainty into the desired crystal structures and ion trajectories. Few researches have been conducted to investigate the configuration change of the crystal in the presence of dark ions and the influence of a dark ion on its surrounding ion trajectories in a multi-ion system. In this work, we utilize the molecular dynamics simulation software LAMMPS and the (py)LIon package (modified to adapt the semi-classical theory of laser cooling) for simulating the three-dimensional ion trajectories of Coulomb crystals. The formation process of 40Ca+ Coulomb crystal in a linear trap is simulated. With the micromotion and secular motion trajectories of each ion, we calculate the temperature of Coulomb crystal and the average velocity of specific ions. It is observed that the crystal structure exhibits obvious layering phenomenon when the trapped ions yield a large difference in their charge-to-mass ratio (CMR), however, layering is not obvious with a small difference in the CMR. In addition, we simulate and compare the Coulomb crystal structure formed by pure 40Ca+ ions with that formed by 40Ca+ ions mixed with a small number of dark ions including isotopic ions (44Ca+) and impurity ions (CaH+). Three different cases are investigated, namely the one-dimensional ion string, two-dimensional planar structure and three-dimensional helical structure. The results show that the ions in the neighborhood of a dark ion exhibit around micron-order position change compared with their positions before the dark ion is formed. Such a change can be measured in experiment through microscopic imaging, thereby providing a way to identify the formation of dark ions in Column crystals with a large ion number.

TI Super-resolution imaging: when biophysics meets nanophotonics
SO NANOPHOTONICS
AB Probing light-matter interaction at the nanometer scale is one of the most fascinating topics of modern optics. Its importance is underlined by the large span of fields in which such accurate knowledge of light-matter interaction is needed, namely nanophotonics, quantum electrodynamics, atomic physics, biosensing, quantum computing and many more. Increasing innovations in the field of microscopy in the last decade have pushed the ability of observing such phenomena across multiple length scales, from micrometers to nanometers. In bioimaging, the advent of super-resolution single-molecule localization microscopy (SMLM) has opened a completely new perspective for the study and understanding of molecular mechanisms, with unprecedented resolution, which take place inside the cell. Since then, the field of SMLM has been continuously improving, shifting from an initial drive for pushing technological limitations to the acquisition of new knowledge. Interestingly, such developments have become also of great interest for the study of light-matter interaction in nanostructured materials, either dielectric, metallic, or hybrid metallic-dielectric. The purpose of this review is to summarize the recent advances in the field of nanophotonics that have leveraged SMLM, and conversely to show how some concepts commonly used in nanophotonics can benefit the development of new microscopy techniques for biophysics. To this aim, we will first introduce the basic concepts of SMLM and the observables that can be measured. Then, we will link them with their corresponding physical quantities of interest in biophysics and nanophotonics and we will describe state-of-the-art experiments that apply SMLM to nanophotonics. The problem of localization artifacts due to the interaction of the fluorescent emitter with a resonant medium and possible solutions will be also discussed. Then, we will show how the interaction of fluorescent emitters with plasmonic structures can be successfully employed in biology for cell profiling and membrane organization studies. We present an outlook on emerging research directions enabled by the synergy of localization microscopy and nanophotonics.

TI Artificial Intelligence for Autonomous Molecular Design: A Perspective
SO MOLECULES
AB Domain-aware artificial intelligence has been increasingly adopted in recent years to expedite molecular design in various applications, including drug design and discovery. Recent advances in areas such as physics-informed machine learning and reasoning, software engineering, high-end hardware development, and computing infrastructures are providing opportunities to build scalable and explainable AI molecular discovery systems. This could improve a design hypothesis through feedback analysis, data integration that can provide a basis for the introduction of end-to-end automation for compound discovery and optimization, and enable more intelligent searches of chemical space. Several state-of-the-art ML architectures are predominantly and independently used for predicting the properties of small molecules, their high throughput synthesis, and screening, iteratively identifying and optimizing lead therapeutic candidates. However, such deep learning and ML approaches also raise considerable conceptual, technical, scalability, and end-to-end error quantification challenges, as well as skepticism about the current AI hype to build automated tools. To this end, synergistically and intelligently using these individual components along with robust quantum physics-based molecular representation and data generation tools in a closed-loop holds enormous promise for accelerated therapeutic design to critically analyze the opportunities and challenges for their more widespread application. This article aims to identify the most recent technology and breakthrough achieved by each of the components and discusses how such autonomous AI and ML workflows can be integrated to radically accelerate the protein target or disease model-based probe design that can be iteratively validated experimentally. Taken together, this could significantly reduce the timeline for end-to-end therapeutic discovery and optimization upon the arrival of any novel zoonotic transmission event. Our article serves as a guide for medicinal, computational chemistry and biology, analytical chemistry, and the ML community to practice autonomous molecular design in precision medicine and drug discovery.

TI Historical Perspectives, State of art and Research Trends of Single
   Photon Avalanche Diodes and Their Applications (Part 1: Single Pixels)
SO FRONTIERS IN PHYSICS
AB The ability to detect single photons is becoming an enabling key capability in an increasing number of fields. Indeed, its scope is not limited to applications that specifically rely on single photons, such as quantum imaging, but extends to applications where a low signal is overwhelmed by background light, such as laser ranging, or in which faint excitation light is required not to damage the sample or harm the patient. In the last decades, SPADs gained popularity with respect to other single-photon detectors thanks to their small size, possibility to be integrated in Complementary Metal-Oxide Semiconductor processes, room temperature operability, low power supply and, above all, the possibility to be fast gated (to time filter the incoming signal) and to precisely timestamp the detected photons. The development of large digital arrays that integrates the detectors and circuits has allowed the implementation of complex functionality on-chip, tailoring the detectors to suit the need of specific applications. This review proposes a complete overview of silicon SPADs characteristics and applications. In this Part I, starting with the working principle, simulation models and required frontend, the paper moves to the most common parameters adopted in literature for characterizing SPADs, and describes single pixels applications and their performance. In the next Part II, the focus is then posed on the development of SPAD arrays, presenting some of the most notable examples found in literature. The actual exploitation of these designs in real applications (e.g., automotive, bioimaging and radiation detectors) is then discussed.

TI The Nature of the Chemical Bonds of High-Valent Transition-Metal Oxo
   (M=O) and Peroxo (MOO) Compounds: A Historical Perspective of the Metal
   Oxyl-Radical Character by the Classical to Quantum Computations
SO MOLECULES
AB This review article describes a historical perspective of elucidation of the nature of the chemical bonds of the high-valent transition metal oxo (M=O) and peroxo (M-O-O) compounds in chemistry and biology. The basic concepts and theoretical backgrounds of the broken-symmetry (BS) method are revisited to explain orbital symmetry conservation and orbital symmetry breaking for the theoretical characterization of four different mechanisms of chemical reactions. Beyond BS methods using the natural orbitals (UNO) of the BS solutions, such as UNO CI (CC), are also revisited for the elucidation of the scope and applicability of the BS methods. Several chemical indices have been derived as the conceptual bridges between the BS and beyond BS methods. The BS molecular orbital models have been employed to explain the metal oxyl-radical character of the M=O and M-O-O bonds, which respond to their radical reactivity. The isolobal and isospin analogy between carbonyl oxide R2C-O-O and metal peroxide LFe-O-O has been applied to understand and explain the chameleonic chemical reactivity of these compounds. The isolobal and isospin analogy among Fe=O, O=O, and O have also provided the triplet atomic oxygen (O-3) model for non-heme Fe(IV)=O species with strong radical reactivity. The chameleonic reactivity of the compounds I (Cpd I) and II (Cpd II) is also explained by this analogy. The early proposals obtained by these theoretical models have been examined based on recent computational results by hybrid DFT (UHDFT), DLPNO CCSD(T0), CASPT2, and UNO CI (CC) methods and quantum computing (QC).

TI A "thoughtful" Local Friendliness no-go theorem: a prospective
   experiment with new assumptions to suit
SO QUANTUM
AB A recent paper by two of us and co-workers [1], based on an extended Wigner's friend scenario, demonstrated that certain empirical correlations predicted by quantum theory (QT) violate inequalities derived from a set of metaphysical assumptions we called "Local Friendliness" (LF). These assumptions are strictly weaker than those used for deriving Bell inequalities. Crucial to the theorem was the premise that a quantum system with reversible evolution could be an observer (colloquially, a "friend"). However, that paper was noncommittal on what would constitute an observer for the purpose of an experiment. Here, we present a new LF no-go theorem which takes seriously the idea that a system's having thoughts is a sufficient condition for it to be an observer. Our new derivation of the LF inequalities uses four metaphysical assumptions, three of which are thought-related, including one that is explicitly called "Friendliness". These four assumptions, in conjunction, allow one to derive LF inequalities for experiments involving the type of system that "Friendliness" refers to. In addition to these four metaphysical assumptions, this new no-go theorem requires two assumptions about what is technologically feasible: Human-Level Artificial Intelligence, and Universal Quantum Computing which is fast and large scale. The latter is often motivated by the belief that QT is universal, but this is not an assumption of the theorem. The intent of the new theorem is to give a clear goal for future experimentalists, and a clear motivation for trying to achieve that goal, by using assumptions that are (i) logically independent, (ii) widely held, (iii) not reliant on the exact correctness of QT, and (iv) relevant to how different interpretations or modifications of QT respond to the no-go theorem. The popular stance that "quantum theory needs no interpretation" does not question any of our assumptions and so is ruled out by the theorem. Finally, we quantitatively discuss how difficult the experiment we envisage would be, and briefly discuss milestones on the paths towards it.

TI Multimodal Quanvolutional and Convolutional Neural Networks for
   Multi-Class Image Classification
SO BIG DATA AND COGNITIVE COMPUTING
AB By utilizing hybrid quantum-classical neural networks (HNNs), this research aims to enhance the efficiency of image classification tasks. HNNs allow us to utilize quantum computing to solve machine learning problems, which can be highly power-efficient and provide significant computation speedup compared to classical operations. This is particularly relevant in sustainable applications where reducing computational resources and energy consumption is crucial. This study explores the feasibility of a novel architecture by leveraging quantum devices as the first layer of the neural network, which proved to be useful for scaling HNNs' training process. Understanding the role of quanvolutional operations and how they interact with classical neural networks can lead to optimized model architectures that are more efficient and effective for image classification tasks. This research investigates the performance of HNNs across different datasets, including CIFAR100 and Satellite Images of Hurricane Damage by evaluating the performance of HNNs on these datasets in comparison with the performance of reference classical models. By evaluating the scalability of HNNs on diverse datasets, the study provides insights into their applicability across various real-world scenarios, which is essential for building sustainable machine learning solutions that can adapt to different environments. Leveraging transfer learning techniques with pre-trained models such as ResNet, EfficientNet, and VGG16 demonstrates the potential for HNNs to benefit from existing knowledge in classical neural networks. This approach can significantly reduce the computational cost of training HNNs from scratch while still achieving competitive performance. The feasibility study conducted in this research assesses the practicality and viability of deploying HNNs for real-world image classification tasks. By comparing the performance of HNNs with classical reference models like ResNet, EfficientNet, and VGG-16, this study provides evidence of the potential advantages of HNNs in certain scenarios. Overall, the findings of this research contribute to advancing sustainable applications of machine learning by proposing novel techniques, optimizing model architectures, and demonstrating the feasibility of adopting HNNs for real-world image classification problems. These insights can inform the development of more efficient and environmentally friendly machine learning solutions.

TI A Vision for the Future of Multiscale Modeling
SO ACS PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY AU
AB The rise of modern computer science enabled physical chemistry to make enormous progresses in understanding and harnessing natural and artificial phenomena. Nevertheless, despite the advances achieved over past decades, computational resources are still insufficient to thoroughly simulate extended systems from first principles. Indeed, countless biological, catalytic and photophysical processes require ab initio treatments to be properly described, but the breadth of length and time scales involved makes it practically unfeasible. A way to address these issues is to couple theories and algorithms working at different scales by dividing the system into domains treated at different levels of approximation, ranging from quantum mechanics to classical molecular dynamics, even including continuum electrodynamics. This approach is known as multiscale modeling and its use over the past 60 years has led to remarkable results. Considering the rapid advances in theory, algorithm design, and computing power, we believe multiscale modeling will massively grow into a dominant research methodology in the forthcoming years. Hereby we describe the main approaches developed within its realm, highlighting their achievements and current drawbacks, eventually proposing a plausible direction for future developments considering also the emergence of new computational techniques such as machine learning and quantum computing. We then discuss how advanced multiscale modeling methods could be exploited to address critical scientific challenges, focusing on the simulation of complex light-harvesting processes, such as natural photosynthesis. While doing so, we suggest a cutting-edge computational paradigm consisting in performing simultaneous multiscale calculations on a system allowing the various domains, treated with appropriate accuracy, to move and extend while they properly interact with each other. Although this vision is very ambitious, we believe the quick development of computer science will lead to both massive improvements and widespread use of these techniques, resulting in enormous progresses in physical chemistry and, eventually, in our society.

TI Federated Learning in Convergence ICT: A Systematic Review on Recent
   Advancements, Challenges, and Future Directions
SO CMC-COMPUTERS MATERIALS & CONTINUA
AB The rapid convergence of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT), driven by advancements in 5G/6G networks, cloud computing, Artificial Intelligence (AI), and the Internet of Things (IoT), is reshaping modern digital ecosystems. As massive, distributed data streams are generated across edge devices and network layers, there is a growing need for intelligent, privacy-preserving AI solutions that can operate efficiently at the network edge. Federated Learning (FL) enables decentralized model training without transferring sensitive data, addressing key challenges around privacy, bandwidth, and latency. Despite its benefits in enhancing efficiency, real-time analytics, and regulatory compliance, FL adoption faces challenges, including communication overhead, heterogeneity, security vulnerabilities, and limited edge resources. While recent studies have addressed these issues individually, the literature lacks a unified, cross-domain perspective that reflects the architectural complexity and application diversity of Convergence ICT. This systematic review offers a comprehensive, cross-domain examination of FL within converged ICT infrastructures. The central research question guiding this review is: How can FL be effectively integrated into Convergence ICT environments, and what are the main challenges in implementing FL in such environments, along with possible solutions? We begin with a foundational overview of FL concepts and classifications, followed by a detailed taxonomy of FL architectures, learning strategies, and privacy-preserving mechanisms. Through in-depth case studies, we analyse FL's application across diverse verticals, including smart cities, healthcare, industrial automation, and autonomous systems. We further identify critical challenges-such as system and data heterogeneity, limited edge resources, and security vulnerabilities-and review state-of-the-art mitigation strategies, including edge-aware optimization, secure aggregation, and adaptive model updates. In addition, we explore emerging directions in FL research, such as energy-efficient learning, federated reinforcement learning, and integration with blockchain, quantum computing, and self-adaptive networks. This review not only synthesizes current literature but also proposes a forward-looking road map to support scalable, secure, and sustainable FL deployment in future ICT ecosystems.

TI Non-Hermitian topological phase induced by next-nearest-neighbor
   transitions in periodic drive systems
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB A non-Hermitian system with long-range hopping under periodic driving is constructed in this work. The Hamiltonian has chiral symmetry, implying that a topological invariant can be determined. Using the non-Bloch band theory and the Floquet method, the relevant operators and topological number can be determined, thereby providing quantitative approaches for studying topological properties. For example, by calculating the non-Bloch time-evolution factor, the Floquet operator, etc., it can be found that the topological invariant is determined by changing the phase of U+& varepsilon;=0,pi(,3) as it moves along the generalized Brillouin zone, corresponding to the emergence of quasi-energy zero mode and p mode. The results show that the topological structure of the static system can be significantly affected by periodic driving. The topological phase boundary of the zero mode can be changed. In the absence of periodic driving, energy spectrum does not exhibit p mode. After introducing periodic driving, a gap appears at the quasi-energy e=rr , thereby inducing a non-trivial p-mode phase and enriching the topological phase diagram. Furthermore, the next nearest neighbor hopping has a unique effect in this system. It can induce large topological numbers. However, unlike the static system, large topological numbers only appear in specific parameter intervals under periodic driving. As the strength of the next nearest neighbor hopping increases, the large topological number phase disappears, reflecting the non-monotonic regulation characteristics of the Floquet system. In addition, introducing the phase of the next nearest neighbor hopping can change the topological phase boundary, providing new ideas for experimentally regulating topological states. This research is of significance in the field of topological phase transitions in non-Hermitian systems. Theoretically, it reveals the synergistic effect of long-range hopping and periodic driving, and improves the theoretical framework for the cross-research of long-range and dynamic regulation in non-Hermitian systems. From an application perspective, it provides theoretical support for experimentally realizing the controllable modulation of topological states, which is helpful in promoting the development of fields such as low energy consumption electronic devices and topological quantum computing.

TI The Role of Smart Grid Technologies in Urban and Sustainable Energy
   Planning
SO ENERGIES
AB Traditional centralized energy grids struggle to meet urban areas' increasingly complex energy demands, necessitating the development of more sustainable and resilient energy solutions. Smart microgrids offer a decentralized approach that enhances energy efficiency, facilitates the integration of renewable energy sources, and improves urban resilience. This study follows a systematic review approach, analyzing the literature published in peer-reviewed journals, conference proceedings, and industry reports between 2011 and 2025. The research draws from academic publications of energy institutions alongside regulatory reports, examining actual smart microgrid deployments in San Diego, Barcelona, and Seoul. Additionally, this article provides real-world case studies from New York and London, showcasing successful and unsuccessful smart microgrid deployments. The Brooklyn Microgrid in New York demonstrates peer-to-peer energy trading, while London faces regulations and funding challenges in its decentralized energy systems. The paper also explores economic and policy frameworks such as public-private partnerships (PPPs), localized energy markets, and standardized regulatory models to enable microgrid adoption at scale. While PPPs provide financial and infrastructural support for microgrid deployment, they also introduce stakeholder alignment and regulatory compliance complexities. Countries like Germany and India have successfully used PPPs for smart microgrid development, leveraging low-interest loans, government incentives, and regulatory mechanisms to encourage innovation and adoption of smart microgrid technologies. In addition, the review examines new trends like the utilization of AI and quantum computing to optimize energy, peer-to-peer energy trading, and climate resilient design before outlining a future research agenda focused on cybersecurity, decarbonization, and the inclusion of new technology. Contributions include the development of a modular and scalable microgrid framework, innovative hybrid storage systems, and a performance-based policy model suited to the urban environment. These contributions help to fill the gap between what is possible today and what is needed for future sustainable urban energy systems and create the foundation for resilient cities of the next century.

TI Impact of band-bending on the k-resolved electronic structure of
   Si-doped GaN
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Band bending at semiconductor surfaces and interfaces is the key to applications ranging from classical transistors to topological quantum computing. A semiconductor particularly important for optical as well as microwave devices is GaN. What makes the material useful is not only its large bandgap but also that it can be heavily doped to become metallic. Here, we apply soft-x-ray angle-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy (ARPES) to metallic Si-doped GaN to explore the electron density and momentum-resolved band dispersions of the valence and conduction electrons varying through the surface band-bending region. We find an upward band bending, where the measured band occupation reduces toward the surface, as probed with low photon energies <0.5 keV. The band occupation approaches the bulk value, matching Hall effect measurements, as the photon energy increases to >1.4 keV, where the photoelectron mean free path exceeds the spatial extent of the band-bending region. Our quantitative analysis of the experimental data describes the potential variation in the band-bending region via self-consistent Poisson-Schrodinger equations. We put forward an insightful model to simulate the ARPES spectra from this region through summing up the contribution from all atomic layers, weighted by the photoelectron mean free path, under in-phase conditions achieved at particular values of the photoelectron out-of-plane momentum. The model adequately describes the peculiarities of the ARPES spectra caused by the surface band bending, including the photon-energy dependence of the apparent band occupation and Fermi-surface area, and allows accurate determination of the band-bending profile and values of the photoelectron mean free path. Finally, comparison of our data with supercell density functional theory calculations reveals the preferential location of Si atoms as substitutional for Ga, with the doped electrons entering the GaN conduction bands without formation of separate impurity states as would occur for Si interstitials. Our theoretical and experimental results resolve fundamental questions underpinning device performance of the GaN-based and other semiconductor materials in general and demonstrate a general methodology for quantitative studies of electron states in the band-bending region.

TI Experimental and Theoretical Study of Defect Evolution in InSb Epilayers
   under Gamma Irradiation: A Comparative Analysis of MOCVD vs MBE Growth
   Methods
SO ACS OMEGA
AB The operational requirements of high-radiation and extraterrestrial environments highlight the need to evaluate narrow-bandgap semiconductors that remain unexplored under such conditions, among them Indium Antimonide (InSb). As a material system, InSb offers unparalleled electron mobility and a massive g-factor, making it indispensable for next-generation infrared detection, Hall sensing, and topological quantum computing architectures. However, the practical realization of these devices is frequently hindered by the necessity of heteroepitaxial growth on lattice-mismatched substrates, typically Gallium Arsenide (GaAs), which introduces a complex landscape of threading dislocations and interfacial defects. This report presents an exhaustive, multimodal investigation into the radiation hardness of InSb epilayers, specifically contrasting the microstructural evolution of films grown via Metal-Organic Chemical Vapor Deposition (MOCVD) against those synthesized by Molecular Beam Epitaxy (MBE). Utilizing an experimental framework that integrates Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR), Raman spectroscopy, High-Resolution Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy (HR-STEM), and ab initio Density Functional Theory (DFT), this study elucidates the mechanistic divergence in radiation response between the two growth methodologies. The data reveal a critical, counterintuitive trade-off: the MOCVD-grown material, despite exhibiting superior initial crystalline quality driven by a zinc-doped seed layer that passivates interfacial traps, demonstrates a heightened susceptibility to electronic degradation and stoichiometry violation under high-fluence Gamma (gamma) irradiation. In contrast, the MBE-grown material, initially marred by a higher density of dislocations, exhibits a complex "survivability" mode at elevated doses, characterized by defect saturation. This report details the atomic-level physics driving these behaviors, including the radiation-induced formation of homopolar Sb-Sb bonds, the symmetry-breaking anisotropy of the g-factor, and the thermodynamic instability of dopant-passivated interfaces under nonequilibrium conditions. Furthermore, these findings can be used as actionable engineering guidelines for Radiation Hardness Assurance (RHA), proposing novel nondestructive spectroscopic metrics for the qualification of semiconductors destined for space and nuclear applications.

TI Advanced applications in chronic disease monitoring using IoT mobile
   sensing device data, machine learning algorithms and frame theory: a
   systematic review
SO FRONTIERS IN PUBLIC HEALTH
AB The escalating demand for chronic disease management has presented substantial challenges to traditional methods. However, the emergence of Internet of Things (IoT) and artificial intelligence (AI) technologies offers a potential resolution by facilitating more precise chronic disease management through data-driven strategies. This review concentrates on the utilization of IoT mobile sensing devices in managing major chronic diseases such as cardiovascular diseases, cancer, chronic respiratory diseases, and diabetes. It scrutinizes their efficacy in disease diagnosis and management when integrated with machine learning algorithms, such as ANN, SVM, RF, and deep learning models. Through an exhaustive literature review, this study dissects how these technologies aid in risk assessment, personalized treatment planning, and disease management. This research addresses a gap in the existing literature concerning the application of IoT and AI technologies in the management of specific chronic diseases. It particularly demonstrates methodological novelty by introducing advanced models based on deep learning, tight frame-based methodologies and real-time monitoring systems. This review employs a rigorous examination method, which includes systematically searching relevant databases, filtering literature that meets specific inclusion and exclusion criteria, and adopting quality assessment tools to ensure the rigor of selected studies. This study identifies potential biases and weaknesses related to data collection, algorithm selection, and user interaction. The research demonstrates that platforms integrating IoT and machine learning algorithms for chronic disease monitoring and management are not only technically viable but also yield substantial economic and social advantages in real-world applications. Future studies could investigate the use of quantum computing for processing vast medical datasets and novel techniques that merge biosensors with nanotechnology for drug delivery and disease surveillance. Furthermore, this paper examines recent progress in medical image reconstruction, emphasizing tight frame-based methodologies. We discuss the principles, benefits, and constraints of these methods, assessing their efficacy across diverse application contexts.

TI Decoupling of Majorana bound states in T-shaped doublequantum-dot
   structure with ferromagnetic leads
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB The significant potential applications of Majorana bound state (MBS) in topological quantum computing manifest the importance and necessity of relevant in-depth research. To understand the physical properties of MBS, the most practical approach is to integrate it to a mesoscopic circuit and then investigate its quantum transport behaviors. In this work, we investigate the transport properties in the systems with MBS, and provide theoretical support for its further understanding and detection, by utilizing the nonequilibrium Green's function method and scattering matrix theory. Specifically, we investigate theoretically the transport properties in a T-shaped double-quantum dot structure, by considering MBS to be coupled to the dot in the main channel, which shows that in the linear transmission region, when the level of side-coupled dot is tuned to the Fermi energy level, the contribution of MBS to the conductance is eliminated under weak and strong Coulomb interaction. The side-coupled dot is far away from the Fermi energy level, leading to different results. When Majorana zero mode is added, the linear conductance is independent of the level of the side-coupled quantum dot, and the conductance plateau appears. However, with coupling between the MBSs, the linear conductance is the same as that without coupling between the MBSs. The decoupling phenomenon of the MBS remains strong. Therefore, the signature of the MBS can be eliminated by adjusting the level of the side-coupled quantum dot or the inter-MBS coupling. When ferromagnetic leads are introduced, the appearance or disappearance of the conductance plateau is clearly dependent on the difference between the magnetic field direction and the lead polarization direction in the system, whereas the decoupling behavior of the MBS is still existent. This work contributes to further explaining the decoupling phenomenon of MBSs in a T-shaped double-quantum-dot system, and presents a theoretical approach to more in-depth understanding and detection of the MBS.

TI ON-CNN: Low Latency and High Throughput Online Arithmetic-Based
   Convolutional Neural Network Accelerator
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Online arithmetic also known as most-significant-digit-first (MSDF) computing is becoming a choice for hardware implementation of different machine learning algorithms. It enables the generation of MSD as the first output digit and usage in consecutive computations in digit serial manner leading to different benefits like low latency, high throughput, variable precision and early termination etc. Recently, the demand for real time implementations of convolutional neural network (CNN) accelerator has dramatically increased. Latency and throughput of the CNN accelerator have paramount importance in real time object detection in video/image classification tasks. In this paper, we present online arithmetic based CNN accelerator architecture (ON-CNN), which exploits the computational capabilities of online arithmetic to achieve lowest latency and highest throughput without affecting accuracy. It also employs a re-configurable power saving strategy which saves significant percentage of power in execution of different convolution layers. ON-CNN has two versions: one whose processing element (PE) takes input in serial-serial manner (ON-CNNSS) and second whose PE takes input in serial-parallel manner (ON-CNNSP). ON-CNNSS achieves speed-up in execution time from 145.6 to 5.7 times in comparison with state-of-the-art CNN accelerator architectures. Whereas, ON-CNNSP achieves speed-up in execution time from 162.0 to 6.4 times in comparison with state-of-the-art CNN accelerator architectures. ON-CNNSS and ON-CNNSP show the highest peak-throughput of 2.276 TOPS and 2.535 TOPS respectively for VGG-16 and ResNet-50 model. The proposed re-configurable power saving strategy saves overall 19.2%, 33.8% and 18.9% power while executing VGG-16, ResNet-18 and ResNet-50 models, respectively. Comparison using metrics like area efficiency (TOPS/mm2) and power efficiency (TOPS/W) shows that ON-CNNSS and ON-CNNSP perform better than state-of-the-art CNN accelerator architectures.

TI Lightweight Yet Nonce-Misuse Secure Authenticated Encryption for Very
   Short Inputs
SO IEEE INTERNET OF THINGS JOURNAL
AB We study authenticated encryption (AE) modes dedicated to very short messages, which are crucial for Internet of Things applications. One of the most popular class of AE is built on block ciphers, namely a mode of operation. The computational cost of a mode is typically measured by its rate, indicating the number of input blocks processed per block cipher call in asymptotic terms. While certain modes demonstrate efficiency in terms of rate, such as OCB , this metric does not always accurately portray the total computational burden as it ignores overhead. Consequently, modes efficient in terms of rate may not always perform optimally with short messages. This observation motivates us to study modes that are efficient on short inputs rather than focusing on rate. Since the existing general-purpose AE modes need at least three block cipher calls for nonempty messages, we explore the design space for AE modes that use at most two calls. We propose a family of AE modes, dubbed Manx , which work when the total input length is less than 2n bits, using an n-bit block cipher. Notably, the second construction of Manx can encrypt almost n-bit plaintexts and saves one or two block cipher calls compared to standard modes, such as GCM or OCB , while preserving comparable provable security. In addition to the conventional security against nonce-respecting adversary, we prove that Manx have security against nonce-misusing adversary with a different security level for each family member. We also present benchmarks on popular 8/32-bit microprocessors, namely 8-bit AVR, 32-bit ARM Cortex-M0, and ARM Cortex-M4, using AES and lightweight block ciphers. Our results show the clear advantage of Manx over the previous modes for such short messages. In particular, Manx2 has significant performance gain from the existing representative schemes thanks to the simple structure and parallelizability. For example, using AES-128, Manx2 is faster than OCB by a factor of 1.5 to 1.7 to process a 64-bit nonce and a 120-bit plaintext.

TI Dynamic stochastic deep learning approaches for predicting geometric
   changes in head and neck cancer
SO PHYSICS IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY
AB Objective. Modern radiotherapy stands to benefit from the ability to efficiently adapt plans during treatment in response to setup and geometric variations such as those caused by internal organ deformation or tumor shrinkage. A promising strategy is to develop a framework, which given an initial state defined by patient-attributes, can predict future states based on pre-learned patterns from a well-defined patient population. Approach. Here, we investigate the feasibility of predicting patient anatomical changes, defined as a joint state of volume and daily setup changes, across a fractionated treatment schedule using two approaches. The first is based on a new joint framework employing quantum mechanics in combination with deep recurrent neural networks, denoted QRNN. The second approach is developed based on a classical framework, which models patient changes as a Markov process, denoted MRNN. We evaluated the performance characteristics of these two approaches on a dataset of 125 head and neck cancer patients, which was supplemented by synthetic data generated using a generative adversarial network. Model performance was evaluated using area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) scores. Main results. The MRNN framework had slightly better performance than the QRNN framework, with MRNN (QRNN) validation AUC scores of 0.742 +/- 0.021 (0.675 +/- 0.036), 0.709 +/- 0.026 (0.656 +/- 0.021), 0.724 +/- 0.036 (0.652 +/- 0.044), and 0.698 +/- 0.016 (0.605 +/- 0.035) for system state vector sizes of 4, 6, 8, and 10, respectively. Of these, only the results from the two higher order states had statistically significant differences (p < 0.05). A similar trend was also observed when the models were applied to an external testing dataset of 20 patients, yielding MRNN (QRNN) AUC scores of 0.707 (0.623), 0.687 (0.608), 0.723 (0.669), and 0.697 (0.609) for states vectors sizes of 4, 6, 8, and 10, respectively. Significance. These results suggest that both stochastic models have potential value in predicting patient changes during the course of adaptive radiotherapy.

TI Quantum Multi-Solution Bernoulli Search with Applications to Bitcoin's
   Post-Quantum Security
SO QUANTUM
AB A proof of work (PoW) is an important cryptographic construct which enables a party to convince other parties that they have invested some effort in solving a computational task. Arguably, its main impact has been in the setting of cryptocur-rencies such as Bitcoin and its underlying blockchain protocol, which have received significant attention in recent years due to its potential for various applications as well as for solving fundamental distributed computing questions in novel threat mod-els. PoWs enable the linking of blocks in the blockchain data structure, and thus the problem of interest is the feasibility of obtaining a sequence (???chain???) of such proofs. At the same time, the rapid development in quantum computing makes the threats to cryptography more and more concerning. In this work, we examine the hardness of finding such chain of PoWs against quantum strategies. We prove that the chain of PoWs problem reduces to a problem we call multi-solution Bernoulli search, for which we establish its quantum query complexity. Effectively, this is an extension of a threshold direct product theorem to an average-case unstructured search problem. Our proof, adding to active recent efforts, simplifies and generalizes the recording technique due to Zhandry [Crypto 2019]. As an application, we revisit the formal treatment of security of the core of the Bitcoin consensus protocol, called the Bitcoin backbone [Eurocrypt 2015], in a setting where the adversary has quantum capabilities while the honest parties remain classical, and show that the protocol???s security holds under a quantum analogue of the classical ???honest majority??? assumption that we formulate. Our analysis indicates that the security of the Bitcoin backbone protocol is guaranteed provided that the number of adversarial quantum queries is bounded so that each quantum query is worth O(p???1/2) classical ones, where p is the probability of success of a single classical query to the protocol???s underlying hash function. Somewhat surprisingly, the wait time for safe settlement of transactions in the case of quantum adversaries matches (up to a constant) the safe settlement time in the classical case.
