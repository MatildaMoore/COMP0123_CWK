TI Machine learning enhanced evaluation of semiconductor quantum dots
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB A key challenge in quantum photonics today is the efficient and on-demand generation of high-quality single photons and entangled photon pairs. In this regard, one of the most promising types of emitters are semiconductor quantum dots, fluorescent nanostructures also described as artificial atoms. The main technological challenge in upscaling to an industrial level is the typically random spatial and spectral distribution in their growth. Furthermore, depending on the intended application, different requirements are imposed on a quantum dot, which are reflected in its spectral properties. Given that an in-depth suitability analysis is lengthy and costly, it is common practice to pre-select promising candidate quantum dots using their emission spectrum. Currently, this is done by hand. Therefore, to automate and expedite this process, in this paper, we propose a data-driven machine-learning-based method of evaluating the applicability of a semiconductor quantum dot as single photon source. For this, first, a minimally redundant, but maximally relevant feature representation for quantum dot emission spectra is derived by combining conventional spectral analysis with an autoencoding convolutional neural network. The obtained feature vector is subsequently used as input to a neural network regression model, which is specifically designed to not only return a rating score, gauging the technical suitability of a quantum dot, but also a measure of confidence for its evaluation. For training and testing, a large dataset of self-assembled InAs/GaAs semiconductor quantum dot emission spectra is used, partially labelled by a team of experts in the field. Overall, highly convincing results are achieved, as quantum dots are reliably evaluated correctly. Note, that the presented methodology can account for different spectral requirements and is applicable regardless of the underlying photonic structure, fabrication method and material composition. We therefore consider it the first step towards a fully integrated evaluation framework for quantum dots, proving the use of machine learning beneficial in the advancement of future quantum technologies.

TI Dynamical generation of chiral W and Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger states
   in laser-controlled Rydberg-atom trimers
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Motivated by the significantly improved scalability of optically trapped neutral-atom systems, extensive efforts have been devoted in recent years to quantum-state engineering in Rydberg-atom ensembles. Here we investigate the problem of engineering generalized ("twisted") W states, as well as Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) states, in the strongly interacting regime of a neutral-atom system. We assume that each atom in the envisioned system initially resides in its ground state and is subject to several external laser pulses that are close to being resonant with the same internal atomic transition. In particular, in the special case of a three-atom system (Rydberg-atom trimer) we determine configurations of field alignments and atomic positions that enable the realization of chiral W states-a special type of twisted three-qubit W states of interest for implementing noiseless-subsystem qubit encoding. Using chiral W states as an example we also address the problem of deterministically converting twisted W states into their GHZ counterparts in the same three-atom system, thus significantly generalizing recent works that involve only ordinary W states. We show that starting from twisted-rather than ordinary-W states is equivalent to renormalizing downward the relevant Rabi frequencies. While this leads to somewhat longer state-conversion times, we also demonstrate that those times are at least two orders of magnitude shorter than typical lifetimes of relevant Rydberg states.

TI DemoQuanDT: a carrier-grade QKD network
SO JOURNAL OF OPTICAL COMMUNICATIONS AND NETWORKING
AB Quantum key distribution networks (QKDNs) enable secure communication even in the age of powerful quantum computers. In the hands of a network operator, which can offer its service to many users, the economic viability of a QKDN increases significantly. The highly challenging operator-user relationship in a large-scale network setting demands additional requirements to ensure carrier-grade operation. Addressing this challenge, this work presents a carrier-grade QKDN architecture, which combines the functional QKDN architecture with the operational perspective of a network operator, ultimately enhancing the economic viability of QKDNs. The focus is on the network and key management aspects of a QKDN while assuming state-of-the-art commercial QKD modules. The presented architecture was rolled out within an in-field demonstrator, connecting the cities of Berlin and Bonn over a link distance of 923 km across Germany. We could show that the proposed network architecture is feasible, integrable, and scalable, making it suitable for deployment in real-world networks. Overall, the presented carrier-grade QKDN architecture promises to serve as a blueprint for network operators providing QKD-based services to their customers. (c) 2025 Optica Publishing Group.

TI Exploiting nonequilibrium phase transitions and strong symmetries for
   continuous measurement of collective observables
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Dissipative many-body quantum dynamics can feature strong symmetries which give rise to conserved quantities. We discuss here how a strong symmetry in conjunction with a nonequilibrium phase transition allows to devise a protocol for measuring collective many-body observables. To demonstrate this idea we consider a collective spin system whose constituents are governed by a dissipative dynamics that conserves the total angular momentum. We show that by continuously monitoring the system output, the value of the total angular momentum can be inferred directly from the time-integrated emission signal, without the need of repeated projective measurements or reinitializations of the spins. This may offer a route towards the measurement of collective properties in qubit ensembles, with applications in quantum tomography, quantum computation, and quantum metrology.

TI Coupling-selective quantum optimal control in weak-coupling
   NV-13C system
SO AAPPS BULLETIN
AB Quantum systems are under various unwanted interactions due to their coupling with the environment. Efficient control of quantum system is essential for quantum information processing. Weak-coupling interactions are ubiquitous, and it is very difficult to suppress them using optimal control method, because the control operation is at a time scale of the coherent life time of the system. Nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center of diamond is a promising platform for quantum information processing. The C-13 nuclear spins in the bath are weakly coupled to the NV, rendering the manipulation extremely difficulty. Here, we report a coupling selective optimal control method that selectively suppresses unwanted weak coupling interactions and at the same time greatly prolongs the life time of the wanted quantum system. We applied our theory to a 3 qubit system consisting of one NV electron spin and two C-13 nuclear spins through weak-coupling with the NV center. In the experiments, the iSWAP dagger gate with selective optimal quantum control is implemented in a time-span of T-ctrl= 170.25 mu s, which is comparable to the phase decoherence time T-2= 203 mu s. The two-qubit controlled rotation gate is also completed in a strikingly 1020(80) mu s, which is five times of the phase decoherence time. These results could find important applications in the NISQ era.

TI A Benchmarking Framework for Hybrid Quantum-Classical Edge-Cloud
   Computing Systems
SO APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
AB Quantum computers are emerging as a major tool in the computation field, leveraging the principles of quantum mechanics to solve specific problems currently beyond the capability of classical computers. This technology holds significant promise in edge-main cloud deployments, where it can enable low-latency data processing and secure communication. This paper aims to establish a research foundation by integrating quantum computing with classical edge-cloud environments to promote performance across a range of applications that scientists are actively investigating. However, the successful deployment of hybrid quantum-classical edge-clouds requires a comprehensive evaluation framework to ensure their alignment with the performance requirements. This study first proposes a novel quantum benchmarking framework, including two distinct methods to evaluate latency scores based on the quantum transpilation levels across different quantum-edge-cloud platforms. The framework is then validated for the edge-cloud environment by benchmarking several well-known and useful quantum algorithms potentially useful in this domain, including Shor's, Grover's, and the Quantum Walks algorithm. An optimal transpilation level is eventually suggested to achieve maximum performance in quantum-edge-cloud environments. In summary, this research paper provides critical insights into the current and prospective capabilities of QPU integration, offering a novel benchmarking framework and providing a comprehensive assessment of their potential to enhance edge-cloud performance under varying parameters, including fidelity and transpilation levels.

TI Space-Time Quantum Metasurfaces
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Metasurfaces have recently entered the realm of quantum photonics, enabling manipulation of quantum light using a compact nanophotonic platform. Realizing the full potential of metasurfaces at the deepest quantum level requires the ability to tune coherent light-matter interactions continuously in space and time. Here, we introduce the concept of space-time quantum metasurfaces for arbitrary control of the spectral, spatial, and spin properties of nonclassical light using a compact photonic platform. We show that space-time quantum metasurfaces allow on-demand tailoring of entanglement among all degrees of freedom of a single photon. We also show that spatiotemporal modulation induces asymmetry at the fundamental level of quantum fluctuations, resulting in the generation of steered and vortex photon pairs out of vacuum. Space-time quantum metasurfaces have the potential to enable novel photonic functionalities, such as encoding quantum information into high-dimensional color qudits using designer modulation protocols, sculpting multispectral and multispatial modes in spontaneous emission, and generating reconfigurable hyperentanglement for high-capacity quantum communications.

TI Effect of localization on photoluminescence and zero-field splitting of
   silicon color centers
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB The study of defect centers in silicon has been recently reinvigorated by their potential applications in optical quantum information processing. A number of silicon defect centers emit single photons in the telecommu-nication O-band, making them promising building blocks for quantum networks between computing nodes. The two-carbon G-center, self-interstitial W-center, and spin-1/2 T-center are the most intensively studied silicon defect centers, yet despite this, there is no consensus on the precise configurations of defect atoms in these centers, and their electronic structures remain ambiguous. Here we employ ab initio density functional theory to characterize these defect centers, providing insight into the relaxed structures, band structures, and photoluminescence spectra, which are compared to experimental results. Motivation is provided for how these properties are intimately related to the localization of electronic states in the defect centers. In partic-ular, we present the calculation of the zero-field splitting for the excited triplet state of the G-center defect as the structure is linearly interpolated from the A-configuration to the B-configuration, showing a sudden increase in the magnitude of the Dzz component of the zero-field-splitting tensor. By performing projections onto the local orbital states of the defect, we analyze this transition in terms of the symmetry and bonding character of the G-center defect, which sheds light on its potential application as a spin-photon interface.

TI Combined use of long short-term memory neural network and quantum
   computation for hierarchical forecasting of locational marginal prices
SO ENERGY CONVERSION AND ECONOMICS
AB Accurate locational marginal price forecasting (LMPF) is crucial for the efficient allocation of resources. Nevertheless, the sudden changes in LMP make it inadequate for many existing long short-term memory (LSTM) network-based prediction models to achieve the required accuracy for practical applications. This study adopts a hierarchical method of three layers based on double quantum-inspired grey wolf optimisation (QGWO) to improve the LSTM model (HD-QGWO-LSTM) for a one-step LMPF. The top layer completes the data processing. The middle layer is a QGWO-optimised support vector machine (SVM) for classifing whether LMPs are price spikes. The bottom laver is a double QGWO-improved LSTM (QGWO-LSTM) model for a real LMPF, where one QGWO-LSTM is for the spike LMPF and the other is for the non-spike LMPF. To address the issue of excessively long training times during the design of the LSTM network structure and parameter selection, a QGWO algorithm is proposed and used to optimise four LSTM parameters. The simulation results on the New England electricity market show that the HD-QGWO-LSTM method achieves similar prediction accuracy to other four LSTM-based methods. The results also validate that the QGWO algorithm significantly reduces time consumption while ensuring optimisation effectiveness when optimising SVM and LSTM.

Their performance is compared to finding controllers using gradient-based L-BFGS optimisation with restarts, with full access to an analytical model. Hamiltonian noise and coarse-graining of fidelity measurements are considered. Reinforcement learning is able to tackle challenging, noisy quantum control problems where L-BFGS optimization algorithms struggle to perform well. Robustness analysis under different levels of Hamiltonian noise indicates that controllers found by reinforcement learning appear to be less affected by noise than those found with L-BFGS.

TI Multimode Strong Coupling in Cavity Optomechanics
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB Optomechanical systems show great potential as quantum transducers and information storage devices for use in future hybrid quantum networks. In this context, optomechanical strong coupling can enable efficient, high-bandwidth, and deterministic transfer of quantum states. While optomechanical strong coupling has been realized at optical frequencies, it has proven difficult to identify a robust optomechanical system that features the low loss and high coupling rates required for more sophisticated control of mechanical motion. In this paper, we demonstrate strong coupling in a Brillouin-based bulk cavity optomechanical system in both the single-mode and the multimode strong-coupling regime, which leads to a useful device both for applications in quantum information and for investigating decoherence phenomena in bulk acoustic wave resonators. Using nontrivial mode hybridizations in the strong-coupling regime, we create hybridized photonic-phononic modes with lifetimes that are significantly longer than those of the uncoupled system. This surprising lifetime enhancement, which results from the interference of decay channels, showcases the use of multimode strong coupling as a general strategy to control extrinsic decoherence mechanisms. Moreover, phonons supported by such bulk-acoustic-wave resonators have a collection of properties, including high frequencies, long coherence times, and robustness against thermal decoherence, that make this optomechanical system particularly enticing for applications such as quantum transduction and memories. Hence, this system provides access to phenomena in a previously unexplored regime of optomechanical interactions and could serve as an important building block for future quantum devices.

TI Faster Born probability estimation via gate merg- ing and frame
   optimisation
SO QUANTUM
AB Outcome probability estimation via classical methods is an important task for validating quantum computing devices. Out-come probabilities of any quantum circuit can be estimated using Monte Carlo sampling, where the amount of negativity present in the circuit frame representation quantifies the overhead on the number of samples required to achieve a certain precision. In this paper, we propose two classical sub-routines: circuit gate merging and frame optimisation, which optimise the circuit representation to reduce the sampling overhead. We show that the run-times of both sub-routines scale polynomially in circuit size and gate depth. Our methods are applicable to general circuits, regardless of generating gate sets, qudit dimensions and the chosen frame representations for the circuit components. We numerically demonstrate that our methods provide improved scaling in the negativity overhead for all tested cases of random circuits with Clifford+T and Haar-random gates, and that the performance of our methods compares favourably with prior quasi-probability simulators as the number of non-Clifford gates increases.

TI Optimal Statistical Analyses of Bell Experiments
SO APPLIEDMATH
AB We show how both smaller and more reliable p-values can be computed in Bell-type experiments by using statistical deviations from no-signalling equalities to reduce statistical noise in the estimation of Bell's S or Eberhard's J. Further improvement was obtained by using the Wilks likelihood ratio test based on the four tetranomially distributed vectors of counts of the four different outcome combinations, one 4-vector for each of the four setting combinations. The methodology was illustrated by application to the loophole-free Bell experiments of 2015 and 2016 performed in Delft and Munich, at NIST, and in Vienna, respectively, and also to the earlier (1998) Innsbruck experiment of Weihs et al. and the recent (2022) Munich experiment of Zhang et al., which investigates the use of a loophole-free Bell experiment as part of a protocol for device-independent quantum key distribution (DIQKD).

Concretely, we focus on the MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport) protocol that is widely used in IoT services. The paper presents our novel quantum-resistant security proposal for the MQTT protocol that supports secure broadcast. Our solution omits using TLS with the handshake causing delay and is suitable for sending irregular short messages. Finally, we show how our solution can practically affect concrete use cases by the performance results of the proposed solution.

TI Automatic generation of Grover quantum oracles for arbitrary data
   structures
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB The steadily growing research interest in quantum computing-together with the accompanying technological advances in the realization of quantum hardware-fuels the development of meaningful real-world applications, as well as implementations for well-known quantum algorithms. One of the most prominent examples till today is Grover's algorithm, which can be used for efficient search in unstructured databases. Quantum oracles that are frequently masked as black boxes play an important role in Grover's algorithm. Hence, the automatic generation of oracles is of paramount importance. Moreover, the automatic generation of the corresponding circuits for a Grover quantum oracle is deeply linked to the synthesis of reversible quantum logic, which-despite numerous advances in the field-still remains a challenge till today in terms of synthesizing efficient and scalable circuits for complex Boolean functions. In this paper, we present a flexible method for automatically encoding unstructured databases into oracles, which can then be efficiently searched with Grover's algorithm. Furthermore, we develop a tailor-made method for quantum logic synthesis, which vastly improves circuit complexity over other current approaches. Finally, we present another logic synthesis method that considers the requirements of scaling onto real world backends. We compare our method with other approaches through evaluating the oracle generation for random databases and analyzing the resulting circuit complexities using various metrics.

TI Enhancement of concentration of XeV and GeV centers in microcrystalline
   diamond films through He+ irradiation
SO DIAMOND AND RELATED MATERIALS
AB Atomic defect centers in diamond have been widely exploited in numerous quantum applications like quantum information, sensing, quantum photonics and so on. In this context, there is always a requirement to improve and optimize the preparation procedure to generate the defect centers in controlled fashion, and to explore new defect centers which can have the potential to overcome the current technological challenges. Through this work we report enhancing the concentration of Ge and Xe vacancy centers in microcrystalline diamond (MCD) by means of He+ irradiation. We have demonstrated controlled growth of MCD by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) and implantation of Ge and Xe ions into the CVD-grown samples. MCDs were irradiated with He+ ions and characterized through optical spectroscopy measurements. Recorded photoluminescence results revealed a clear signature of enhancement of the Xe-related and Ge vacancies in MCDs.

TI Dissipative Stabilization of Squeezing Beyond 3 dB in a Microwave Mode
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB While a propagating state of light can be generated with arbitrary squeezing by pumping a parametric resonator, the intraresonator state is limited to 3 dB of squeezing. Here, we implement a reservoir-engineering method to surpass this limit using superconducting circuits. Two-tone pumping of a three-wave-mixing element implements an effective coupling to a squeezed bath, which stabilizes a squeezed state inside the resonator. Using an ancillary superconducting qubit as a probe allows us to perform a direct Wigner tomography of the intraresonator state. The raw measurement provides a lower bound on the squeezing at about 6.7 +/- 0.2 dB below the zero-point level. Further, we show how to correct for resonator evolution during the Wigner tomography and obtain a squeezing as high as 8.2 +/- 0.8 dB. Moreover, this level of squeezing is achieved with a purity of 0.91 +/- 0.09.

TI Transformation of the discrete logarithm problem over F2n to the QUBO
   problem using normal bases
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ELECTRONICS AND TELECOMMUNICATIONS
AB computations are very important branch of modern cryptology. According to the number of working physical qubits available in general-purpose quantum computers and in quantum annealers, there is no coincidence, that nowadays quantum annealers allow to solve larger problems. In this paper we focus on solving discrete logarithm problem (DLP) over binary fields using quantum annealing. It is worth to note, that however solving DLP over prime fields using quantum annealing has been considered before, no author, until now, has considered DLP over binary fields using quantum annealing. Therefore, in this paper, we aim to bridge this gap. We present a polynomial transformation of the discrete logarithm problem over binary fields to the Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problem, using approximately 3n2 logical variables for the binary field F2n. In our estimations, we assume the existence of an optimal normal base in the given fields. Such a QUBO instance can then be solved using quantum annealing.

TI Integrated photonic structures for photon-mediated entanglement of
   trapped ions
SO OPTICA QUANTUM
AB Trapped atomic ions are natural candidates for quantum information processing and have the potential to realize or improve quantum computing, sensing, and networking. These applications often require the collection of individual photons emitted from ions into guided optical modes, in some cases for the production of entanglement between separated ions. Proof-of-principle demonstrations of such photon collection from trapped ions have been performed using high-numerical-aperture lenses or cavities and single-mode fibers, but integrated photonic elements in ion-trap structures offer advantages in scalability and manufacturability over traditional optics. In this paper we analyze structures monolithically fabricated with an ion trap for collecting ion-emitted photons, coupling them into waveguides, and manipulating them via interference. We calculate geometric limitations on collection efficiency for this scheme, simulate a single-layer grating that shows performance comparable to demonstrated free-space optics, and discuss practical fabrication and fidelity considerations. Based on this analysis, we conclude that integrated photonics can support scalable systems of trapped ions that can distribute quantum information via photon-mediated entanglement.

TI Experimental Demonstration of Input-Output Indefiniteness in a Single

AB Quantum theory allows information to flow through a single device in a coherent superposition of two opposite directions, resulting into situations where the input-output direction is indefinite. Here we introduce a theoretical method to witness input-output indefiniteness in a single quantum device, and we experimentally demonstrate it by constructing a photonic setup that exhibits input-output indefiniteness with a statistical significance exceeding 69 standard deviations. Our results provide a way to characterize input-output indefiniteness as a resource for quantum information and photonic quantum technologies and enable tabletop simulations of hypothetical scenarios exhibiting quantum indefiniteness in the direction of time.

TI Electrical manipulation of a hole 'spin'-orbit qubit in nanowire quantum
   dot: The nontrivial magnetic field effects
SO CHINESE PHYSICS B
AB Strong 'spin'-orbit coupled one-dimensional hole gas is achievable in a Ge nanowire in the presence of a strong magnetic field. The strong magnetic field lifts the two-fold degeneracy in the hole subband dispersions, so that the effective low-energy subband dispersion exhibits strong spin-orbit coupling. Here, we study the electrical spin manipulation in a Ge nanowire quantum dot for both the lowest and second lowest hole subband dispersions. Using a finite square well to model the quantum dot confining potential, we calculate exactly the level splitting of the spin-orbit qubit and the Rabi frequency in the electric-dipole spin resonance. The spin-orbit coupling modulated longitudinal g-factor g (so) is not only non-vanishing but also magnetic field dependent. Moreover, the spin-orbit couplings of the lowest and second lowest subband dispersions have opposite magnetic dependences, so that the results for these two subband dispersions are totally different. It should be noticed that we focus only on the properties of the hole 'spin' instead of the real hole spin.

TI Learning Quantum Processes Without Input Control
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB We introduce a general statistical learning theory for processes that take as input a classical random variable and output a quantum state. Our setting is motivated by the practical situation in which one desires to learn a quantum process governed by classical parameters that are out of one's control. This framework is applicable, for example, to the study of astronomical phenomena, disordered systems and biological processes not controlled by the observer. We provide an algorithm for learning with high probability in this setting with a finite amount of samples, even if the concept class is infinite. To do this, we review and adapt existing algorithms for shadow tomography and hypothesis selection, and combine their guarantees with the uniform convergence on the data of the loss functions of interest. As a byproduct, we obtain sufficient conditions for performing shadow tomography of classical-quantum states with a number of copies, which depends on the dimension of the quantum register, but not on the dimension of the classical one. We give concrete examples of processes that can be learned in this manner, based on quantum circuits or physically motivated classes, such as systems governed by Hamiltonians with random perturbations or data -dependent phase shifts.

TI Enhanced superconducting qubit performance through ammonium fluoride
   etch
SO MATERIALS FOR QUANTUM TECHNOLOGY
AB The performance of superconducting qubits is often limited by dissipation and two-level systems ( TLS) losses. The dominant sources of these losses are believed to originate from amorphous materials and defects at interfaces and surfaces, likely as a result of fabrication processes or ambient exposure. Here, we explore a novel wet chemical surface treatment at the Josephson junction-substrate and the substrate-air interfaces by replacing a buffered oxide etch (BOE) cleaning process with one that uses hydrofluoric acid followed by aqueous ammonium fluoride. We show that the ammonium fluoride etch process results in a statistically significant improvement in median T-1 by similar to 22% (p = 0.002), and a reduction in the number of strongly-coupled TLS in the tunable frequency range. Microwave resonator measurements on samples treated with the ammonium fluoride etch after niobium deposition and etching also show similar to 33% lower TLS-induced loss tangent compared to the BOE treated samples. As the chemical treatment primarily modifies the Josephson junction-substrate interface and substrate-air interface, we perform targeted chemical and structural characterizations to examine materials differences at these interfaces and identify multiple microscopic changes that could contribute to decreased TLS losses.

We develop a unitary coupled cluster method based on the antisymmetrized geminal power (AGP)-a state formally equivalent to the number-projected Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer wavefunction. We demonstrate our method for the single-band Fermi-Hubbard Hamiltonian in one and two dimensions. We also explore post-selection as a state preparation step to obtain correlated AGP and prove that it scales no worse than O(root M) in the number of measurements, thereby making a less expensive alternative to gauge integration to restore particle number symmetry.

AB In quantum computation, entanglement is a fundamental phenomenon that significantly affects the behaviour and correctness of quantum programs. One of the most striking effects of such a phenomenon arises from its interplay with quantum measurement. A non-classical correlation between the entangled qubits, which is related to a non-local action, makes the measurement of one qubit of an entangled pair instantaneously affect also the other. This leads to potential problems in the execution of a quantum program where variables become entangled during a computation since unintended measurements may cause erroneous results. A static analysis detecting such critical situations is, therefore, necessary to guarantee the correct execution of a quantum program. To pursue this objective, we introduce a novel abstract domain specifically designed to analyse and manage entanglement in quantum programs.

TI Resolving catastrophic error bursts from cosmic rays in large arrays of
   superconducting qubits
SO NATURE PHYSICS
AB Scalable quantum computing can become a reality with error correction, provided that coherent qubits can be constructed in large arrays(1,2). The key premise is that physical errors can remain both small and sufficiently uncorrelated as devices scale, so that logical error rates can be exponentially suppressed. However, impacts from cosmic rays and latent radioactivity violate these assumptions. An impinging particle can ionize the substrate and induce a burst of quasiparticles that destroys qubit coherence throughout the device. High-energy radiation has been identified as a source of error in pilot superconducting quantum devices(3-5), but the effect on large-scale algorithms and error correction remains an open question. Elucidating the physics involved requires operating large numbers of qubits at the same rapid timescales necessary for error correction. Here, we use space- and time-resolved measurements of a large-scale quantum processor to identify bursts of quasiparticles produced by high-energy rays. We track the events from their initial localized impact as they spread, simultaneously and severely limiting the energy coherence of all qubits and causing chip-wide failure. Our results provide direct insights into the impact of these damaging error bursts and highlight the necessity of mitigation to enable quantum computing to scale.

TI Shortcuts to dynamic polarization
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB Dynamic polarization protocols aim to hyperpolarize a spin bath by transferring spin polarization from a well-controlled qubit such as a quantum dot or a color defect. Building on techniques from shortcuts to adiabaticity, we design fast and efficient dynamic polarization protocols in central spin models that apply to dipolarly interacting systems. The protocols maximize the transfer of polarization via bright states at a nearby integrable point, exploit the integrability-breaking terms to reduce the statistical weight on dark states that do not transfer polarization, and realize experimentally accessible local counterdiabatic driving through Floquet engineering. A master equation treatment suggests that the protocol duration scales linearly with the number of bath spins with a prefactor that can be orders of magnitude smaller than that of unassisted protocols. This work opens pathways to cool spin baths and extend qubit coherence times for applications in quantum information processing and metrology.

AB Multipartite entanglement is indispensable in the implementation of quantum technologies and the fundamental test of quantum mechanics. Here we study how the W state and W-like state may be generated in a quantum-dot array by controlling the coupling between an incident photon and the quantum dots on a waveguide. We also discuss how the coupling may be controlled to observe the sudden death of entanglement. Our work can find potential applications in quantum information processing.

TI Coherent state representation of squeezing operator and its applications
SO RESULTS IN PHYSICS
AB In a previous paper Zhan et al. (2022) proposed the coherent state representation for linear operator, which shows a beautiful theoretical value. Inspired by the work, we further extend it to the nonlinear case, including single- and two-mode squeezing process. Based on squeezing operators' transformation relation, we introduce their coherent state representations and derive their normal ordering forms by using the technique of integration within product of operator. As applications, we examine some operators's normal ordering forms and show the entanglement property of prepared quantum states via the Schmidt decomposition. In particular, we further consider two cascaded two-mode squeezing operators, in which a generalized SU(1,1) interferometer is involved. In addition, the application of two-mode squeezing operator followed by photon-subtraction to generate non-Gaussian entangled states in quantum teleportation is discussed. Our results will be useful in preparation of quantum states and quantum metrology.

TI Non-Markovian Protection and Thermal Fragility of Quantum Resources in a
   Spin-1/2 Ising-Heisenberg Diamond Chain
SO ANNALEN DER PHYSIK
AB This research investigates the dynamics of entanglement and uncertainty-induced nonlocality (UIN) in a spin-1/2 Ising-Heisenberg diamond chain subjected to local non-Markovian decoherence channels. By examining amplitude damping (AD) and random telegraph noise (RTN) in both zero and finite temperature regimes, the study reveals nuanced distinctions in the degradation and revival of quantum correlations. The interplay between intrinsic spin couplings, thermal effects, and memory-induced coherence backflow highlights the complex behavior of quantum resources under realistic noise conditions. Concurrence emerges as a sensitive marker of entanglement recovery in dephasing environments, while uncertainty-induced nonlocality proves more resilient in high-temperature or dissipative regimes. The analysis further demonstrates that moderate thermal activation and external magnetic fields can nontrivially enhance or suppress quantum features depending on system parameters. These findings offer a detailed perspective on the robustness and complementarity of different quantum correlation measures, providing guiding principles for the design of thermally stable and noise-resilient quantum information protocols.

TI Graph-theoretic approach to dimension witnessing
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB A fundamental problem in quantum computation and quantum information is finding the minimum quantum dimension needed for a task. For tasks involving state preparation and measurements, this problem can be addressed using only the input-output correlations. This has been applied to Bell, prepare-and-measure, and Kochen-Specker contextuality scenarios. Here, we introduce a novel approach to quantum dimension witnessing for scenarios with one preparation and several measurements, which uses the graphs of mutual exclusivity between sets of measurement events. We present the concepts and tools needed for graph-theoretic quantum dimension witnessing and illustrate their use by identifying novel quantum dimension witnesses, including a family that can certify arbitrarily high quantum dimensions with few events.

AB Quantum computing has gained considerable attention, especially after the arrival of the Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) era. Quantum processors and cloud services have been made worldwide increasingly available. Unfortunately, jobs on existing quantum processors are often executed in series, and the workload could be heavy to the processor. Typically, one has to wait for hours or even longer to obtain the result of a single quantum job on public quantum cloud due to long queue time. In fact, as the scale grows, the qubit utilization rate of the serial execution mode will further diminish, causing the waste of quantum resources. In this paper, to our best knowledge for the first time, the Quantum Job Scheduling Problem (QJSP) is formulated and introduced, and we accordingly aim to improve the utility efficiency of quantum resources. Specifically, a noise-aware quantum job scheduler (NAQJS) concerning the circuit width, number of measurement shots, and submission time of quantum jobs is proposed to reduce the execution latency. We conduct extensive experiments on a simulated Qiskit noise model, as well as on the Xiaohong (from QuantumCTek) superconducting quantum processor. Numerical results show the effectiveness in both the QPU time and turnaround time.

TI Scalable quantum detector tomography by high-performance computing
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB At large scales, quantum systems may become advantageous over their classical counterparts at performing certain tasks. Developing tools to analyze these systems at the relevant scales, in a manner consistent with quantum mechanics, is therefore critical to benchmarking performance and characterizing their operation. While classical computational approaches cannot perform like-for-like computations of quantum systems beyond a certain scale, classical high-performance computing (HPC) may nevertheless be useful for precisely these characterization and certification tasks. By developing open-source customized algorithms using HPC, we perform quantum tomography on a megascale quantum photonic detector covering a Hilbert space of 106. This requires finding 108 elements of the matrix corresponding to the positive operator valued measure, the quantum description of the detector, and is achieved in minutes of computation time. Moreover, by exploiting the structure of the problem, we achieve highly efficient parallel scaling, paving the way for quantum objects up to a system size of 1012 elements to be reconstructed using this method. In general, this shows that a consistent quantum mechanical description of quantum phenomena is applicable at everyday scales. More concretely, this enables the reconstruction of large-scale quantum sources, processes and detectors used in computation and sampling tasks, which may be necessary to prove their nonclassical character or quantum computational advantage.

TI Enhanced Quantum Ensemble Classification Algorithm With Shallow Circuit
   and Parallelism Mechanism
SO CONCURRENCY AND COMPUTATION-PRACTICE & EXPERIENCE
AB Ensemble learning plays a central role in improving the generalization of machine learning models, yet its full potential remains underexplored in the quantum domain. In this work, we propose a Quantum Ensemble Learning (QEL) algorithm that leverages the parallelism of quantum computing to construct diverse classifiers in a shallow-circuit ensemble. The method uses a control-qubit-based sampling strategy to create superpositions of training subsamples, enabling simultaneous evaluation of multiple weak learners. The algorithm proceeds through four stages: quantum state preparation, superposition-based sampling, learning via quantum interference, and final measurement. Our framework is flexible and allows different quantum classifiers to be used as base learners. We demonstrate this by implementing a robust QSVM-based ensemble with quantum feature extraction using PauliFeatureMaps. Unlike classical methods, this technique adds classifiers to time complexity additively rather than multiplicatively due to the parallelism of quantum computing. To demonstrate the workflow of the proposed algorithm, we include a step-by-step example using the XOR problem. Simulation results further validate the effectiveness of the QEL framework-enhanced by the integration of a Quantum Support Vector Machine (QSVM) classifier with quantum feature extraction-showing improved classification accuracy compared to existing algorithms across several UCI benchmark datasets using IBM Qiskit.

TI Long-lived electronic spin qubits in single-walled carbon nanotubes
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Spins defined in single-walled carbon nanotubes promise ultra-long spin relaxation times, but qubit implementations require confinement of isolated spins. Here the authors report highly confined long-lived electron spins in chemically functionalized nanotubes and demonstrate their coherent control.
   Electron spins in solid-state systems offer the promise of spin-based information processing devices. Single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs), an all-carbon one-dimensional material whose spin-free environment and weak spin-orbit coupling promise long spin coherence times, offer a diverse degree of freedom for extended range of functionality not available to bulk systems. A key requirement limiting spin qubit implementation in SWCNTs is disciplined confinement of isolated spins. Here, we report the creation of highly confined electron spins in SWCNTs via a bottom-up approach. The record long coherence time of 8.2 mu s and spin-lattice relaxation time of 13 ms of these electronic spin qubits allow demonstration of quantum control operation manifested as Rabi oscillation. Investigation of the decoherence mechanism reveals an intrinsic coherence time of tens of milliseconds. These findings evident that combining molecular approaches with inorganic crystalline systems provides a powerful route for reproducible and scalable quantum materials suitable for qubit applications.

TI Large-scale cluster quantum microcombs
SO LIGHT-SCIENCE & APPLICATIONS
AB An optical frequency comb comprises a cluster of equally spaced, phase-locked spectral lines. Replacing these classical components with correlated quantum light gives rise to cluster quantum frequency combs, providing abundant quantum resources for measurement-based quantum computation, and multi-user quantum networks. We propose and generate cluster quantum microcombs within an on-chip optical microresonator driven by multi-frequency lasers. Through resonantly enhanced four-wave mixing processes, continuous-variable cluster states with 60 qumodes are deterministically created. The graph structures can be programmed into one- and two-dimensional lattices by adjusting the configurations of the pump lines, which are confirmed inseparable based on the measured covariance matrices. Our work demonstrates the largest-scale cluster states with unprecedented raw squeezing levels from a photonic chip, offering a compact and scalable platform for computational and communicational tasks with quantum advantages.

TI High-connectivity quantum processor nodes using single-ion qubits in
   rare-earth-ion-doped crystals
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We present two protocols for constructing quantum processor nodes in randomly doped rare-earth-ion crystals and analyze their properties. By varying the doping concentration and the accessible laser tunability, the processor nodes can contain anywhere from only a few tens to almost 1000 qubits. Furthermore, the average number of qubits each qubit can interact with, denoted by the connectivity, can be partly tailored to lie between just a few and roughly 100. We also study how a limited tunability of the laser affects the results and conclude that a tuning range of 100 GHz limits the results to roughly 100 qubits with around 50 connections per qubit on average. In order to construct an even larger processor, the vision is that several of these quantum processor nodes should be connected to each other in a multinode architecture via, e.g., optical interfaces or flying qubits in the form of light. Our results are encouraging for establishing the rare-earth-ion-based systems as a quantum computing platform with strong potential and can serve to focus the efforts within the field.

TI Harmonic flow-field representations of quantum bits and gates
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB We describe a general procedure for mapping arbitrary n-qubit states to two-dimensional (2D) vector fields. The mappings use complex rational function representations of individual qubits, producing classical vector field configurations that can be interpreted in terms of 2D inviscid fluid flows or electric fields. Elementary qubits are identified with localized defects in 2D harmonic vector fields, and multiqubit states find natural field representations via complex superpositions of vector field products. In particular, separable states appear as highly symmetric flow configurations, making them both dynamically and visually distinct from entangled states. The resulting real-space representations of entangled qubit states enable an intuitive visualization of their transformations under quantum logic operations. We demonstrate this for the quantum Fourier transform and the period finding process underlying Shor's algorithm, along with other quantum algorithms. Due to its generic construction, the mapping procedure suggests the possibility of extending concepts such as entanglement or entanglement entropy to classical continuum systems, and thus may help guide new experimental approaches to information storage and nonstandard computation.

TI Distributing Quantum Computations, Shot-Wise
SO FUTURE INTERNET
AB NISQ (Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum) era constraints, high sensitivity to noise and limited qubit count, impose significant barriers on the usability of QPUs (Quantum Process Units) capabilities. To overcome these challenges, researchers are exploring methods to maximize the utility of existing QPUs despite their limitations. Building upon the idea that the execution of a quantum circuit's shots does not need to be treated as a singular monolithic unit, we propose a methodological framework, termed shot-wise, which enables the distribution of shots for a single circuit across multiple QPUs. Our framework features customizable policies to adapt to various scenarios. Additionally, it introduces a calibration method to pre-evaluate the accuracy and reliability of each QPU's output before the actual distribution process and an incremental execution mechanism for dynamically managing the shot allocation and policy updates. Such an approach enables flexible and fine-grained management of the distribution process, taking into account various user-defined constraints and (contrasting) objectives. Demonstration results show that shot-wise distribution consistently and significantly improves the execution performance, with no significant drawbacks and additional qualitative advantages. Overall, the shot-wise methodology improves result stability and often outperforms single QPU runs, offering a robust and flexible approach to managing variability in quantum computing.

TI Tunability of the Nonlinear Interferometer Method for Anchoring
   Constructive Interference Patterns on the ITU-T Grid
SO APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
AB Recently, a method of engineering the quantum states with a nonlinear interferometer was proposed to achieve precise state engineering for near-ideal single-mode operation and near-unity efficiency (L. Cui et al., Phys. Rev. A 102, 033718 (2020)), and the high-purity bi-photon states can be created without degrading brightness and collection efficiency. Here, we study the coarse or fine tunability of the nonlinear interference method to match constructive interference patterns into a transmission window of standard 100-GHz DWDM channels. The joint spectral intensity spectrum is measured for various conditions of the nonlinear interference effects. We show that the method has coarse- and fine-tuning ability while maintaining its high spectral purity. We expect that our results expand the usefulness of the nonlinear interference method. The photon-pair generation engineered via this method will be an excellent practical source of the quantum information process.

TI Probing new physics through entanglement in diboson production
SO JOURNAL OF HIGH ENERGY PHYSICS
AB Pair production of heavy vector bosons is a key process at colliders: it allows to test our understanding of the Standard Model and to explore the existence of new physics through precision measurements of production rates and differential distributions. New physics effects can be subtle and often require observables specifically designed for their detection. In this study, we focus on quantum information observables that characterise the spin states of the final diboson system. We analyse concurrence bounds, purity, and Bell inequalities for a bipartite qutrit system representing two massive gauge bosons. Our findings show that quantum spin observables can serve as complementary probes for heavy new physics as parametrised by higher dimensional operators in the Standard Model effective field theory. In particular, we find that these observables offer increased sensitivity to operators whose contributions do not interfere with the Standard Model amplitudes at the level of differential cross sections.

TI Higher-Order Topological Phase of Interacting Photon Pairs
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Topological phases open a door to such intriguing phenomena as unidirectional propagation and disorder-resilient localization at a stable frequency. Recently discovered higher-order topological phases further extend the concept of topological protection enabling versatile control over localization in multiple dimensions. Motivated by the recent advances in quantum technologies such as large coherently operating qubit ensembles, we predict and investigate the higher-order topological phase of photon pairs emerging due to effective photon-photon interaction and described by the extended version of Bose-Hubbard model. Being feasible for state-of-the-art experimental capabilities, the designed model provides an interesting example of interaction-induced topological transitions in the few-particle two-dimensional system.

TI Shuttle-Exploiting Attacks and Their Defenses in Trapped-Ion Quantum
   Computers
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Trapped-ion (TI) quantum bits are a front-runner technology for quantum computing. TI systems with multiple interconnected traps can overcome the hardware connectivity issue inherent in superconducting qubits and can solve practical problems at scale. With a sufficient number of qubits on the horizon, the multi-programming model for Quantum Computers (QC) has been proposed where multiple users share the same QC for their computing. Multi-programming is enticing for quantum cloud providers as it can maximize device utilization, throughput, and profit for clouds. Users can also benefit from the short wait queue. However, shared access to quantum computers can create new security issues. This paper presents one such vulnerability in shared TI systems that require shuttle operations for communication among traps. Repeated shuttle operations increase quantum bit energy and degrade the reliability of computations (fidelity). We show adversarial program design approaches requiring numerous shuttles. We propose a random and systematic methodology for adversary program generation. Our analysis shows shuttle-exploiting attacks can substantially degrade the fidelities of victim programs by to approximate to 2x to approximate to 63x. Finally, we present several countermeasures such as adopting a hybrid initial mapping policy, padding victim programs with dummy qubits, and capping maximum shuttles.

TI Design of an ultra-low mode volume piezo-optomechanical quantum
   transducer
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Coherent transduction of quantum states from the microwave to the optical domain can play a key role in quantum networking and distributed quantum computing. We present the design of a piezo-optomechanical device formed in a hybrid lithium niobate on silicon platform, that is suitable for microwave-to-optical quantum transduction. Our design is based on acoustic hybridization of an ultra-low mode volume piezoacoustic cavity with an optomechanical crystal cavity. The strong piezoelectric nature of lithium niobate allows us to mediate transduction via an acoustic mode which only minimally interacts with the lithium niobate, and is predominantly silicon-like, with very low electrical and acoustic loss. We estimate that this transducer can realize an intrinsic conversion efficiency of up to 35% with <0.5 added noise quanta when resonantly coupled to a superconducting transmon qubit and operated in pulsed mode at 10 kHz repetition rate. The performance improvement gained in such hybrid lithium niobate-silicon transducers make them suitable for heralded entanglement of qubits between superconducting quantum processors connected by optical fiber links.& COPY; 2023 Optica Publishing Group under the terms of the Optica Open Access Publishing Agreement

AB We propose a setup for studying the quantum coherence properties of a quadrupolar nucleus using the nuclear magnetic resonance platforms We consider powder samples labeled with 23Na and oriented with respect to the static magnetic field. By using the l 1-norm of coherence, we examine the quantum coherence in the Zeeman basis at thermal equilibrium. Non-zero coherence is found to result from the strong nuclear quadrupolar spin interactions. It is also shown that higher coherence is created as the quadrupolar interaction coefficient increases. We also discuss the stability of coherence in a possible measurement process in order to use it as a potential resource in any quantum computation protocol.

TI Engineering the development of quantum programs: Application to the
   Boolean satisfiability problem
SO ADVANCES IN ENGINEERING SOFTWARE
AB The development of quantum programs is becoming a reality due to the rapid advancement of quantum computing. Over the past few years, a multitude of hardware platforms, algorithms, and programming languages have emerged to support this paradigm. By the very nature of Quantum Mechanics principles, there is an enormous change of philosophy when building quantum programs, which operate in a probabilistic space, unlike the deterministic behaviour shown by classical programming languages. These conceptual differences can be overcome by using techniques and tools of Software Engineering. In this paper, we apply Model-Driven Engineering techniques in a systematic way to ease the generation of quantum programs and we apply it to solve the satisfiability problem, very important in many engineering domains like verification of discrete systems and test of integrated circuits. To that aim, we contribute with a metamodel for representing quantum circuits and a model-to-text transformation to generate working IBM Qiskit code. This model-driven infrastructure is employed to automatically generate quantum programs from SAT equations through a model-to-model transformation that embeds Grover's algorithm. Besides, we provide formulas for calculating the number of required quantum elements from SAT equations, crucial in the current context of limited quantum resources. The interoperability with other tools and the extensibility to target additional quantum platforms is guaranteed thanks to the use of a model-based toolchain. We cover several usage scenarios to validate the approach, providing exemplary SAT equations, the generated Qiskit code and the results of executing this code in IBM Quantum infrastructure.

SO QUANTUM INFORMATION PROCESSING
AB This article explores the concurrence in a two-qubit Heisenberg XXX model with Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) and Kaplan-Shekhtman-Entin-Wohlman-Aharony (KSEA) interactions. The concurrence expression was developed using the physical variables connected with the chosen system. Our results indicate that the temperature, the spin coupling constant, the x-components of the DM and KSEA interactions may all play a role in determining the degree of intricacy between states. Additionally, these findings imply that the separability of states is obtained at high-temperature domains or by switching the spin coupling. In contrast, the entanglement of states may be achieved at low temperatures or by using high values of the x-components of the DM and KSEA parameters. Furthermore, the DM and KSEA interactions have an identical effect on the concurrence behaviors at high temperatures.

TI Non-symmetric Pauli spin blockade in a silicon double quantum dot
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Spin qubits in gate-defined silicon quantum dots are receiving increased attention thanks to their potential for large-scale quantum computing. Readout of such spin qubits is done most accurately and scalably via Pauli spin blockade (PSB), however, various mechanisms may lift PSB and complicate readout. In this work, we present an experimental study of PSB in a multi-electron low-symmetry double quantum dot (DQD) in silicon nanowires. We report on the observation of non-symmetric PSB, manifesting as blockaded tunneling when the spin is projected to one QD of the pair but as allowed tunneling when the projection is done into the other. By analyzing the interaction of the DQD with a readout resonator, we find that PSB lifting is caused by a large coupling between the different electron spin manifolds of 7.90 mu eV and that tunneling is incoherent. Further, magnetospectroscopy of the DQD in 16 charge configurations, enables reconstructing the energy spectrum of the DQD and reveals the lifting mechanism is energy-level selective. Our results indicate enhanced spin-orbit coupling which may enable all-electrical qubit control of electron spins in silicon nanowires.

TI Optical vortex ladder via Sisyphus pumping of Pseudospin
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Robust high-order optical vortices are much in demand for applications in optical manipulation, optical communications, quantum entanglement and quantum computing. However, in numerous experimental settings, a controlled generation of optical vortices with arbitrary orbital angular momentum remains a challenge. Here, we present a concept of "optical vortex ladder" for the stepwise generation of optical vortices through Sisyphus pumping of pseudospin modes in photonic graphene. The ladder is applicable in various lattices with Dirac-like structures. Instead of conical diffraction and incomplete pseudospin conversion under conventional Gaussian beam excitations, the vortices produced in the ladder arise from non-trivial topology and feature diffraction-free Bessel profiles, thanks to the refined excitation of the ring spectrum around the Dirac cones. By employing a periodic "kick" to the photonic graphene, effectively inducing the Sisyphus pumping, the ladder enables tunable generation of optical vortices of any order even when the initial excitation does not involve any orbital angular momentum. The optical vortex ladder stands out as an intriguing non-Hermitian dynamical system, and, among other possibilities, opens a pathway for applications of topological singularities in beam shaping and wavefront engineering.

TI Detecting and estimating coherence based on coherence witnesses
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Quantum coherence has wide-ranging applications from quantum thermodynamics to quantum metrology, quantum channel discrimination, and even quantum biology. Thus, detecting and quantifying coherence are two fundamental problems in quantum resource theory. Here, we introduce feasible methods to detect and estimate the coherence by constructing coherence witnesses for any finite-dimensional states. Our coherence witnesses detect coherent states by testing whether the expectation value of the witness is negative or not. Two typical coherence witnesses are proposed and discussed based on our witness-constructing method, which are also used to estimate the robustness of coherence, the l(1) norm, and the l(2) norm of coherence measures. Furthermore, we compare one of our coherence witnesses with a previously introduced witness by proving that our witness is strictly stronger than that previous witness. We also present an application of coherence in a quantum metrology task, in which we estimate an unknown parameter by measuring our coherence witness.

TI Limitations in design and applications of ultra-small mode volume
   photonic crystals
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB Ultra-small mode volume nanophotonic crystal cavities have been proposed as powerful tools for increasing coupling rates in cavity quantum electrodynamics systems. However, their adoption in quantum information applications remains elusive. In this work, we investigate possible reasons why, and analyze the impact of different low mode volume resonator design choices on their utility in quantum optics experiments. We analyze band structure features and loss rates of low mode volume bowtie cavities in diamond and demonstrate independent design control over cavity-emitter coupling strength and loss rates. Further, using silicon vacancy centers in diamond as exemplary emitters, we investigate the influence of placement imprecision. We find that the benefit on photon collection efficiency and indistinguishability is limited, while the fabrication complexity of ultra-small cavity designs increases substantially compared to conventional photonic crystals. We conclude that ultra-small mode volume designs are primarily of interest for dispersive spin-photon interactions, which are of great interest for future quantum networks.

TI Estimation of the CHSH Parameter Using HOM Interference
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM ENGINEERING
AB The Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (CHSH) experiment is an essential test of nonlocality in quantum mechanics and can be used to validate the principle of entanglement. In addition to verifying entanglement, the measurable CHSH parameter can also be used to gauge the quality of the entanglement present in a system. The measurement of Hong-Ou-Mandel (HOM) interference is another important fundamental experiment in quantum optics that measures the indistinguishability of a pair of photons. In this article, we demonstrate how the results of a HOM interference experiment, a relatively simple experiment, can be used to obtain an estimate for the value of the CHSH S parameter, which is a more complicated measurement. We experimentally demonstrate that the HOM interference technique is capable of providing an estimate of the value of the CHSH parameter that is within one standard deviation of measurement error when spectral impairments are present. We expect that this technique will aid in the calibration of quantum optical systems.

TI Higher-dimensional symmetric informationally complete measurement via
   programmable photonic integrated optics
SO OPTICA
AB Symmetric informationally complete measurements are both important building blocks in many quantum information protocols and the seminal example of a generalized, non-orthogonal, and quantum measurement. In higher-dimensional systems, these measurements become both increasingly interesting and increasingly complex to implement. Here, we demonstrate an integrated quantum photonic platform, operating at high fidelities, to realize such a measurement on three-level quantum systems. We demonstrate the quality of the measurement device by verifying a genuine many-outcome quantum measurement, performing near-optimal quantum state discrimination, and beating the projective limit in quantum random number generation. Moreover, the device is programmable and can readily implement other quantum measurements at similarly high quality. Our work paves the way for the implementation of sophisticated higher-dimensional quantum measurements that go beyond the traditional orthogonal projections.

SO PRX QUANTUM
AB We demonstrate coherent manipulation of the nuclear degrees of freedom of ultracold ground-state strontium-87 atoms, thus providing a toolkit for fully exploiting the corresponding large Hilbert space as a quantum resource and for quantum simulation experiments with zu(N)-symmetric matter. By controlling the resonance conditions of Raman transitions with a tensor light shift, we can perform rotations within a restricted Hilbert space of two isolated spin states among the 2F + 1 = 10 possible states. These manipulations correspond to engineering unitary operations derived from generators of the zu(N) algebra beyond what can be done by simple spin precession. We present Ramsey interferometers involving an isolated pair of Zeeman states with no measurable decoherence after 3 s. We also demonstrate that one can harness the large spin degrees of freedom as a qudit resource by implementing two interferometer schemes over four states. The first scheme senses in parallel multiple external fields acting on the atoms, and the second scheme simultaneously measures multiple observables of a collective atomic state-including noncommuting ones. Engineering unitary transformations of the large spin driven by other generators than the usual spin-F representation of the zu(2) group offers new possibilities from the point of view of quantum metrology and quantum many-body physics, notably for the quantum simulation of large-spin zu(N)-symmetric quantum magnetism with fermionic alkaline-earth atoms.

TI Scalable projected entangled-pair state representation of random quantum
   circuit states
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Classical simulation of a programmable quantum processor is crucial in identifying the threshold of a quantum advantage. We demonstrate the simple update of projected entangled-pair states (PEPSs) in the Vidal gauge that represent random quantum circuit states, which center around recent quantum advantage claims. Applied to square lattices of qubits akin to state-of-the-art superconducting processors, the PEPS representation is exact for circuit depths less than Dtr = log2 chi, where chi is the maximum bond dimension and 2 <= <= 4 depends on the choice of two-qubit gates, independent of the qubit number n. We find the universal scaling behaviors of the state fidelity by treating large-scale circuits of n 104, using chi 128 on a conventional CPU. Our method has a polynomial scaling of computational costs with n for circuit depth D = O(log n) and is more advantageous than matrix product state approaches if n is large. This work underscores PEPSs as a scalable tool for benchmarking quantum algorithms with future potential for sampling applications using advanced contraction techniques.

TI Synchronization and coalescence in a dissipative two-qubit system
SO PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY A-MATHEMATICAL PHYSICAL AND ENGINEERING
   SCIENCES
AB The possibility of detuned spins displaying synchronous oscillations in local observables is analysed in the presence of coupling, collective dissipation and incoherent pumping. We show that there exist two distinct scenarios in which synchronization can emerge, related respectively to the presence of a non-degenerate long-lived eigenmode and to the presence of a single-frequency regime. Both scenarios can arise by tuning parameters in this system, owing to the presence of coalascence. The former, known as transient synchronization, is here generalized in the presence of incoherent pumping, and is due to long-lasting coherences leading to a progressive frequency selection. On the other hand, in spite of the spins detuning, the dynamics can be governed by a single frequency. Still, we show that synchronization can be established only after a transient, when phase-locking arises. Spectral features of synchronization in these two scenarios are analysed for two-time correlations.

TI Hyperentanglement W state concentration for polarization-time-bin photon
   systems with linear optics
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB In recent years, quantum communication technology has developed rapidly, and quantum communication schemes based on hyperentangled states have attracted widespread attention due to their efficiency and security. However, in practical communication, maximally hyperentangled states are highly susceptible to environmental noise, which causes them to degrade into non-maximally hyperentangled states. This degradation significantly reduces the fidelity of the quantum information and communication efficiency. In this article, we propose an efficient entanglement concentration scheme to restore degraded polarization-time hyperentangled W states, thereby enhancing the reliability and transmission distance of multiparty quantum communication. The protocol employs the parameter-splitting approach, where the receiver performs local operations on received non-maximally hyperentangled photons by using linear optical elements, achieving hyperentanglement concentration through detector responses and post-selection. This method eliminates the need for auxiliary photons, thereby reducing the use of quantum resources and maintaining operational simplicity. Moreover, the scheme can be extended to N-photon hyperentangled W states. The theoretical calculations demonstrate that the success probability of the protocol is determined by the minimal parameter of the hyperentangled state, exhibiting a monotonic increase as this parameter grows. Under ideal conditions, the maximum success probability approaches unity and the success probability improves with the number of entangled photons increasing. When considering the efficiency of practical optical components, the maximal success probabilities for hyperentangled W states with N = 3, 4, and 5 are found to be 0.856, 0.791, and 0.732, respectively. Consequently, the proposed scheme efficiently concentrates the degraded polarization-time hyperentangled W state into the maximally hyperentangled state. This work is of significant importance for long-distance information transmission and provides theoretical references for implementing long-distance multi-party quantum communication.

TI Raman imaging of atoms inside a high-bandwidth cavity
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB High-bandwidth, fiber-based optical cavities are a promising building block for future quantum networks. They are used to resonantly couple stationary qubits such as single or multiple atoms with photons routing quantum information into a fiber network at high rates. In high-bandwidth cavities, standard fluorescence imaging on the atom-cavity resonance line for controlling atom positions is impaired since the Purcell effect strongly suppresses all-directional fluorescence. Here, we restore imaging of Rb-87 atoms strongly coupled to such a fiber Fabry-Perot cavity by detecting the repumper fluorescence which is generated by continuous and three-dimensional Raman sideband cooling. We have carried out a detailed spectroscopic investigation of the repumper-induced differential light shifts affecting the Raman resonance, dependent on intensity and detuning. Our analysis identifies a compromise regime between imaging signal-to-noise ratio and survival rate, where physical insight into the role of dipole-force fluctuations in the heating dynamics of trapped atoms is gained.

TI A Herculean task: classical simulation of quantum computers
SO SCIENCE BULLETIN
AB In the effort to develop useful quantum computers, simulating quantum machines with conventional classical computing resources is a key capability. Such simulations will always face limits, preventing the emulation of quantum computers at substantial scale; however, by pushing the envelope through optimal choices of algorithms and hardware, the value of simulator tools can be maximized. This work reviews state-of-the-art numerical simulation methods, i.e., classical algorithms that emulate quantum computer evolution under specific operations. We focus on the mainstream state-vector and tensornetwork paradigms, while briefly mentioning alternative methods. Moreover, we review the diverse applications of simulation across different facets of quantum computer development, including understanding the fundamental differences between quantum and classical computations, exploring algorithmic design for quantum advantage, predicting quantum processor performance at the design stage, and efficiently characterizing fabricated devices for rapid iterations. This review complements recent surveys of current tools and implementations; here, we aim to provide readers with an essential understanding of the theoretical basis of classical simulation methods, a detailed discussion of their advantages and limitations, and an overview of the demands and challenges arising from practical use cases.

TI Selective nuclear-spin interaction based on a dissipatively stabilized
   nitrogen-vacancy center
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Current typical methods to realize nuclear-nuclear quantum gates require a sequence of electron-nuclear quantum gates by using dynamical decoupling techniques, which are implemented at low temperature because of the short decoherence and relaxation time of the nitrogen-vacancy (NV) spin at room temperature. This limitation could be overcome by using periodic resets of an NV spin as a mediator of the interaction between two nuclear spins [Q. Chen et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 119, 010801 (2017)]. However, this method works under stringent coupling strength conditions, which makes it not applicable to heteronuclear quantum gate operations. Here we develop this scheme by using radio-frequency fields to control different nuclear-spin species. Periodic resets of the NV center protect the nuclear spins from decoherence and relaxation of the NV spin. Radio-frequency control provides the probability to have highly selective and high-fidelity quantum gates between heteronuclear spins and detecting nuclear spins by using a nuclear-spin sensor under ambient conditions.

TI Spin-exchange collisions in hot vapors creating and sustaining bipartite
   entanglement
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Spin-exchange collisions in alkali or alkali-noble gas vapors are at the basis of quantum sensing, nucleon structure studies, tests of fundamental symmetries, and medical imaging. We here show that spin-exchange collisions in hot alkali vapors naturally produce strong bipartite entanglement, which we explicitly quantify using the tools of quantum information science. This entanglement is shown to have a lifetime at least as long as the spin-exchange relaxation time, and to directly affect measurable spin noise observables. This is a formal theoretical demonstration that a hot and dense atomic vapor dominated by random spin-exchange collisions can support long-lived bipartite and possibly higher-order entanglement.

TI Hong-Ou-Mandel interference with a coexisting clock using transceivers
   for synchronization over deployed fiber
SO OPTICS COMMUNICATIONS
AB Interference between independently generated photons is a key step towards distributing entanglement over long distances, but it requires synchronization between the distantly-located photon sources. Synchronizing the clocks of such photon sources using coexisting two-way classical optical communications over the same fiber that transports the quantum photonic signals is a promising approach for achieving photon-photon interference over long distances, enabling entanglement distribution for quantum networking using the deployed fiber infrastructure. Here, we demonstrate photon-photon interference by observing the Hong-Ou-Mandel dip between two distantly-located sources: a weak coherent-state source obtained by attenuating the output of a laser and a heralded single-photon source. We achieve a maximum dip visibility of 0.58 +/- 0.04 when the two sources are connected via 4.3 km of deployed fiber. Dip visibilities > 0.5 are nonclassical and a first step towards achieving teleportation over the deployed fiber infrastructure. In our experiment, the classical optical communication is achieved with - 21 dBm of optical signal launch power, which is used to synchronize the clocks in the two independent, distantly-located photon sources. The impact of spontaneous Raman scattering from the classical optical signals is mitigated by appropriate choice of the quantum- and classical-channel wavelengths. All equipment used in our experiment (the photon sources and the synchronization setup) is commercially available. Finally, our experiment represents a scalable approach to enabling practical quantum networking with commercial equipment and coexistence with classical communications in optical fiber.

TI Broadband polarization-entangled source for C plus L-band flex-grid
   quantum networks
SO OPTICS LETTERS
AB The rising demand for transmission capacity in optical net-works has motivated steady interest in expansion beyond the standard C-band (1530-1565 nm) into the adjacent L-band (1565-1625 nm) for an approximate doubling of capacity in a single stroke. However, in the context of quantum net-working, the L-band has yet to be fully leveraged with the suite of advanced tools for characterization and manage-ment available from classical lightwave communications. In this work, we demonstrate an ultrabroadband two-photon source integrating both C-and L-band wavelength-selective switches for complete control of spectral routing and allo-cation across 7.5 THz in a single setup. Polarization state tomography of all 150 pairs of 25-GHz-wide channels reveals an average fidelity of 0.98 and total distillable entanglement greater than 181 kebits/s. This source is explicitly designed for flex-grid optical networks and can facilitate optimal uti-lization of entanglement resources across the full C+L-band.(c) 2022 Optica Publishing Group

TI Design and performance of entanglement-based underwater VLC/QKD systems
SO OPTICS CONTINUUM
AB Underwater wireless communication is rapidly advancing, finding applications in diverse fields such as oceanography, defense, and commercial ventures. However, ensuring security in such transmissions is crucial due to the sensitive nature of the data involved and the challenges posed by the underwater environment. While classical encryption techniques provide some level of security, the emergence of quantum computing presents opportunities and challenges. Quantum key distribution (QKD) offers theoretically unbreakable encryption, making it an attractive solution. Extending QKD capabilities to underwater environments is a significant endeavor in this context. This paper explores the feasibility of applying an entanglement-based non-coherent QKD protocol inspired by the BBM92 protocol to underwater visible light communication (VLC)/QKD systems. We investigate the system's design criteria and analyze its secret key performance, addressing challenges such as water absorption and turbulence-induced fading, focusing on addressing unauthorized receiver attacks. Through analysis and the considered case study, the feasibility and efficacy of this approach are explored, contributing to the advancement of secure underwater communications.

TI Adaptive filtering of projective quantum measurements using discrete
   stochastic methods
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Adaptive filtering is a powerful class of control theoretic concepts useful in extracting information from noisy data sets or performing forward prediction in time for a dynamic system. The broad utilization of the associated algorithms makes them attractive targets for similar problems in the quantum domain. To date, however, the construction of adaptive filters for quantum systems has typically been carried out in terms of stochastic differential equations for weak, continuous quantum measurements, as used in linear quantum systems such as optical cavities. Discretized measurement models are not as easily treated in this framework, but are frequently employed in quantum information systems leveraging projective measurements. This paper presents a detailed analysis of several technical innovations that enable classical filtering of discrete projective measurements, useful for adaptively learning system dynamics, noise properties, or hardware performance variations in classically correlated measurement data from quantum devices. In previous work we studied a specific case of this framework, in which noise and calibration errors on qubit arrays could be efficiently characterized in space; here, we present a generalized analysis of filtering in quantum systems and demonstrate that the traditional convergence properties of nonlinear classical filtering hold using single-shot projective measurements. These results are important early demonstrations indicating that a range of concepts and techniques from classical nonlinear filtering theory may be applied to the characterization of quantum systems involving discretized projective measurements, paving the way for broader adoption of control theoretic techniques in quantum technology.

AB Highlights What are the main findings? Quantum and quantum-inspired methods show promise in transport optimisation but remain limited by hardware scale, data realism, and lack of standardised benchmarks. Empirical studies reveal that data translation, queue latency, and energy consumption, not the quantum step itself, dominate total computation time. What is the implication of the main finding? Progress toward real-world deployment depends on developing open benchmark suites, transparent energy and latency reporting, and hybrid quantum-classical workflows. Addressing organisational readiness and interoperability standards is essential for quantum computing to become a viable component of future smart-mobility systems.Highlights What are the main findings?

Progress toward real-world deployment depends on developing open benchmark suites, transparent energy and latency reporting, and hybrid quantum-classical workflows. Addressing organisational readiness and interoperability standards is essential for quantum computing to become a viable component of future smart-mobility systems.Abstract Quantum computing offers transformative potential to solve complex optimisation problems in transportation and logistics, particularly those that involve large combinatorial decision spaces such as vehicle routing, traffic control, and supply chain design. Despite theoretical promise and growing empirical interest, its adoption remains limited. This systematic literature review synthesises fifteen peer-reviewed studies published between 2015 and 2025, examining the application of quantum and quantum-inspired methods to transport optimisation. The review identifies five key problem domains (vehicle routing, factory scheduling, network design, traffic operations, and energy management) and categorises the quantum techniques used, including quantum annealing, variational circuits, and digital annealers. Although several studies demonstrate performance gains over classical heuristics, most rely on synthetic datasets, lack statistical robustness, and omit critical operational metrics such as energy consumption and queue latency. Four cross-cutting barriers are identified: hardware limitations, data availability, energy inefficiency, and organisational readiness. The review identifies limited real-world deployment, a lack of standardised benchmarks, and scarce cost-benefit evaluations, highlighting key areas where further empirical work is needed. It concludes with a structured research agenda aimed at bridging the gap between laboratory demonstrations and practical implementation, emphasising the need for pilot trials, open datasets, robust experimental protocols, and interdisciplinary collaboration.

TI Error Mitigation and Quantum-Assisted Simulation in the Error Corrected
   Regime
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB A standard approach to quantum computing is based on the idea of promoting a classically simulable and fault-tolerant set of operations to a universal set by the addition of "magic" quantum states. In this context, we develop a general framework to discuss the value of the available, nonideal magic resources, relative to those ideally required. We single out a quantity, the quantum-assisted robustness of magic (QROM), which measures the overhead of simulating the ideal resource with the nonideal ones through quasiprobability-based methods. This extends error mitigation techniques, originally developed for noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices, to the case where qubits are logically encoded. The QROM shows how the addition of noisy magic resources allows one to boost classical quasiprobability simulations of a quantum circuit and enables the construction of explicit protocols, interpolating between classical simulation and an ideal quantum computer.

SO ADVANCED MATERIALS
AB As an approximation to the quantum state of solids, the band theory, developed nearly seven decades ago, fostered the advance of modern integrated solid-state electronics, one of the most successful technologies in the history of human civilization. Nonetheless, their rapidly growing energy consumption and accompanied environmental issues call for more energy-efficient electronics and optoelectronics, which necessitate the exploration of more advanced quantum mechanical effects, such as band-to-band tunneling, spin-orbit coupling, spin-valley locking, and quantum entanglement. The emerging 2D layered materials, featured by their exotic electrical, magnetic, optical, and structural properties, provide a revolutionary low-dimensional and manufacture-friendly platform (and many more opportunities) to implement these quantum-engineered devices, compared to the traditional electronic materials system. Here, the progress in quantum-engineered devices is reviewed and the opportunities/challenges of exploiting 2D materials are analyzed to highlight their unique quantum properties that enable novel energy-efficient devices, and useful insights to quantum device engineers and 2D-material scientists are provided.

TI Industrial 300 mm wafer processed spin qubits in natural
   silicon/silicon-germanium
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB The realisation of a universal quantum computer will require the operation of many thousands to millions of coherently coupled qubits. The possibility of using existing industrial semiconductor fabrication techniques and infrastructure for up-scaling and reproducibility makes silicon based spin qubits one of the most promising platforms to achieve this goal. The implementation of the up to now largest semiconductor based quantum processor was realised in a silicon/silicon-germanium heterostructure known for its low charge noise, long qubit coherence times and fast driving speeds, but the high structural complexity creates challenges for industrial implementations. Here we demonstrate quantum dots hosted in a natural Si/SiGe heterostructure fully fabricated by an industrial 300 mm semiconductor wafer process line from heterostructure growth to Co micromagnet monolithic integration. We report charge noise values below 2 mu eV/Hz\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$\sqrt{{\rm{Hz}}}$$\end{document}, spin relaxation times exceeding 1 s, and coherence times T2*\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$${T}_{2}<^>{* }$$\end{document} and T2H\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$${T}_{2}<^>{H}$$\end{document} of 1 mu s and 50 mu s respectively, for quantum wells grown using natural silicon. Further, we achieve Rabi frequencies up to 5 MHz and single qubit gate fidelities above 99%. In addition to scalability, the high reproducibility of the 300 mm processes enables the deterministic study of qubit metric dependencies on process parameters, which is essential for optimising qubit quality.

TI A Perspective on Protein Structure Prediction Using Quantum Computers
SO JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL THEORY AND COMPUTATION
AB Despite the recent advancements by deep learning methods such as AlphaFold2, in silico protein structure prediction remains a challenging problem in biomedical research. With the rapid evolution of quantum computing, it is natural to ask whether quantum computers can offer some meaningful benefits for approaching this problem. Yet, identifying specific problem instances amenable to quantum advantage and estimating the quantum resources required are equally challenging tasks. Here, we share our perspective on how to create a framework for systematically selecting protein structure prediction problems that are amenable for quantum advantage, and estimate quantum resources for such problems on a utility-scale quantum computer. As a proof-of-concept, we validate our problem selection framework by accurately predicting the structure of a catalytic loop of the Zika Virus NS3 Helicase, on quantum hardware.

TI Dimensionality reduction of the many-body problem using coupled-cluster
   subsystem flow equations: Classical and quantum computing perspective
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We discuss reduced-scaling strategies employing the recently introduced subsystem embedding subalgebra (SES) coupled-cluster (CC) formalism to describe quantum many-body systems. These strategies utilize properties of the SES CC formulations where the equations describing certain classes of subsystems can be integrated into computational flows composed of coupled eigenvalue problems of reduced dimensionality. Additionally, these flows can be determined at the level of the CC ansatz by the inclusion of selected classes of cluster amplitudes, which define the wave-function "memory" of possible partitioning of the many-body system into constituent subsystems. One of the possible ways of solving these coupled problems is through implementing procedures where the information is passed between the subsystems in a self-consistent manner. As a special case we consider local flow formulations where the local character of correlation effects can be closely related to the properties of subsystem embedding subalgebras employing a localized molecular basis. We also generalize flow equations to the time domain and to downfolding methods utilizing a double-exponential unitary CC ansatz, where the reduced dimensionality of constituent subproblems offers a possibility of efficient utilization of limited quantum resources in modeling realistic systems.

TI Universal expressiveness of variational quantum classifiers and quantum
   kernels for support vector machines
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Machine learning is considered to be one of the most promising applications of quantum computing. Therefore, the search for quantum advantage of the quantum analogues of machine learning models is a key research goal. Here, we show that variational quantum classifiers and support vector machines with quantum kernels can solve a classification problembased on the k-FORRELATION problem, which is known to be PROMISEBQP-complete. Because the PROMISEBQP complexity class includes all Bounded-Error Quantum Polynomial-Time (BQP) decision problems, our results imply that there exists a feature map and a quantum kernel thatmake variational quantum classifiers and quantum kernel support vector machines efficient solvers for any BQP problem. Hence, this work implies that their feature map and quantum kernel, respectively, can be designed to have a quantum advantage for any classification problem that cannot be classically solved in polynomial time but contrariwise by a quantum computer.

TI Multilevel variational spectroscopy using a programmable quantum
   simulator
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Energy spectroscopy is a powerful tool with diverse applications across various disciplines. Variational quantum-classical algorithms based on programmable digital quantum simulators have emerged as promising approaches for conducting spectroscopy on various models using a single device, despite facing significant quantum and classical resource overheads. Here, we experimentally demonstrate multilevel variational spectroscopy for fundamental many-body Hamiltonians using a superconducting digital quantum simulator. By exploiting symmetries and the subspace search method, we achieve full spectroscopy for a four-qubit Heisenberg spin chain, yielding an average energy deviation as small as 0.13 from the theoretical values, assuming unity coupling strength. Our method, when extended to eight-qubit Heisenberg and transverse-field Ising Hamiltonians, successfully determines the three lowest-energy levels. In achieving the above, we introduce a circuit-agnostic compilation method that enhances the robustness of our simulator against signal crosstalk. Our study highlights the combination of the subspace search method and symmetry-assisted resource efficiency in variational quantum algorithms and lays the foundation for practical spectroscopy on near-term quantum simulators, with potential applications in quantum chemistry and condensed matter physics.

TI Magnon squeezing via reservoir-engineered optomagnomechanics
SO APL PHOTONICS
AB We show how to prepare magnonic squeezed states in an optomagnomechanical system in which magnetostriction induced mechanical displacement couples to an optical cavity via radiation pressure. We discuss two scenarios depending on whether the magnomechanical coupling is linear or dispersive. We show that in both cases the strong mechanical squeezing obtained via two-tone driving of the optical cavity can be efficiently transferred to the magnon mode. In the linear coupling case, stationary magnon squeezing is achieved, while in the dispersive coupling case, a transient magnonic squeezed state is prepared in a two-step protocol. The proposed magnonic squeezed states find promising applications in quantum information processing and quantum sensing using magnons. (c) 2024 Author(s).

TI Bloch oscillation with a diatomic tight-binding model on quantum
   computers
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB We aim to explore a more efficient way to simulate few-body dynamics on quantum computers. Instead of mapping the second quantization of the system Hamiltonian to qubit Pauli gate representation via the Jordan-Wigner transform, we propose to use the few-body Hamiltonian matrix under the state-vector basis representation, which is more economical on the required number of quantum registers. For a single-particle excitation state on a one-dimensional chain, P qubits can simulate N = 2r number of sites, in comparison to N qubits for N sites via the Jordan-Wigner approach. A two-band diatomic tight-binding model is used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the state-vector basis representation. Both one-particle and two-particle quantum circuits are constructed, and some numerical tests on IBM hardware are presented.

TI Observing crossover between quantum speed limits
SO SCIENCE ADVANCES
AB Quantum mechanics sets fundamental limits on how fast quantum states can be transformed in time. Two well-known quantum speed limits are the Mandelstam-Tamm and the Margolus-Levitin bounds, which relate the maximum speed of evolution to the system's energy uncertainty and mean energy, respectively. Here, we test concurrently both limits in a multilevel system by following the motion of a single atom in an optical trap using fast matter wave interferometry. We find two different regimes: one where the Mandelstam-Tamm limit constrains the evolution at all times, and a second where a crossover to the Margolus-Levitin limit occurs at longer times. We take a geometric approach to quantify the deviation from the speed limit, measuring how much the quantum evolution deviates from the geodesic path in the Hilbert space of the multilevel system. Our results are important to understand the ultimate performance of quantum computing devices and related advanced quantum technologies.

TI Deterministic single-photon source in the ultrastrong-coupling regime
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We propose a high-quality deterministic single-photon source which can not only works in the ultrastrong light-matter coupling regime, but also emits two single photons with an arbitrary time separation, in one excitation process. We find that the special solutions of the two-qubit quantum Rabi and Jaynes-Cummings models which have at most one photon and constant eigenenergies can be used to implement this proposal through two consecutive adiabatic evolutions, and the system goes back to the initial state of the next period automatically after photon emission. Due to their peculiarities and reach of the ultrastrong coupling, the adiabatic evolution can be quite fast and further accelerated with the Stark shift. This Letter paves the way to fast quantum information protocols which take advantage of the ultrastrong coupling and avoid its dynamical complexity simultaneously.

TI Experimental solutions to the high-dimensional mean king's problem
SO OPTICA QUANTUM
AB Vaidman, Aharanov, and Albert [Phys. Rev. Lett. 58(14),1385 (1987)] put forward a puzzle called the mean king's problem (MKP) that can be solved only by harnessing quantum entanglement. Prime-powered solutions to the problem have been shown to exist, but they have not yet been experimentally realized for any dimension beyond two. We propose a general first-of-its-kind experimental scheme for solving the MKP in prime dimensions (D). Our search is guided by the digital discovery framework PYTHEus, which finds highly interpretable graph-based representations of quantum optical experimental setups; using it, we find specific solutions and generalize to higher dimensions through human insight. As proof of principle, we present a detailed investigation of our solution for the three-, five-, and seven-dimensional cases. We obtain maximum success probabilities of 82.37c, 56.27c, and 35.57c, respectively. We therefore posit that our computer-inspired scheme yields solutions that implement Alice's strategy with quantum advantage, demonstrating its promise for experimental implementation in quantum communication tasks.

TI Photonic variational quantum eigensolver using entanglement measurements
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Variational quantum eigensolver (VQE), which combines quantum systems with classical computational power, has been arisen as a promising candidate for near-term quantum computing applications. However, the experimental resources such as the number of measurements to implement VQE rapidly increases as the Hamiltonian problem size grows. Applying entanglement measurements to reduce the number of measurement setups has been proposed to address this issue, but, entanglement measurements themselves can introduce additional resource demands. Here, we apply entanglement measurements to the photonic VQE utilizing polarization and path degrees of freedom of a single-photon. In our photonic VQE, entanglement measurements can be deterministically implemented using linear optics, so it takes full advantage of introducing entanglement measurements without additional experimental demands. Moreover, we show that such a setup can mitigate errors in measurement apparatus for a certain Hamiltonian.

SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB We report the experimental verification of nonclassical correlations for an unfiltered spontaneous four wave mixing process in an ensemble of cold two-level atoms, confirming theoretical predictions by Du et al. in 2007 for the violation of a Cauchy-Schwarz inequality in the system, and obtaining R = (1.98 +/- 0.03) not less than or equal to 1. Quantum correlations are observed in a nanoseconds timescale in the interference between the central exciting frequency and sidebands dislocated by the detuning to the atomic resonance. They prevail over the noise background coming from Rayleigh scattering from the same optical transition. These correlations are fragile with respect to processes that disturb the phase of the atomic excitation, but are robust to variations in number of atoms and to increasing light intensities.

TI Semi-device-independent nonstabilizerness certification in the
   prepare-and-measure scenario
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Nonstabilizerness is an essential resource for quantum computational advantage as stabilizer states admit efficient classical simulation. We develop a semi-device-independent framework for certifying nonstabilizer states in prepare-and-measure (PAM) scenarios, relying only on assumptions about the system's dimension. Within this framework, we introduce PAM witnesses that can distinguish stabilizer from nonstabilizer states, and we provide analytical proofs that threshold violations of these witnesses certify nonstabilizerness. In the simplest setting-three preparations, two measurements, and qubit systems-surpassing a specific threshold guarantees that at least one prepared state lies outside the stabilizer polytope, while a stronger violation can certify at least two. We extend this approach by linking it to quantum random access codes, also generalizing our results to qutrit systems and introducing a necessary condition for certifying nonstabilizerness based on state overlaps (Gram matrices). These results offer a set of semi-device-independent tools for practically and systematically verifying nonstabilizer states using PAM inequalities.

TI Improved Variational Quantum Eigensolver Via Quasidynamical Evolution
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB The variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) is a hybrid quantum classical algorithm designed for cur-rent and near-term quantum devices. Despite its initial success, there is a lack of understanding involving several of its key aspects. There are problems with VQE that forbid a favorable scaling towards quan-tum advantage. In order to alleviate the problems, we propose and extensively test a quantum annealing inspired heuristic that supplements VQE. The improved VQE enables an efficient initial state-preparation mechanism, in a recursive manner, for a quasidynamical unitary evolution. We conduct an in-depth scal-ing analysis of finding the ground-state energies with increasing lattice sizes of the Heisenberg model, employing simulations of up to 40 qubits that manipulate the complete state vector. In addition to system-atically finding the ground-state energy, we observe that it avoids barren plateaus, escapes local minima, and works with low-depth circuits. For the current devices, we further propose a benchmarking toolkit using a mean-field model and test it on IBM Q devices. Realistic gate execution times estimate a longer computational time to complete the same computation on a fully functional error-free quantum computer than on a quantum computer emulator implemented on a classical computer. However, our proposal can be expected to help accurate estimations of the ground-state energies beyond 50 qubits when the complete state vector can no longer be stored on a classical computer, thus enabling quantum advantage.

TI Quantum advantage on proof of work
SO ARRAY
AB Proof-of-Work (PoW) is a fundamental underlying technology behind most major blockchain cryptocurrencies. It has been previously pointed out that quantum devices provide a computational advantage in performing PoW in the context of Bitcoin. Here we make the case that this quantum advantage extends not only to all existing PoW mechanisms, but to any possible PoW as well. This has strong consequences regarding both quantum-based attacks on the integrity of the entirety of the blockchain, as well as more legitimate uses of quantum computation for the purpose of mining Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. For the first case, we estimate when these quantum attacks will become feasible, for various cryptocurrencies, and discuss the impact of such attacks. For the latter, we derive a precise formula to calculate the economic incentive for switching to quantum-based cryptocurrency miners. Using this formula, we analyze several test scenarios, and conclude that investing in quantum hardware for cryptocurrency mining has the potential to pay off immensely.

TI Realization of a spin-1/2 Kondo necklace model with magnetic
   field-induced coupling switch
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB The theoretical Kondo necklace model, which simplifies the Kondo lattice model by focusing on spin degrees of freedom, provides a valuable framework for understanding spin-related quantum phenomena. However, it has not been applied to real materials until now. We present a realization of a spin-1/2 anisotropic Kondo necklace model using a complex of radical and Co spins. Electron spin resonance reveals anisotropic g values and an Isingtype exchange interaction with Co spin. The specific heat measurements demonstrate Schottky-type behavior, suggesting a Kondo singlet state with an energy gap in the excitation spectrum. Our findings suggest that a magnetic field can decouple Kondo interactions, unveiling a different mechanism for controlling Kondo coupling. This offers other opportunities for quantum technologies, particularly in the development of tunable qubits for quantum computing and spintronic devices, where precise control over spin interactions is essential.

TI Quantum arbitrary waveform generator
SO SCIENCE ADVANCES
AB Controlling the temporal waveform of light is the key to a versatile light source in classical and quantum electronics. Although pulse shaping of classical light is mature and has been used in various fields, more advanced applications would be realized by a light source that generates arbitrary quantum light with arbitrary temporal waveforms. We call such a device a quantum arbitrary waveform generator (Q-AWG). The Q-AWG must be able to handle various quantum states of light, which are fragile. Thus, the Q-AWG requires a radically different methodology from classical pulse shaping. Here, we invent an architecture of Q-AWGs that can operate semi-deterministically at a repetition rate over gigahertz in principle. We demonstrate its core technology via generating highly nonclassical states with temporal waveforms that have never been realized before. This result would lead to powerful quantum technologies based on Q-AWGs such as practical optical quantum computing.

TI Trade-off relations of quantum resource theory in Heisenberg models
SO PHYSICA SCRIPTA
AB Studying the relations between entanglement and coherence is essential in many quantum information applications. For this, we consider the concurrence, intrinsic concurrence and first-order coherence, and evaluate the proposed trade-off relations between them. In particular, we study the temporal evolution of a general two-qubit XYZ Heisenberg model with asymmetric spin-orbit interaction under decoherence and analyze the trade-off relations of quantum resource theory. For XYZ Heisenberg model, we confirm that the trade-off relation between intrinsic concurrence and first-order coherence holds. Furthermore, we show that the lower bound of intrinsic concurrence is universally valid, but the upper bound is generally not. These relations in Heisenberg models can provide a way to explore how quantum resources are distributed in spins, which may inspire future applications in quantum information processing.

TI Quantum fermions from classical bits
SO PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY A-MATHEMATICAL PHYSICAL
   AND ENGINEERING SCIENCES
AB A simple probabilistic cellular automaton is shown to be equivalent to a relativistic fermionic quantum field theory with interactions. Occupation numbers for fermions are classical bits or Ising spins. The automaton acts deterministically on bit configurations. The genuinely probabilistic character of quantum physics is realized by probabilistic initial conditions. In turn, the probabilistic automaton is equivalent to the classical statistical system of a generalized Ising model. For a description of the probabilistic information at any given time quantum concepts as wave functions and non-commuting operators for observables emerge naturally. Quantum mechanics can be understood as a particular case of classical statistics. This offers prospects to realize aspects of quantum computing in the form of probabilistic classical computing. This article is part of the theme issue 'Quantum technologies in particle physics'.

TI Quantum Phase Estimation Algorithm with Gaussian Spin States
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Quantum phase estimation (QPE) is one of the most important subroutines in quantum computing. In general applications, current QPE algorithms either suffer an exponential time overload or require a set of-notoriously quite fragile-GHZ states. These limitations have so far prevented the demonstration of QPE beyond proof of principles. Here we propose a new QPE algorithm based on a cascade of Gaussian spin states (GSSs) and a suitable adaptive measurement protocol. GSSs are renownedly resilient and have been created experimentally in a variety of platforms, from hundreds of ions up to millions of cold and ultracold neutral atoms. We show that our protocol achieves a QPE sensitivity overcoming previous schemes, including that obtained with GHZ states, scales linearly with time, and is robust against certain sources of noise and decoherence, such as detection noise, in particular. Our work paves the way toward an efficient implementation of the QPE, as well as applications of atomic squeezed states for quantum computation.

In this article, we study how bipartite states may be distributed in the context of a quantum network limited by timing constraints. We explore various tasks that plausibly arise in this context, and characterize the achievability of several of these in settings where only one-way communication is allowed. We provide partial results in the case where two-way communication is allowed. This builds on earlier work on summoning single and bipartite systems.

By controlling the phase of each of the two split laser beams and checking the number of photons at the output, it is possible to determine if the input bits are "not equal" or "not uniform." The phase of the laser light was controlled using an LC device and a half-wave plate, and changes in the interference state of the output light and the number of photons were observed. The voltage application to the LC device is set at the input bit. As a result, the interference state changed according to the input bit, and changes in the number of photons were observed.

TI Post-variational classical quantum transfer learning for binary
   classification
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB We address the limitations of variational quantum circuits (VQCs) in hybrid classical-quantum transfer learning by introducing post-variational strategies, which reduce training overhead and mitigate optimization issues. Our approach Post Variational Classical Quantum Transfer Learning (PVCQTL) includes three designs: (1) modified observable construction, (2) a hybrid approach, and (3) a variational-post-variational combination. We evaluate these on pre-trained models (VGG19, ResNet50, ResNet18, MobileNet) for 4 and 8 qubits, with ResNet50 performing best in deepfake detection. Compared to classical models (MLP, ResNet50) and quantum baselines hybrid quantum classical neural network (HQCNN), classical-quantum transfer learning (CQTL). PVCQTL consistently achieves better accuracy. The modified observable variant reaches 85% accuracy for Deepfake dataset with lower computational cost. To evaluate generalizability, we tested PVCQTL on three additional binary classification datasets, observing improved accuracy on each. We conducted ablation studies to assess the effects of architectural choices on quantum component variations, including the choice of quantum gates, use of fixed ansatz circuits, and observable measurements. Robustness to input noise and sensitivity of the PVCQTL models were examined through ablation studies on learning rate, batch size, and number of qubits. These results demonstrate that PVCQTL offers a measurable improvement over traditional hybrid classical-quantum approaches.

TI Performance of quantum approximate optimization with quantum error
   detection
SO COMMUNICATIONS PHYSICS
AB The quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) is a promising candidate for scaling up to tackle real-world applications. However, achieving better-than-classical performance with QAOA is believed to require fault tolerance. In this paper, we demonstrate a partially fault-tolerant implementation of QAOA using the [[k + 2, k, 2]] "Iceberg" error detection code. We observe that encoding the circuit with the Iceberg code improves the algorithmic performance as compared to the unencoded circuit for problems with up to 20 logical qubits on a trapped-ion quantum computer. Additionally, we propose and calibrate a model for predicting the code performance. We use this model to characterize the limits of the Iceberg code and extrapolate its performance to future hardware with improved error rates. To the best of our knowledge, our results demonstrate the largest universal quantum computing algorithm protected by partially fault-tolerant quantum error detection on practical applications to date.

AB In this paper, we propose a vertical side-channel leakage detection on the decryption function of the third round implementation of CPA-secure public-key encryption scheme underlying CRYSTALS-Kyber, a lattice-based key encapsulation mechanism, which is a candidate to the NIST Post-Quantum Cryptography standardization project. Using a leakage assessment metric, we show that the side-channel information can be efficiently used to pinpoint operations leaking the secret variable and how masking countermeasures can be applied. We detect leakages in the polynomial multiplication between the secret key and the ciphertext. We propose and evaluate two different masking countermeasures, based on additive and multiplicative masking. To the best of our knowledge, the multiplicative masking has not been proposed before as a countermeasure to CRYSTALS-Kyber vulnerabilities. We demonstrate their efficiency and discuss their impact in terms of performance. Our work is beneficial to assess and enhance the security of Post-Quantum Cryptography against advanced vertical side-channel analysis.

TI Quantum-information-theoretical measures to distinguish fermionized
   bosons from noninteracting fermions
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We study the dynamical fermionization of strongly interacting one-dimensional bosons in Tonks-Girardeau limit by solving the time-dependent many-boson Schr & ouml;dinger equation numerically exactly. We establish that the one-body momentum distribution approaches the ideal Fermi gas distribution at the time of dynamical fermionization. The analysis is further complemented by the measures on the two-body level. The dynamical fermionization in the two-body level should be inferred as the presence of a distinct correlation hole along the diagonal of two-body correlation. Investigation of two-body momentum distribution for the strongly interacting bosons clearly exhibits a pattern along the diagonal which is not extinguished at the time of fermionization. Two-body local and nonlocal correlation also clearly distinguish the fermionized bosons from noninteracting fermions. The magnitude of distinguishablity between the two systems is further discussed employing suitable measures of information theory, i.e., the well-known Kullback-Leibler relative entropy and the Jensen-Shannon divergence entropy. We also observe very rich structure in the higher-body density for strongly correlated bosons, whereas noninteracting fermions do not possess any higher-order correlation beyond two-body.

TI Quantum coherence of critical unstable two-level systems
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
AB We study in detail the dynamics of unstable two-level quantum systems by adopting the Bloch-sphere formalism of qubits. By employing the Bloch-vector representation for such unstable qubit systems, we identify a novel class of critical scenarios in which the so-called energy-level and decay-width vectors, E and & UGamma;, are orthogonal to one another, and the parameter r = I & UGamma;I/(2IEI) is less than 1. Most remarkably, we find that critical unstable qubit systems exhibit atypical behaviors like coherence-decoherence oscillations when analyzed in an appropriately defined codecaying frame of the system. In the same frame, a unit Bloch vector b describing a pure critical qubit will sweep out unequal areas during equal intervals of time, while rotating about the vector E. These phenomena emerge beyond the usual oscillatory pattern due to the energy-level difference of the two-level quantum system. Interestingly enough, we observe that these new features will persist even for quasicritical scenarios, in which the vectors E and & UGamma; are not perfectly orthogonal to each other. Applications of our results to quantum information and to unstable meson-antimeson and other systems are discussed.

Herein, we demonstrate a mode-hybridization-based broadband nonlinear frequency conversion on X-cut thin film lithium niobate. With the spontaneous quasi-phase matching and quasi-group-velocity matching being simultaneously satisfied, broadband second-harmonic generation with a 3-dB bandwidth up to 13 nm has been achieved in a micro-racetrack resonator. The same mechanism can work on the frequency conversion of the ultrashort pulse in the bent waveguide structure. This work will be beneficial to on-chip tunable frequency conversion and quantum light source generation on integrated photonic platforms and further enable on-chip large-capacity multiplexing, multichannel optical information processing, and large quantum information networks.

TI Cooper quartets in interacting hybrid superconducting systems
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Cooper quartets represent exotic fermion aggregates describing correlated matter at the basis of charge-4e superconductivity and offer a platform for studying four-body interactions, of interest for topologically protected quantum computing, nuclear matter simulations, and more general strongly correlated matter. Focusing on solidstate systems, we show how to quantum design Cooper quartets in a double-dot system coupled to ordinary superconducting leads through the introduction of an attractive interdot interaction. A fundamentally novel, maximally correlated double-dot ground state, in the form of a superposition of vacuum |0) and four-electron state |4e), emerges as a narrow resonance in a many-body quartet correlator that is accompanied by negligible pair correlations and features a rich phenomenology. The system represents an instance of correlated Andreev matter and the results open the way to the exploration of interaction effects in hybrid superconducting devices, and the study of novel correlated states of matter with ingredients available in a quantum solid-state laboratory.

The contextual extensions of C*-algebras, originally proposed for contextual hidden variables, are generalized to the cones indexed by the contexts and their limit in a category. By abstracting the quantum gravity models as functors, we study the contextual extensions as the categorical limits of these functors in several quantum gravity models. Such contextual extensions of quantum gravity models are useful for building topos-theoretic models of quantum gravity.

TI Chip-Integrated Vortex Manipulation
SO NANO LETTERS
AB The positions of Abrikosov vortices have long been considered as means to encode classical information. Although it is possible to move individual vortices using local probes, the challenge of scalable on-chip vortex-control remains outstanding, especially when considering the demands of controlling multiple vortices. Realization of vortex logic requires means to shuttle vortices reliably between engineered pinning potentials, while concomitantly keeping all other vortices fixed. We demonstrate such capabilities using Nb loops patterned below a NbSe2 layer. SQUID-on-Tip (SOT) microscopy reveals that the loops localize vortices in designated sites to a precision better than 100 nm; they realize "push" and "pull" operations of vortices as far as 3 mu m. Successive application of such operations shuttles a vortex between adjacent loops. Our results may be used as means to integrate vortices in future quantum circuitry. Strikingly, we demonstrate a winding operation, paving the way for future topological quantum computing and simulations.

TI Ultra-efficient generation of time-energy entangled photon pairs in an
   InGaP photonic crystal cavity
SO COMMUNICATIONS PHYSICS
AB The typical approaches to generate heralded single photons rely on parametric processes, with the advantage of generating highly entangled states at the price of a random pair emission. To overcome this limit, degenerate spontaneous Four-Wave-Mixing is a reliable technique which combines two pump photons into a pair of signal and idler photons via Kerr nonlinear optical effect. By exploiting the intrinsic small confinement volume and thermally tuning the resonances of a 20 mu m-long Photonic Crystal cavity, we efficiently generate time-energy entangled photon pairs and heralded single photons at a large maximum on-chip rate of 22 MHz, using 36 mu W of pump power. We measure time-energy entanglement with net visibility up to 96.6 % using 1 second integration time constant. Our measurements demonstrate the viability of Photonic Crystal cavities to act as an alternative and efficient photon pair source for quantum photonics.
   The generation of entangled photon pairs in an integrated platform is important for quantum technologies. This work experimentally demonstrates time-energy entangled photon pair generation from a suspended InGaP photonic crystal cavity with high pair generation rate, using a bichromatic lattice and thermal tuning.

TI Purcell enhancement of single-photon emitters in silicon
SO OPTICA
AB Individual spins that are coupled to telecommunication photons offer unique promise for distributed quantum information processing once a coherent and efficient spin-photon interface can be fabricated at scale. We implement such an interface by integrating erbium dopants into a nanophotonic silicon resonator. We achieve spin-resolved excitation of individual emitters with <0.1 GHz spectral diffusion linewidth. Upon resonant driving, we observe optical Rabi oscillations and single-photon emission with a 78-fold Purcell enhancement. Our results establish a promising platform for quantum networks.

TI Niobium hydride formation in superconducting qubit thin films
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW MATERIALS
AB The formation of nonsuperconducting hydrides in 160-170-nm-thick films of niobium is examined. We identify six elastically distinct orientation relationships e-Nb4H3 takes within the matrix, solid-solution a-NbHx phase. We employ a phase field model to assess the impact of elastic energy induced by the strain of phase transformation on the morphology and transformation dynamics of e precipitates within a thin film. We consider the dimensions of the thin film, crystallographic growth direction, and diffusion rates to predict the timescale of hydride evolution. Leveraging the finite element method, we predict two-dimensional and three-dimensional equilibrium shapes of e-hydrides within a bulk sample and in a thin film that has a traction-free surface. Our results suggest that niobium hydrides migrate to the free surface of the film. Precipitates which reach the free surface coarsen, while precipitates within the film dissolve. Precipitates in both two dimensions and three dimensions experience a repulsive interaction force at the free surface, that is attractive in the bulk, shown in experiment and theory of previous studies.

TI Adiabatic state preparation from general initial states
SO MOLECULAR PHYSICS
AB A variety of quantum computing algorithms exist for the preparation of approximate Hamiltonian ground states. A natural and important question is how these ground-state approximations can be further improved using adiabatic state preparation. Here, we present a heuristic method to carry out adiabatic state preparation starting from a generic initial wavefunction. Given a quantum circuit that prepares the initial wavefunction, and a target Hamiltonian for which one wishes to prepare the ground state, we present an algorithm to construct an adiabatic path between these two states. This method works by approximating a parent Hamiltonian for the initial wavefunction, and the quality of this approximation can be can be checked prior to running the ASP algorithm. We apply this technique to simulate the ground state of water and the lowest-lying multireference singlet state of methylene, using various initial wavefunctions as the starting point of the adiabatic path.

TI Effective light cone and digital quantum simulation of interacting
   bosons
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB The speed limit of information propagation is one of the most fundamental features in non-equilibrium physics. The region of information propagation by finite-time dynamics is approximately restricted inside the effective light cone that is formulated by the Lieb-Robinson bound. To date, extensive studies have been conducted to identify the shape of effective light cones in most experimentally relevant many-body systems. However, the Lieb-Robinson bound in the interacting boson systems, one of the most ubiquitous quantum systems in nature, has remained a critical open problem for a long time. This study reveals a tight effective light cone to limit the information propagation in interacting bosons, where the shape of the effective light cone depends on the spatial dimension. To achieve it, we prove that the speed for bosons to clump together is finite, which in turn leads to the error guarantee of the boson number truncation at each site. Furthermore, we applied the method to provide a provably efficient algorithm for simulating the interacting boson systems. The results of this study settle the notoriously challenging problem and provide the foundation for elucidating the complexity of many-body boson systems.
   Studying bounds on the speed of information propagation across interacting boson systems is notoriously difficult. Here, the authors find tight bounds for both the transport of boson particles and information propagation, for arbitrary time-dependent Bose-Hubbard-type Hamiltonians in arbitrary dimensions.

TI Experimental multi-state quantum discrimination through optical networks
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Developing strategies to effectively discriminate between different quantum states is a fundamental issue in quantum information and communication. The actual realization of generally optimal protocols in this task is often limited by the need of supplemental resources and very complex receivers. We have experimentally implemented two discrimination schemes in a minimum-error scenario based on a receiver featured by a network structure and a dynamical processing of information. The first protocol implemented in our experiment, directly inspired to a recent theoretical proposal, achieves binary optimal discrimination, while the second one provides a novel approach to multi-state quantum discrimination, relying on the dynamical features of the network-like receiver. This strategy exploits the arrival time degree of freedom as an encoding variable, achieving optimal results, without the need for supplemental systems or devices. Our results further reveal the potential of dynamical approaches to quantum state discrimination tasks, providing a possible starting point for efficient alternatives to current experimental strategies.

TI Strong second-harmonic generation by sublattice polarization in
   non-uniformly strained monolayer graphene
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Despite the potential of graphene for building a variety of quantum photonic devices, its centrosymmetric nature forbids the observation of second harmonic generation (SHG) for developing second-order nonlinear devices. To activate SHG in graphene, extensive research efforts have been directed towards disrupting graphene's inversion symmetry using external stimuli like electric fields. However, these methods fail to engineer graphene's lattice symmetry, which is the root cause of the forbidden SHG. Here, we harness strain engineering to directly manipulate graphene's lattice arrangement and induce sublattice polarization to activate SHG. Surprisingly, the SHG signal is boosted 50-fold at low temperatures, which can be explained by resonant transitions between strain-induced pseudo-Landau levels. The second-order susceptibility of strained graphene is found to be larger than that of hexagonal boron nitride with intrinsic broken inversion symmetry. Our demonstration of strong SHG in strained graphene offers promising possibilities for developing high-efficiency nonlinear devices for integrated quantum circuits.
   Nanostructured platforms for efficient nonlinear optics are the building block of next generation integrated photonic devices. Here the authors provide a straightforward method to engineer the lattice symmetry of monolayer graphene, boosting the SHG signal at low temperature.

AB Quantum computers promise to solve important problems faster than conventional computers. However, unleashing this power has been challenging. In particular, design automation runs into (1) the probabilistic nature of quantum computation and (2) exponential requirements for computational resources on non-quantum hardware. In quantum circuit simulation, Decision Diagrams (DDs) have previously shown to reduce the required memory in many important cases by exploiting redundancies in the quantum state. In this paper, we show that this reduction can be amplified by exploiting the probabilistic nature of quantum computers to achieve even more compact representations. Specifically, we propose two new DD-based simulation strategies that approximate the quantum states to attain more compact representations, while, at the same time, allowing the user to control the resulting degradation in accuracy. We also analytically prove the effect of multiple approximations on the attained accuracy and empirically show that the resulting simulation scheme enables speed-ups up to several orders of magnitudes.

TI Interplay among entanglement, measurement incompatibility, and
   nonlocality
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Nonlocality, manifested by the violation of Bell inequalities, indicates entanglement within a joint quantum system. A natural question is how much entanglement is required for a given nonlocal behavior. Here, we explore this question by quantifying entanglement using a family of generalized Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt-type Bell inequalities. Given a Bell-inequality violation, we derive analytical lower bounds on the entanglement of formation, a measure related to entanglement dilution. The bounds also lead to an analytical estimation of the negativity of entanglement. In addition, we consider one-way distillable entanglement tied to entanglement distillation and derive tight numerical estimates. With the additional assumptions of qubit-qubit systems, we find that the relationship between entanglement and measurement incompatibility is not simply a trade-off under a fixed nonlocal behavior. Furthermore, we apply our results to two realistic scenarios-non-maximally entangled and Werner states. We show that one can utilize the nonlocal statistics by optimizing the Bell inequality for better entanglement estimation.

TI Remote preparation and manipulation of squeezed light
SO OPTICS LETTERS
AB Remote state preparation enables one to create and manipulate a quantum state based on the shared entanglement between distant nodes. Here, we experimentally demonstrate remote preparation and manipulation of squeezed light. By performing a homodyne projective measurement on one mode of the continuous variable entangled state at Alice's station, a squeezed state is created at Bob's station. Moreover, rotation and displacement operations are applied on the prepared squeezed state by changing the projective parameters on Alice's state. We also show that the remotely prepared squeezed state is robust against loss and N - 1 squeezed states can be remotely prepared based on an N-mode continuous variable Greenberger-Horne-Zeilingerlike state. Our results verify the entanglement-based model used in security analysis of quantum key distribution with continuous variables and have potential application in remote quantum information processing.

TI A hybrid coupler for directing quantum light emission with high
   radiative Purcell enhancement to a dielectric metasurface lens
SO JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS
AB Quantum photonic technologies such as quantum sensing, metrology, and simulation could be transformatively enabled by the availability of integrated single photon sources with high radiative rates and photon collection efficiencies. We address these challenges for quantum emitters formed from color center defect sites such as those in hexagonal boron nitride, which are promising candidates as single photon sources due to their bright, stable, polarized, and room temperature emission. We report design of a nanophotonic coupler from color center quantum emitters to a dielectric metasurface lens. The coupler is comprised of a hybrid plasmonic-dielectric resonator that achieves a large radiative Purcell enhancement and partial control of far-field radiation. We report radiative Purcell factors up to 285 and photon collection efficiencies up to 89% for a lossless metasurface, applying a continuous hyperboloidal phase-front. Our hybrid plasmonic-dielectric coupler interfacing two nanophotonic elements is a compound optical element, analogous to those found in microscope objective lenses, which combine multiple optical functions into a single component for improved performance.

SO POLYCYCLIC AROMATIC COMPOUNDS
AB 1-Piperoylpiperidine (1-PIP) was crystallized as a single unit by a slow evaporation process, and it was examined using XRD and FT-IR spectroscopy. The centrosymmetric monoclinic structure is confirmed by XRD. The functional groups were determined by experimental FT-IR range from 4000 to 400 cm(-1). Density functional theory was used to do calculations on quantum chemistry on B3LYP/6-311++G (d,p) theory. The vibrational wavenumbers were calculated, and experimentally obtained were assigned and compared. The molecule's reactivity and kinetic stability are revealed via molecular orbital research. The Mulliken atomic charge distribution and molecular electrostatic potential analyses provide additional evidence of the molecule's reactive site. The electronic spectrum was computed through TD-DFT and the electronic transition was attained at & pi;& RARR;& pi;*. The molecule's bioactivity is shown by the natural bond orbital analysis. The efficiency and contribution of interactions between various atoms were evaluated using the Hirshfeld analysis. The DPPH assay was performed to access the antioxidant ability of 1-PIP. The disk diffusion test exhibited the antibacterial efficiency of 1-PIP molecule. The safety profile of 1-PIP was confirmed through physiochemical and pharmacokinetic predictions. In silico docking evaluation was performed for 1-PIP against 10 breast cancer-aided proteins and the higher binding affinity was recorded for NAMPT, which was further investigated through molecular dynamic (MD) simulation. MD simulation for a time period of 50 ns confirmed the stability of 1-PIP bounded NAMPT structure.

TI Binary Subspace Chirps
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION THEORY
AB We describe in detail the interplay between binary symplectic geometry and notions from quantum computation, with the ultimate goal of constructing highly structured codebooks. The Binary Chirps (BCs) are Complex Grassmannian Lines in N = 2(m) dimensions used in deterministic compressed sensing and random/unsourced multiple access in wireless networks. Their entries are fourth roots of unity and can be described in terms of second order Reed-Muller codes. The Binary Subspace Chirps (BSSCs) are a unique collection of BCs of ranks ranging from r = 0 to r = m, embedded in N dimensions according to an on-off pattern determined by a rank r binary subspace. This yields a codebook that is asymptotically 2.38 times larger than the codebook of BCs, has the same minimum chordal distance as the codebook of BCs, and the alphabet is minimally extended from {+/- 1,+/- i} to {+/- 1,+/- i, 0}. Equivalently, we show that BSSCs are stabilizer states, and we characterize them as columns of a well-controlled collection of Clifford matrices. By construction, the BSSCs inherit all the properties of BCs, which in turn makes them good candidates for a variety of applications. For applications in wireless communication, we use the rich algebraic structure of BSSCs to construct a low complexity decoding algorithm that is reliable against Gaussian noise. In simulations, BSSCs exhibit an error probability comparable or slightly lower than BCs, both for single-user and multi-user transmissions.

SO NANOPHOTONICS
AB Two-photon interference is an important effect that is tightly related to the quantum nature of light. Recently, it has been shown that the photon bunching from the Hong-Ou-Mandel (HOM) effect can be used for quantum imaging in which sample properties (reflection/transmission amplitude, phase delay, or polarization) can be characterized at the pixel-by-pixel level. In this work, we perform Jones matrix imaging for an unknown object based on two-photon interference. By using a reference metasurface with panels of known polarization responses in pairwise coincidence measurements, the object's polarization responses at each pixel can be retrieved from the dependence of the coincidence visibility as a function of the reference polarization. The post-selection of coincidence images with specific reference polarization in our approach eliminates the need in switching the incident polarization and thus parallelized optical measurements for Jones matrix characterization. The parallelization in preparing input states, prevalent in any quantum algorithms, is an advantage of adopting two-photon interference in Jones matrix imaging. We believe our work points to the usage of metasurfaces in biological and medical imaging in the quantum optical regime.

TI Exotic symmetry breaking properties of self-dual fracton spin models
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Fracton codes host unconventional topological states of matter and are promising for fault -tolerant quantum computation due to their large coding space and strong resilience against decoherence and noise. In this paper, we investigate the ground -state properties and phase transitions of two prototypical self -dual fracton spin models-the tetrahedral Ising model and the fractal Ising model-which correspond to error -correction procedures for the representative fracton codes of type I and type II, the checkerboard code and the Haah's code, respectively, in the error -free limit. They are endowed with exotic symmetry -breaking properties that contrast sharply with the spontaneous breaking of global symmetries and deconfinement transition of gauge theories. To show these unconventional behaviors, which are associated with subdimensional symmetries, we construct and analyze the order parameters, correlators, and symmetry generators for both models. Notably, the tetrahedral Ising model acquires an extended semilocal ordering moment, while the fractal Ising model fits into a polynomial ring representation and leads to a fractal order parameter. Numerical studies combined with analytical tools show that both models experience a strong first -order phase transition with an anomalous L -(D-1) scaling, despite the fractal symmetry of the latter. Our paper provides a unique understanding of subdimensional symmetry breaking and makes an important step for studying quantum -error -correction properties of the checkerboard and Haah's codes.

TI Perovskite Quantum Dots: Fabrication, Degradation, and Enhanced
   Performance Across Solar Cells, Optoelectronics, and Quantum
   Technologies
SO CARBON ENERGY
AB Metal halide perovskites exhibit excellent absorption properties, high carrier mobility, and remarkable charge transfer ability, showcasing significant potential as light harvesters in new-generation photovoltaic and optoelectronic technologies. Their development has seen unprecedented growth since their discovery. Similar to metal halide perovskite developments, perovskite quantum dots (PQDs) have demonstrated significant versatility in terms of shape, dimension, bandgap, and optical properties, making them suitable for the development of optoelectronic devices. This review discusses various fabrication methods of PQDs, delves into their degradation mechanisms, and explores strategies for enhancing their performance with their applications in a variety of technological fields. Their elevated surface-to-volume ratio highlights their importance in increasing solar cell efficiency. PQDs are also essential for increasing the performance of perovskite solar cells, photodetectors, and light-emitting diodes, which makes them indispensable for solid-state lighting applications. PQDs' unique optoelectronic characteristics make them suitable for sophisticated sensing applications, giving them greater capabilities in this field. Furthermore, PQDs' resistive switching behavior makes them a good fit for applications in memory devices. PQDs' vast potential also encompasses the fields of quantum optics and communication, especially for uses like nanolasers and polarized light detectors. Even though stability and environmental concerns remain major obstacles, research efforts are being made to actively address these issues, enabling PQDs to obtain their full potential in device applications. Simply put, understanding PQDs' real potential lies in overcoming obstacles and utilizing their inherent qualities.

TI On the Monotonicity of Relative Entropy: A Comparative Study of Petz's
   and Uhlmann's Approaches
SO ENTROPY
AB We revisit the monotonicity of relative entropy under the action of quantum channels, a foundational result in quantum information theory. Among the several available proofs, we focus on those by Petz and Uhlmann, which we reformulate within a unified, finite-dimensional operator-theoretic framework. In the first part, we examine Petz's strategy, identify a subtle flaw in his original use of Jensen's contractive operator inequality, and point out how it was corrected to restore the validity of his line of reasoning. In the second part, we develop Uhlmann's approach, which is based on interpolations of positive sesquilinear forms and applies automatically to non-invertible density operators. By comparing these two approaches, we highlight their complementary strengths: Petz's method is more direct and clear; Uhlmann's method is more abstract and general. Our treatment aims to clarify the mathematical structure underlying the monotonicity of relative entropy and to make these proofs more accessible to a broader audience interested in both the foundations and applications of quantum information theory.

TI Quantum CZ gates on a single gradient metasurface
SO LIGHT-SCIENCE & APPLICATIONS
AB For the requirement of quantum photonic integration in on-chip quantum information, we propose a scheme to realize quantum controlled-Z (CZ) gates through single gradient metasurface. Using its parallel beam-splitting feature, i.e., a series of connected beamsplitters with the same splitting ratio, one metasurface can support a polarization encoding CZ gate or path encoding CZ gate, several independent CZ gates, and cascade CZ gates. Taking advantage that the path of output state is locked by the polarization of input state, path encoding CZ gates can efficiently filter out bit-flip errors coming from beam-splitting processes. These CZ gates also have the potential to detect quantum errors and generate high-dimensional entanglement through multi-degree-of-freedom correlation on metasurfaces. By integrating quantum CZ gates into a single metasurface, our results open an avenue for high-density and multifunctional integration of quantum devices.

AB In recent years, malicious software has risen in both number and effectiveness of attacks, particularly due to the increased utilization of machine learning and even quantum computing by cybercriminals. This research addresses the disparity between these rapidly progressing technologies and the lack of advanced cybersecurity systems in nearly half of all American small businesses by creating accessible malware detection software on Google Colaboratory, a cloud-based software hosting service. Neural networks (NN), a common machine learning model for cybersecurity tasks, were created with both classical and simulated quantum computing using Python libraries, starter code, and an Android malware dataset. The average F1 score of accuracy of the classical NN, 0.6928, was slightly higher than the average F1 score of the quantum NN, 0.6406. However, a two-sample t-test found that the true means of both populations of F1 scores were statistically equal, indicating no difference in accuracy between classical and simulated quantum neural networks at this time. Differences in resource efficiency could not accurately be assessed, because although the quantum neural network was simulated on a classical computer and had a much higher runtime, a quantum neural network running on a quantum computer can be significantly faster than a classical neural network running on a classical computer for certain types of problems; this is because of unique quantum properties like superposition and entanglement that allow complex calculations to be performed much more efficiently. This research does find, however, that features related to the services or transactions of Android applications had higher correlations with malicious/benign software status, the change in runtime of a classical NN on Google Colaboratory was roughly linear over a large range of sample sizes, and two iterations of text segments and comments within the software improved the usability of the tool. Overall, the study develops a methodology for creating and evaluating open-source quantum and classical machine learning cybersecurity software for small businesses.

TI Optimal tests of genuine multipartite nonlocality
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB We propose an optimal and efficient numerical test for witnessing genuine multipartite nonlocality based on a geometric approach. In particular, we consider two non-equivalent models of local hidden variables, namely the Svetlichny and the no-signaling bilocal models. While our knowledge concerning these models is well established for Bell-type scenarios involving two measurement settings per party, the general case based on an arbitrary number of settings is a considerably more challenging task and very little work has been done in this field. In this paper, we applied such general tests to detect and characterize genuine n-way nonlocal correlations for various states of three qubits and qutrits. Apart from the fundamental problem of characterizing genuine multipartite nonlocal correlations, the extension of the number of measurements beyond two is also of practical importance. As a measure of nonlocality, we use the probability of violation of local realism under randomly sampled observables, and the strength of nonlocality, described by the resistance to white noise admixture. In particular, we analyze to what extent the Bell-type scenario involving two measurement settings can be used to certify genuine n-way nonlocal correlations generated for more general models. In addition, we propose a simple procedure to detect such nonlocal correlations for randomly chosen settings with an efficiency of up to 100%. Due to its near-perfect efficiency, our method may open new possibilities in device-independent quantum cryptography applications where strong nonlocality between all partners is required.

TI Quantum Transfer Learning with Adversarial Robustness for Classification
   of High-Resolution Image Datasets
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB The application of quantum machine learning to large-scale high-resolution image datasets is not yet possible due to the limited number of qubits and relatively high level of noise in the current generation of quantum devices. In this work, this challenge is addressed by proposing a quantum transfer learning (QTL) architecture that integrates quantum variational circuits with a classical machine learning network pre-trained on ImageNet dataset. Through a systematic set of simulations over a variety of image datasets such as Ants & Bees, CIFAR-10, and Road Sign Detection, the superior performance of the QTL approach over classical and quantum machine learning without involving transfer learning is demonstrated. Furthermore, the adversarial robustness of QTL architecture with and without adversarial training is evaluated, confirming that our QTL method is adversarially robust against data manipulation attacks and outperforms classical methods.

TI Analytically Solvable Model for Qubit-Mediated Energy Transfer between
   Quantum Batteries
SO ENTROPY
AB The coherent energy transfer between two identical two-level systems is investigated. Here, the first quantum system plays the role of a charger, while the second can be seen as a quantum battery. Firstly, a direct energy transfer between the two objects is considered and then compared to a transfer mediated by an additional intermediate two-level system. In this latter case, it is possible to distinguish between a two-step process, where the energy is firstly transferred from the charger to the mediator and only after from the mediator to the battery, and a single-step in which the two transfers occurs simultaneously. The differences between these configurations are discussed in the framework of an analytically solvable model completing what recently discussed in literature.

TI Quantum capacities of transducers
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB High-performance quantum transducers, which faithfully convert quantum information between disparate physical carriers, are essential in quantum science and technology. Different figures of merit, including efficiency, bandwidth, and added noise, are typically used to characterize the transducers' ability to transfer quantum information. Here we utilize quantum capacity, the highest achievable qubit communication rate through a channel, to define a single metric that unifies various criteria of a desirable transducer. Using the continuous-time quantum capacities of bosonic pure-loss channels as benchmarks, we investigate the optimal designs of generic quantum transduction schemes implemented by transmitting external signals through a coupled bosonic chain. With physical constraints on the maximal coupling rate g(max), the highest continuous-time quantum capacity Q(max)approximate to 31.4g(max) is achieved by transducers with a maximally flat conversion frequency response, analogous to Butterworth electric filters. We further investigate the effect of thermal noise on the performance of transducers.

TI Floquet integrability and long-range entanglement generation in the
   one-dimensional quantum Potts model
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB We develop a Floquet protocol for long-range entanglement generation in the one-dimensional quantum Potts model, which generalizes the transverse-filed Ising model by allowing each spin to have n > 2 states. We focus on the case of n = 3, so that the model describes a chain of qutrits. The suggested protocol creates qutrit Bell-like pairs with nonlocal long-range entanglement that spans over the entire chain. We then conjecture that the proposed Floquet protocol is integrable and explicitly construct a few first nontrivial conserved quantities that commute with the stroboscopic evolution operator. Our analysis of the Floquet integrability relies on the deep connection between the quantum Potts model and a much broader class of models described by the Temperley-Lieb algebra. We work at the purely algebraic level and our results on Floquet integrability are valid for any representation of the Temperley-Lieb algebra. We expect that our findings can be probed with present experimental facilities using Rydberg programmable quantum simulators and can find various applications in quantum technologies.

TI Composability of global phase invariant distance and its application to
   approximation error management
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS COMMUNICATIONS
AB Many quantum algorithms can be written as a composition of unitaries, some of which can be exactly synthesized by a universal fault-tolerant gate set like Clifford+T, while others can be approximately synthesized. One task of a quantum compiler is to synthesize each approximately synthesizable unitary up to some approximation error, such that the error of the overall unitary remains bounded by a certain amount. In this paper we consider the case when the errors are measured in the global phase invariant distance. Apart from deriving a relation between this distance and the Frobenius norm, we show that this distance composes. If a unitary is written as a composition (product and tensor product) of other unitaries, we derive bounds on the error of the overall unitary as a function of the errors of the composed unitaries. Our bound is better than the sum-of-error bound, derived by BernsteinVazirani(1997), for the operator norm. This builds the intuition that working with the global phase invariant distance might give us a lower resource count while synthesizing quantum circuits. Next we consider the following problem. Suppose we are given a decomposition of a unitary, that is, the unitary is expressed as a composition of other unitaries. We want to distribute the errors in each component such that the resource-count (specifically T-count) is optimized. We consider the specific case when the unitary can be decomposed such that the R-z(theta) gates are the only approximately synthesizable component. We prove analytically that for both the operator norm and global phase invariant distance, the error should be distributed equally among these components (given some approximations). The optimal number of T-gates obtained by using the global phase invariant distance is less than what is obtained using the operator norm. Furthermore, we show that in case of approximate Quantum Fourier Transform, the error obtained by pruning rotation gates is less when measured in this distance, rather than the operator norm.

TI Standard model physics and the digital quantum revolution: thoughts
   about the interface
SO REPORTS ON PROGRESS IN PHYSICS
AB Advances in isolating, controlling and entangling quantum systems are transforming what was once a curious feature of quantum mechanics into a vehicle for disruptive scientific and technological progress. Pursuing the vision articulated by Feynman, a concerted effort across many areas of research and development is introducing prototypical digital quantum devices into the computing ecosystem available to domain scientists. Through interactions with these early quantum devices, the abstract vision of exploring classically-intractable quantum systems is evolving toward becoming a tangible reality. Beyond catalyzing these technological advances, entanglement is enabling parallel progress as a diagnostic for quantum correlations and as an organizational tool, both guiding improved understanding of quantum many-body systems and quantum field theories defining and emerging from the standard model. From the perspective of three domain science theorists, this article compiles thoughts about the interface on entanglement, complexity, and quantum simulation in an effort to contextualize recent NISQ-era progress with the scientific objectives of nuclear and high-energy physics.

AB Cryo-CMOS characterization, modeling, and development have significantly progressed to help overcome the interconnection bottleneck between qubits and the readout interface of quantum computers. Nevertheless, available compact models for circuit design fail to predict the detrimental deviation of 1/f noise from the expected T scaling observed at cryogenic temperatures.
   In this paper, we extensively characterize noise on a commercial 28 nm CMOS technology as well as on Ge channel devices at temperatures ranging from 370 K down to 4 K. Our investigations give fundamental insights into the origin of the excess 1/f noise at low temperatures by excluding electron heating and bulk dielectric defects as possible causes. We show further evidence for a strong correlation between the excess 1/f noise and the saturation of the subthreshold swing (SS). A plausible cause of the excess noise is found in disorder-induced states in the channel acting as new trapping centers at cryogenic temperatures. Random telegraph noise (RTN) waveforms and power spectral density (PSD) measurements on small area MOSFETs support this explanation.

TI Optimized architectures for universal quantum state transformations
   using photonic path and polarization
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB An arbitrary lossless transformation in high-dimensional (HD) quantum space can be decomposed into elementary operations which are easy to implement, and an effective decomposition algorithm is important for constructing HD systems. Here, we present two optimized architectures to effectively realize an arbitrary unitary transformation by using the photonic path and polarization based on the existing decomposition algorithm. In the first architecture, the number of required interferometers is reduced by half compared with previous works. In the second architecture, by using the HD X gate, all the elementary operations are transferred to the operations which act locally on the photonic polarization in the same path. Such an architecture could be of significance in polarization-based applications. Both architectures maintain the symmetric layout. Our work facilitates the optical implementation of HD transformations and could have potential applications in HD quantum computation and quantum communication.

TI Quantum nonlocality evolution for two entangled mesoscopic fields under
   decoherence
SO COMMUNICATIONS IN THEORETICAL PHYSICS
AB Investigation of the nonlocality evolution of entangled mesoscopic fields under decoherence not only is important for understanding the quantum-classical transition, but also has relevance to quantum communication and quantum computation protocols based on continuous variables. According to previous formulations of Bell inequalities, the system loses nonlocal features far before the disappearance of entanglement. We here construct a new version of Bell signal based on rotated and displaced on-off correlations, with which the Bell inequality is violated as long as there remains entanglement and the field state components keep quasiorthogonal. Consequently, the nonlocal character revealed by our formulation decays much slower compared with those based on previous ones. More importantly, there exists a wide regime where the Bell inequality is restored with previous formulations but remains to be violated based on our correlation operators.

TI VECTOR-DRIVEN LOGIC AND STRUCTURE FOR TESTING AND DEDUCTIVE FAULT
   SIMULATION
SO RADIO ELECTRONICS COMPUTER SCIENCE CONTROL
AB Context. It is known that data structures are decisive for the creation of efficient parallel algorithms and high-performance computing devices. Therefore, the development of mathematically perfect and technologically simple data structures takes about 80 percent of the design time, when about 20 percent of time and material resources are spent on algorithms and their hardware-software coding. This lead to search for such primitives of data structures that will significantly simplify the parallel high-performance algorithms which are working on them. Models and methods for testing and simulation of digital systems are proposed, which containing certain advantages of quantum computing in terms of implementation of vector qubit data structures in technology of classical computational processes.
   Objective. The goal of the work is development of an innovative technology for qubit-vector synthesis and deductive analysis of tests for their verification based on vector data structures that greatly simplify algorithms that can be embedded as BIST components in digital systems on chips.
   Method. The deductive faults simulation is used to obtain analytical expressions focused on transporting fault lists through a functional or logical element based on the xor-operation, which serves as a measure of similarity-difference between a test, a function and faults which is specified in the same way in one of the formats - a table, graph, equation. A binary vector is proposed as the most technologically advanced primitive of data structures for setting logical functionality for the purpose of parallel synthesis and analysis of digital systems. The parallelism of solving combinatorial problems is a physical property of quantum computing, which in classical computing, for parallel simulation and faults diagnostics, is provided by unitary-coded data structures due to excess memory.
   Results. 1) A method of analytical synthesis of deductive logic for functional elements on the gate level and register transfer level has been developed. 2) A deductive processor for faults simulation based on transporting input lists or faults vectors to external outputs of digital circuits was proposed. 3) The qubit-vector form of logic setting and methods of qubit synthesis of deductive equations for faults simulation were described. 4) A qubit-vector method for the tests' synthesis which is using derivatives calculated by vector coverage of logic has been developed. 5) Models and methods verification is performed on test examples in the software implementation of structures and algorithms.
   Conclusions. The scientific novelty lies in the new paradigm of the technology for the synthesis of deductive RTL logic based on metric test equation, which forms the. A vector form for structures description is introduced, which makes it possible to apply wellknown technologies for the synthesis and analysis of logical circuits tests to effectively solve the problems of graph structures testing and state machine models of digital devices. The practical significance is reflected in the examples of analytical synthesis of deductive logic for functional elements on gate level and register transfer level. A deductive processor for faults simulation which is focused on implementation as a BIST tool, which is used in online testing, simulation and fault diagnosis for digital systems on chips is proposed. A qubit-vector form of the digital systems description is proposed, which surpasses the existing methods of computing devices development in terms of the metric: manufacturability, compactness, speed and quality. A software application has been developed that implements the main testing, simulation and diagnostics services which are used in the educational process to study the advantages of qubit-vector data structures and algorithms. The computational complexity of synthesis processes and deductive formulas for logic and their usage in fault simulation are given.

TI What can we Learn from Quantum Convolutional Neural Networks?
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB Quantum machine learning (QML) shows promise for analyzing quantum data. A notable example is the use of quantum convolutional neural networks (QCNNs), implemented as specific types of quantum circuits, to recognize phases of matter. In this approach, ground states of many-body Hamiltonians are prepared to form a quantum dataset and classified in a supervised manner using only a few labeled examples. However, this type of dataset and model differs fundamentally from typical QML paradigms based on feature maps and parameterized circuits. In this study, how models utilizing quantum data can be interpreted through hidden feature maps, where physical features are implicitly embedded via ground-state feature maps is demonstrated. By analyzing selected examples as case studies for understanding QCNNs, it is shown that high performance in quantum phase recognition comes from generating a highly effective basis set with sharp features at critical points. The learning process adapts the measurement to create sharp decision boundaries. The analysis highlights improved generalization when working with quantum data, particularly in the limited-shots regime. Furthermore, translating these insights into the domain of quantum scientific machine learning, it is demonstrated that ground-state feature maps can be applied to fluid dynamics problems, expressing shock wave solutions with good generalization and proven trainability.

TI A Review on High-Frequency Trading Forecasting Methods: Opportunity and
   Challenges for Quantum Based Method
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB High frequency trading, often known as HFT, is a subset of algorithmic trading, which is one of the most significant improvements to the trading environment in recent years. Algorithmic trading gives traders the ability to trade or receive orders within extremely brief time intervals, such as minutes or seconds based. The very nature of high-frequency trading necessitates the use of high-speed data feeds, which deliver information in real time as well as trade executions for high-frequency traders. Due to the unpredictable nature of the market, several different methods are utilised in order to forecast the HFT time series. However none of these methods have been demonstrated to be a consistently acceptable forecast tool. The majority of HFT trading is conducted using traditional arbitrage-based methods.The conventional method of forecasting using time series does not have the capability to take into account seasonality or outliers in a dataset. The HFT time series data is consistently expanding from day to day, thereby becoming big and enormous. To solve this problem, we require a model that is both more precise and less time-consuming. The purpose of this paper work is to investigate historical models, contemporary models and hypothetical future models that can be used to anticipate HFT time series. Within the domain of HFT forecasting where accuracy and productivity are of the utmost importance, it also becomes critical to investigate state-of-the-art technologies. In light of the inherent difficulties that classical computing methods encounter when confronted with the intricacies of time series data, our focus shifts to quantum computing as a prospective resolution. This undertaking is driven by the imperative to confront prevailing obstacles in the field of forecasting, including enhancing precision, managing extensive datasets and alleviating the consequences of noise and uncertainty.The progression of quantum technologies is expected to bring significant changes that will enhance the reliability, precision and scalability of forecasting methodologies. The synergy between quantum computing and HFT forecasting holds the promise of reshaping how we approach and derive insights from time-varying datasets. The exploration and use of quantum computing for HFT forecasting marks a significant stride toward overcoming current limitations.

TI Unsupervised beyond-standard-model event discovery at the LHC with a
   novel quantum autoencoder
SO QUANTUM MACHINE INTELLIGENCE
AB This study explores the potential of unsupervised anomaly detection for identifying physics beyond the standard model that may appear at proton collisions at the Large Hadron Collider. We introduce a novel quantum autoencoder circuit ansatz that is specifically designed for this task and demonstrates superior performance compared to previous approaches. To assess its robustness, we evaluate the quantum autoencoder on various types of new physics 'signal' events and varying problem sizes. Additionally, we develop classical autoencoders that outperform previously proposed quantum autoencoders but remain outpaced by the new quantum ansatz, despite its significantly reduced number of trainable parameters. Finally, we investigate the properties of quantum autoencoder circuits, focusing on entanglement and magic. We introduce a novel metric in the context of parameterised quantum circuits, stabiliser 2-R & eacute;nyi entropy to quantify magic, along with the previously studied Meyer-Wallach measure for entanglement. Intriguingly, both metrics decreased throughout the training process along with the decrease in the loss function. This appears to suggest that models preferentially learn parameters that reduce (but not minimise) these metrics. This study highlights the potential utility of quantum autoencoders in searching for physics beyond the standard model at the Large Hadron Collider and opens exciting avenues for further research into the role of entanglement and magic in quantum machine learning more generally.

TI Spin-Spacetime Censorship
SO ANNALEN DER PHYSIK
AB Quantum entanglement and relativistic causality are key concepts in theoretical works seeking to unify quantum mechanics and gravity. In this article, a gedanken experiment that couples the spin to spacetime is proposed, and is then analyzed in the context of quantum information by using different approaches to quantum gravity. Both classical gravity theory and certain quantum theories predict that around a spin-half particle, the spherical symmetry of spacetime is broken by its magnetic field or merely by its intrinsic angular momentum. It is asserted that any spin-related deviation from spherical symmetry, upon appropriate measurement, can violate relativistic causality and quantum no-cloning. To avoid these violations, the measurable spacetime around the particle's rest frame shall typically remain spherically symmetric, potentially as a back-action by the act of a covariant measurement, or due to a quantized spin-dependence of the magnetic field. This way, this gedanken experiment suggests a censorship mechanism preventing the possibility of spacetime-based spin detection, which can shed light on the interface between quantum mechanics and gravity. Since this proposed gedanken experiment is independent of any specific theory, it is suitable for testing the coupling of quantum matter and spacetime in present and future candidate theories of quantum gravity.

TI Current trends in global quantum metrology
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS A-MATHEMATICAL AND THEORETICAL
AB Quantum sensors are now universally acknowledged as one of the most promising near-term quantum technologies. The traditional formulation of quantum sensing introduces a concrete bound on ultimate precision through the so-called local sensing framework, in which a significant knowledge of prior information about the unknown parameter value is implicitly assumed. Moreover, the framework provides a systematic approach for optimizing the sensing protocol. In contrast, the paradigm of global sensing aims to find a precision bound for parameter estimation in the absence of such prior information. In recent years, vigorous research has been pursued to describe the contours of global quantum estimation. Here, we review some of these emerging developments. These developments are both in the realm of finding ultimate precision bounds with respect to appropriate figures of merit in the global sensing paradigm, as well as in the search for algorithms that achieve these bounds. We categorize these developments into two largely mutually exclusive camps; one employing Bayesian updating and the other seeking to generalize the frequentist picture of local sensing towards the global paradigm. In the first approach, in order to achieve the best performance, one has to optimize the measurement settings adaptively. In the second approach, the measurement setting is fixed, however the challenge is to identify this fixed measurement optimally.

TI Microscopic parametrizations for gate set tomography under coloured

SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Gate set tomography (GST) allows for a self-consistent characterization of noisy quantum information processors (QIPs). The standard approach treats QIPs as black boxes only constrained by the laws of physics, attaining full generality at a considerable resource cost: numerous circuits must be run in order to amplify each of the gate set parameters. In this work, we show that a microscopic parametrization of quantum gates under time-correlated noise on the driving phase, motivated by recent experiments with trapped-ion gates, enables a more efficient version of GST. Adopting the formalism of filter functions over the noise spectral densities, we discuss the minimal parametrizations of the gate set that include the effect of non-Markovian quantum evolutions during the individual gates. We compare the estimated gate sets obtained by our method and the standard long-sequence GST, discussing their accuracies and showcasing the advantages of the parametrized approach in terms of the sampling complexity.

In particular, we focus on permutation synchronization which involves solving a non-convex optimization problem in discrete variables. We start by formulating synchronization into a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization problem (QUBO). While such formulation respects the binary nature of the problem, ensuring that the result is a set of permutations requires extra care. Hence, we: (i) show how to insert permutation constraints into a QUBO problem and (ii) solve the constrained QUBO problem on the current generation of the adiabatic quantum computers D-Wave. Thanks to the quantum annealing, we guarantee global optimality with high probability while sampling the energy landscape to yield confidence estimates. Our proofof-concepts realization on the adiabatic D-Wave computer demonstrates that quantum machines offer a promising way to solve the prevalent yet difficult synchronization problems.

TI Ensuring information security resilience in Digital-enabled Construction
   Projects (DCP) through quantum security technologies
SO AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION
AB Ensuring information security resilience in Digital-enabled Construction Projects (DCPs) is challenging. This is due to the presence of various protocols, the participation of multiple organizations, and the extensive exchange of dynamic and static information across complex networks. Traditional security measures are often reactive, static, and fragmented, and insufficient. This paper explores quantum security technologies to proactively address information confidentiality, integrity, and availability (CIA) challenges in DCPs. A mixed-method review combining quantitative scientometric analysis and qualitative literature review was conducted, with findings validated through expert interviews and a focus group. The research proposes the Adaptive Quantum-Classical Security (AQCS) framework, demonstrating how quantum cryptography, communication, networks, and optimization can enhance proactive security in DCPs. AQCS facilitates gradual adoption, improving information resilience while minimizing workflow disruption, financial losses, and operational risks. This paper applies quantum security technologies to construction, introducing the AQCS framework for integrating quantum advancements into DCPs.

AB Strong light-matter interaction plays a central role in realizing quantum photonic technologies. The entanglement state, which results from the hybridization of excitons and cavity photons, forms the foundation of quantum information science. In this work, an entanglement state is achieved by manipulating the mode coupling between surface lattice resonance and quantum emitter into the strong coupling regime. At the same time, a Rabi splitting of 40 meV is observed. A full quantum model based on the Heisenberg picture is used to describe this unclassical phenomenon, and it perfectly explains the interaction and dissipation process. In addition, the observed concurrency degree of the entanglement state is 0.5, presenting the quantum nonlocality. This work effectively contributes to the understanding of nonclassical quantum effects arising from strong coupling and will intrigue more interesting potential applications in quantum optics.

TI Efficient Quantum Private Comparison Based on GHZ States
SO ENTROPY
AB Quantum private comparison (QPC) is a fundamental cryptographic protocol that allows two parties to compare the equality of their private inputs without revealing any information about those inputs to each other. In recent years, QPC protocols utilizing various quantum resources have been proposed. However, these QPC protocols have lower utilization of quantum resources and qubit efficiency. To address this issue, we propose an efficient QPC protocol based on GHZ states, which leverages the unique properties of GHZ states and rotation operations to achieve secure and efficient private comparison. The secret information is encoded in the rotation angles of rotation operations performed on the received quantum sequence transmitted along the circular mode. This results in the multiplexing of quantum resources and enhances the utilization of quantum resources. Our protocol does not require quantum key distribution (QKD) for sharing a secret key to ensure the security of the inputs, resulting in no consumption of quantum resources for key sharing. One GHZ state can be compared to three bits of classical information in each comparison, leading to qubit efficiency reaching 100%. Compared with the existing QPC protocol, our protocol does not require quantum resources for sharing a secret key. It also demonstrates enhanced performance in qubit efficiency and the utilization of quantum resources.

TI A performance evaluation framework for post-quantum TLS
SO FUTURE GENERATION COMPUTER SYSTEMS-THE INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ESCIENCE
AB Quantum computers pose a significant threat to widely used cryptographic schemes, making it crucial to urgently shift to post-quantum protocols that ensure the long-term security of communications. This paper presents a framework for facilitating the transition to a quantum-resistant web by enabling the evaluation of the impact of integrating post-quantum and hybrid cryptographic primitives in the TLS protocol. By leveraging the OpenSSL library, the framework enables the seamless evaluation and comparison of key encapsulation mechanisms (KEMs) and signature schemes provided by the Open Quantum Safe project. The proposed framework is used to analyze different TLS configurations involving classic, hybrid and post-quantum primitives, with a focus on those selected by NIST. The study concentrates on evaluating the performance impact and the data overhead introduced by configurations involving primitives at different security levels. It starts by benchmarking standalone cryptographic primitives and continues with the evaluation of TLS configurations with hybrid and post-quantum KEMs under controlled network conditions, as this is the first natural step for a transition to a quantum-safe TLS. An impact analysis on real-world scenarios follows. Finally, our evaluation concentrates on providing insight into the cost of shifting to TLS configurations involving only hybrid or post-quantum primitives.

AB Persistent homology, a powerful mathematical tool for data analysis, summarizes the shape of data through tracking topological features across changes in different scales. Classical algorithms for persistent homology are often constrained by running times and memory requirements that grow exponentially on the number of data points. To surpass this problem, two quantum algorithms of persistent homology have been developed based on two different approaches. However, both of these quantum algorithms consider a data set in the form of a point cloud, which can be restrictive considering that many data sets come in the form of time series. In this paper, we alleviate this issue by establishing a quantum Takens's delay embedding algorithm, which turns a time series into a point cloud by considering a pertinent embedding into a higher dimensional space. Having this quantum transformation of time series to point clouds, then one may use a quantum persistent homology algorithm to extract the topological features from the point cloud associated with the original times series.

TI Single atomic layer quantum holography
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Quantum metasurfaces composed of subwavelength two-dimensional atomic arrays hold great promise as a practical and scalable atom-photon interface. However, these quantum metasurfaces are limited to amplitude control of photonic states thereby restricting the quantum information processing task they can implement. In this work, we present a method that enables precise control over the phase distribution of quantum photonic states. We achieve this by developing a quantum holography technique, which involves preparing a superposition of holograms and leveraging both electromagnetically induced transparency and long-range Rydberg interactions. Our method enables encoding of arbitrary recoverable images that are entangled with the atomic array degrees of freedom rapidly on the order of microseconds. Furthermore, we extend our analysis to include many-body atomphoton entangled states by establishing a quantitative mapping between the atomic and photonic states. Finally, we discuss the experimental realization of our approach, potential error mechanisms, and practical quantum optics applications.

TI Optical coherence properties of Kramers' rare-earth ions at the
   nanoscale for quantum applications
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB Rare Earth (RE) ion doped nanomaterials are promising candidates for a range of quantum technology applications. Among RE ions, the so-called Kramers' ions possess spin transitions in the GHz range at low magnetic fields, which allows for high-bandwidth multimode quantum storage, fast qubit operations as well as interfacing with superconducting circuits. They also present relevant optical transitions in the infrared. In particular, Er3+ has an optical transition in the telecom band, while Nd3+ presents a high-emission-rate transition close to 890 nm. In this paper, we measure spectroscopic properties that are of relevance to using these materials in quantum technology applications. We find the inhomogeneous linewidth to be 10.7 GHz for Er3+ and 8.2 GHz for Nd3+, and the excited state lifetime T-1 to be 13.68 ms for Er3+ and 540 mu s for Nd3+. We study the dependence of homogeneous linewidth on temperature for both samples, with the narrowest linewidth being 379 kHz (T-2 = 839 ns) for Er3+ measured at 3 K, and 62 kHz (T-2 = 5.14 mu s) for Nd3+ measured at 1.6 K. Further, we investigate time-dependent homogeneous linewidth broadening due to spectral diffusion and the dependence of the homogeneous linewidth on magnetic field to get additional clarity of mechanisms that can influence the coherence time. In light of our results, we discuss two applications: single qubit-state readout and a Fourier-limited single photon source.

TI Certifying asymmetry in the configuration of three qubits
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB Symmetry restrictions limit the types of tasks that can be achieved with a given set of quantum states. Therefore, any breaking of these symmetries could potentially be exploited as a resource for quantum communication. Here we demonstrate this operationally by certifying asymmetry in the configuration of the Bloch vectors of a set of three unknown qubit states within the dimensionally bounded prepare-and-measure scenario. To do this, we construct a linear witness from three simpler witnesses as building blocks, each featuring, along with two binary measurement settings, three preparations; two of them are associated with the certification task, while the third one serves as an auxiliary. The final witness is chosen to self-test some target configuration. We numerically derive a bound Qmirror for any mirror-symmetric configuration, thereby certifying asymmetry if this bound is exceeded (e.g. experimentally) for the unknown qubit configuration. We also consider the gap (Qmax-Qmirror) between the analytically derived overall quantum maximum Qmax and the mirror-symmetric bound, and use it as a quantifier of asymmetry in the target configuration. Numerical optimization shows that the most asymmetric configuration then forms a right scalene triangle on the unit Bloch sphere. Finally, we implement our protocol on a public quantum processor, where a clear violation of the mirror-symmetric bound certifies asymmetry in the configuration of our experimental triple of qubit states.

We show that for Cantor-setlike erasure in the boundary in AdS3/CFT2, the code distance is independent of the mixed-state entropy in the bulk in them -> infinity limit. We also show that for a Sierpinski triangle shaped boundary subregion with fractal boundary erasures in AdS4/CFT3, bulk reconstruction is possible in the presence of highly entropic mixed states in the bulk in the large m regime.

TI Berry phase induced entanglement of hole-spin qubits in a microwave
   cavity
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB Hole spins localized in semiconductor structures, such as quantum dots or defects, serve in the realization of efficient gate-tunable solid-state quantum bits. Here, we study two electrically driven spin-3/2 holes coupled to the electromagnetic field of a microwave cavity. We show that the interplay between the non-Abelian Berry phases generated by local time-dependent electrical fields and the shared cavity photons allows for fast manipulation, detection, and long-range entanglement of the hole-spin qubits in the absence of any external magnetic field. Owing to its geometrical structure, such a scheme is more robust against external noises than conventional hole-spin qubit implementations. These results suggest that hole spins are favorable qubits for scalable quantum computing by purely electrical means.

TI Cubic nonlinear squeezing and its decoherence
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Squeezed states of the harmonic oscillator are a common resource in applications of quantum technology. If the noise is suppressed in a nonlinear combination of quadrature operators below threshold for all possible up-to-quadratic Hamiltonians, the quantum states are non-Gaussian and we refer to the noise reduction as nonlinear squeezing. Non-Gaussian aspects of quantum states are often more vulnerable to decoherence due to imperfections appearing in realistic experimental implementations. Therefore, a stability of nonlinear squeezing is essential. We analyze the behavior of quantum states with cubic nonlinear squeezing under loss and dephasing. The properties of nonlinear squeezed states depend on their initial parameters which can be optimized and adjusted to achieve the maximal robustness for the potential applications.

TI Non-Gaussian entanglement swapping between three-mode spontaneous
   parametric down-conversion and three qubits
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB In this work we study the production and swapping of non-Gaussian multipartite entanglement in a setup containing a parametric amplifier which generates three photons in different modes coupled to three qubits. We prove that the entanglement generated in this setup is of non-Gaussian nature. We introduce witnesses of genuine tripartite non-Gaussian entanglement, valid for both mode and qubit entanglement. Moreover, those witnesses show that the entanglement generated among the photons can be swapped to the qubits, and indeed the qubits display non-Gaussian genuine tripartite entanglement over a wider parameter regime, suggesting that our setup could be a useful tool to extract entanglement generated in higher-order parametric amplification for quantum metrology or quantum computing applications.

TI Theory of high performance piezotronic quantum harmonic oscillator under
   nonuniform strain
SO NANO ENERGY
AB Piezotronics and piezo-phototronics are two emerging fields that involve high performance piezoelectric semi-conductor devices. The nonuniform strain can create nonlinear piezopotential even in nonpiezoelectric materials such as silicon. Here, we propose theory of quantum piezotronics under nonuniform strain using a typical example of the interaction between independently trapped charges under nonlinear piezopotential. The trapped-ion motional frequency along the x direction can increase from 4 MHz to 25 MHz, and the electric-field noise can decrease by 15 times under nonuniform strain. This piezotronic harmonic oscillator based on trapping wells not only provides a good understanding of quantum piezotronics but also a guide for developing peizotronic devices for quantum computing.

TI Optical precursors in waveguide quantum electrodynamics
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB When a broadband signal propagates through a dispersive medium, some frequency components move faster than the center of the pulse. This leads to the appearance of precursors, transient signals that emerge from the medium earlier than the main part of the pulse and seem to propagate superluminally. Here, we investigate the microscopic origin of precursors in a minimal setup: an array of qubits coupled to a waveguide. The linear transmission function only converges to that of a continuous medium for large qubit numbers. Nevertheless, the dispersion produced by only two qubits is enough to produce oscillatory transients. Precursors are best observed under conditions of electromagnetically induced transparency, as the center of the pulse is significantly delayed. Under these conditions, just a single qutrit is enough to generate a precursor. Our results pave the way towards dispersion engineering of light with just a few qubits and can be realized with superconducting qubits coupled to transmission lines or atoms coupled to optical waveguides.

The aim of the present study is twofold. The first part of the study deals with the dynamics under Heisenberg Hamiltonian and the second part deals under bi-linear bi-quadratic Hamiltonian which is the extension of the first Hamiltonian. In both parts, we investigate the dynamical trade-off and equilibrium points for squashed entanglement and concurrence. During the study, we also found the results of entanglement sudden death (ESD) with Heisenberg Hamiltonian in Werner state under concurrence measure. In the second part, we investigate the special result for the bi-linear bi-quadratic Hamiltonian which does not disturb squashed entanglement and concurrence in both the states and exhibits the robust character for both of the states.

TI Hybrid integration of 2D materials for on-chip nonlinear photonics
SO LIGHT-ADVANCED MANUFACTURING
AB Interests surrounding the development of on-chip nonlinear optical devices have been consistently growing in the past decades due to the tremendous applications, such as quantum photonics, all-optical communications, optical computing, on-chip metrology, and sensing. Developing efficient on-chip nonlinear optical devices to meet the requirements of those applications brings the need for new directions to improve the existing photonic approaches. Recent research has directed the field of on-chip nonlinear optics toward the hybrid integration of two-dimensional layered materials (such as graphene, transition metal dichalcogenides, and black phosphorous) with various integrated platforms. The combination of well-known photonic chip design platforms (e.g., silicon, silicon nitride) and different two-dimensional layered materials has opened the road for more versatile and efficient structures and devices, which has the great potential to unlock numerous new possibilities. This review discusses the modeling and characterization of different hybrid photonic integration structures with two-dimensional materials, highlights the current state of the art examples, and presents an outlook for future prospects.

SO OPTICAL ENGINEERING
AB The quantum optics/quantum information and nano-optics educational laboratory facility (QNOL) at the University of Rochester (UR) is located within three rooms of the Institute of Optics with a total area of 587 ft(2). It has been used for teaching a 4-credit-hour QNOL class annually for 15 years. Four teaching labs were prepared on the generation and characterization of entangled and single (antibunched) photons demonstrating the laws of quantum mechanics: (1) entanglement and Bell's inequalities, (2) single-photon interference (Young's double slit experiment and Mach-Zehnder interferometer), (3) single-photon source I: confocal fluorescence microscopy of single nanoemitters, and (4) single-photon source II: a Hanbury Brown and Twiss setup, fluorescence antibunching. Further, based on QNOL, 1.5 to 3 h sturdy quantum "mini-labs" were developed and introduced into the required classes such that all optics students at the UR had experience with quantum labs. Monroe Community College (MCC) students participated in two mini-labs at the UR. Since 2006 to spring 2022, a total of similar to 850 students have utilized the labs for lab report submission (including 144 MCC students) and more than 250 students have used them for lab demonstrations. In addition, UR freshman research projects have become a very important educational activity in this facility. All developed materials and students' reports are available at http://www.optics.rochester.edu/workgroups/lukishova/QuantumOpticsLab/. We present a description of sturdy, universally accessible experiments that can be introduced into either a separate advanced class or into classes with a large number of students. Assessment methods, evaluation of students' knowledge, and their attitude toward their career in quantum information are discussed. (C) 2022 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE)

TI Supervised Learning Enhanced Quantum Circuit Transformation
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON COMPUTER-AIDED DESIGN OF INTEGRATED CIRCUITS AND
   SYSTEMS
AB A quantum circuit transformation (QCT) is required when executing a quantum program in a real quantum processing unit (QPU). By inserting auxiliary SWAP gates, a QCT algorithm transforms a quantum circuit to one that satisfies the connectivity constraint imposed by the QPU. Due to the nonnegligible gate error and the limited qubit coherence time of the QPU, QCT algorithms that minimize gate number or circuit depth or maximize the fidelity of output circuits are in urgent need. Unfortunately, finding optimized transformations often involve exhaustive searches, which are extremely time consuming and not practical for most circuits. In this article, we propose a framework that uses a policy artificial neural network (ANN) trained by supervised learning on shallow circuits to help existing QCT algorithms select the most promising SWAP gate. ANNs can be trained offline in a distributed way and the trained ANN can be easily incorporated into QCT algorithms to enable them to search deeper without bringing too much overhead in time complexity. Exemplary embeddings of the trained ANNs into target QCT algorithms demonstrate that the transformation performance can be consistently improved on QPUs with various connectivity structures and random or realistic quantum circuits.

TI Nonclassical correlated deterministic single-photon pairs for a trapped
   atom in bimodal cavities
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Single photons and single-photon pairs, inherently nonclassical in their nature, are fundamental elements of quantum sciences and technologies. Here, we propose to realize the nonclassical correlated deterministic photon pairs at the single-photon level for a single atom trapped in bimodal cavities. It is shown that the photon emissions for bimodal cavities exhibit a high single-photon purity and relatively large intracavity photon numbers, which are ascribed to the combination of optical Stark-shift enhanced energy-spectrum anharmonicity and quantum interference suppressed two-photon excitation. Our scheme generates photon-photon pairs with strong photon blockade for cavity modes via constructing a highly tunable cavity-enhanced deterministic parametric down conversion process. Furthermore, we show that the cross-correlation function between the two cavity modes vastly violates the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality of the classical boundary, which unambiguously demonstrates the nonclassicality of the single-photon pairs. Our result reveals a prominent strategy to generate the high-quality two-mode single-photon sources with strong nonclassical correlation, which could provide versatile applications in distribution of quantum networks, long-distance quantum communication, and fundamental tests of quantum physics.

TI Quantum natural gradient optimizer on noisy platforms: Quantum
   approximate optimization algorithm as a case study
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We investigate the performance of the quantum natural gradient (QNG) optimizer in the presence of noise. Specifically, we evaluate the efficacy of QNG within the quantum approximate optimization algorithm for finding the ground state of the transverse field Ising model. Its performance is benchmarked against the vanilla gradient descent optimizer across two prominent quantum computing platforms: Rydberg atoms and superconducting circuits. Our analysis includes simulations under both idealized noise-free conditions and realistic noisy environments based on calibration data from actual devices. Results demonstrate that QNG consistently outperforms vanilla gradient descent, exhibiting faster convergence on average and greater robustness against random initializations of parameters. This robustness is attributed to the distance regularization in parameter space inherent to QNG. Additionally, QNG achieves a higher convergence rate to the solution, effectively avoiding certain local minima. These findings highlight QNG as a promising tool for optimizing variational quantum algorithms in noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices.

TI Metrological detection of entanglement generated by non-Gaussian
   operations
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB Entanglement and non-Gaussianity are physical resources that are essential for a large number of quantum-optics protocols. Non-Gaussian entanglement is indispensable for quantum-computing advantage and outperforms its Gaussian counterparts in a number of quantum-information protocols. The characterization of non-Gaussian entanglement is a critical matter as it is in general highly demanding in terms of resources. We propose a simple protocol based on the Fisher information for witnessing entanglement in an important class of non-Gaussian entangled states: photon-subtracted states. We demonstrate that our protocol is relevant for the detection of non-Gaussian entanglement generated by multiple photon-subtraction and that it is experimentally feasible through homodyne detection.

TI Multiset Variational Quantum Dynamics Algorithm for Simulating
   Nonadiabatic Dynamics on Quantum Computers
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY LETTERS
AB Accelerating quantum dynamical simulations with quantum computing has received considerable attention but remains a significant challenge. In variational quantum algorithms for quantum dynamics, designing an expressive and shallow-depth parametrized quantum circuit (PQC) is a key difficulty. Here, we propose a multiset variational quantum dynamics algorithm (MS-VQD) tailored for nonadiabatic dynamics involving multiple electronic states. The MS-VQD employs multiple PQCs to represent the electronic-nuclear coupled wave function, with each circuit adapting to the motion of the nuclear wavepacket on a specific potential energy surface. By simulating excitation energy transfer dynamics in molecular aggregates described by the Frenkel-Holstein model, we demonstrate that the MS-VQD achieves the same accuracy as the traditional VQD while requiring significantly shallower PQCs. Notably, its advantage increases with the number of electronic states, making it suitable for simulating nonadiabatic quantum dynamics in complex molecular systems.

TI Online Parameter Estimation for Continuously Monitored Quantum Systems
SO IEEE CONTROL SYSTEMS LETTERS
AB In this letter, we consider the problem of online (real-time, single-shot) estimation of static or slow-varying parameters along quantum trajectories in quantum dynamical systems. Based on the measurement signal of a continuously monitored quantum system, we propose a recursive algorithm for computing the maximum likelihood (ML) estimate of unknown parameters using an approach based on stochastic gradient ascent on the log-likelihood function. We formulate the algorithm in both discrete-time and continuous-time and illustrate the performance of the algorithm through simulations of a simple two-level system undergoing homodyne measurement from which we are able to track multiple parameters simultaneously.

TI Quantum Dynamics of Cavity-Bose-Einstein Condensates in a Gravitational
   Field
SO PHOTONICS
AB We theoretically studied the quantum dynamics of a cavity-Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) system in a gravitational field, which is composed of a Fabry-Perot cavity and a BEC. We also show how to deterministically generate the transient macroscopic quantum superposition states (MQSSs) of the cavity by the use of optomechanical coupling between the cavity field and the BEC. The quantum dynamics of the cavity-BEC system specifically include phase space trajectory dynamics, system excitation number dynamics, quantum entanglement dynamics, and quantum coherence dynamics. We found that the system performs increasingly complex trajectories for larger values of the Newtonian gravity parameter. Moreover, the number of phonon excitations of the system can be increased by coupling the cavity-BEC system to Newtonian gravity, which is analogous to an external direct current drive. The scattering of atoms inside the BEC affects the periodicity of the quantum dynamics of the system. We demonstrate a curious complementarity relation between the quantum entanglement and quantum coherence of cavity-BEC systems and found that the complementarity property can be sustained to some extent, despite being in the presence of the cavity decay. This phenomenon also goes some way to show that quantum entanglement and quantum coherence can be referred to together as quantum resources.

TI Absolutely Stable Spatiotemporal Order in Noisy Quantum Systems
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB We introduce a model of nonunitary quantum dynamics that exhibits infinitely long-lived discrete spatiotemporal order robust against any unitary or dissipative perturbation. Ergodicity is evaded by combining a sequence of projective measurements with a local feedback rule that is inspired by Toom's "north-east-center" classical cellular automaton. The measurements in question only partially collapse the wave function of the system, allowing some quantum coherence to persist. We demonstrate our claims using numerical simulations of a Clifford circuit in two spatial dimensions which allows access to large system sizes, and also present results for more generic dynamics on modest system sizes. We also devise explicit experimental protocols realizing this dynamics using one- and two-qubit gates that are available on present-day quantum computing platforms.

TI Spin-amplification SERF atomic magnetometer based on direct feedback
SO EPJ QUANTUM TECHNOLOGY
AB We demonstrate that atomic spin trajectories on the Bloch sphere can be manipulated through direct feedback, achieving spin amplification. This method is applied to Spin-Exchange Relaxation-Free (SERF) magnetometers where a feedback loop introduces a magnetic field positively proportional to the transverse spin polarization, which significantly amplifies the low-frequency response signal by an order of magnitude. Experimental results show that the feedback mechanism improves the signal-to-noise ratio and effectively strengthens the system's ability to suppress technical noise. In addition, this feedback-enabled magnetometer exhibits superior sensitivity at lower spin polarization, reducing reliance on optical power and thereby facilitating scalability in multi-channel systems. This approach can be extended to various physical systems utilizing atomic spins, such as quantum memory and quantum metrology.

TI Realization of photon correlations beyond the linear optics limit
SO SCIENCE ADVANCES
AB Linear optical transformations of multiple single-photon inputs are fundamental for the development of photonic quantum technologies. Various nonclassical correlations can already be observed directly in states generated using only single-photon inputs and linear optics transformations. However, some quantum correlations require additional operations, and states that exhibit such correlations are classified as non-Fock states. Here, we demonstrate the generation of a two-photon three-mode non-Fock state that exhibits conditional quantum coherences that can only be achieved by non-Fock states. We determine the fidelity of the non-Fock state based on experimentally observed conditional visibilities that characterize the state and compare the result to the fidelity bounds for different classes of Fock and non-Fock states. Our experimental verification of the non-Fock character of the state provides insights into the technological requirements needed to achieve nonclassical correlations in multiphoton quantum optics.

TI Model-free optimization of power/efficiency tradeoffs in quantum thermal
   machines using reinforcement learning
SO PNAS NEXUS
AB A quantum thermal machine is an open quantum system that enables the conversion between heat and work at the micro or nano-scale. Optimally controlling such out-of-equilibrium systems is a crucial yet challenging task with applications to quantum technologies and devices. We introduce a general model-free framework based on reinforcement learning to identify out-of-equilibrium thermodynamic cycles that are Pareto optimal tradeoffs between power and efficiency for quantum heat engines and refrigerators. The method does not require any knowledge of the quantum thermal machine, nor of the system model, nor of the quantum state. Instead, it only observes the heat fluxes, so it is both applicable to simulations and experimental devices. We test our method on a model of an experimentally realistic refrigerator based on a superconducting qubit, and on a heat engine based on a quantum harmonic oscillator. In both cases, we identify the Pareto-front representing optimal power-efficiency tradeoffs, and the corresponding cycles. Such solutions outperform previous proposals made in the literature, such as optimized Otto cycles, reducing quantum friction.

TI Quantum Non-Markovian Environment-to-System Backflows of Information:
   Nonoperational vs. Operational Approaches
SO ENTROPY
AB Quantum memory effects can be qualitatively understood as a consequence of an environment-to-system backflow of information. Here, we analyze and compare how this concept is interpreted and implemented in different approaches to quantum non-Markovianity. We study a nonoperational approach, defined by the distinguishability between two system states characterized by different initial conditions, and an operational approach, which is defined by the correlation between different outcomes associated to successive measurement processes performed over the system of interest. The differences, limitations, and vantages of each approach are characterized in detail by considering diverse system-environment models and dynamics. As a specific example, we study a non-Markovian depolarizing map induced by the interaction of the system of interest with an environment characterized by incoherent and coherent self-dynamics.

TI Toward large-scale, ordered and tunable Majorana-zero-modes lattice on
   iron-based superconductors
SO REPORTS ON PROGRESS IN PHYSICS
AB Majorana excitations are the quasiparticle analog of Majorana fermions in solid materials. Typical examples are the Majorana zero modes (MZMs) and the dispersing Majorana modes. When probed by scanning tunneling spectroscopy, the former manifest as a pronounced conductance peak locating precisely at zero-energy, while the latter behaves as constant or slowly varying density of states. The MZMs obey non-abelian statistics and are believed to be building blocks for topological quantum computing, which is highly immune to the environmental noise. Existing MZM platforms include hybrid structures such as topological insulator, semiconducting nanowire or 1D atomic chains on top of a conventional superconductor, and single materials such as the iron-based superconductors (IBSs) and 4Hb-TaS2. Very recently, ordered and tunable MZM lattice has also been realized in IBS LiFeAs, providing a scalable and applicable platform for future topological quantum computation. In this review, we present an overview of the recent local probe studies on MZMs. Classified by the material platforms, we start with the MZMs in the iron-chalcogenide superconductors where FeTe0.55Se0.45 and (Li0.84Fe0.16)OHFeSe will be discussed. We then review the Majorana research in the iron-pnictide superconductors as well as other platforms beyond the IBSs. We further review recent works on ordered and tunable MZM lattice, showing that strain is a feasible tool to tune the topological superconductivity. Finally, we give our summary and perspective on future Majorana research.

TI Quantum-enabled topological optimization of distributed energy storage
   for resilient black-start operations
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB As modern power grids grow increasingly complex with the widespread deployment of renewable energy and distributed energy storage systems (ESS), ensuring robust and resilient black-start capabilities has become a critical challenge. Traditional black-start approaches, which typically rely on centralized hydro or diesel generators, are increasingly inadequate due to rising network complexity, the stochastic nature of renewables, and growing exposure to cyber-physical threats. To overcome these limitations, this study introduces a quantum-enhanced framework for dynamic network reconfiguration and topological optimization of ESS to support black-start restoration. The proposed method leverages quantum graph theory and quantum annealing to dynamically determine optimal ESS connectivity and energy redistribution pathways, enabling rapid grid recovery under diverse failure scenarios, including those involving cyber-physical disruptions. By integrating quantum annealing algorithms, the framework efficiently addresses the combinatorial complexity of large-scale ESS placement and dispatch, outperforming traditional heuristic and classical optimization techniques in both computational speed and solution quality. The approach is formulated through a comprehensive mathematical model that captures key interactions between network topology, energy flow dynamics, and black-start performance indicators such as restoration time, efficiency, and resilience. Simulation results on a 300-bus synthetic power grid with high levels of renewable penetration demonstrate that the proposed quantum-assisted strategy reduces restoration decision time by up to 50%, optimizes energy allocation, and significantly improves system robustness. These findings highlight the transformative potential of quantum computing in enabling intelligent, adaptive black-start planning, offering a powerful tool for enhancing the resilience of future energy systems.

TI On Families of Wigner Functions for N-Level Quantum Systems
SO SYMMETRY-BASEL
AB A method for constructing all admissible unitary non-equivalent Wigner quasiprobability distributions providing the Stratonovic-h-Weyl correspondence for an arbitrary N-level quantum system is proposed. The method is based on the reformulation of the Stratonovich-Weyl correspondence in the form of algebraic "master equations" for the spectrum of the Stratonovich-Weyl kernel. The later implements a map between the operators in the Hilbert space and the functions in the phase space identified by the complex flag manifold. The non-uniqueness of the solutions to the master equations leads to diversity among the Wigner quasiprobability distributions. It is shown that among all possible Stratonovich-Weyl kernels for a N=(2j+1)-level system, one can always identify the representative that realizes the so-called SU(2)-symmetric spin-j symbol correspondence. The method is exemplified by considering the Wigner functions of a single qubit and a single qutrit.

AB Quantum sampling, a fundamental subroutine in numerous quantum algorithms, involves encoding a given probability distribution in the amplitudes of a pure state. Given the hefty cost of largescale quantum storage, we initiate the study of quantum sampling in a distributed setting. Specifically, we assume that the data is distributed among multiple machines, and each machine solely maintains a basic oracle that counts the multiplicity of individual elements. Given a quantum sampling task, which is to sample from the joint database, a coordinator can make oracle queries to all machines. We focus on the oblivious communication model, where communications between the coordinator and the machines are predetermined. We present both sequential and parallel algorithms: the sequential algorithm queries the machines sequentially, while the parallel algorithm allows the coordinator to query all machines simultaneously. Furthermore, we prove that both algorithms are optimal in their respective settings.

TI Observation of PT-symmetric quantum coherence in a single-ion
   system
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Parity-time (PT)-symmetric systems, featuring real eigenvalues despite their non-Hermitian nature, undergo spontaneous PT symmetry breaking at the exceptional point (EP). The phase transition from PT symmetry to PT symmetry breaking has shown exotic functionalities in the classical realm, such as loss-induced transparency or lasing revival. This transition is also expected to produce a more unconventional effect in pure quantum PT devices. Here, we report experimental evidences of spontaneous PT symmetry breaking in a single cold Ca-40(+) ion and, more importantly, a counterintuitive effect of perfect quantum coherence occurring at the EP. Excellent agreement between experimental results and theoretical predictions is identified. In view of the versatile role of cold ions in building a quantum memory or processor, our experiment provides an alternative platform to explore PT-symmetric physics and utilize pure quantum EP effects.

TI Noisy quantum amplitude estimation without noise estimation
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Many quantum algorithms contain an important subroutine-the quantum amplitude estimation. As the name implies, this is essentially the parameter estimation problem and thus can be handled via the established statistical estimation theory. However, this problem has an intrinsic difficulty that the system, i.e., the real quantum computing device, inevitably introduces unknown noise; the probability distribution model then has to incorporate many nuisance noise parameters, resulting that the construction of an optimal estimator becomes inefficient and difficult. For this problem we apply the theory of nuisance parameters (more specifically, the parameter orthogonalization method) to precisely compute the maximum likelihood estimator for only the target amplitude parameter by removing the other nuisance noise parameters. That is, we can estimate the amplitude parameter without estimating the noise parameters. We validate the parameter orthogonalization method in a numerical simulation and study the performance of the estimator in the experiment using a real superconducting quantum device.

TI Entangling three identical particles via spatial overlap
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Quantum correlations between identical particles are at the heart of quantum technologies. Several studies with two identical particles have shown that the spatial overlap and indistinguishability between the particles are necessary for generating bipartite entanglement. On the other hand, researches on the extension to more than two-particle systems are limited by the practical difficulty to control multiple identical particles in laboratories. In this work, we propose schemes to generate two fundamental classes of genuine tripartite entanglement, i.e., GHZ and W classes, which are experimentally demonstrated using linear optics with three identical photons. We also show that the tripartite entanglement class decays from the genuine entanglement to the full separability as the particles become more distinguishable from each other. Our results support the prediction that particle indistinguishability is a fundamental element for entangling identical particles.

TI Electron-spin spectral diffusion in an erbium doped crystal at
   millikelvin temperatures
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB Erbium doped crystals offer a versatile platform for hybrid quantum devices because they combine magnetically sensitive electron-spin transitions with telecom-wavelength optical transitions. At the high doping concentrations necessary for many quantum applications, however, strong magnetic interactions of the electronspin bath lead to excess spectral diffusion and rapid decoherence. Here we lithographically fabricate a 4.4 GHz superconducting planar microresonator on a CaWO4 crystal doped with Er ions at a concentration of 20 ppm relative to Ca. Using the microwave resonator, we characterize the spectral diffusion processes that limit the electron-spin coherence of Er ions at millikelvin temperatures by applying two- and three-pulse echo sequences. The coherence time shows a strong temperature dependence, reaching 1.3 ms at 23 mK for an electron-spin transition of 167Er.

TI Optically heralded microwave photon addition
SO NATURE PHYSICS
AB Photons with optical frequencies of a few hundred terahertz are perhaps the only way to distribute quantum information over long distances. Superconducting qubits, which are one of the most promising approaches for realizing large-scale quantum machines, operate on microwave photons at frequencies that are similar to 40,000 times lower. To network these quantum machines across appreciable distances, we must bridge this frequency gap. Here we implement and demonstrate a transducer that can generate correlated optical and microwave photons. We use it to show that by detecting an optical photon we generate an added microwave photon with an efficiency of similar to 35%. Our device uses a gigahertz nanomechanical resonance as an intermediary, which efficiently couples to optical and microwave channels through strong optomechanical and piezoelectric interactions. We show continuous operation of the transducer with 5% frequency conversion efficiency, input-referred added noise of similar to 100, and pulsed microwave photon generation at a heralding rate of 15 Hz. Optical absorption in the device generates thermal noise of less than two microwave photons. Improvements of the system efficiencies and device performance are necessary to realize a high rate of entanglement generation between distant microwave-frequency quantum nodes, but these enhancements are within reach.
   Many quantum devices operate in the microwave regime, but long-distance communication relies on optical photons. A nanomechanical resonator can be used to create entangled optical and microwave photons linking the two frequency regimes.

TI Nanoscale Quantum Imaging of Field-Free Deterministic Switching of a
   Chiral Antiferromagnet
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Recently, unconventional spin-orbit torques (SOTs) with tunable spin generation have opened new pathways for designing novel magnetization control for cutting-edge spintronics innovations. A leading research thrust is to develop field-free deterministic magnetization switching for implementing scalable and energy favorable magnetic recording and storage, which have been demonstrated in conventional ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic material systems. Here, we extend this advanced magnetization control strategy to chiral antiferromagnet Mn3Sn using spin currents with out-of-plane canted polarization generated from low-symmetry van der Waals (vdW) material WTe2. Numerical calculations suggest that dampinglike SOT of spins injected perpendicular to the kagome plane of Mn3Sn serves as a driving force to rotate the chiral magnetic order, while the fieldlike SOT of spin currents with polarization parallel to the kagome plane provides the bipolar deterministicity to the magnetic switching in the absence of an external magnetic field. We further introduce scanning quantum microscopy to visualize nanoscale evolutions of Mn3Sn magnetic domains during the field-free switching process, corroborating the exceptionally large magnetic switching ratio up to 90%. Our results highlight the opportunities provided by hybrid SOT material platforms consisting of noncollinear antiferromagnets and low-symmetry vdW spin source materials for developing next-generation spintronic logic devices.

TI Reinforcement learning assisted recursive QAOA
SO EPJ QUANTUM TECHNOLOGY
AB In recent years, variational quantum algorithms such as the Quantum Approximation Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) have gained popularity as they provide the hope of using NISQ devices to tackle hard combinatorial optimization problems. It is, however, known that at low depth, certain locality constraints of QAOA limit its performance. To go beyond these limitations, a non-local variant of QAOA, namely recursive QAOA (RQAOA), was proposed to improve the quality of approximate solutions. The RQAOA has been studied comparatively less than QAOA, and it is less understood, for instance, for what family of instances it may fail to provide high-quality solutions. However, as we are tackling NP-hard problems (specifically, the Ising spin model), it is expected that RQAOA does fail, raising the question of designing even better quantum algorithms for combinatorial optimization. In this spirit, we identify and analyze cases where (depth-1) RQAOA fails and, based on this, propose a reinforcement learning enhanced RQAOA variant (RL-RQAOA) that improves upon RQAOA. We show that the performance of RL-RQAOA improves over RQAOA: RL-RQAOA is strictly better on these identified instances where RQAOA underperforms and is similarly performing on instances where RQAOA is near-optimal. Our work exemplifies the potentially beneficial synergy between reinforcement learning and quantum (inspired) optimization in the design of new, even better heuristics for complex problems.

TI Thermal-noise limits to the frequency stability of burned spectral holes
SO APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS
AB Techniques in frequency stabilization of lasers to fixed-spacer optical cavities have advanced to the point where the ultimate frequency stabilities are limited by thermal noise for standard cavity configurations at room temperature. In early experiments, laser stabilization via spectral-hole burning (SHB) has been shown to be a promising alternative. In this Letter, we explore the thermal-noise limits to frequency stability in spectral holes and compile known material parameters for a typical system used in SHB experiments ( Eu3+ doped Y2SiO5) to make numerical estimates for the fundamental thermal-noise induced frequency instability in spectral holes for the liquid-helium temperature and dilution temperature cases. These efforts can guide the design of future SHB experiments and clarify which important material parameters remain to be measured.

TI Adaptive modelling and filtering of periodic signals with non-stationary
   fundamental frequency
SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF CONTROL
AB We present a novel approach to processing periodic signals with non-stationary fundamental frequency. These quasi-periodic signals feature a perpetually recurring underlying signal pattern and arise in various fields of science and engineering. The proposed method integrates a recursive extraction of the signal pattern with dynamic tracking of the instantaneous phase to effectively suppress measurement noise without prior knowledge of the signal characteristics or the frequency variation. The performance is showcased both in simulation and using experimental measurements of the cardiac cycle obtained by a nitrogen-vacancy diamond quantum sensor. Overall, high-fidelity signal reconstruction and convincing pattern learning is achieved, even in the presence of complex non-linear disturbances and non-Gaussian noise. Conclusively, the proposed technique constitutes a flexible and efficient solution, addressing limitations of existing methods and offering real-world applicability.

TI Constructive plaquette compilation for the parity architecture
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Parity compilation is the challenge of laying out the required constraints for the parity mapping in a local way. We present the first constructive compilation algorithm for the parity architecture using plaquettes for arbitrary higher-order optimization problems. This enables adiabatic protocols, where the plaquette layout can natively be implemented, as well as fully parallelized digital circuits. The algorithm builds a rectangular layout of plaquettes, where in each layer of the rectangle at least one constraint is added. The core idea is that each constraint, consisting of any qubits on the boundary of the rectangle and some new qubits, can be decomposed into plaquettes with a deterministic procedure using ancillas. We show how to pick a valid set of constraints and how this decomposition works. We further give ways to optimize the ancilla count and show how to implement optimization problems with additional constraints.

TI Eavesdropper Detection in Six-State Protocol Against Partial
   Intercept-Resend Attack
SO FUTURE INTERNET
AB This work presents and evaluates two threshold-based detection methods for the Six-State quantum key distribution protocol, considering a realistic scenario involving partial intercept-resend attack and channel noise. The statistical properties of the shared quantum bit error rate (QBER) are analyzed and used to estimate the attacker interception density from observed data. Building on this foundation, the work derives two optimal QBER detection thresholds designed to minimize both false positive and false negative rates, following, respectively, upper theoretical bounds and limit probability density function approach. A developed Qiskit simulation environment enables the evaluation and comparison of the two detection methods on simulated and real-inspired quantum systems with differing noise characteristics. This framework moves beyond theoretical analysis, allowing practical investigation of system noise effects on detection accuracy. Simulation results confirm that both methods are robust and effective, achieving high detection accuracy across all the tested configurations, thereby validating their applicability to real-world quantum communication systems.

TI Nearly Complete Generalized Clifford Monoids and Applications
SO SYMMETRY-BASEL
AB A semigroup S is termed a generalized Clifford semigroup (GC-semigroup) if it forms a strong semilattice of pi-groups. This paper explores necessary and sufficient conditions for a GC-monoid to be nearly complete within certain subclasses. These subclasses are distinguished by the nature of their linking homomorphisms, which may be bijective, surjective, injective, or image trivial. The findings provide a deeper understanding of the structural integrity and completeness of GC-monoids, contributing valuable insights to the theoretical framework of semigroup theory. Applications of this study span various fields, including cryptography for secure algorithm design, coding theory and quantum computing for advanced quantum algorithms. The established criteria also support further research in mathematical biology and automorphic theory, demonstrating the broad relevance and utility of nearly complete GC-monoids.

AB The precise control of complex quantum systems promises numerous technological applications including digital quantum computing. The complexity of such devices renders the certification of their correct functioning a challenge. To address this challenge, numerous methods were developed in the last decade. In this tutorial, we explain prominent protocols for certifying the physical layer of quantum devices described by quantum states and processes. Such protocols are particularly important in the development of near-term devices. Specifically, we discuss methods of direct quantum-state certification, direct-fidelity estimation, shadow-fidelity estimation, direct quantum-process certification, randomized benchmarking, and cross-entropy benchmarking. Moreover, we provide an introduction to powerful mathematical methods, which are widely used in quantum-information theory, in order to derive theoretical guarantees for the protocols.

TI Clock synchronization characterization of the Washington DC metropolitan
   quantum network (DC-QNet)
SO APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS
AB Quantum networking protocols relying on interference and precise time-of-flight measurements require high-precision clock synchronization. This study describes the design, implementation, and characterization of two optical time transfer methods in a metropolitan-scale quantum networking research testbed. With active electronic stabilization, sub-picosecond time deviation (TDEV) was achieved at integration times between 1 and 10(5) s over 53 km of deployed fiber. Over the same integration periods, 10-ps level TDEV was observed using the White Rabbit-Precision Time Protocol over 128 km. Measurement methods are described to understand the sources of environmental fluctuations on clock synchronization toward the development of in situ compensation methods. Path delay gradients, chromatic dispersion, polarization drift, and optical power variations all contributed to clock synchronization errors. The results from this study will inform future work in the development of compensation methods essential for enabling experimental research in developing practical quantum networking protocols.

AB There is an increasing interest in quantum algorithms for problems of integer programming and combinatorial optimization. Classical solvers for such problems employ relaxations, which replace binary variables with continuous ones, for instance in the form of higher-dimensional matrix-valued problems (semidefinite programming). Under the Unique Games Conjecture, these relaxations often provide the best performance ratios available classically in polynomial time. Here, we discuss how to warm-start quantum optimization with an initial state corresponding to the solution of a relaxation of a combinatorial optimization problem and how to analyze properties of the associated quantum algorithms. In particular, this allows the quantum algorithm to inherit the performance guarantees of the classical algorithm. We illustrate this in the context of portfolio optimization, where our results indicate that warm-starting the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) is particularly beneficial at low depth. Likewise, Recursive QAOA for MAXCUT problems shows a systematic increase in the size of the obtained cut for fully connected graphs with random weights, when Goemans-Williamson randomized rounding is utilized in a warm start. It is straightforward to apply the same ideas to other randomized-rounding schemes and optimization problems.

TI Mutual information-assisted adaptive variational quantum eigensolver
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Adaptive construction of ansatz circuits offers a promising route towards applicable variational quantum eigensolvers on near-term quantum hardware. Those algorithms aim to build up optimal circuits for a certain problem and ansatz circuits are adaptively constructed by selecting and adding entanglers from a predefined pool. In this work, we propose a way to construct entangler pools with reduced size by leveraging classical algorithms. Our method uses mutual information between the qubits in classically approximated ground state to rank and screen the entanglers. The density matrix renormalization group method is employed for classical precomputation in this work. We corroborate our method numerically on small molecules. Our numerical experiments show that a reduced entangler pool with a small portion of the original entangler pool can achieve same numerical accuracy. We believe that our method paves a new way for adaptive construction of ansatz circuits for variational quantum algorithms.

TI Evanescent Electron Wave-Spin
SO ENTROPY
AB This study demonstrates the existence of an evanescent electron wave outside both finite and infinite quantum wells by solving the Dirac equation and ensuring the continuity of the spinor wavefunction at the boundaries. We show that this evanescent wave shares the spin characteristics of the wave confined within the well, as indicated by analytical expressions for the current density across all regions. Our findings suggest that the electron cannot be confined to a mathematical singularity and that quantum information, or quantum entropy, can leak through any quantum confinement. These results emphasize that the electron wave, fully characterized by Lorentz-invariant charge and current densities, should be considered the true and sole entity of the electron.

TI Direct Parameter Estimations from Machine Learning-Enhanced Quantum
   State Tomography
SO SYMMETRY-BASEL
AB With the power to find the best fit to arbitrarily complicated symmetry, machine-learning (ML)-enhanced quantum state tomography (QST) has demonstrated its advantages in extracting complete information about the quantum states. Instead of using the reconstruction model in training a truncated density matrix, we develop a high-performance, lightweight, and easy-to-install supervised characteristic model by generating the target parameters directly. Such a characteristic model-based ML-QST can avoid the problem of dealing with a large Hilbert space, but cab keep feature extractions with high precision, capturing the underlying symmetry in data. With the experimentally measured data generated from the balanced homodyne detectors, we compare the degradation information about quantum noise squeezed states predicted by the reconstruction and characteristic models; both are in agreement with the empirically fitting curves obtained from the covariance method. Such a ML-QST with direct parameter estimations illustrates a crucial diagnostic toolbox for applications with squeezed states, from quantum information process, quantum metrology, advanced gravitational wave detectors, to macroscopic quantum state generation.

TI Memory Management Strategies for Software Quantum Simulators
SO QUANTUM REPORTS
AB Software quantum simulators are essential tools for designing and testing quantum algorithms on classical computing architectures, especially given the current limitations of physical quantum hardware. This work focuses on studying and evaluating memory management strategies for scalable quantum state simulation. We examine full-state representation, dynamic state pruning, shared-memory parallelization with OpenMP, distributed memory execution using MPI, and error-bounded floating-point compression with ZFP. These techniques are implemented in a prototype simulator and assessed using the quantum Fourier transform as a benchmark, with performance compared against leading open-source simulators such as Intel-QS, QuEST, and qsim. The results show the trade-offs between computational overhead and memory efficiency, and demonstrate that hybrid approaches combining distributed memory and compression can significantly extend the number of qubits that can be simulated. This work contributes practical insights for improving the scalability of software quantum simulators on classical hardware through optimized memory usage.

TI Nanoscale single-electron box with a floating lead for quantum sensing:
   Modeling and device characterization
SO APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS
AB We present an in-depth analysis of a single-electron box (SEB) biased through a floating node technique that is common in charge-coupled devices. The device is analyzed and characterized in the context of single-electron charge sensing techniques for integrated silicon quantum dots (QD). The unique aspect of our SEB design is the incorporation of a metallic floating node, strategically employed for sensing and precise injection of electrons into an electrostatically formed QD. To analyze the SEB, we propose an extended multi-orbital Anderson impurity model (MOAIM), adapted to our nanoscale SEB system, that is used to predict theoretically the behavior of the SEB in the context of a charge sensing application. The validation of the model and the sensing technique has been carried out on a QD fabricated in a fully depleted silicon on insulator process (FD-SOI) on a 22-nm CMOS technology node. We demonstrate the MOAIM's efficacy in predicting the observed electronic behavior and elucidating the complex electron dynamics and correlations in the SEB. The results of our study reinforce the versatility and precision of the model in the realm of nanoelectronics and highlight the practical utility of the metallic floating node as a mechanism for charge injection and detection in integrated QDs. Finally, we identify the limitations of our model in capturing higher order effects observed in our measurements and propose future outlooks to reconcile some of these discrepancies.

TI Topological and conventional nanophotonic waveguides for directional
   integrated quantum optics
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Directionality in integrated quantum photonics has emerged as a promising route towards achieving scalable quantum technologies with nonlinearities at the single -photon level. Topological photonic waveguides have been proposed as a novel approach to harnessing such directional light -matter interactions on -chip. However, uncertainties remain regarding the strength of the directional coupling of embedded quantum emitters to topological waveguides in comparison to conventional line defect waveguides. In this work we present an investigation of directional coupling in a range of waveguides using a combination of experimental, theoretical, and numerical analyses. We quantitatively characterize the position dependence of the light -matter coupling on several topological photonic waveguides and benchmark their directional coupling performance against conventional line defect waveguides. We conclude that topological waveguides underperform in comparison to conventional line defect waveguides, casting their directional optics credentials into doubt. To demonstrate this is not a question of the maturity of the field; we show that state-of-the-art inverse design methods, while capable of improving the directional emission of these topological waveguides, still place them significantly behind the operation of a conventional (glide -plane) photonic crystal waveguide. Our results and conclusions pave the way towards improving the implementation of quantitatively predicted quantum nonlinear effects on -chip.

TI Hardness-dependent quantum adiabatic schedules for the
   maximum-independent-set problem
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB We propose a numerical approach to design highly efficient adiabatic schedules for analog quantum computing, focusing on the maximum-independent-set problem and neutral atom platforms. On the basis of a representative dataset of small graphs, we present numerical evidence that the optimum schedules depend principally on the hardness of the problem rather than on its size. These schedules perform better than the benchmark protocols and admit a straightforward implementation in the hardware. This allows us to extrapolate the results to larger graphs and to successfully solve moderately hard problems using QuEra's 256-qubit Aquila computer. We believe that extending our approach to hybrid algorithms could be the key to solving the hardest instances with the current technology, making yet another step toward real-world applications.

TI Combinatorial and rotational quantum abstract detecting systems
SO QUANTUM INFORMATION PROCESSING
AB Quantum abstract detecting systems (QADS) were introduced as a common framework for the study and design of detecting algorithms in a quantum computing setting. In this paper, we introduce new families of such QADS, known as combinatorial and rotational, which, respectively, generalize detecting systems based on single qubit controlled gates and on Grover's algorithm. We study the algorithmic closure of each family and prove that some of these QADS are equivalent (in the sense of having the same detection rate) to others constructed from tensor product of controlled operators and their square roots. We also apply the combinatorial QADS construction to a problem of eigenvalue decision, and to a problem of phase estimation.

TI Resource and stability near a critical point from the quantum
   information perspective
SO PHYSICS LETTERS B
AB In the presence of chemical potential and temperature, we holographically study subregion complexity in a non-conformal quantum field theory with a critical point. We propose a new interpretation according to which the states, needing (more) less information to be specified, characterize the (un) stable thermodynamical solutions. We observe the increasing and decreasing effects of chemical potential and temperature on holographic subregion complexity, respectively. These two opposite behaviors lead to a point where subregion complexity of the mixed state is the same as this value for a zero temperature conformal field theory. We also present a new description of the difference between the minimum and the maximum value (the value near the critical point) of holographic subregion complexity as a resource for doing computational work to prepare the state near the critical point from the state far from it. We also calculate the critical exponent. (c) 2023 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier B.V. This is an open access article under the CC BY license (http://creativecommons .org /licenses /by /4 .0/).

TI Proof of a Conjectured 0-Renyi Entropy Inequality With Applications to
   Multipartite Entanglement
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION THEORY
AB Characterizing the relations among the three bipartite reduced density operators ?AB, ?AC and ?BC of a tripartite mixed state ?ABC has been an open problem in quantum information. One of such relations has been reduced by [Cadney et al, LAA. 452, 153, 2014] to a conjectured inequality in terms of matrix rank, namely r(?AB) . r(?AC) = r(?BC) for any ?ABC. It is denoted as open problem 41 in the website "Open quantum problems-IQOQI Vienna". We prove the inequality, and thus establish a complete picture of the four-party linear inequalities in terms of the 0-entropy. Our proof is based on the construction of a novel canonical form of bipartite matrices under local equivalence. We extend our result to inequalities in multipartite systems, as well as the condition when the inequality is saturated.

TI Resonance Fluorescence from Waveguide-Coupled, Strain-Localized,
   Two-Dimensional Quantum Emitters
SO ACS PHOTONICS
AB Efficient on-chip integration of single-photon emitters imposes a major bottleneck for applications of photonic integrated circuits in quantum technologies. Resonantly excited solid-state emitters are emerging as near-optimal quantum light sources, if not for the lack of scalability of current devices. Current integration approaches rely on cost-inefficient individual emitter placement in photonic integrated circuits, rendering applications impossible. A promising scalable platform is based on two-dimensional (2D) semiconductors. However, resonant excitation and single-photon emission of waveguide-coupled 2D emitters have proven to be elusive. Here, we show a scalable approach using a silicon nitride photonic waveguide to simultaneously strain-localize single-photon emitters from a tungsten diselenide (WSe2) monolayer and to couple them into a waveguide mode. We demonstrate the guiding of single photons in the photonic circuit by measuring second-order autocorrelation of g((2))(0) = 0.150 +/- 0.093 and perform on-chip resonant excitation, yielding a g((2))(0) = 0.377 +/- 0.081. Our results are an important step to enable coherent control of quantum states and multiplexing of high-quality single photons in a scalable photonic quantum circuit.

TI Quantum enhanced radio detection and ranging with solid spins
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB The accurate radio frequency (RF) ranging and localizing of objects has benefited the researches including autonomous driving, the Internet of Things, and manufacturing. Quantum receivers have been proposed to detect the radio signal with ability that can outperform conventional measurement. As one of the most promising candidates, solid spin shows superior robustness, high spatial resolution and miniaturization. However, challenges arise from themoderate response to a high frequency RF signal. Here, by exploiting the coherent interaction between quantum sensor and RF field, we demonstrate quantum enhanced radio detection and ranging. The RF magnetic sensitivity is improved by three orders to 21 pT/ root Hz, based on nanoscale quantum sensing and RF focusing. Further enhancing the response of spins to the target's position through multi-photon excitation, a ranging accuracy of 16 mu m is realized with a GHz RF signal. The results pave the way for exploring quantum enhanced radar and communications with solid spins.

TI A Quantum Approach to the Problem of Charging Electric Cars on a
   Motorway
SO ENERGIES
AB In this paper, the problem of charging electric motor vehicles on a motorway is considered. Charging points are located alongside the motorway. It is assumed that there are a number of vehicles on a given section of a motorway. In the motorway, there are several nodes, and for each vehicle, the entering and the leaving nodes are known, as well as the time of entrance. For each vehicle, we know the total capacity of its battery, and the current amount of energy in the battery when entering the motorway. It is also assumed that for each vehicle, there is a finite set of speeds it can use when traveling the motorway. The speed is chosen when entering the motorway, and cannot be changed before reaching the charging station. For each speed, there is given a corresponding power usage; the higher the speed, the larger the power usage. Each vehicle can only use one charger, and when its battery is full, the amount of energy is sufficient for reaching the outgoing node. We look for a feasible solution to the problem, i.e., a solution in which no vehicle has to wait for a charger. The problem is formulated as a problem of scheduling independent, nonpreemptable jobs in parallel, unrelated machines under an additional doubly constrained resource, which is power. Quantum approaches to solve the defined problem are proposed. They use the quantum approximate optimization algorithm and the quantum annealing technique. A computational experiment is presented and discussed. Some conclusions and directions for future research are given.

TI Emergent complex quantum networks in continuous-variables non-Gaussian
   states
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB We use complex network theory to study a class of photonic continuous variable quantum states that present both multipartite entanglement and non-Gaussian statistics. We consider the intermediate scale of several dozens of modes at which such systems are already hard to characterize. In particular, the states are built from an initial imprinted cluster state created via Gaussian entangling operations according to a complex network structure. We then engender non-Gaussian statistics via multiple photon subtraction operations acting on a single node. We replicate in the quantum regime some of the models that mimic real-world complex networks in order to test their structural properties under local operations. We go beyond the already known single-mode effects, by studying the emergent network of photon-number correlations via complex networks measures. We analytically prove that the imprinted network structure defines a vicinity of nodes, at a distance of four steps from the photon-subtracted node, in which the emergent network changes due to photon subtraction. We show numerically that the emergent structure is greatly influenced by the structure of the imprinted network. Indeed, while the mean and the variance of the degree and clustering distribution of the emergent network always increase, the higher moments of the distributions are governed by the specific structure of the imprinted network. Finally, we show that the behaviour of nearest neighbours of the subtraction node depends on how they are connected to each other in the imprinted structure.

TI Non-Abelian braiding of graph vertices in a superconducting processor
SO NATURE
AB Indistinguishability of particles is a fundamental principle of quantum mechanics(1). For all elementary and quasiparticles observed to date-including fermions, bosons and Abelian anyons-this principle guarantees that the braiding of identical particles leaves the system unchanged(2,3). However, in two spatial dimensions, an intriguing possibility exists: braiding of non-Abelian anyons causes rotations in a space of topologically degenerate wavefunctions(4-8). Hence, it can change the observables of the system without violating the principle of indistinguishability. Despite the well-developed mathematical description of non-Abelian anyons and numerous theoretical proposals(9-22), the experimental observation of their exchange statistics has remained elusive for decades. Controllable many-body quantum states generated on quantum processors offer another path for exploring these fundamental phenomena. Whereas efforts on conventional solid-state platforms typically involve Hamiltonian dynamics of quasiparticles, superconducting quantum processors allow for directly manipulating the many-body wavefunction by means of unitary gates. Building on predictions that stabilizer codes can host projective non-Abelian Ising anyons(9,10), we implement a generalized stabilizer code and unitary protocol(23) to create and braid them. This allows us to experimentally verify the fusion rules of the anyons and braid them to realize their statistics. We then study the prospect of using the anyons for quantum computation and use braiding to create an entangled state of anyons encoding three logical qubits. Our work provides new insights about non-Abelian braiding and, through the future inclusion of error correction to achieve topological protection, could open a path towards fault-tolerant quantum computing.

TI Opportunities for diamond quantum metrology in biological systems
SO APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS
AB Sensors that harness quantum mechanical effects can enable high sensitivity and high spatial resolution probing of their environment. The nitrogen-vacancy defect in diamond, a single, optically accessible electronic spin, is a promising quantum sensor that can operate in soft and living systems and provides nanoscale spatial resolution when hosted inside a diamond nanoparticle. Nanodiamond quantum sensors are nontoxic, amenable to surface functionalization, and can be introduced into a variety of living systems. The optical readout of the spin provides detailed information about the local electromagnetic and thermal environment in a noninvasive way. In this Perspective, we introduce the different modalities that nanodiamond quantum sensors offer, highlight recent progress in quantum sensing of biological systems, and discuss remaining challenges and directions for future efforts.

AB Variational quantum algorithms have been one of the most intensively studied applications for near-term quantum computing applications. The noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) regime, where small enough algorithms can be run successfully on noisy quantum computers expected during the next 5 years, is driving both a large amount of research work and a significant amount of private sector funding. Therefore, it is important to understand whether variational algorithms are effective at successfully converging to the correct answer in presence of noise. We perform a comprehensive study of the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) and its individual quantum subroutines. Building on asymptotic bounds, we show through explicit simulation that the VQE algorithm effectively collapses already when single errors occur during a quantum processing call. We discuss the significant implications of this result in the context of being able to run any variational type algorithm without resource expensive error correction protocols.

TI A Hybrid Quantum-Classical Spectral Solver for Nonlinear Differential
   Equations
SO ALGORITHMS
AB We investigate hybrid quantum-classical solvers for nonlinear boundary value problems using Chebyshev spectral collocation. Unlike prior methods such as H-DES, which repeatedly recompile circuits and encode the entire spectral basis on the quantum processor, our framework offloads only the residual minimisation to a quantum backend while retaining classical enforcement of boundary conditions. Two paradigms are considered: (i) gate-based residual minimisation on CUDA-Q using variational circuits to evaluate a Cubic Unconstrained Binary Optimisation (CUBO) cost, which naturally arises from the discretisation, and (ii) a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimisation (QUBO) reformulation, which is required for execution on a quantum annealer, executed via a classical-quantum mapping. We further explore a CUBO extension on CUDA-Q and direct residual-to-energy mapping on annealers. Benchmarks confirm that the classical solver reproduces the analytic solution with spectral accuracy; among quantum-enhanced methods, the annealer-based QUBO yields the closest approximation. The gate-based CUBO solver improves upon a legacy variational baseline but exhibits a small interior bias due to limited circuit depth and precision. These findings underscore the complementary roles of annealers and gate-based devices in hybrid scientific computing and demonstrate a feasible workflow for the NISQ era rather than a speedup over classical methods. Recent progress in quantum algorithms for differential equations signals a rapidly maturing field with significant potential for practical quantum advantage.

TI Efficient vacuum-state preparation for quantum simulation of strongly
   interacting local quantum field theories
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We present an efficient approach for preparing ground states in the context of strongly interacting local quantum field theories on quantum computers. The approach produces the vacuum state in a time proportional to the square root of the volume, which is a square-root improvement in speed compared to traditional approaches. The approach exploits a method for traversing the path in parameter space in which the resources scale linearly with a path length suitably defined in parameter space. Errors due to practical limitations are controlled and do not exhibit secular growth along the path. The final accuracy can be arbitrarily improved with an additive cost, which is independent of the volume and grows slower than logarithmically with the overlap between the state produced and the exact ground state. We expect that the method could potentially hold practical value not only within the realm of quantum field theories but also in addressing other challenges involving long path lengths.

TI Entanglement between Muon and I &gt; 1/2 Nuclear Spins as a Probe
   of Charge Environment
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB We report on the first example of quantum coherence between the spins of muons and quadrupolar nuclei. We reveal that these entangled states are highly sensitive to a local charge environment and thus, can be deployed as a functional quantum sensor of that environment. The quantum coherence effect was observed in vanadium intermetallic compounds which adopt the A15 crystal structure, and whose members include all technologically pertinent superconductors. Furthermore, the extreme sensitivity of the entangled states to the local structural and electronic environments emerges through the quadrupolar interaction with the electric field gradient due to the charge distribution at the nuclear (I > 1/2) sites. This case study demonstrates that positive muons can be used as a quantum sensing tool to also probe structural and charge-related phenomena in materials, even in the absence of magnetic degrees of freedom.

TI Fast imaging of multimode transverse-spectral correlations for twin
   photons
SO OPTICS LETTERS
AB Hyperentangled photonic states-exhibiting nonclassical correlations in several degrees of freedom-offer improved performance of quantum optical communication and computation schemes. Experimentally, a hyperentanglement of transverse-wave-vector and spectral modes can be obtained in a straightforward way with multimode parametric single-photon sources. Nevertheless, experimental characterization of such states remains challenging. Not only single-photon detection with high spatial resolutiona single-photon camera-is required, but also a suitable mode converter to observe the spectral-temporal degree of freedom. We experimentally demonstrate a measurement of full four-dimensional transverse-wave-vector-spectral correlations between pairs of photons produced in noncollinear spontaneous parametric downconversion. Utilization of a custom ultrafast single-photon camera provides high resolution and a short measurement time.

TI Correcting for finite statistics effects in a quantum steering
   experiment
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Verifying entanglement between parties is essential for creating secure quantum communication. However, finite statistics can lead to false positive outcomes in any tests for entanglement. Here, we introduce a one-sided device-independent protocol that corrects for apparent signaling effects in experimental probability distributions, caused by statistical fluctuations and experimental imperfections. We use semidefinite programming to identify the optimal inequality, for our experimental probability distribution, without resource-intensive tomography. Our protocol is numerically and experimentally analyzed in the context of random, misaligned measurements, correcting apparent signaling where necessary. Our results show a significantly higher probability of violation than existing state-of-the-art inequalities. This study demonstrates the power of semidefinite programming for entanglement verification and brings quantum networks closer to practical applications.

TI Quantum simulation of the one-dimensional Fermi-Hubbard model as a Z2
   lattice-gauge theory
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB The Fermi-Hubbard model is one of the central paradigms in the physics of strongly correlated quantum many-body systems. Here we propose a quantum circuit algorithm based on the Z2 lattice gauge theory (LGT) representation of the one-dimensional Fermi-Hubbard model, which is suitable for implementation on current NISQ quantum computers. Within the LGT description there is an extensive number of local conserved quantities commuting with the Hamiltonian. We show how these conservation laws can be used to implement an efficient error-mitigation scheme. The latter is based on a postselection of states for noisy quantum simulators. While the LGT description requires a deeper quantum-circuit compared to a Jordan-Wigner (JW) based approach, remarkably, we find that our error-correction protocol leads to results being on par with a standard JW implementation on noisy quantum simulators.

TI Development of a thermodynamics of human cognition and human culture
SO PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY A-MATHEMATICAL PHYSICAL
   AND ENGINEERING SCIENCES
AB Inspired by foundational studies in classical and quantum physics, and by information retrieval studies in quantum information theory, we prove that the notions of 'energy' and 'entropy' can be consistently introduced in human language and, more generally, in human culture. More explicitly, if energy is attributed to words according to their frequency of appearance in a text, then the ensuing energy levels are distributed non-classically, namely, they obey Bose-Einstein, rather than Maxwell-Boltzmann, statistics, as a consequence of the genuinely 'quantum indistinguishability' of the words that appear in the text. Secondly, the 'quantum entanglement' due to the way meaning is carried by a text reduces the (von Neumann) entropy of the words that appear in the text, a behaviour which cannot be explained within classical (thermodynamic or information) entropy. We claim here that this 'quantum-type behaviour is valid in general in human language', namely, any text is conceptually more concrete than the words composing it, which entails that the entropy of the overall text decreases. In addition, we provide examples taken from cognition, where quantization of energy appears in categorical perception, and from culture, where entities collaborate, thus 'entangle', to decrease overall entropy. We use these findings to propose the development of a new 'non-classical thermodynamic theory' for human cognition, which also covers broad parts of human culture and its artefacts and bridges concepts with quantum physics entities.This article is part of the theme issue 'Thermodynamics 2.0: Bridging the natural and social sciences (Part 2)'.

TI Iterated nth order nonlinear quantum dynamics with mixed initial states
SO PHYSICS LETTERS A
AB Nonlinear quantum transformations play an important role in quantum state distillation, aiding quantum communication schemes. The simplest of these involve quadratic rational maps for qubits, higher order versions have not been explored in detail. We consider such iterated nonlinear protocols for qubits, involving a generalized CNOT, a measurement, and a single-qubit Hadamard gate processing n inputs in identical quantum states. To characterize the global properties of these protocols, we determine the fixed points and relevant fixed cycles. We show that a repelling mixed fixed point exists for all orders, marking a phase transition related to the disappearance of the fractalness of borders of different basins of attraction.

TI Influence of intrinsic decoherence on quantum metrology of two atomic
   systems in the presence of dipole-dipole interaction
SO OPTICAL AND QUANTUM ELECTRONICS
AB We study the dynamics behavior of a two atomic qubits (two two-level atoms) exposed to a dipole-dipole interaction (DDI) under rotating wave approximation (RWA). Each atom resonantly interacts with the vacuum cavity field via one-photon hopping. We assume that the two atoms and field are initially prepared in their excited state and vacuum state, respectively. An exact solution of Milburn equation is given, and then we study a non-classical statistical properties in the full range of decoherence parameters. In the absence and presence of intrinsic decoherence, the influence of dipole-dipole interaction (DDI) on the degree of entanglement between atom-field and atom-atom are evaluated through different entanglement measures, namely, von Neumann reduced entropy and concurrence, respectively. The influence of DDI on geometrical quantum discord (GQD) are discussed. Furthermore, we estimate the sensitive of the atomic system under variation of DDI parameter via the quantum Fisher information.

TI Landscape of quantum information science and engineering education: From
   physics foundations to interdisciplinary frontiers
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW PHYSICS EDUCATION RESEARCH
AB Quantum information science and engineering (QISE) is rapidly gaining interest from those within many disciplines, and higher education needs to adapt to the changing landscape. Although QISE education still has a strong presence and roots in physics, the field is becoming increasingly interdisciplinary. There is a need to understand the presence of QISE instruction and quantum-related instruction across all disciplines in order to figure out where QISE education is already happening and where it could be expanded. Although there is recent work that characterizes introductory QISE courses, there is no holistic picture of the landscape of QISE and quantum-related education in the United States. To understand how QISE education is evolving, we analyzed course catalogs from 1456 U. S. institutions. We found 61 institutions offering QISE degree programs, mostly at Ph.D.-granting schools, with interdisciplinary programs being the most common. Physics, electrical and computer engineering, and computer science are the primary contributors to these programs. Across all institutions, we identified over 8000 courses mentioning "quantum," mainly in physics and chemistry departments, but about one-third of institutions in our study had none. We also found over 500 dedicated QISE courses, concentrated in Ph. D.-granting institutions, primarily in physics, electrical and computer engineering, and computer science. Physics leads in offering both general quantum-related courses (similar to 4700) and QISE-specific courses (similar to 200). While quantum knowledge is often a prerequisite for QISE, there are efforts to make QISE education more accessible to students with less background in quantum mechanics. Across multiple disciplines, we also see that QISE topics are being introduced in courses not fully dedicated to QISE, which may be a productive strategy for increasing students' access to QISE education. Our dataset and analysis provide the most comprehensive overview to date of quantum education across U.S. higher education. Additionally, this work is the first to address, in detail, the landscape of quantum content in two-year and community colleges and examines the largest set of MSIs in this context. We hope these findings will support and guide future efforts in curriculum design, workforce development, and education policy across the quantum ecosystem.

TI Enhancing the teleportation of quantum Fisher information under
   correlated generalized amplitude damping noise
SO RESULTS IN PHYSICS
AB The generalized amplitude damping (GAD) noise models the dynamical map of a qubit in contact with a non-zero temperature bosonic reservoir. When two qubits successively pass through the same GAD channel, correlation effects should be taken into account. Therefore, the dynamical map is modeled as correlated GAD (CGAD) noise. In this paper, we investigate the teleportation of quantum Fisher information (QFI) under CGAD noise. We first show that the correlation effects in CGAD noise can enhance the teleported QFI. We then present two probabilistic schemes to improve the teleportation of QFI in CGAD noise by weak measurement (WM) and environment-assisted measurement (EAM). We find the correlation effects of CGAD noise serve to improve the teleportation of QFI and increase the probability of success. Contrary to intuition, the thermal average photon number n does not always play a negative role in our probabilistic schemes. Although a larger n will cause the teleported QFI to decay faster, the corresponding probability of success will be higher. Finally, we introduce a quantity called average QFI to demonstrate that the EAM scheme is superior to the WM scheme with respect to QFI improvement under CGAD noise.

TI Transmission of coherent information at the onset of interactions
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS A-MATHEMATICAL AND THEORETICAL
AB In this work, we investigate the parameters governing the rate at which a quantum channel arises at the onset of an interaction between two systems, A and B. In particular, when system A is pre-entangled with an ancilla, A, we quantify the early-time transmission of pre-existing entanglement by calculating the leading order change in coherent information of the complementary channel (A -> B'). We show that, when A and B are initially unentangled and B is pure, there is no change in coherent information to first order, while the leading (second) order change is divergent. However, this divergence may be regulated by embedding the conventional notion of coherent information into what we call the family of n-coherent informations, defined using n-Renyi entropies. We find that the rate of change of the n-coherent information at the onset of the interaction is governed by a quantity, which we call the n-exposure, which captures the extent to which the initial coherent information of A with (A) over tilde is exposed to or 'seen by' the interaction Hamiltonian between A and B. We give examples in qubit systems and in the light-matter interaction.

TI Conditional quantum operation of two exchange-coupled single-donor spin
   qubits in a MOS-compatible silicon device
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Silicon nanoelectronic devices can host single-qubit quantum logic operations with fidelity better than 99.9%. For the spins of an electron bound to a single-donor atom, introduced in the silicon by ion implantation, the quantum information can be stored for nearly 1 second. However, manufacturing a scalable quantum processor with this method is considered challenging, because of the exponential sensitivity of the exchange interaction that mediates the coupling between the qubits. Here we demonstrate the conditional, coherent control of an electron spin qubit in an exchange-coupled pair of P-31 donors implanted in silicon. The coupling strength, J = 32.06 0.06 MHz, is measured spectroscopically with high precision. Since the coupling is weaker than the electron-nuclear hyperfine coupling A approximate to 90 MHz which detunes the two electrons, a native two-qubit controlled-rotation gate can be obtained via a simple electron spin resonance pulse. This scheme is insensitive to the precise value of J, which makes it suitable for the scale-up of donor-based quantum computers in silicon that exploit the metal-oxide-semiconductor fabrication protocols commonly used in the classical electronics industry. Operating donor-based quantum computers in silicon is hindered by the dependence of inter-qubit coupling on the precise donor position. Here, the authors show controlled rotation operation on exchange-coupled electron spins in the weak-exchange regime, loosening the requirements on positioning precision.

TI Enhancing quantum sensing performance by optimizing the concentration
   and dephasing time of the NV ensemble in CVD-diamond
SO OPTICAL MATERIALS EXPRESS
AB The negatively charged nitrogen-vacancy (NV-) center ensembles in diamonds offer enormous potential for developing integrated sensors with an improved signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and high sensitivity. However, the preparation and treatment of diamond samples with suitable NV- concentrations and dephasing time have remained challenging. This work provided insight into the NV- center formation mechanism and reconstruction via a comprehensive analysis of the concentration and dephasing time of a set of diamond samples treated by various parameters. By varying the electron irradiation dose and subsequent annealing duration, the conversion rate of nitrogen to NV- is up to 18.45%, and the corresponding maximum NV- concentration is 3.69 ppm. The dephasing time for all samples varies around 300 ns. The nitrogen-related NV- center ensemble dephasing rate per unit density is 146.4 (ppm center dot ms)-1, indicating that the treatment did not substantially alter the paramagnetic spin environment around the NV- center. This study not only offers support to exquisite sensitivities of NV-based sensors but also provides valuable experience for the preparation of unique properties of synthetic diamonds.

TI Tight qubit uncertainty relations studied through weak values in neutron
   interferometry
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB In its original formulation, Heisenberg's uncertainty principle describes a trade-off relation between the error of a quantum measurement and the thereby induced disturbance on the measured object. However, this relation is not valid in general. An alternative universally valid relation was derived by Ozawa in 2003, defining error and disturbance in a general concept, experimentally accessible via a tomographic method. Later, it was shown by Hall that these errors correspond to the statistical deviation between a physical property and its estimate. Recently, it was discovered that these errors can be observed experimentally when weak values are determined through a procedure named "feedback compensation." Here, we apply this procedure for the complete experimental characterization of the error-disturbance relation between a which-way observable in an interferometer and another observable associated with the output of the interferometer, confirming the theoretically predicted relation. As expected for pure states, the uncertainty is tightly fulfilled.

TI Quantum simulation of the spin-2 1 XYZ model using solid-state spin
   centers
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB In this work we propose a solid-state platform for creating quantum simulators based on implanted spin centers in semiconductors. We show that under the presence of an external magnetic field, an array of S = 1 spin centers interacting through magnetic dipole-dipole interaction can be mapped into an effective spin-half system equivalent to the XYZ model in an external magnetic field. Interestingly, this system presents a wide range of quantum phases and critical behaviors that can be controlled via magnetic field and orientational arrangement of the spin centers. We demonstrate our interacting spin chain can be tuned to both isotropic Heisenberg model and transverse-field Ising universality class. Notably, our model contains a line where the system is in a critical floating phase that terminates at Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless and Pokrovsky-Talapov transition points. We propose this system as a solid-state quantum simulator for the floating phase based on spin centers.

TI Entanglement in Lifshitz fermion theories
SO JOURNAL OF HIGH ENERGY PHYSICS
AB We study the static entanglement structure in (1+1)-dimensional free Dirac-fermion theory with Lifshitz symmetry and arbitrary integer dynamical critical exponent. This model is different from the one introduced in [Hartmann et al., SciPost Phys.11 (2021) 031] due to a proper treatment of the square Laplace operator. Dirac fermion Lifshitz theory is local as opposed to its scalar counterpart which strongly affects its entanglement structure. We show that there is quantum entanglement across arbitrary subregions in various pure (including the vacuum) and mixed states of this theory for arbitrary integer values of the dynamical critical exponent. Our numerical investigations show that quantum entanglement in this theory is tightly bounded from above. Such a bound and other physical properties of quantum entanglement are carefully explained from the correlation structure in these theories. A generalization to (2+1)-dimensions where the entanglement structure is seriously different is addressed.

TI Quantum interference with independent single-photon sources over 300 km
   fiber
SO ADVANCED PHOTONICS
AB In the quest to realize a scalable quantum network, semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) offer distinct advantages, including high single-photon efficiency and indistinguishability, high repetition rate (tens of gigahertz with Purcell enhancement), interconnectivity with spin qubits, and a scalable on-chip platform. However, in the past two decades, the visibility of quantum interference between independent QDs rarely went beyond the classical limit of 50%, and the distances were limited from a few meters to kilometers. Here, we report quantum interference between two single photons from independent QDs separated by a 302 km optical fiber. The single photons are generated from resonantly driven single QDs deterministically coupled to microcavities. Quantum frequency conversions are used to eliminate the QD inhomogeneity and shift the emission wavelength to the telecommunication band. The observed interference visibility is 0.67 +/- 0.02 (0.93 +/- 0.04) without (with) temporal filtering. Feasible improvements can further extend the distance to similar to 600 km. Our work represents a key step to long-distance solid-state quantum networks.

What is the implication of the main finding? The proposed taxonomy and cross-layer evaluation guide future research on energy-aware and quantum-resilient cryptographic integration in UAV networks. Insights from this work promote the development of interoperable and scalable security architectures to support safe UAV operations across diverse civilian and military missions.Abstract Deployment of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) continues to expand rapidly across a wide range of applications, including environmental monitoring, precision agriculture, and disaster response. Despite their increasing ubiquity, UAVs remain inherently vulnerable to security threats due to resource-constrained hardware, energy limitations, and reliance on open wireless communication channels. These factors render traditional cryptographic solutions impractical, thereby necessitating the development of lightweight, UAV-specific security mechanisms. This review article presents a comprehensive analysis of lightweight encryption techniques and key management strategies designed for energy-efficient and secure UAV communication. Special emphasis is placed on recent cryptographic advancements, including the adoption of the ASCON family of ciphers and the emergence of post-quantum algorithms that can secure UAV networks against future quantum threats. Key management techniques such as blockchain-based decentralized key exchange, Physical Unclonable Function (PUF)-based authentication, and hierarchical clustering schemes are evaluated for their performance and scalability. To ensure comprehensive protection, this review introduces a multilayer security framework addressing vulnerabilities from the physical to the application layer. Comparative analysis of lightweight cryptographic algorithms and multiple key distribution approaches is conducted based on energy consumption, latency, memory usage, and deployment feasibility in dynamic aerial environments. Unlike design- or implementation-focused studies, this work synthesizes existing literature across six interconnected security dimensions to provide an integrative foundation. Our review also identifies key research challenges, including secure and efficient rekeying during flight, resilience to cross-layer attacks, and the need for standardized frameworks supporting post-quantum cryptography in UAV swarms.
   By highlighting current advancements and research gaps, this study aims to guide future efforts in developing secure communication architectures tailored to the unique operational constraints of UAV networks.

TI Defining quantum divergences via convex optimization
SO QUANTUM
AB We introduce a new quantum Renyi divergence D-alpha(#) for alpha is an element of (1, infinity) defined in terms of a convex optimization program. This divergence has several desirable computational and operational properties such as an efficient semidefinite programming representation for states and channels, and a chain rule property. An important property of this new divergence is that its regularization is equal to the sandwiched (also known as the minimal) quantum Renyi divergence. This allows us to prove several results. First, we use it to get a converging hierarchy of upper bounds on the regularized sandwiched alpha-Renyi divergence between quantum channels for alpha > 1. Second it allows us to prove a chain rule property for the sandwiched alpha-Renyi divergence for alpha > 1 which we use to characterize the strong converse exponent for channel discrimination. Finally it allows us to get improved bounds on quantum channel capacities.

TI Experimental test of entropic noise-disturbance uncertainty relations
   for three-outcome qubit measurements
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Information-theoretic uncertainty relations formulate the joint immeasurability of two noncommuting observables in terms of information entropies. The tradeoff of the accuracy in the outcome of two successive measurements manifests in entropic noise-disturbance uncertainty relations. Recent theoretical analysis predicts that projective measurements are not optimal, with respect to the noise-disturbance tradeoffs. Therefore, the results in our previous paper [Phys. Rev. Lea. 115, 030401 (2015)] are outperformed by general quantum measurements. Here, we experimentally test a tight information-theoretic measurement uncertainty relation for three-outcome positive-operator-valued measures, using neutron spin-1/2 qubits. The obtained results violate the lower bound for projective measurements as theoretically predicted.

TI Dependence of the recoherence times and recoherence increments on the
   state of phonon bath in a single-qubit dephasing model
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB The recoherence times t & lowast; and the maximum values of the recoherence increments gamma extr are studied as functions of the bath parameters for a single qubit dephasing model, prepared initially by a special kind of the nonselective measurements. The recoherence-decoherence events (RDE), occurring at the initial stage of the system evolution, are found to be both similar and different from the system dynamics at large times. For instance, in contrast to the RDE observed on large timescales, the sub-Ohmic and Ohmic coupling regimes are more favorable for the short-time recoherence than the super-Ohmic one. On the other hand, the short-time behavior of the recoherence and the long-time dynamics of the decoherence are closely related: The domain of the ohmicity indexes, where the decoherence changes its type (from the complete to incomplete one), is, simultaneously, that of the weakest recoherence. The obtained results give us some hints about the basic characteristics of the environment, which might provide the most optimal values of t & lowast; and gamma extr in some sense.

TI Quantum Metrology for Non-Markovian Processes
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Quantum metrology is a rapidly developing branch of quantum technologies. While various theories have been established on quantum metrology for Markovian processes, i.e., quantum channel estimation, quantum metrology for non-Markovian processes is much less explored. In this Letter, we establish a general framework of non-Markovian quantum metrology. For any parametrized non-Markovian process on a finite-dimensional system, we derive a formula for the maximal amount of quantum Fisher information that can be extracted from it by an optimally controlled probe state. In addition, we design an algorithm that evaluates this quantum Fisher information via semidefinite programming. We apply our framework to noisy frequency estimation, where we find that the optimal performance of quantum metrology is better in the non-Markovian scenario than in the Markovian scenario and explore the possibility of efficient sensing via simple variational circuits.

TI Local certification of unitary operations
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB In this work, we analyze the local certification of unitary quantum channels, which is a natural extension of quantum hypothesis testing. A particular case of a quantum channel operating on two systems corresponding to product states at the input, is considered. The goal is to minimize the probability of the type II error, given a specified maximum probability of the type I error, considering assistance through entanglement with auxiliary systems. Our result indicates connection of the local certification problem with a product numerical range of unitary matrices. We show that the optimal local strategy does not need usage of auxiliary systems and requires only single round of one-way classical communication. Moreover, we compare local and global certification strategies and show that typically local strategies are optimal, yet in some extremal cases, where global strategies make no errors, local ones may fail miserably. Finally, some application for local certification of von Neumann measurements are discussed as well.

AB The approximate stabilizer rank of a quantum state is the minimum number of terms in any approximate decomposition of that state into stabilizer states. Bravyi and Gosset showed that the approximate stabilizer rank of a so-called magic state like |T >(circle times n), up to polynomial factors, is an upper bound on the number of classical operations required to simulate an arbitrary quantum circuit with Clifford gates and n number of T gates. As a result, an exponential lower bound on this quantity seems inevitable. Despite this intuition, several attempts using various techniques could not lead to a better than a linear lower bound on the exact rank of |T >(circle times n), meaning the minimal size of a decomposition that exactly produces the state. For the approximate rank, which is more realistically related to the cost of simulating quantum circuits, no lower bound better than Omega((SIC))(root n) has been known. In this paper, we improve the lower bound on the approximate rank to Omega((SIC))(n(2)) for a wide range of the approximation parameters. An immediate corollary of our result is the existence of polynomial time computable functions which require a super-linear number of terms in any decomposition into exponentials of quadratic forms over F-2, resolving a question by Williams. Our approach is based on a strong lower bound on the approximate rank of a quantum state sampled from the Haar measure, a step-by-step analysis of the approximate rank of a magic-state teleportation protocol to sample from the Haar measure, and a result about trading Clifford operations with T gates.

TI Multiple-Valued Logic Modelling for Agents Controlled via Optical
   Networks
SO APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
AB The methods of data verification are discussed, which are intended for the distant control of autonomous mobile robotic agents via networks, combining optical data links. The problem of trust servers is considered for position verification and position-based cryptography tasks. In order to obtain flexible quantum and classical verification procedures, one should use the collective interaction of agents and network nodes, including some elements of the blockchain. Multiple-valued logic functions defined within discrete k-valued Allen-Givone algebra are proposed for the logically linked list of entries and the distributed ledger, which can be used for distant data verification and breakdown restoration in mobile agents with the help of partner network nodes. A distributed ledger scheme involves the assigning by distant partners of random hash values, which further can be used as keys for access to a set of distributed data storages, containing verification and restoration data. Multiple-valued logic procedures are simple and clear enough for high-dimensional logic modelling and for the design of combined quantum and classical protocols.

AB Lattice problems are a class of optimization problems that are notably hard. There are no classical or quantum algorithms known to solve these problems efficiently. Their hardness has made lattices a major cryptographic primitive for post-quantum cryptography. Several different approaches have been used for lattice problems with different computational profiles; some suffer from super-exponential time, and others require exponential space. This motivated us 10 develop a novel lattice problem solver, CMAP-LAP, based on the clever coordination of different algorithms that run massively in parallel. With our flexible framework, heterogeneous modules run asynchronously in parallel on a large-scale distributed system while exchanging information, which drastically boosts the overall performance. We also implement full checkpoint-and-restart functionality, which is vital to high-dimensional lattice problems. CMAP-LAP facilitates the implementation of large-scale parallel strategies for lattice problems since all the functions are designed to he customizable and abstract. Through numerical experiments with up to 103,680 cores, we evaluated the performance and stability of our system and demonstrated its high capability for future massive-scale experiments.

TI Quantum Random Access Memory Architectures Using 3D Superconducting
   Cavities
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Quantum random access memory (QRAM) is a common architecture resource for algorithms with many proposed applications, including quantum chemistry, windowed quantum arithmetic, unstructured search, machine learning, and quantum cryptography. Here, we propose two bucket -brigade QRAM architectures based on high -coherence superconducting resonators, which differ in their realizations of the conditional -routing operations. In the first, we directly construct cavity -controlled controlled - SWAP ( CSWAP ) operations, while in the second, we utilize the properties of giant -unidirectional emitters (GUEs). For both architectures, we analyze singleand dual -rail implementations of a bosonic qubit. In the singlerail encoding, we can detect first -order ancilla errors, while the dual -rail encoding additionally allows for the detection of photon losses. For parameter regimes of interest, the postselected infidelity of a QRAM query in a dual -rail architecture is nearly an order of magnitude below that of a corresponding query in a single -rail architecture. These findings suggest that dual -rail encodings are particularly attractive as architectures for QRAM devices in the era before fault tolerance.

TI Generation of a time-bin Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger state with an
   optical switch
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Multipartite entanglement is a critical resource in quantum information processing that exhibits much richer phenomenon and stronger correlations than in bipartite systems. This advantage is also reflected in its multi-user applications. Although many demonstrations have used photonic polarization qubits, polarization-mode dispersion confines the transmission of photonic polarization qubits through an optical fiber. Consequently, time-bin qubits have a particularly important role to play in quantum communication systems. Here, we generate a three-photon time-bin Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) state using a 2 x 2 optical switch as a time-dependent beam splitter to entangle time-bin Bell states from a spontaneous parametric down-conversion source and a weak coherent pulse. To characterize the three-photon time-bin GHZ state, we performed measurement estimation, showed a violation of the Mermin inequality, and used quantum state tomography to fully reconstruct a density matrix, which shows a state fidelity exceeding 70%. We expect that our three-photon time-bin GHZ state can be used for long-distance multi-user quantum communication.

TI Symmetry-Enforced Entanglement in Maximally Mixed States
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Entanglement in quantum many-body systems is typically fragile to interactions with the environment. Generic unital quantum channels, for example, have the maximally mixed state with no entanglement as their unique steady state. However, we find that for a unital quantum channel that is "strongly symmetric," i.e., it preserves a global on-site symmetry, the maximally mixed steady state in certain symmetry sectors can be highly entangled. For a given symmetry, we analyze the entanglement and correlations of the maximally mixed state in the invariant sector (MMIS) and show that the entanglement of formation and distillation are exactly computable and equal for any bipartition. For all Abelian symmetries, the MMIS is separable and for all non-Abelian symmetries, the MMIS is entangled. Remarkably, for non-Abelian continuous symmetries described by compact semisimple Lie groups (e.g., SU(2)), the bipartite entanglement of formation for the MMIS scales logarithmically with the number of qudits N.

TI Solving linear systems on quantum hardware with hybrid HHL++
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB The limited capabilities of current quantum hardware significantly constrain the scale of experimental demonstrations of most quantum algorithmic primitives. This makes it challenging to perform benchmarking of the current hardware using useful quantum algorithms, i.e., application-oriented benchmarking. In particular, the Harrow-Hassidim-Lloyd (HHL) algorithm is a critical quantum linear algebra primitive, but the majority of the components of HHL are far out of the reach of noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices, which has led to the proposal of hybrid classical-quantum variants. The goal of this work is to further bridge the gap between proposed near-term friendly implementations of HHL and the kinds of quantum circuits that can be executed on noisy hardware. Our proposal adds to the existing literature of hybrid quantum algorithms for linear algebra that are more compatible with the current scale of quantum devices. Specifically, we propose two modifications to the Hybrid HHL algorithm proposed by Lee et al., leading to our algorithm Hybrid HHL++: (1) propose a novel algorithm for determining a scaling factor for the linear system matrix that maximizes the utility of the amount of ancillary qubits allocated to the phase estimation component of HHL, and (2) introduce a heuristic for compressing the HHL circuit. We demonstrate the efficacy of our work by running our modified Hybrid HHL on Quantinuum System Model H-series trapped-ion quantum computers to solve different problem instances of small-scale portfolio optimization problems, leading to the largest experimental demonstrations of HHL for an application to date.

AB We consider the kinematics of bipartite quantum states as determined by observable quantities, in particular the Bloch vectors of the subsystems. In examining the simplest case of a pair of two-level systems, there is a remarkable connection between the presence of non-classical correlations and the chirality of the two bases generated by the singular value decomposition of the correlation matrix of the Bloch vectors. We investigate the limits imposed by quantum mechanics of this effect and its relationship with other methods on quantifying the system's non-classical behavior. (c) 2022 Optica Publishing Group

AB Featured Application The integrated-information measure Phi provides a practical tool for quantifying multipartite entanglement and identifying modular structures in many-body quantum states, thereby guiding tensor-network decompositions and variational ans & auml;tze. In quantum computing, Phi can suggest optimal qubit partitions to minimize information loss in error-correction procedures and inform distributed algorithm design. By constructing integration dendrograms, one can visualize hierarchical correlation patterns in quantum simulators and, speculatively, infer functional clusters in quantum-inspired models of neural networks.Abstract We introduce a quantum integrated-information measure Phi for multipartite states within the Relational Quantum Dynamics (RQD) framework. Phi(rho) is defined as the minimum quantum Jensen-Shannon distance between an n-partite density operator rho and any product state over a bipartition of its subsystems. We prove that its square root induces a genuine metric on state space and that Phi is monotonic under all completely positive trace-preserving maps. Restricting the search to bipartitions yields a unique optimal split and a unique closest product state. From this geometric picture, we derive a canonical entanglement witness directly tied to Phi and construct an integration dendrogram that reveals the full hierarchical correlation structure of rho. We further show that there always exists an "optimal observer"-a channel or basis-that preserves Phi better than any alternative. Finally, we propose a quantum Markov blanket theorem: the boundary of the optimal bipartition isolates subsystems most effectively. Our framework unites categorical enrichment, convex-geometric methods, and operational tools, forging a concrete bridge between integrated information theory and quantum information science.

AB Physical attacks are serious threats to cryptosystems deployed in the real world. In this work, we propose a microarchitectural end-to-end attack methodology on generic lattice-based post-quantum key encapsulation mechanisms to recover the long-term secret key. Our attack targets a critical component of a Fujisaki-Okamoto transform that is used in the construction of almost all lattice-based key encapsulation mechanisms. We demonstrate our attack model on practical schemes such as Kyber and Saber by using Rowhammer. We show that our attack is highly practical and imposes little preconditions on the attacker to succeed. As an additional contribution, we propose an improved version of the plaintext checking oracle, which is used by almost all physical attack strategies on lattice-based key-encapsulation mechanisms. Our improvement reduces the number of queries to the plaintext checking oracle by as much as 39% for Saber and approximately 23% for Kyber768. This can be of independent interest and can also be used to reduce the complexity of other attacks.

TI Deterministic Search on Complete Bipartite Graphs by Continuous-Time
   Quantum Walk
SO QUANTUM INFORMATION & COMPUTATION
AB How to design deterministic spatial search algorithms is a difficult but important problem. This paper presents a deterministic search algorithm on complete bipartite graphs with optimal runtime scaling. Our algorithm adopts the simple form of alternating iterations of an oracle and a continuous-time quantum walk operator, which is a generalization of Grover's search algorithm. To address the case of the number of marked vertices being unknown, we construct a quantum counting algorithm based on the spectrum structure of the search operator. This is a non-trivial example of quantum counting for spatial search. To implement the continuous-time quantum walk operator, we perform Hamiltonian simulation in the quantum circuit model and simulate it on the IBM quantum computing platform Qiskit.

TI Observation of quantum nonlocality in Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger
   entanglement on a silicon
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Nonlocality is the defining feature of quantum entanglement. Entangled states with multiple particles are of crucial importance in fundamental tests of quantum physics as well as in many quantum information tasks. One of the archetypal multipartite quantum states, Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) state, allows one to observe the striking conflict of quantum physics to local realism in the so-called all -versus -nothing way. This is profoundly different from Bell's theorem for two particles, which relies on statistical predictions. Here, we demonstrate an integrated photonic chip capable of generating and manipulating the four -photon GHZ state. We perform a complete characterization of the four -photon GHZ state using quantum state tomography and obtain a state fidelity of 0.729 +/- 0.006. We further use the all -versus -nothing test and the Mermin inequalities to witness the quantum nonlocality of GHZ entanglement. Our work paves the way to perform fundamental tests of quantum physics with complex integrated quantum devices.

TI Quantum k-uniform states for heterogeneous systems from
   irredundant mixed orthogonal arrays
SO QUANTUM INFORMATION PROCESSING
AB Quantum multipartite entangled states play significant roles in quantum information processing. By using difference schemes and orthogonal partitions, we construct a series of infinite classes of irredundant mixed orthogonal arrays (IrMOAs) and thus provide positive answers to two open problems. The first is the extension of the method for constructing homogeneous systems from orthogonal arrays to heterogeneous multipartite systems with different individual levels. The second is the existence of k-uniform states in heterogeneous quantum systems. We present explicit constructions of two- and three-uniform states for arbitrary heterogeneous multipartite systems with coprime individual levels and characterize the entangled states in heterogeneous systems consisting of subsystems with nonprime power dimensions as well. Moreover, we obtain infinite classes of k-uniform states for heterogeneous multipartite systems for any k >= 2. The non-existence of a class of IrMOAs is also proved.

TI Coexistence Demonstration and Wavelength Dependency Analysis of S-Band
   CV-QKD Signal with Fully Loaded C plus L-Band DWDM Signals
SO ENTROPY
AB We demonstrated the coexistence of an S-band CV-QKD signal with fully loaded C+L-band classical signals for the first time. The secret key rate of the S-band QKD system was 986 kbps with the C+L-band WDM signals transmitted through a 20 km G.654.E fiber link. We also revealed that the S-band CV-QKD performance limiting factor under the C+L-band WDM condition is the spontaneous Raman scattering light similar to the C-band CV-QKD performance limiting factor, confirming the validity of estimating the wavelength dependency of the secret key rate under the WDM condition from the fiber loss and the spontaneous Raman scattering light power. These results show that the CV-QKD performance under the C+L band WDM conditions becomes comparable to that under the C-band WDM conditions by wavelength design in the S-band.

TI Structural analysis of code-based algorithms of the NIST post-quantum
   call
SO LOGIC JOURNAL OF THE IGPL
AB Code-based cryptography is currently the second most promising post-quantum mathematical tool for quantum-resistant algorithms. Since in 2022 the first post-quantum standard Key Encapsulation Mechanism, Kyber (a latticed-based algorithm), was selected to be established as standard, and after that the National Institute of Standards and Technology post-quantum standardization call focused in code-based cryptosystems. Three of the four candidates that remain in the fourth round are code-based algorithms. In fact, the only non-code-based algorithm (SIKE) is now considered vulnerable. Due to this landscape, it is crucial to update previous results about these algorithms and their functioning. The Fujisaki-Okamoto transformation is a key part of the study of post-quantum algorithms and in this work we focus our analysis on Classic McEliece, BIKE and HQC proposals, and how they apply this transformation to obtain IND-CCA semantic security. Since after security the most important parameter in the evaluation of the algorithms is performance, we have compared the performance of the code-based algorithms of the NIST call considering the same architecture for all of them.

TI Quantum block coherence with respect to projective measurements
SO CHINESE PHYSICS B
AB Quantum coherence serves as a defining characteristic of quantum mechanics, finding extensive applications in quantum computing and quantum communication processing. This study explores quantum block coherence in the context of projective measurements, focusing on the quantification of such coherence. Firstly, we define the correlation function between the two general projective measurements P and Q, and analyze the connection between sets of block incoherent states related to two compatible projective measurements P and Q. Secondly, we discuss the measure of quantum block coherence with respect to projective measurements. Based on a given measure of quantum block coherence, we characterize the existence of maximal block coherent states through projective measurements. This research integrates the compatibility of projective measurements with the framework of quantum block coherence, contributing to the advancement of block coherence measurement theory.

TI Compact generation scheme of path-frequency hyperentangled photons using
   2D periodical nonlinear photonic crystal
SO CHINESE PHYSICS B
AB Hyperentanglement is a promising resource for achieving high capacity quantum communication. Here, we propose a compact scheme for the generation of path-frequency hyperentangled photon pairs via spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) processes, where six different paths and two different frequencies are covered. A two-dimensional periodical chi (2) nonlinear photonic crystal (NPC) is designed to satisfy type-I quasi-phase-matching conditions in the plane perpendicular to the incident pump beam, and a perfect phase match is achieved along the pump beam's direction to ensure high conversion efficiency, with theoretically estimated photon flux up to 2.068 x 105 pairs & sdot;s-1 & sdot;mm-2. We theoretically calculate the joint-spectral amplitude (JSA) of the generated photon pair and perform Schmidt decomposition on it, where the resulting entropy S of entanglement and effective Schmidt rank K reach 3.2789 and 6.4675, respectively. Our hyperentangled photon source scheme could provide new avenues for high-dimensional quantum communication and high-speed quantum information processing.

TI Integrated Broadband Mode Division Demultiplexer in Waveguide Arrays
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB On-chip mode division (de)multiplexing plays a significant role in integrated devices to greatly improve communication capacity. One of the goals of mode division (de)multiplexing is to realize devices with larger bandwidth and better fabrication tolerance. However, integrated broadband mode division (de)multiplexing devices have rarely been reported up to now. In this work, we experimentally realize a broadband mode division demultiplexing device with a high degree of fabrication tolerance based on a lithium niobate-on-insulator waveguide array. By taking advantage of the fact that different modes in the waveguide array have different group velocities, we experimentally confirm that different modes in the waveguide array have different transverse displacements. The implementation of the integrated broadband mode division demultiplexer may have future applications in information processing technology, quantum communication, and quantum computing.

TI Synthesis of a reversible quantum Vedic multiplier on IBM quantum
   computers
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Quantum computers provide considerable potential to enhance computing technology, anticipated to surpass conventional computers by resolving intricate challenges that existing systems cannot tackle. They use quantum algorithms for improved performance and depend on reversible computations based on quantum physics and linear algebra. In contrast to traditional computing, which may include irreversible processes, quantum computing relies on unitary operations that are fundamentally reversible. The parity-preserving feature enables the identification of both permanent and transient defects within circuits. The parity-preserving feature ensures that the input and output states are equal in reversible circuits. Vedic multipliers offer a crucial foundation in the design and implementation of digital circuits, recognized for their speed, efficiency, ease of calculations, reduction of errors, and broad applicability. Prior investigations of quantum Vedic multipliers have faced obstacles like elevated Quantum Cost (QC), substantial Garbage Output (GO), Constant Input (CI), augmented Gate Count (GC), and CNOT-V/V+ count, resulting in more resource use and implementation intricacy. These inefficiencies hinder the scalability and feasibility of quantum multipliers in high-performance computing applications. A proposed solution to these issues is to introduce a cost-effective, parity-preserving reversible quantum block synthesized through an established method that produces a network list of multi-controlled Toffoli (MCT) gates. This Toffoli-based network is then optimized using various techniques, ultimately transforming it into a network of fundamental quantum gates. This approach decreases quantum expenses, eliminates unnecessary outputs, and enhances quantum gate efficiency. Integrating this innovative technique into the reversible quantum Vedic multipliers offers a more efficient, cost-effective, and scalable solution than current approaches. All proposed designs, such as a half adder-subtractor, a ripple carry adder (RCA), and two-bit and four-bit Vedic multipliers, are suggested based on functional blocks and pre-existing components. The suggested structures undergo evaluation in comparison to existing state-of-the-art procedures, demonstrating their cost-effectiveness. The observed average savings for two-bit and four-bit Vedic multipliers, with respect to QC, number of CNOT-V/V+ count, GO, CI, and GC, are 20.01%, 19.38%, 37.51%, 37.51%, and 54.89%, and 22.71%, 18.78%, 27.23%, 31.10%, and 42.38%, respectively when compared to previous studies. Furthermore, all suggested circuits are evaluated and confirmed using the IBM quantum laboratory.

AB Internet-of-Things(IoT)-based edge computing in smart factories, smart grid, agriculture, constructions and autonomous vehicles include service-oriented gateways that connect with the cloud, perform machine-to-machine communication, often transmiting large amount data up and down the network, performing time-sensitive processing and involving intelligent local decision-making. In view of a sharp increase in cyberattacks today targeting edge computing, these gateways need to provide digital signing and key negotiation for ensuring reliable data sources, trusted applications and authentic devices and connections. In contrast to common perception, we show that post-quantum cryptography methods do not necessitate extensive modification to adopt in such environments; further, the cryptography algorithm's hardness is preserved while fulfilling the IoT device's resource limitations. In particular, we demonstrate an efficient method and an implementation on a 32-bit ARMCortex-M4, 64KB memory microcontroller, based on post-quantum key encapsulation mechanisms (KEMs), for secure communication and authentication in an industrial IoT environment.

TI Enabling phase stabilization of quantum networks via
   displacement-enhanced photon counting
SO OPTICA
AB Optical phase stabilization, tracking, and locking in long fiber links are pivotal for the functionality of many communication protocols and distributed sensors. However, conventional phase stabilization methods use strong optical probe signals that may contaminate and destroy fragile quantum signals propagating in the same fiber link. Here, we experimentally demonstrate phase locking of fiber spools up to 100 km and over 120 km deployed optical communication link using faint coherent states with an average of just approximate to 650,000 photons per second detected at the receiving detector as a probe signal. The power spectral density of phase noise, integrated from 1 Hz to 50 kHz, yields an excess rms phase noise of 110 mrad (corresponding to timing jitter below 0.09 fs) for a 100 km fiber spool and 140 mrad (corresponding to rms timing jitter below 0.12 fs) for deployed fiber. The displacement-enhanced measurement protocol that we employ for phase stabilization yields Fisher information that is greater than that of homodyne and heterodyne measurement protocols for fiber links longer than 100 m and, therefore, exceeds the canonical shot noise limit of accuracy. By implementing this stabilization strategy with a 50% duty cycle, we enable time-division multiplexed faint light and quantum payloads to coexist within the same communication channel.

TI Cavity magnomechanics: from classical to quantum
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB Hybrid quantum systems based on magnons in magnetic materials have made significant progress in the past decade. They are built based on the couplings of magnons with microwave photons, optical photons, vibration phonons, and superconducting qubits. In particular, the interactions among magnons, microwave cavity photons, and vibration phonons form the system of cavity magnomechanics (CMM), which lies in the interdisciplinary field of cavity QED, magnonics, quantum optics, and quantum information. Here, we review the experimental and theoretical progress of this emerging field. We first introduce the underlying theories of the magnomechanical coupling, and then some representative classical phenomena that have been experimentally observed, including magnomechanically induced transparency, magnomechanical dynamical backaction, magnon-phonon cross-Kerr nonlinearity, etc. We also discuss a number of theoretical proposals, which show the potential of the CMM system for preparing different kinds of quantum states of magnons, phonons, and photons, and hybrid systems combining magnomechanics and optomechanics and relevant quantum protocols based on them. Finally, we summarize this review and provide an outlook for the future research directions in this field.

TI Guesswork With Quantum Side Information
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION THEORY
AB What is the minimum number of guesses needed on average to guess a realization of a random variable correctly? The answer to this question led to the introduction of a quantity called guesswork by Massey in 1994, which can be viewed as an alternate security criterion to entropy. In this paper, we consider the guesswork in the presence of quantum side information, and show that a general sequential guessing strategy is equivalent to performing a single quantum measurement and choosing a guessing strategy based on the outcome. We use this result to deduce entropic one-shot and asymptotic bounds on the guesswork in the presence of quantum side information, and to formulate a semi-definite program (SDP) to calculate the quantity. We evaluate the guesswork for a simple example involving the BB84 states, both numerically and analytically, and we prove a continuity result that certifies the security of slightly imperfect key states when the guesswork is used as the security criterion.

TI Physicochemical and microbiological characteristics of pork meat exposed
   to SoRegen® Technology
SO VETERINARY WORLD
AB Background and Aim: Quantum entanglement has been explored as a novel approach in food technology to enhance the quality and nutritional properties of animal products. SoRegen (R) Technology applies quantum entanglement signals to food products, aiming to induce physicochemical modifications. This study investigates the effects of SoRegen (R) Technology on the physicochemical and microbiological characteristics of pork meat, focusing on meat quality attributes and cholesterol levels. Materials and Methods: Pork meat samples were exposed to a quantum entanglement signal from a SoRegen (R) chip for 20 min in an electromagnetic field chamber. Physicochemical properties, including water-holding capacity (WHC), pH, drip loss, and cooking loss, were analyzed. Cholesterol levels, including total cholesterol and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits. Microbiological analysis included total plate count (TPC), Escherichiacoli, and Listeriamonocytogenes enumeration. Data were statistically analyzed using an independent sample t-test with significance set at p < 0.05. Results: Pork meat exposed to SoRegen (R) Technology exhibited significant improvements in physicochemical properties. WHC increased, indicating better moisture retention, while drip loss and cooking loss were reduced, suggesting improved meat texture and quality. Minor but statistically significant fluctuations in pH were observed at specific time points. Cholesterol analysis revealed a significant 35% reduction in total cholesterol levels, alongside a significant increase in HDL cholesterol levels, indicating potential health benefits. Microbiological analysis indicated no significant differences between exposed and unexposed pork samples in terms of E. coli, L. monocytogenes, and TPC, suggesting that the technology does not directly affect microbial contamination. Conclusion: The application of SoRegen (R) Technology significantly improved the physicochemical and nutritional attributes of pork meat, particularly by enhancing WHC and reducing cholesterol levels. However, no significant changes were observed in microbiological characteristics. These findings highlight the potential of quantum entanglement technology in food science, though further research is required to elucidate the mechanisms underlying these effects and explore commercial applications.

TI Automatic Test Pattern Generation for Robust Quantum Circuit Testing
SO ACM TRANSACTIONS ON DESIGN AUTOMATION OF ELECTRONIC SYSTEMS
AB Quantum circuit testing is essential for detecting potential faults in realistic quantum devices, while the testing process itself also suffers from the inexactness and unreliability of quantum operations. This article alleviates the issue by proposing a novel framework of automatic test pattern generation (ATPG) for robust testing of logical quantum circuits. We introduce the stabilizer projector decomposition (SPD) for representing the quantum test pattern and construct the test application (i.e., state preparation and measurement) using Clifford-only circuits, which are rather robust and efficient as evidenced in the fault-tolerant quantum computation. However, it is generally hard to generate SPDs due to the exponentially growing number of the stabilizer projectors. To circumvent this difficulty, we develop an SPD generation algorithm, as well as several acceleration techniques that can exploit both locality and sparsity in generating SPDs. The effectiveness of our algorithms are validated by (1) theoretical guarantees under reasonable conditions and (2) experimental results on commonly used benchmark circuits, such as Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT), Quantum Volume (QV), and Bernstein-Vazirani (BV) in IBM Qiskit.

TI Ternary LWE Key Search: A New Frontier for Quantum Combinatorial Attacks
SO INFORMATION
AB The Learning with Errors (LWE) problem, particularly its efficient ternary variant where secrets and errors are small, is a fundamental building block for numerous post-quantum cryptographic schemes. Combinatorial attacks provide a potent approach to cryptanalyzing ternary LWE. While classical attacks have achieved complexities close to their asymptotic S0.25 bound for a search space of size S, their quantum counterparts have faced a significant gap: the attack by van Hoof et al. (vHKM) only reached a concrete complexity of S0.251, far from its asymptotic promise of S0.193. This work introduces an efficient quantum combinatorial attack that substantially narrows this gap. We present a quantum walk adaptation of the locality-sensitive hashing algorithm by Kirshanova and May, which fundamentally removes the need for guessing error coordinates-the primary source of inefficiency in the vHKM approach. This crucial improvement allows our attack to achieve a concrete complexity of approximately S0.225, markedly improving over prior quantum combinatorial methods. For concrete parameters of major schemes including NTRU, BLISS, and GLP, our method demonstrates substantial runtime improvements over the vHKM attack, achieving speedup factors ranging from 216 to 260 across different parameter sets and establishing the new state-of-the-art for quantum combinatorial attacks. As a second contribution, we address the challenge of polynomial quantum memory constraints. We develop a hybrid approach combining the Kirshanova-May framework with a quantum claw-finding technique, requiring only O(n) qubits while utilizing exponential classical memory. This work provides the first comprehensive concrete security analysis of real-world LWE-based schemes under such practical quantum resource constraints, offering crucial insights for post-quantum security assessments. Our results reveal a nuanced landscape where our combinatorial attacks are superior for small-weight parameters, while lattice-based attacks maintain an advantage for others.

TI Geminal-Based Strategies for Modeling Large Building Blocks of Organic
   Electronic Materials
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY LETTERS
AB We elaborate on unconventional electronic structure methods based on geminals and their potential to advance the rapidly developing field of organic photovoltaics (OPVs). Specifically, we focus on the computational advantages of geminal-based methods over standard approaches and identify the critical aspects of OPV development. Examples are reliable and efficient computations of orbital energies, electronic spectra, and van der Waals interactions. Geminal-based models can also be combined with quantum embedding techniques and a quantum information analysis of orbital interactions to gain a fundamental understanding of the electronic structures and properties of realistic OPV building blocks. Furthermore, other organic components present in, for instance, dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) represent another promising scope of application. Finally, we provide numerical examples predicting the properties of a small building block of OPV components and two carbazole-based dyes proposed as possible DSSC sensitizers.

TI Quantum-information theory of a Dirichlet ring with Aharonov-Bohm field
SO EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL PLUS
AB Shannon quantum-information entropies S-rho(,gamma) (phi(AB), r(0)), Fisher informations I-rho(,gamma)(phi(AB), r(0)), Onicescu energies O-rho,O- gamma (phi(AB), r(0)) and Renyi entropies R rho, gamma (phi(AB), r(0);( )alpha) are calculated both in the position (subscript rho) and momentum (gamma) spaces as functions of the inner radius r(0) for the two-dimensional Dirichlet unit-width annulus threaded by the Aharonov-Bohm (AB) flux phi(AB). Small (huge) values of r(0) correspond to the thick (thin) rings with extreme of r(0) = 0 describing the dot. Discussion is based on the analysis of the corresponding position Psi(nm) (phi(AB) , r(0); r) and momentum Phi(nm) (phi(AB), r(0); k) waveforms, with n and m being principal and magnetic quantum indices, respectively: the former allows an analytic expression at any AB field whereas for the latter it is true at the flux-free configuration, phi(AB) = 0, only. It is shown, in particular, that the position Shannon entropy S-rho nm (phi(AB), r(0)) [Onicescu energy O-rho nm(phi(AB), r(0))] grows logarithmically [decreases as 1 /r(0)] with large r(0) tending to the same asymp-tote S-rho(asym) = ln(4 pi r(0)) - 1 [O-rho(asym) = 3/(4 pi r(0))] for all orbitals whereas their Fisher counterpart I-rho nm(phi(AB), r(0)) approaches in the same regime the m-independent limit mimicking in this way the energy spectrum variation with r(0), which for the thin structures exhibits quadratic dependence on the principal index. Frequency of the fading oscillations of the radial parts of the wave vector functions Phi(nm) (phi(AB), r(0); k) increases with the inner radius what results in the identical r(0) >> 1 asymptote for all momentum Shannon entropies S-gamma nm(phi(AB); r(0)) with the alike n and different m. The same limit causes the Fisher momentum components I-gamma (phi(AB), r(0)) to grow exponentially with r(0). Based on these calculations, properties of the complexities e(S) O are addressed too. Among many findings on the Renyi entropy, it is proved that the lower limit alpha(TH) of the semi-infinite range of the dimensionless coefficient alpha, where the momentum component of this one-parameter entropy exists, is not influenced by the radius; in particular, the change of the topology from the simply, r(0) = 0, to the doubly, r(0) > 0, connected domain is unable to change alpha(TH) = 2/5. AB field influence on the measures is calculated too. Parallels are drawn to the geometry with volcano-shape confining potential and similarities and differences between them are discussed.

SO DALTON TRANSACTIONS
AB Gold(i) bridged dimeric and trimeric structures of a ground state spin S = 1/2 heterometallic {Cr7Ni} wheel have been prepared and studied by continuous wave (CW) and pulsed wave EPR spectrometry. The {Cr7Ni} relaxation time constants (T-1 and T-m) show rates matching well with previous observations. Four pulse Double Electron Resonance (DEER) studies suggest presence of more than one conformations. Small Angle X-ray Scattering (SAXS) in conjunction with Molecular Dynamic (MD) Simulations were performed to look at the possible conformations in solution. In line with DEER results, simulation data further indicated more flexible molecular geometry in solution than the one in solid state.

TI Optical and mechanical squeezing with coherent feedback control beyond
   the resolved-sideband regime
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB The noise reduction in squeezed states makes them a powerful nonclassical resource in quantum technologies, especially in quantum sensing, and an essential step for the ongoing development of nonGaussian states. In particular, optical and mechanical squeezing can both be generated when light interacts with a mechanical oscillator. Here we use a linear optical system as a controller and use coherent optical feedback to enhance squeezing in the unresolved-sideband regime of optomechanics. Feedback control is generally profitable for cooling, manipulating, and stabilizing the dynamics of mechanical oscillators; coherent feedback is then notable for its ability to steer a quantum system toward the highest squeezing without measurement, avoiding backaction. We thoroughly maximize optical and conditional mechanical squeezing feasible with state-of-the-art experimental setups and derive the optimal conditions under which quantum squeezing is generated in the system.

TI Quantum Privacy-preserving Two-party Circle Intersection Protocol Based
   on Phase-encoded Query
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF THEORETICAL PHYSICS
AB Privacy-preserving geometric intersection (PGI) is an important issue in Secure multiparty computation (SMC). The existing quantum PGI protocols are mainly based on grid coding, which requires a lot of computational complexity. The phase-encoded query method which has been used in some Quantum SMC protocols is suitable to solve the decision problem, but it needs to apply high dimensional Oracle operators. In this paper, we use the principle of phase-encoded query to solve an important PGI problem, namely privacy-preserving two-party circle intersection. We study the implementation of Oracle operator in detail, and achieve polynomial computational complexity by decompsing it into quantum arithmetic operations. Performance analysis shows that our protocol is correct and efficient, and can protect the privacy of all participants against internal and external attacks.

TI Spacetime symmetries and the qubit Bloch ball: A physical derivation of
   finite-dimensional quantum theory and the number of spatial dimensions
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Quantum theory and relativity are the pillar theories on which our understanding of physics is based. Poincare invariance is a fundamental physical principle stating that the experimental results must be the same in all inertial reference frames inMinkowski spacetime. It is a basic condition imposed on quantum theory in order to construct quantum field theories, hence, it plays a fundamental role in the standard model of particle physics too. As is well known, Minkowski spacetime follows from clear physical principles, like the relativity principle and the invariance of the speed of light. Here we reproduce such a derivation but leave the number of spatial dimensions n as a free variable. Then, assuming that spacetime is Minkowski in 1 + n dimensions and within the framework of general probabilistic theories, we reconstruct the qubit Bloch ball and finite dimensional quantum theory, and obtain that the number of spatial dimensions must be n = 3, from Poincare invariance and other physical postulates. Our results suggest a fundamental physical connection between spacetime and quantum theory.

TI Local operator entanglement in spin chains
SO SCIPOST PHYSICS CORE
AB Understanding how and whether local perturbations can affect the entire quantum system is a fundamental step in understanding non-equilibrium phenomena such as thermalization. This knowledge of non-equilibrium phenomena is applicable for quantum computation, as many quantum computers employ non-equilibrium processes for computations. In this paper, we investigate the evolution of bi-and tripartite operator mutual information of the time-evolution operator and the Pauli spin operators in the one-dimensional Ising model with magnetic field and the disordered Heisenberg model to study the properties of quantum circuits. In the Ising model, the early-time evolution qualitatively follows an effective light cone picture, and the late-time value is well de-scribed by Page's value for a random pure state. In the Heisenberg model with strong disorder, we find that many-body localization prevents the information from propagating and being delocalized. We also find an effective Ising Hamiltonian that describes the time evolution of bi-and tripartite operator mutual information for the Heisenberg model in the large disorder regime.

TI Manipulating Entanglement Dynamics in Dephased Interacting Qubits Using
   a Radiation Field
SO ENTROPY
AB We study the entanglement dynamics of a pair of non-identical interacting atoms (qubits) coupled off-resonance to a single-mode cavity radiation field and exposed to dephasing environments. The qubits are studied starting from various initial states that are disentangled from an initially coherent field. The system models the basic building units of quantum information processing (QIP) platforms under the realistic considerations of asymmetry and external environmental influences. We investigate how introducing a radiation field alters the system's entanglement dynamics in the presence of dephasing environments, and how it impacts the effects of the dephasing environments themselves. The work examines the problem under various settings of inter-qubit interactions, which are now experimentally controllable in some of the newly engineered artificial qubit systems. We illustrate that only upon introducing the radiation field, the system suffers a terminal disentanglement (followed by no revivals) in a finite time. This behavior is exacerbated when the atoms' interaction with the field is stronger. Moreover, the effects of the field's intensity and the atoms' detunings are vastly sensitive to the choice of the initial state. We also demonstrate that the closer the atoms' transition frequencies are to resonance with the field, the more pronounced are the effects of strengthening the independent dephasing environments corresponding to some initial states. Those states also suffered a greater reduction in entanglement content when the qubits with stronger atom-field interaction strength were influenced by a stronger independent dephasing environment. In addition, we examined the ability of the correlated dephasing environment to induce a noise-enhanced efficiency in the presence of an external radiation field. We showed that the radiation field could play a decisive role in enabling or restricting noise-enhanced efficiency, but one that is also highly sensitive to the system's initial state.

TI Nonlocal Detection of Interlayer Three-Magnon Coupling
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB A leading nonlinear effect in magnonics is the interaction that splits a high-frequency magnon into two low-frequency magnons with conserved linear momentum. Here, we report experimental observation of nonlocal three-magnon scattering between spatially separated magnetic systems, viz. a CoFeB nanowire and a yttrium iron garnet (YIG) thin film. Above a certain threshold power of an applied microwave field, a CoFeB Kittel magnon splits into a pair of counterpropagating YIG magnons that induce voltage signals in Pt electrodes on each side, in excellent agreement with model calculations based on the interlayer dipolar interaction. The excited YIG magnon pairs reside mainly in the first excited (n = 1) perpendicular standing spin-wave mode. With increasing power, the n = 1 magnons successively scatter into nodeless (n = 0) magnons through a four-magnon process. Our results demonstrate nonlocal detection of two separately propagating magnons emerging from one common source that may enable quantum entanglement between distant magnons for quantum information applications.

TI Compact spin qubits using the common gate structure of fin field-effect
   transistors
SO AIP ADVANCES
AB The sizes of commercial transistors are of nanometer order, and there have already been many proposals of spin qubits using conventional complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor transistors. However, most of the previously proposed spin qubits require many wires to control a small number of qubits. This causes a significant "jungle of wires" problem when the qubits are integrated into a chip. Herein, to reduce the complicated wiring, we theoretically consider spin qubits embedded into fin field-effect transistor (FinFET) devices such that the spin qubits share the common gate electrode of the FinFET. The interactions between qubits occur via the Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida interaction via the channel of the FinFET. The possibility of a quantum annealing machine is discussed in addition to the quantum computers of the current proposals.

TI Loss and decoherence in superconducting circuits on silicon: Insights
   from electron spin resonance
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB Solid-state devices used for quantum computation and quantum sensing applications are adversely affected by loss and noise caused by spurious, charged two-level systems (TLS) and stray paramagnetic spins. These two sources of noise are interconnected, exacerbating the impact on circuit performance. We use an on-chip electron spin resonance (ESR) technique, with niobium nitride (NbN) superconducting resonators, to study surface spins on silicon and the effect of postfabrication surface treatments. We identify two distinct spin species that are characterized by different spin-relaxation times and respond selectively to various surface treatments (annealing and hydrofluoric acid). Only one of the two spin species has a significant impact on the TLS-limited resonator quality factor at low-power (near-single-photon) excitation. We observe a three- to fivefold reduction in the total density of spins after surface treatments and demonstrate the efficacy of ESR spectroscopy in developing strategies to mitigate loss and decoherence in quantum systems.

TI Decomposition of nonlinear collision operator in quantum Lattice
   Boltzmann algorithm
SO EPL
AB - We propose a quantum algorithm to tackle the quadratic nonlinearity in the Lattice Boltzmann (LB) collision operator. The key idea is to build the quantum gates based on the particle distribution functions (PDF) within the coherence time for qubits. Thus, both the operator and a state vector are linear functions of PDFs, and upon quantum state evolution, the resulting PDFs will have quadraticity. To this end, we decompose the collision operator for a DmQn lattice model into a product of 2(n + 1) operators, where n is the number of lattice velocity directions. After decomposition, the (n + 1) operators with constant entries remain unchanged throughout the simulation, whereas the remaining (n+1) will be built based on the statevector of the previous time step. Also, we show that such a decomposition is not unique. Compared to the second-order Carleman-linearized LB, the present approach reduces the circuit width by half and circuit depth by exponential order. The proposed algorithm has been verified through the one-dimensional flow discontinuity and two-dimensional Kolmogrov-like flow test cases.

TI Interference and parity blockade in transport through a Majorana box
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB A Majorana box-two topological superconducting nanowires coupled via a trivial superconductor-is a building block in devices aiming to demonstrate non-Abelian physics, as well as for topological quantum computer architectures. We theoretically investigate charge transport through a Majorana box and show that current can be blocked when two Majoranas couple to the same lead, fixing their parity. In direct analogy to a Pauli spin blockade in spin qubits, this parity blockade can be used for fast and high-fidelity qubit initialization and readout, as well as for current-based measurements of decoherence times. Furthermore, we demonstrate that transport can distinguish between a clean Majorana box and a disordered box with additional unwanted Majorana or Andreev bound states.

TI Optimizing Post-Quantum Digital Signatures with Verkle Trees and Quantum
   Seed-Based Pseudo-Random Generators
SO COMPUTERS
AB Nowadays, quantum computing is developing at an unprecedented speed. This will pose a serious threat to the security of widely used public-key cryptosystems in the near future. Scientists are actively looking for ways to protect against quantum attacks; however, existing solutions still face different limitations in terms of efficiency and practicality. This paper explores hash-based digital signature schemes, post-quantum vector commitments and Verkle tree-based approaches for protecting against quantum attacks. The paper proposes an improved approach to generating digital signatures based on Verkle trees using lattice based vector commitments. In order to further reduce the memory space, the paper offers the methodology of integrating a post-quantum secure pseudo-random number generator into the scheme. Finally, the paper proposes an efficient post-quantum digital signature scheme based on Verkle trees, which minimizes memory requirements and reduces the signature size. Our proposed framework has strong resistance to quantum attacks, as well as high speed and efficiency. This study is an important contribution to the elaboration of post-quantum cryptosystems, which lays the foundation for developing secure and practical digital signature systems in the face of emerging quantum threats.

TI Experimentally Accessible Bounds on Distillable Entanglement from
   Entropic Uncertainty Relations
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Entanglement is not only the resource that fuels many quantum technologies but also plays a key role for some of the most profound open questions of fundamental physics. Experiments controlling quantum systems at the single quantum level may shed light on these puzzles. However, measuring, or even bounding, entanglement experimentally has proven to be an outstanding challenge, especially when the prepared quantum states are mixed. We use entropic uncertainty relations for bipartite systems to derive measurable lower bounds on distillable entanglement. We showcase these bounds by applying them to physical models realizable in cold-atom experiments. The derived entanglement bounds rely on measurements in only two different bases and are generically applicable to any quantum simulation platform.

TI Dissipative preparation of W states in trapped ion systems
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB We present protocols for dissipative entanglement of three trapped-ion qubits and discuss a scheme that uses sympathetic cooling as the dissipation mechanism. This scheme relies on tailored destructive interference to generate any one of six entangled W states in a three-ion qubit space. Using a beryllium-magnesium ion crystal as an example system, we theoretically investigate the protocol's performance and the effects of likely error sources, including thermal secular motion of the ion crystal, calibration imperfections, and spontaneous photon scattering. We estimate that a fidelity of similar to 98% may be achieved in typical trapped ion experiments with similar to 1 ms interaction time. These protocols avoid timescale hierarchies for faster preparation of entangled states.

SO QUANTUM MACHINE INTELLIGENCE
AB Identification of malicious attacks in network traffic is one of many important big data problems that have been approached from different directions, including machine learning. In this paper, it is used as an example for investigating the applicability of quantum machine learning to such problems. Particular focus is kept on the NISQ era, in which available computer sizes are typically fairly small. Instead of applying typical cutting and knitting techniques with their associated overhead cost, we use the trainable output layer inherent in many hybrid QML approaches to re-combine the results from a collection of smaller QVCs executed on different machines. It is compared to classical and established quantum approaches on four real-world datasets.

TI Non-Abelian non-adiabatic geometric manipulation of spinor BEC
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Adiabatic non-Abelian geometric operations play a crucial role in quantum systems due to their inherent robustness. However, their implementation requires long evolution times, posing significant challenges for maintaining coherence in practical quantum systems. In this work, we experimentally realize non-adiabatic non-Abelian geometric manipulations in a spinor Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) system. We demonstrate that two distinct quantum operations, originating from different paths in Grassmann space, yield non-equivalent transformations when applied in different orders, directly showcasing their non-Abelian nature. Notably, these geometric operations are non-adiabatic and exhibit high-speed dynamics. Our results pave the way for robust geometric control of spinor BEC, with promising applications in quantum computation and quantum simulation.

TI Quantum verification of NP problems with single photons and linear
   optics
SO LIGHT-SCIENCE & APPLICATIONS
AB Quantum computing is seeking to realize hardware-optimized algorithms for application-related computational tasks. NP (nondeterministic-polynomial-time) is a complexity class containing many important but intractable problems like the satisfiability of potentially conflict constraints (SAT). According to the well-founded exponential time hypothesis, verifying an SAT instance of size n requires generally the complete solution in an O(n)-bit proof. In contrast, quantum verification algorithms, which encode the solution into quantum bits rather than classical bit strings, can perform the verification task with quadratically reduced information about the solution in (O) over tilde(root n) qubits. Here we realize the quantum verification machine of SAT with single photons and linear optics. By using tunable optical setups, we efficiently verify satisfiable and unsatisfiable SAT instances and achieve a clear completeness-soundness gap even in the presence of experimental imperfections. The protocol requires only unentangled photons, linear operations on multiple modes and at most two-photon joint measurements. These features make the protocol suitable for photonic realization and scalable to large problem sizes with the advances in high-dimensional quantum information manipulation and large scale linear-optical systems. Our results open an essentially new route toward quantum advantages and extend the computational capability of optical quantum computing.

TI Reliable experimental manipulation of quantum steering direction
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Noise-adding methods have been widely used to manipulate the direction of quantum steering, but all related experimental schemes only worked under the assumption that Gaussian measurements were performed and ideal target states were accurately prepared. Here, we prove, and then experimentally observe, that a class of two-qubit states can be flexibly changed among two-way steerable, one-way steerable and no-way steerable, by adding either phase damping noise or depolarization noise. The steering direction is determined by measuring steering radius and critical radius, each of which represents a necessary and sufficient steering criterion valid for general projective measurements and actually prepared states. Our work provides a more efficient and rigorous way to manipulate the direction of quantum steering, and can also be employed to manipulate other types of quantum correlations.

TI Self-testing quantum states via nonmaximal violation in Hardy's test of
   nonlocality
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Self-testing protocols enable the certification of quantum devices without demanding full knowledge about their inner workings. A typical approach in designing such protocols is based on observing nonlocal correlations which exhibit maximum violation in a Bell test. We show that in the Bell experiment known as Hardy???s test of nonlocality, not only does the maximally nonlocal correlation self-test a quantum state, rather a nonmaximal nonlocal behavior can serve the same purpose. We, in fact, completely characterize all such behaviors leading to a self-test of every pure two-qubit entangled state except for the maximally entangled ones. Apart from presenting an alternative self-testing protocol, our method provides a powerful tool towards characterizing the complex boundary of the set of quantum correlations.

TI Securing the Future: Advanced Encryption for Quantum-Safe Video
   Transmission
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON CONSUMER ELECTRONICS
AB The rapid growth of digital communication and video transmission has brought about an urgent need for robust encryption methods to ensure the security and integrity of video data. Traditional encryption techniques, while effective, face increasing challenges from advancing computing capabilities. Quantum cryptography has emerged as a promising solution to secure video transmission. In this article, we propose a novel cutting-edge Hybrid Quantum Video Encryption Framework. Our key idea is to integrate the strengths of quantum encryption and the classical video transmission paradigm to enhance the security of video transmission. By combining the proposed quantum encryption framework which uses a pseudorandom number generated key to perform a row-wise XOR operation along with the secure SSL-encrypted HTTP transmission over the internet, this framework provides a robust defense against threats. The experimental simulation conducted under the new computational integrated paradigm shows the strong encryption capability of the proposed method. The superior performance of the proposed method (ranges from 10-15% compared to the existing methods) as validated through statistical analysis, outperforms the state-of-the-art video encryption frameworks in terms of Information Entropy and Correlation Coefficient for encrypted plain images offering a significant advancement in the field of secure video transmission.

TI Fractional Verkle Trees for Scalable Post-Quantum Signatures
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Quantum computers threaten to break widely used cryptosystems like RSA and ECC, forcing us to develop new quantum-resistant alternatives. While hash-based signatures like SPHINCS+ offer a proven solution, their reliance on Merkle trees result in large signature sizes and memory-intensive verification, which hinders scalability. We present a novel approach that replaces Merkle trees with Fractional Verkle Trees (FVTs), a hierarchical structure where a large Verkle tree is decomposed into smaller, more manageable pieces, which we call hypertrees. This approach provides fast verification and smaller signatures, while preserving the required level of security. Our FVT construction offers a useful basis for scalable verifiable data structures while lowering memory and verification costs without sacrificing security. Validation by way of a functional prototype shows that the derived Fractal Verkle-Based Digital Signature (FVDS) scheme achieves signature sizes of about 16.2 KB, which is 2.5x smaller than SPHINCS+, while maintaining localized updates and scalable verification. This makes it especially appropriate for bandwidth-constrained applications, such as IoT firmware updates and blockchain light clients.

TI Nonlocal realism tests and quantum state tomography in Sagnac-based
   type-II polarization-entanglement SPDC-source
SO HELIYON
AB We have experimentally created a robust, ultrabright and phase-stable polarization-entangled state close to maximally entangled Bell-state with %98-fidelity using the type-II spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) process in periodically-poled KTiOPO4 (PPKTP) collinear crystal inside a Sagnac interferometer (SI). Bell inequality measurement, Freedman's test, as the different versions of CHSH inequality, and also visibility test which all can be seen as the nonlocal realism tests, imply that our created entangled state shows a strong violation from the classical physics or any hidden-variable theory. We have obtained very reliable and very strong Bell violation as S = 2.78 +/- 0.01with high brightness nu(HV) = %(99.969 +/- 0.003) and nu(DA) = %(96.751 +/- 0.002) and very strong violation due to Freedman test as delta(F) = 0.01715 +/- 0.00001. Furthermore, using the tomographic reconstruction of quantum states together a maximum-likelihood-technique (MLT) as the numerical optimization, we obtain the physical non-negative definite density operator which shows the nonseparability and entanglement of our prepared state. By having the maximum likelihood density operator, we calculate some important entanglement-measures and entanglement entropies. The Sagnac configuration provides bidirectional crystal pumping yields to high-rate entanglement source which is very applicable in quantum communication, sensing and metrology as well as quantum information protocols, and has potential to be used in quantum illumination-based LIDAR and free-space quantum key distribution (QKD).

TI Exploring the Accuracy of Interferometric Quantum Measurements under
   Conservation Laws
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB A (target) quantum system is often measured through observations performed on a second (meter) system to which the target is coupled. In the presence of global conservation laws holding on the joint meter-target system, the Wigner-Araki-Yanase theorem and its generalizations predict a lower bound on the measurement's error (Ozawa's bound). While practically negligible for macroscopic meters, it becomes relevant for microscopic ones. Here, we propose a simple interferometric setup, arguably within reach of present technology, in which a flying particle (a microscopic quantum meter) is used to measure a qubit by interacting with it in one arm of the interferometer. In this scenario, the globally conserved quantity is the total energy of particle and qubit. We show how the measurement error epsilon is linked to the nonstationary nature of the measured observable and the finite duration of the target-meter interaction while Ozawa's bound epsilon B only depends on the momentum uncertainty of the meter's wave packet. When considering short wave packets with respect to the evolution time of the qubit, we show that epsilon/epsilon B is strictly tied to the position-momentum uncertainty of the meter's wave packet and epsilon/epsilon B -* 1 only when employing Gaussian wave packets. On the contrary, long wave packets of any shape lead to epsilon/epsilon B -* 2 .In addition to their fundamental relevance, our findings have important practical consequences for optimal resource management in quantum technologies.

AB Aluminum Josephson junctions are the building blocks for the realization of superconducting quantum bits. Attention has been also paid to hybrid ferromagnetic Josephson junctions, which allow switching between different magnetic states, making them interesting for applications such as cryogenic memories, single-photon detectors, and spintronics. In this paper, we report on the fabrication and characterization of high-quality ferromagnetic Josephson junctions based on aluminum technology. We employed an innovative fabrication process inspired by niobium-based technology, allowing us to obtain very high-quality hybrid aluminum Josephson junctions; thus, supporting the use of ferromagnetic Josephson junctions in advanced quantum circuits. The fabrication process is described in detail and the main DC transport properties at low temperatures (current-voltage characteristic, critical current as a function of the temperature, and the external magnetic field) are reported. Here, we illustrate in detail the fabrication process, as well as the main DC transport properties at low temperatures (current-voltage characteristic, critical current as a function of the temperature, and the external magnetic field).

TI Maxwell's two-demon engine under pure dephasing noise
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB The interplay between thermal machines and quantum correlations is of great interest in both quantum thermodynamics and quantum information science. Recently, a quantum Szilard engine has been proposed, showing that the quantum steerability between a Maxwell's demon and a work medium can be beneficial to a work extraction task. Nevertheless, this type of quantum-fueled machine is usually fragile in the presence of decoherence effects. Therefore, in this work we tackle this question by introducing a second demon who can access a control system and make the work medium pass through two dephasing channels in a manner of quantum superposition. Furthermore, we provide a quantum circuit to simulate our proposed concept and test it on IBMQ and IonQ quantum computers.

TI Quantum search in a dictionary using fingerprinting function
SO UCHENYE ZAPISKI KAZANSKOGO UNIVERSITETA-SERIYA FIZIKO-MATEMATICHESKIE
   NAUKI
AB The problem of searching for an element within a dictionary was considered. Over the past decades, various approaches, including classical and quantum algorithms, have been proposed to solve it. One possible solution is the method of quantum amplitude amplification, which underpins the well-known Grover algorithm and enables a quadratic speedup in the search process. In this article, a new approach to searching for an element w of length m in a dictionary V of size n with the use of the quantum fingerprinting function was introduced. The developed algorithm has a query complexity of O(root n) and requires O(log n + log m) qubits.

TI Transportable and Ultra-Stable Laser System for 133Cs
   Rydberg Excitation
SO PHOTONICS
AB Recent progress in Rydberg atoms has enabled a wide range of applications in quantum sensing and quantum computation. In these applications, ultra-stable optical reference systems are essential to meet the requirements of a narrow linewidth and low technical noise. However, most existing systems are confined to laboratory settings and are not suitable for measurement-site-independent applications, such as external electric field sensors. This paper presents a transportable ultra-stable optical reference system for Rydberg excitation. The system is based on a 10 cm long ultra-low-expansion glass optical cavity, and it achieves finesse values of 410 k (at 1018 nm) and 200 k (at 852 nm). After being assembled in the experimental environment, it can still operate with only minor adjustments even after being transported over 400 km. Thanks to its vibration-insensitive design, two-stage temperature control, and hybrid locking unit, the system can maintain its locking status for up to 2 h.

TI Relativistic bound state solutions and quantum information theory in D
   dimensions under exponential-type plus Yukawa potentials
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB The bound-state solution of the radial Klein-Gordon equation has been obtained under the interaction of an exponential-type and Yukawa potential functions. The Greene-Aldrich approximation has been used to overcome the centrifugal barrier and enable the analytical solutions of the energy and wave functions in closed form. The momentum space wave function in D dimensions has been constructed using the Fourier transform. The mean values have been conjectured for the position and momentum spaces using two equivalent equations. The effects of the potential parameters on the expectation values and quantum information measurement have been investigated. For the 1D case, the results obey the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, Fisher, Shannon, Onicescu, and the R & eacute;nyi entropic inequalities. Other information complexities measures, such as Shannon Power, Fisher-Shannon, and Lopez-Ruiz-Mancini-Calbet, have been verified. For the ground state, the 1D momentum expectation value < p(2)>(00) coincides with the 3D < p(2)>(000) values, which is an indication of degeneracy. The total energy of a particle in both 1D and 3D space may be degenerate due to the inter-dimensional degeneracy of the quantum numbers. However, in this present result, the degeneracy in 1D and 3D occurred for fixed quantum states at different momentum intervals. Thus, in 1D, a particle may transit an entire space (-infinity < p < infinity) with a certain kinetic energy, which must be equal to its kinetic energy if it moves through the interval 0 < p < infinity in 3D space. This may have implications for kinetic energy degeneracy in higher dimensions.

TI Quasi-integrability and nonlinear resonances in cold atoms under
   modulation
SO ROYAL SOCIETY OPEN SCIENCE
AB Quantum dynamics of a collection of atoms subjected to phase modulation has been carefully revisited. We present an exact analysis of the evolution of a two-level system (represented by a spinor) under the action of a time-dependent matrix Hamiltonian. The dynamics is shown to evolve on two coupled potential energy surfaces (PESs): one of them is binding, while the other one is scattering type. The dynamics is shown to be quasi-integrable with nonlinear resonances. The bounded dynamics with intermittent scattering at random moments presents a scenario reminiscent of Anderson and dynamical localization. We believe that a careful analytical investigation of a multi-component system that is classically non-integrable is relevant to many other fields, including quantum computation with multi-qubit systems.

TI Array of Individual Circular Rydberg Atoms Trapped in Optical Tweezers
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Circular Rydberg atoms (CRAs), i.e., Rydberg atoms with maximal orbital momentum, are highly promising for quantum computation, simulation, and sensing. They combine long natural lifetimes with strong interatomic interactions and coupling to electromagnetic fields. Trapping individual CRAs is essential to harness these unique features. We report the first demonstration of CRAs laser trapping in a programmable array of optical bottle beams. We observe the decay of a trapped rubidium circular level over 5 ms using a novel optical detection method. This first optical detection of alkali CRAs is both spatially and level selective. We finally observe the mechanical oscillations of the CRAs in the traps. This work opens the route to the use of circular levels in quantum devices. It is also promising for quantum simulation and information processing using the full extent of Rydberg manifolds.

TI Defining Stable Phases of Open Quantum Systems
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW X
AB The steady states of dynamical processes can exhibit stable nontrivial phases, which can also serve as fault-tolerant classical or quantum memories. For Markovian quantum (classical) dynamics, these steady states are extremal eigenvectors of the non-Hermitian operators that generate the dynamics, i.e., quantum channels (Markov chains). However, since these operators are non-Hermitian, their spectra are an unreliable guide to dynamical relaxation timescales or to stability against perturbations. We propose an alternative dynamical criterion for a steady state to be in a stable phase, which we name uniformity: Informally, our criterion amounts to requiring that, under sufficiently small local perturbations of the dynamics, the unperturbed and perturbed steady states are related to one another by a finite-time dissipative evolution. We show that this criterion implies many of the properties one would want from any reasonable definition of a phase. We prove that uniformity is satisfied in a canonical classical cellular automaton, and we provide numerical evidence that the gap determines the relaxation rate between nearby steady states in the same phase, a situation we conjecture holds generically whenever uniformity is satisfied. We further conjecture some sufficient conditions for a channel to exhibit uniformity and therefore stability.

TI Qubit vitrification and entanglement criticality on a quantum simulator
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Many elusive quantum phenomena emerge from a quantum system interacting with its classical environment. Quantum simulators enable us to program this interaction by using measurement operations. Measurements generally remove part of the entanglement built between the qubits in a simulator. While in simple cases entanglement may disappear at a constant rate as we measure qubits one by one, the evolution of entanglement under measurements for a given class of quantum states is generally unknown. We show that consecutive measurements of qubits in a simulator can lead to criticality, separating two phases of entanglement. Using up to 48 qubits, we prepare an entangled superposition of ground states to a classical spin model. Progressively measuring the qubits drives the simulator through an observable vitrification point and into a spin glass phase of entanglement. Our findings suggest coupling to a classical environment may drive critical phenomena in more general quantum states. Non-equilibrium quantum many-body systems undergoing repeated measurements exhibit phase transitions in their entanglement properties. Here the authors use a superconducting quantum simulator to demonstrate an entanglement phase transition that can be mapped to a vitrification transition in the spin glass theory.

TI Fragmented imaginary-time evolution for early-stage quantum signal
   processors
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Simulating quantum imaginary-time evolution (QITE) is a significant promise of quantum computation. However, the known algorithms are either probabilistic (repeat until success) with unpractically small success probabilities or coherent (quantum amplitude amplification) with circuit depths and ancillary-qubit numbers unrealistically large in the mid-term. Our main contribution is a new generation of deterministic, high-precision QITE algorithms that are significantly more amenable experimentally. A surprisingly simple idea is behind them: partitioning the evolution into a sequence of fragments that are run probabilistically. It causes a considerable reduction in wasted circuit depth every time a run fails. Remarkably, the resulting overall runtime is asymptotically better than in coherent approaches, and the hardware requirements are even milder than in probabilistic ones. Our findings are especially relevant for the early fault-tolerance stages of quantum hardware.

TI Approximate Petz Recovery from the Geometry of Density Operators
SO COMMUNICATIONS IN MATHEMATICAL PHYSICS
AB We derive a new bound on the effectiveness of the Petz map as a universal recovery channel in approximate quantum error correction using the second sandwiched Renyi relative entropy (D) over tilde (2). For large Hilbert spaces, our bound implies that the Petz map performs quantum error correction with order-epsilon accuracy whenever the data processing inequality for (D) over tilde (2) is saturated up to terms of order epsilon(2) times the inverse Hilbert space dimension. Conceptually, our result is obtained by extending (Cree and Sorce in J Phys A Math Theor, 2022. http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1751-8121/ac5648), in which we studied exact saturation of the data processing inequality using differential geometry, to the case of approximate saturation. Important roles are played by (i) the fact that the exponential of the second sandwiched Renyi relative entropy is quadratic in its first argument, and (ii) the observation that the second sandwiched Renyi relative entropy satisfies the data processing inequality even when its first argument is a non-positive Hermitian operator.

TI On-demand directional microwave photon emission using waveguide quantum
   electrodynamics
SO NATURE PHYSICS
AB Routing quantum information between non-local computational nodes is a foundation for extensible networks of quantum processors. Quantum information transfer between arbitrary nodes is generally mediated either by photons that propagate between them or by resonantly coupling nearby nodes. The utility is determined by the type of emitter, propagation channel and receiver. Conventional approaches involving propagating microwave photons have limited fidelity due to photon loss and are often unidirectional, whereas architectures that use direct resonant coupling are bidirectional in principle but can generally accommodate only a few local nodes. Here we demonstrate high-fidelity, on-demand, directional, microwave photon emission. We do this using an artificial molecule comprising two superconducting qubits strongly coupled to a bidirectional waveguide, effectively creating a chiral microwave waveguide. Quantum interference between the photon emission pathways from the molecule generates single photons that selectively propagate in a chosen direction. This circuit will also be capable of photon absorption, making it suitable for building interconnects within extensible quantum networks.

TI Quantum deep learning in neuroinformatics: a systematic review
SO ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE REVIEW
AB Neuroinformatics involves replicating and detecting intricate brain activities through computational models, where deep learning plays a foundational role. Our systematic review explores quantum deep learning (QDL), an emerging deep learning sub-field, to assess whether quantum-based approaches outperform classical approaches in brain data learning tasks. This review is a pioneering effort to compare these deep learning domains. In addition, we survey neuroinformatics and its various subdomains to understand the current state of the field and where QDL stands relative to recent advancements. Our statistical analysis of tumor classification studies (n = 16) reveals that QDL models achieved a mean accuracy of 0.9701 (95% CI 0.9533-0.9868), slightly outperforming classical models with a mean accuracy of 0.9650 (95% CI 0.9475-0.9825). We observed similar trends across Alzheimer's diagnosis, stroke lesion detection, cognitive state monitoring, and brain age prediction, with QDL demonstrating better performance in metrics such as F1-score, dice coefficient, and RMSE. Our findings, paired with prior documented quantum advantages, highlight QDL's promise in healthcare applications as quantum technology evolves. Our discussion outlines existing research gaps with the intent of encouraging further investigation in this developing field.

TI Infinite-Dimensional Quantum Entropy: The Unified Entropy Case
SO ENTROPY
AB Infinite-dimensional systems play an important role in the continuous-variable quantum computation model, which can compete with a more standard approach based on qubit and quantum circuit computation models. But, in many cases, the value of entropy unfortunately cannot be easily computed for states originating from an infinite-dimensional Hilbert space. Therefore, in this article, the unified quantum entropy (which extends the standard von Neumann entropy) notion is extended to the case of infinite-dimensional systems by using the Fredholm determinant theory. Some of the known (in the finite-dimensional case) basic properties of the introduced unified entropies were extended to this case study. Certain numerical examples for computing the proposed finite- and infinite-dimensional entropies are outlined as well, which allowed us to calculate the entropy values for infinite Hilbert spaces.

AB It is a promising research for optimization of quantum gate in the field of quantum computation. We investigate the feasibility of implementing the single-qubit gate (Hadamard) in molecular rotational system. By applying the Multi-constraint quantum optimal control method, the excepted final states can be achieved based on the molecular rotational states both in resonant and non-resonant cases with the control pulses. The permanent electric dipole moment is ignored in non-resonance. Besides, the zero-pulse area constraint and the constant fluence constraint are employed to optimize shapes of control pulses. Finally, we show that the Hadamard gate can be realized with the high fidelity (0.9999) and also examine the dependence of the fidelity on pulse fluence as well as the control pulse.

TI The black hole interior from non-isometric codes and complexity
SO JOURNAL OF HIGH ENERGY PHYSICS
AB Quantum error correction has given us a natural language for the emergence of spacetime, but the black hole interior poses a challenge for this framework: at late times the apparent number of interior degrees of freedom in effective field theory can vastly exceed the true number of fundamental degrees of freedom, so there can be no isometric (i.e. inner-product preserving) encoding of the former into the latter. In this paper we explain how quantum error correction nonetheless can be used to explain the emergence of the black hole interior, via the idea of "non-isometric codes protected by computational complexity". We show that many previous ideas, such as the existence of a large number of "null states", a breakdown of effective field theory for operations of exponential complexity, the quantum extremal surface calculation of the Page curve, post-selection, "state-dependent/state-specific" operator reconstruction, and the "simple entropy" approach to complexity coarse-graining, all fit naturally into this framework, and we illustrate all of these phenomena simultaneously in a soluble model.

TI Approaching the Tsirelson bound with a Sagnac source of
   polarization-entangled photons
SO SCIPOST PHYSICS
AB High-fidelity polarization-entangled photons are a powerful resource for quantum communication, distributing entanglement and quantum teleportation. The Bell-CHSH inequality S <= 2 is violated by bipartite entanglement and only maximally entangled states can achieve S = 2 root 2, the Tsirelson bound. Spontaneous parametric down-conversion sources can produce entangled photons with correlations close to the Tsirelson bound. Sagnac configurations offer intrinsic stability, compact footprint and high collection efficiency, however, there is often a trade off between source brightness and entanglement visibility. Here, we present a Sagnac polarization-entangled source with 2 root 2 - S = (5.65 +/- 0.57) x 10(-3), on-par with the highest S parameters recorded, while generating and detecting (4660 +/- 70) pairs/s/mW, which is a substantially higher brightness than previously reported for Sagnac sources and around two orders of magnitude brighter than for traditional cone sources with the highest S parameters. Our source records 0.9953 +/- 0.0003 concurrence and 0.99743 +/- 0.00014 fidelity to an ideal Bell state. By studying systematic errors in Sagnac sources, we identify that the precision of the collection focal point inside the crystal plays the largest role in reducing the S parameter in our experiment. We provide a pathway that could enable the highest S parameter recorded with a Sagnac source to-date while maintaining very high brightness.

TI Cavity quantum electrodynamics design with single photon emitters in
   hexagonal boron nitride
SO APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS
AB Hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN), a prevalent insulating crystal for dielectric and encapsulation layers in two-dimensional (2D) nanoelectronics and a structural material in 2D nanoelectromechanical systems, has also rapidly emerged as a promising platform for quantum photonics with the recent discovery of optically active defect centers and associated spin states. Combined with measured emission characteristics, here we propose and numerically investigate the cavity quantum electrodynamics scheme, incorporating these defect-enabled single photon emitters (SPEs) in h-BN microdisk resonators. The whispering-gallery nature of microdisks can support multiple families of cavity resonances with different radial and azimuthal mode indices simultaneously, overcoming the challenges in coinciding a single point defect with the maximum electric field of an optical mode both spatially and spectrally. The excellent characteristics of h-BN SPEs, including exceptional emission rate, considerably high Debye-Waller factor, and Fourier transform limited linewidth at room temperature, render strong coupling with the ratio of coupling to decay rates g/max(gamma, kappa) predicated as high as 500. This study not only provides insight into the emitter-cavity interaction, but also contributes toward realizing h-BN photonic components, such as low-threshold microcavity lasers and high-purity single photon sources, critical for linear optics quantum computing and quantum networking applications.

TI Broadband Bright Biphotons From Periodically Poled Brillouin Zone
   Folding Metasurface
SO LASER & PHOTONICS REVIEWS
AB Biphotons from spontaneous parametric down conversion with broad bandwidth are highly wanted in many quantum technologies. However, achieving broad bandwidth in both frequency and momentum while keeping a high rate remains a challenge for both conventional nonlinear crystals and recently emerging nonlinear metasurfaces. Here, we address this challenge by introducing a periodically poled Brillouin zone folding (PP-BZF) metasurface incorporating a periodically perturbed silica grating atop a periodically poled lithium niobate film. PP-BZF metasurfaces support high-Q guided mode resonances at pump, signal and idler wavelengths while enabling quasi-phase matching between three guided modes in a broad frequency/momentum range. The predicted biphoton rate is over 100 MHz/mW with a frequency bandwidth of 20.5 THz (1472.5-1637.8 nm) and a momentum bandwidth of , improving the state-of-the-art for metasurface biphoton sources by over three orders of magnitude in rate and one order of magnitude in bandwidths. This ultrathin broadband bright biphoton source could stimulate system-level miniaturization of various free-space quantum photonic technologies.

TI Ten principles for responsible quantum innovation
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB This paper proposes a set of guiding principles for responsible quantum innovation. The principles are organized into three functional categories: safeguarding, engaging, and advancing (SEA), and are linked to central values in responsible research and innovation (RRI). Utilizing a global equity normative framework and literature-based methodology, we connect the quantum-SEA categories to promise and perils specific to quantum technology (QT). The paper operationalizes the responsible QT framework by proposing ten actionable principles to help address the risks, challenges, and opportunities associated with the entire suite of second-generation QTs, which includes the quantum computing, sensing, simulation, and networking domains. Each quantum domain has different technology readiness levels, risks, and affordances, with sensing and simulation arguably being closest to market entrance. Our proposal aims to catalyze a much-needed interdisciplinary effort within the quantum community to establish a foundation of quantum-specific and quantum-tailored principles for responsible quantum innovation. The overarching objective of this interdisciplinary effort is to steer the development and use of QT in a direction not only consistent with a values-based society but also a direction that contributes to addressing some of society's most pressing needs and goals.

TI Visible Light Communication System Technology Review: Devices,
   Architectures, and Applications
SO CRYSTALS
AB Visible light communication (VLC) is an advanced, highly developed optical wireless communication (OWC) technology that can simultaneously provide lighting and high-speed wireless data transmission. A VLC system has several key advantages: ultra-high data rate, secure communication channels, and a lack of interference from electromagnetic (EM) waves, which enable a wide range of applications. Light-emitting diodes (LEDs) have been considered the optimal choice for VLC systems since they can provide excellent illumination performance. However, the quantum confinement Stark effect (QCSE), crystal orientation, carrier lifetime, and recombination factor will influence the modulation bandwidth, and the transmission performance is severely limited. To solve the insufficient modulation bandwidth, micro-LEDs (mu-LEDs) and laser diodes (LDs) are considered as new ideal light sources. Additionally, the development of modulation technology has dramatically increased the transmission capacity of the system. The performance of the VLC system is briefly discussed in this review article, as well as some of its prospective applications in the realms of the industrial Internet of Things (IoT), vehicle communications, and underwater wireless network applications.

TI Violation of Leggett-Garg Inequality in Perceiving Cup-like Objects and
   Cognitive Contextuality
SO ENTROPY
AB This paper is devoted to an experimental investigation of cognitive contextuality inspired by quantum contextuality research. This contextuality is related to, but not identical to context-sensitivity which is well-studied in cognitive psychology and decision making. This paper is a part of quantum-like modeling, i.e., exploring the methodology of quantum theory outside of physics. We examined the bistable perception of cup-like objects, which strongly depends on experimental contexts. Our experimental data confirmed the existence of cognitive hysteresis, the important role of memory, and the non-commutative structure of cognitive observables. In physics, quantum contextuality is assessed using Bell-CHSH inequalities, and their violation is incorrectly believed to imply the nonlocality of Nature. The violation of Bell-type inequalities in cognitive and social science strongly indicates that the metaphysical implications of these inequalities are quite limited. In our experiments, modified Leggett-Garg inequalities were also significantly violated, but this only means that experimental data from experiments performed in different contexts cannot be modeled by a unique set of noncontextual, jointly distributed random variables. In our experiments, we know the empirical probability distributions measured in different contexts; thus, we can obtain much more detailed and reliable information about contextuality in human cognition by performing nonparametric compatibility tests.

TI Compatibility of quantum instruments
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Incompatibility of quantum devices is a useful resource in various quantum information theoretical tasks, and it is at the heart of some fundamental features of quantum theory. While the incompatibility of measurements and quantum channels is well studied, the incompatibility of quantum instruments has not been explored in much detail. In this work, we revise a notion of instrument compatibility introduced in the literature that we call traditional compatibility. Then, we introduce the notion of parallel compatibility and show that these two notions are inequivalent. We then argue that the notion of traditional compatibility is conceptually incomplete and prove that, while parallel compatibility captures measurement and channel compatibility, traditional compatibility does not capture channel compatibility. Hence, we propose parallel compatibility as the conceptually complete definition of the compatibility of quantum instruments.

TI Improved Approximation Algorithms for Bounded-Degree Local Hamiltonians
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB The low-temperature properties of interacting quantum systems are believed to require exponential resources to compute in the general case. Quantifying the extent to which such properties can be approximated using efficient algorithms remains a significant open challenge. Here, we consider the task of approximating the ground state energy of two-local quantum Hamiltonians with bounded-degree interaction graphs. Most existing algorithms optimize the energy over the set of product states. We propose and analyze a family of shallow quantum circuits that can be used to improve the approximation ratio achieved by a given product state. The algorithm takes as input an n-qubit product state with variance Var and improves its energy by an amount proportional to Var(2)/n. In a typical case, this results in an extensive improvement in the estimated energy. We extend our results to k-local Hamiltonians and entangled initial states.

TI Quadrature squeezing in a nanophotonic microresonator
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Squeezed states of light are essential for emerging quantum technology in metrology and information processing. Chip-integrated photonics offers a route to scalable and efficient squeezed light generation, however, parasitic nonlinear processes and optical losses remain significant challenges. Here, we demonstrate single-mode quadrature squeezing in a photonic crystal microresonator via degenerate dual-pump spontaneous four-wave mixing. Implemented in a scalable, low-loss silicon-nitride photonic-chip platform, the microresonator features a tailored nano-corrugation that modifies its resonances to suppress parasitic nonlinear processes. In this way, we achieve an estimated 7.8 dB of on-chip squeezing in the bus waveguide, with potential for further improvement. These results open a promising pathway toward integrated squeezed light sources for quantum-enhanced interferometry, Gaussian boson sampling, coherent Ising machines, and universal quantum computing.

   shaping
SO OPTICS LETTERS
AB The ability to engineer the properties of quantum optical states is essential for quantum information processing applications. Here, we demonstrate tunable control of spatial correlations between photon pairs produced by spontaneous parametric down-conversion, and measure them using an electron multiplying charge coupled device (EMCCD) camera. By shaping the spatial pump beam profile in a type-I collinear configuration, we tailor the spatial structure of coincidences between photon pairs entangled in high dimensions without effect on intensity. The results highlight fundamental aspects of spatial coherence and hold potential for the development of quantum technologies based on high-dimensional spatial entanglement.

TI Quantum Darwinism in a structured spin environment
SO PHYSICS LETTERS A
AB We examine the emergence and suppression of signatures of quantum Darwinism when the system of interest interacts with a complex, structured environment. We introduce an extended spin-star model where the system is coupled to N independent spin-chains. Each site of the chain then lives in a definite layer of the environment, and hence we term this the "onion" model. We fix the system-environment interaction such that classical objectivity is guaranteed if the environment consists of a single layer. Considering a fully factorized initial state for all constituent sub-systems, we then examine how the emergence and proliferation of signatures of quantum Darwinism are delicately dependent on the chain interaction, establishing that when the chains are considered as indivisible fragments to be interrogated, characteristic redundancy plateaux are always observed at least transiently. In contrast, observing a redundant encoding in a specific layer is highly sensitive to the nature of the interaction. Finally, we consider the case in which each chain is initialized in the ground state of the interaction Hamiltonian, establishing that this case shares the qualitative features of the factorized initial state case, however now the strength of the applied magnetic field has a significant impact on whether quantum Darwinism can be observed. We demonstrate that the presence or absence of quantum Darwinistic features can be understood by analysing the correlations within a layer using total mutual information and global quantum discord.

TI Generalized cluster states from Hopf algebras: non-invertible symmetry
   and Hopf tensor network representation
SO JOURNAL OF HIGH ENERGY PHYSICS
AB Cluster states are crucial resources for measurement-based quantum computation (MBQC). It exhibits symmetry-protected topological (SPT) order, thus also playing a crucial role in studying topological phases. We present the construction of cluster states based on Hopf algebras. By generalizing the finite group valued qudit to a Hopf algebra valued qudit and introducing the generalized Pauli-X operator based on the regular action of the Hopf algebra, as well as the generalized Pauli-Z operator based on the irreducible representation action on the Hopf algebra, we develop a comprehensive theory of Hopf qudits. We demonstrate that non-invertible symmetry naturally emerges for Hopf qudits. Subsequently, for a bipartite graph termed the cluster graph, we assign the identity state and trivial representation state to even and odd vertices, respectively. Introducing the edge entangler as controlled regular action, we provide a general construction of Hopf cluster states. To ensure the commutativity of the edge entangler, we propose a method to construct a cluster lattice for any triangulable manifold. We use the 1d cluster state as an example to illustrate our construction. As this serves as a promising candidate for SPT phases, we construct the gapped Hamiltonian for this scenario and provide a detailed discussion of its non-invertible symmetries. We demonstrate that the 1d cluster state model is equivalent to the quasi-1d Hopf quantum double model with one rough boundary and one smooth boundary. We also discuss the generalization of the Hopf cluster state model to the Hopf ladder model through symmetry topological field theory. Furthermore, we introduce the Hopf tensor network representation of Hopf cluster states by integrating the tensor representation of structure constants with the string diagrams of the Hopf algebra, which can be used to solve the Hopf cluster state model.

These findings demonstrate that adequately designed Ni(II) complexes are excellent candidates for spin qubits.

TI Grover Adaptive Search With Fewer Queries
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB In binary optimization problems, where the goal is to find the input $\boldsymbol {x}$ that minimizes a given objective function, Grover adaptive search (GAS) is a well-known quantum algorithm that provides quadratic speedup when compared with the brute-force approaches of classical computers. GAS calls a renowned quantum search algorithm, Grover search (GS), as a subroutine to search for inputs with function values less than the threshold value. If such an input is found, the threshold value is updated with the function value and the search targets are narrowed. To search efficiently for a solution, an appropriate number of queries must be selected to amplify the desired state of the GS in each step. This paper discusses this issue and proposes a new method for selecting the number of queries and provides proof that our method achieves quadratic speedup as well as the original GAS. Furthermore, the simulation results for 40-bit problems confirm that our method allows an optimal solution with 22% fewer queries than the standard method, thus offering the possibility of significantly reduced computation times for combinatorial optimization problems.

TI BHT-QAOA: The Generalization of Quantum Approximate Optimization
   Algorithm to Solve Arbitrary Boolean Problems as Hamiltonians
SO ENTROPY
AB A new methodology is introduced to solve classical Boolean problems as Hamiltonians, using the quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA). This methodology is termed the "Boolean-Hamiltonians Transform for QAOA" (BHT-QAOA). Because a great deal of research and studies are mainly focused on solving combinatorial optimization problems using QAOA, the BHT-QAOA adds an additional capability to QAOA to find all optimized approximated solutions for Boolean problems, by transforming such problems from Boolean oracles (in different structures) into Phase oracles, and then into the Hamiltonians of QAOA. From such a transformation, we noticed that the total utilized numbers of qubits and quantum gates are dramatically minimized for the generated Hamiltonians of QAOA. In this article, arbitrary Boolean problems are examined by successfully solving them with our BHT-QAOA, using different structures based on various logic synthesis methods, an IBM quantum computer, and a classical optimization minimizer. Accordingly, the BHT-QAOA will provide broad opportunities to solve many classical Boolean-based problems as Hamiltonians, for the practical engineering applications of several algorithms, digital synthesizers, robotics, and machine learning, just to name a few, in the hybrid classical-quantum domain.

TI Coulomb Interaction-Driven Entanglement of Electrons on Helium
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB The generation and evolution of entanglement in many-body systems is an active area of research that spans multiple fields, from quantum information science to the simulation of quantum many-body systems encountered in condensed matter, subatomic physics, and quantum chemistry. Motivated by recent experiments exploring quantum information processing systems with electrons trapped above the surface of cryogenic noble gas substrates, we theoretically investigate the generation of motional entanglement between two electrons via their unscreened Coulomb interaction. The model system consists of two electrons confined in separate electrostatic traps that establish microwave-frequency quantized states of their motion. We compute the motional energy spectra of the electrons, as well as their entanglement, by diagonalizing the model Hamiltonian with respect to a single-particle Hartree product basis. We also compare our results with the predictions of an effective Hamiltonian. The computational procedure outlined here can be employed for device design and guidance of experimental implementations. In particular, the theoretical tools developed here can be used for fine-tuning and optimization of control parameters in future experiments with electrons trapped above the surface of superfluid helium or solid neon.

TI Exploring Photogenerated Molecular Quartet States as Spin Qubits and
   Qudits
SO JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY
AB Photogenerated molecular spin systems hold great promise for applications in quantum information science because they can be prepared in well-defined spin states at modest temperatures, they often exhibit long coherence times, and their properties can be tuned by chemical synthesis. Here, we investigate a molecular spin system composed of a 1,6,7,12-tetra(4-tert-butyl-phenoxy)perylene-3,4:9,10-bis(dicarboximide) (PDI) chromophore covalently linked to a stable nitroxide radical (TEMPO) by optical and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) techniques. Upon photoexcitation of the spin system, a quartet state is formed as confirmed by transient nutation experiments. This quartet state has spin polarization lifetimes longer than 0.1 ms and is characterized by relatively long coherence times of similar to 1.8 mu s even at 80 K. Rabi oscillation experiments reveal that more than 60 single-qubit logic operations can be performed with this system at 80 K. The large magnitude of the nitroxide N-14 hyperfine coupling in the quartet state of PDI-TEMPO is resolved in the transient EPR spectra and leads to a further splitting of the quartet state electron spin sublevels. We discuss the properties of this photogenerated multilevel system, comprising 12 electron-nuclear spin states, in the context of its viability as a qubit for applications in quantum information science.

TI Phase analysis of biphoton joint spectra by interference between
   different SPDC sources
SO OPTICA QUANTUM
AB In spontaneous parametric down-conversion, the spectral correlations between the signal and the idler are expressed by the joint spectral amplitude (JSA) function. However, in the standard coincidence measurements, the phase information of the JSA is lost, and only the square of the absolute value of the JSA is recorded, thus preventing full characterization of the biphoton state. Here, we present an experimental technique to investigate the interference of biphoton joint spectral amplitudes, unlocking new avenues in quantum photonics research. Our method explores phase-dependent phenomena within entangled biphoton spectra. This is achieved by simultaneously pumping two structured nonlinear photonic crystals and observing their interference, which reveals previously inaccessible effects with direct intensity measurements. We demonstrate the versatility of our technique by analyzing two types of joint spectra: one exhibiting a two-lobe shape and the other a three-lobe shape. Additionally, we reconstruct the joint spectral amplitudes for both scenarios and observe good agreement with theoretical predictions. These results pave the way for developing advanced quantum communication and information processing technologies using biphoton spectra.

TI Logical channel for heralded and pure loss with the
   Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill code
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Photon loss is the dominant source of noise in optical quantum systems. The Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) bosonic code provides significant protection; however, even low levels of loss can generate uncorrectable errors that another concatenated code must handle. In this work, we characterize these errors by deriving analytic expressions for the logical channel that arises from pure loss acting on approximate GKP qubits. Unlike random displacement noise, we find that the loss-induced logical channel is not a stochastic Pauli channel. We also provide analytic expressions for the logical channel for "heralded loss," when the light scattered out of the signal mode is measured either by photon number counting, i.e., photon subtraction, or heterodyne detection. These expressions offer a pathway to intentionally inducing non-Pauli channels for, e.g., magic-state production.

TI Benchmarking the operation of quantum heuristics and Ising machines:
   scoring parameter setting strategies on optimization applications
SO QUANTUM MACHINE INTELLIGENCE
AB We discuss guidelines for evaluating the performance of parameterized stochastic solvers for optimization problems, with particular attention to systems that employ novel hardware, such as digital quantum processors running variational algorithms, analog processors performing quantum annealing, or coherent Ising machines. We illustrate through an example a benchmarking procedure grounded in the statistical analysis of the expectation of a given performance metric measured in a test environment. In particular, we discuss the necessity and cost of setting parameters that affect the algorithm's performance. The optimal value of these parameters could vary significantly between instances of the same target problem. We present an open-source software package that facilitates the design, evaluation, and visualization of practical parameter tuning strategies for the complex use of the heterogeneous components of the solver. We examine in detail an example using parallel tempering and a simulator of a photonic coherent Ising machine computing and display the scoring of an illustrative baseline family of parameter setting strategies that feature an exploration-exploitation trade-off.

TI A Grover-search based quantum learning scheme for classification
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB The hybrid quantum-classical learning scheme provides a prominent way to achieve quantum advantages on near-term quantum devices. A concrete example toward this goal is the quantum neural network (QNN), which has been developed to accomplish various supervised learning tasks such as classification and regression. However, there are two central issues that remain obscure when QNN is exploited to accomplish classification tasks. First, a quantum classifier that can well balance the computational cost such as the number of measurements and the learning performance is unexplored. Second, it is unclear whether quantum classifiers can be applied to solve certain problems that outperform their classical counterparts. Here we devise a Grover-search based quantum learning scheme (GBLS) to address the above two issues. Notably, most existing QNN-based quantum classifiers can be seamlessly embedded into the proposed scheme. The key insight behind our proposal is reformulating the classification tasks as the search problem. Numerical simulations exhibit that GBLS can achieve comparable performance with other quantum classifiers under various noise settings, while the required number of measurements is dramatically reduced. We further demonstrate a potential quantum advantage of GBLS over classical classifiers in the measure of query complexity. Our work provides guidance to develop advanced quantum classifiers on near-term quantum devices and opens up an avenue to explore potential quantum advantages in various classification tasks.

TI Coherence-Based Operational Nonclassicality Criteria
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB The nonclassicality of quantum states is a fundamental resource for quantum technologies and quantum information tasks, in general. In particular, a pivotal aspect of quantum states lies in their coherence properties, encoded in the nondiagonal terms of their density matrix in the Fock-state bosonic basis. We present operational criteria to detect the nonclassicality of individual quantum coherences that use only data obtainable in experimentally realistic scenarios. We analyze and compare the robustness of the nonclassical coherence aspects when the states pass through lossy and noisy channels. The criteria can be immediately applied to experiments with light, atoms, solid-state system, and mechanical oscillators, thus providing a toolbox allowing practical experiments to more easily detect the nonclassicality of generated states.

AB Quantum emitters in transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) have recently emerged as a promising platform for generating single photons for optical quantum information processing. In this work, we present an approach for deterministically controlling the polarization of fabricated quantum emitters in a tungsten diselenide (WSe2) monolayer. We employ novel nanopillar geometries with long and sharp tips to induce a controlled directional strain in the monolayer, and we report on fabricated WSe2 emitters producing single photons with a high degree of polarization (99 +/- 4%) and high purity (g((2))(0) = 0.030 +/- 0.025). Our work paves the way for the deterministic integration of TMD-based quantum emitters for future photonic quantum technologies.<br />

TI Indirect control of the 29SiV- nuclear spin in diamond
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB Coherent control and optical readout of the electron spin of the 29SiV??? center in diamond have been demonstrated in the literature, with exciting prospects for implementations as memory nodes and spin qubits. Nuclear spins may be even better suited for many applications in quantum information processing due to their long coherence times. Control of the 29SiV??? nuclear spin using conventional NMR techniques is feasible, albeit at slow kilohertz rates due to the nuclear spin???s low gyromagnetic ratio. In this work we theoretically demonstrate how indirect control using the electron spin-orbit effect can be employed for high-speed, megahertz control of the 29Si nuclear spin. We discuss the impact of the nuclear spin precession frequency on gate times and the exciting possibility of all-optical nuclear spin control.

TI Optimal Moment-Based Characterization of a Gaussian State
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Fast and precise characterization of Gaussian states is crucial for their effective use in quantum technologies. In this work, we apply a multiparameter moment-based estimation method that enables rapid and accurate determination of squeezing, antisqueezing, and the squeezing angle of the squeezed vacuum state. Compared to conventional approaches, our method achieves faster parameter estimation with reduced uncertainty, reaching the Crame<acute accent>r-Rao bound. We validate its effectiveness using the two most common measurement schemes in continuous-variable quantum optics: homodyne detection and double homodyne detection. This rapid estimation framework is well suited for dynamically characterizing sources with timedependent parameters, potentially enabling real-time feedback stabilization.

AB Quantum circuit simulator (QCS) is essential for designing quantum algorithms because it assists researchers in understanding how quantum operations work without access to expensive quantum computers. Traditional array-based QCSs suffer from exponential time and memory complexities. To address this problem, Decision Diagram (DD) was introduced to compress simulation data by exploring the circuit regularity. However, for irregular circuit structures, DD-based simulation incurs significant runtime and memory overhead. To overcome this challenge, we present FlatDD, a high-performance QCS that capitalizes on the strength of both DD- and array-based approaches. FlatDD parallelizes the simulation workload at multiple levels and leverages an efficient caching technique to reuse historical results. To further enhance the simulation performance for deep circuits, FlatDD introduces a gate-fusion algorithm to reduce the computational cost. Compared to state-of-the-art QCSs on commonly used quantum circuits, FlatDD achieves 34.81x speed-up and 1.93x memory reduction.

TI On the Baltimore Light RailLink into the quantum future
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB In the current era of noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) technology, quantum devices present new avenues for addressing complex, real-world challenges including potentially NP-hard optimization problems. Acknowledging the fact that quantum methods underperform classical solvers, the primary goal of our research is to demonstrate how to leverage quantum noise as a computational resource for optimization. This work aims to showcase how the inherent noise in NISQ devices can be leveraged to solve such real-world problems effectively. Utilizing a D-Wave quantum annealer and IonQ's gate-based NISQ computers, we generate and analyze solutions for managing train traffic under stochastic disturbances. Our case study focuses on the Baltimore Light RailLink, which embodies the characteristics of both tramway and railway networks. We explore the feasibility of using NISQ technology to model the stochastic nature of disruptions in these transportation systems. Our research marks the inaugural application of both quantum computing paradigms to tramway and railway rescheduling, highlighting the potential of quantum noise as a beneficial resource in complex optimization scenarios.

TI Compressive sensing based parameter estimation for free-space
   continuous-variable quantum key distribution
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB In satellite-based free-space continuous-variable QKD (CV-QKD), the parameter estimation for the atmospheric channel fluctuations due to the turbulence effects and attenuation is crucial for analyzing and improving the protocol performance. However, the partial key data usually need to be sacrificed for the parameter estimation leading to the secret key reduction and the possible information leakage, especially when the channel is varying. In this paper, compressive sensing (CS) theory is applied to free-space CV-QKD to achieve the channel parameter estimation with small amount of key data sacrifice and low computational complexity. According to CS theory, the possibility of the sparse representation for free-space channel is analyzed and the two types of sparse reconstruction models for the channel parameters are constructed combining with the stability of the sub-channels. The most part of key data for parameter estimation is saved by using the model constructed by the variables in the quantum signals, while all the key data can be saved and be used to generate the secret key by using the model constructed by the second-order statistics of the variables. Thus, the methods can generate more secret key, improve the secret key rate, and be well adapted for the cases with the limited communication time since fewer or no key data (variables) is sacrificed for parameter estimation. Finally, simulation results are given to verify the effectiveness of the proposed methods. (C) 2022 Optica Publishing Group under the terms of the Optica Open Access Publishing Agreement

TI Time and frequency as quantum continuous variables
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We present a second quantization description of frequency-based continuous variables quantum computation in the subspace of single photons. For this, we define frequency and time operators using the free-field Hamiltonian and its Fourier transform, and we show that these observables, when restricted to the one photon per mode subspace, reproduce the canonical position-momentum commutation relations. As a consequence, frequency and time operators can be used to define a universal set of gates in this particular subspace. We discuss the physical implementation of these gates as well as their effect on single photon states, and show that frequency and time variables can also be used to implement continuous variables quantum information protocols, in the same way than polarization is currently used as a two-dimensional quantum variable.

TI Feedback-enhanced distant entanglement of magnon and phonon modes with
   atomic ensembles in coupled cavities
SO OPTICS AND LASER TECHNOLOGY
AB The generation and manipulation of distant entanglement between disparate systems are crucial for various quantum technologies. In this work, we investigate a system of coupled cavities comprising an ensemble in cavity-1, a yttrium-iron-garnet (YIG) sphere in cavity-2, and a coherent feedback loop (CFL) that feeds the output of cavity-1 back into cavity-1 through a beam splitter. This system features five excitation modes: cavity-1 photons, atomic ensemble, cavity-2 photons, and the magnon and phonon modes of the YIG sphere. Thus various combinations of bipartite entanglements can be studied. Our main focus is the study of various combinations of distant bipartite entanglements, especially the entanglement of the atomic ensemble and photons in cavity-1 with the magnon and phonon modes of the YIG sphere in cavity-2. Compared to the previously reported results, introducing a CFL significantly enhances all the bipartite entanglements. Besides, the degree of entanglement of various modes, the parameter space, where the strong entanglement exists, is also significantly enhanced due to CFL. Moreover, the entanglement is more robust against thermal noise. We believe our results are important for quantum technologies where the distribution of entanglement on quantum networks is crucial.

However, a comprehensive understanding of the quantum computational resources required for such a problem is thus far lacking. In this work, we investigate using the quantum subspace expansion (QSE) algorithm to compute the groundstate of the Schwinger model, an archetypal LGT describing quantum electrodynamics in one spatial dimension. We perform numerical simulations, including the effect of measurement noise, to extrapolate the resources required for the QSE algorithm to achieve a desired accuracy for a range of system sizes. Using this, we present a full analysis of the resources required to compute LGT vacuum states using a quantum algorithm using qubitization within a fault tolerant framework. We develop of a novel method for performing qubitization of a LGT Hamiltonian based on a "linear combination of unitaries" (LCU) approach. The cost of the corresponding block encoding operation scales as O(N) with system size N. Including the corresponding prefactors, our method reduces the gate cost by multiple orders of magnitude when compared to previous LCU methods for the QSE algorithm, which scales as O(N2) when applied to the Schwinger model. While the qubit and single circuit T-gate cost resulting from our resource analysis is appealing to early fault-tolerant implementation, we find that the number of shots required to avoid numerical instability within the QSE procedure must be significantly reduced in order to improve the feasibility of the methodology we consider and discuss how this might be achieved.

TI Real-time adaptive estimation of decoherence timescales for a single
   qubit
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB Characterizing the time over which quantum coherence survives is critical for any implementation of quantum bits, memories, and sensors. The usual method for determining a quantum system's decoherence rate involves a suite of experiments probing the entire expected range of this parameter, and extracting the resulting estimation in postprocessing. Here we present an adaptive multiparameter Bayesian approach, based on a simple analytical update rule, to estimate the key decoherence timescales (T1, T2*, and T2) and the corresponding decay exponent of a quantum system in real time, using information gained in preceding experiments. This approach reduces the time required to reach a given uncertainty by a factor up to an order of magnitude, depending on the specific experiment, compared to the standard protocol of curve fitting. A further speedup of a factor approximately 2 can be realized by performing our optimization with respect to sensitivity as opposed to variance.

TI Coherence properties of a spin in a squeezed resonator
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB A promising venue for hybrid quantum computation involves the strong coupling between impurity spins and superconducting circuits. This coupling can be controlled and enhanced by preparing superconducting resonators in nonclassical states, such as squeezed states. In this work, we theoretically study the effects of these states on the coherence properties of the spin. We develop an analytic approach based on the Schrieffer-Wolff transformation that allows us to quantitatively predict the dynamics of the spin, and we numerically confirm its validity. We find that squeezing can enhance the coupling between the resonator and the spin. However, at the same time, it amplifies the photon noise and enhances the spin decoherence. Our work demonstrates a major impediment in using squeezing to reach the strong-coupling limit.

TI Fast quantum dialogue
SO EPJ QUANTUM TECHNOLOGY
AB Quantum dialogue (QD) is a term of quantum cryptography, which can fulfill the secure exchange of two parties' private information in an open environment. Up to now, there have been a lot of QD protocols. Many have several common components and activities, such as encoding photons coming forth with auxiliary photons and back, one party or both performing unitary operations on encoding photons, two times of security check, and both parties' private data being decoded chronologically from encoding photons. This work proposes a brand-new QD model, whose quantum transmission is unidirectional with only one security check and decoding of both parties' secrets are simultaneous. Equally important is neither unitary operations nor auxiliary photons being used. Consequently, such a QD can substantially reduce costs and increase efficiency, thus entitled fast quantum dialogue (FQD). The presented FQD protocol is analysed with safety and without information leakage. Moreover, its information-theoretical efficiency is 88.89%, much higher than the current maximum 66.67%. So, it offers us a better alternative for QD.

TI Optimization schemes for unitary tensor-network circuit
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB An efficient representation of a quantum circuit is of great importance in achieving a quantum advantage on current noisy intermediate scale quantum (NISQ) devices and the classical simulation of quantum many-body systems. The quantum circuits are playing the key ingredient in the performance of variational quantum algorithms and quantum dynamics in problems of physics and chemistry. In this paper, we study the role of the network structure of a quantum circuit in its performance. We discuss the variational optimization of quantum circuit (a unitary tensor-network circuit) with different network structures. The ansatz is performed based on a generalization of well-developed multiscale entanglement renormalization algorithm and also the conjugate-gradient method with an effective line search. We present the benchmarking calculations for different network structures by studying the Heisenberg model in a strongly disordered magnetic field and a tensor-network QR decomposition. Our work can contribute to achieve the most out of NISQ hardware and to classically develop isometric tensor network states.

TI Experimental Demonstration of High-Fidelity Logical Magic States from
   Code Switching
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW X
AB Preparation of high-fidelity logical magic states has remained as a necessary but daunting step towards building a large-scale fault-tolerant quantum computer. One approach is to fault-tolerantly prepare a magic state in one code and then switch to another, a method known as code switching. We experimentally demonstrate this protocol on an ion-trap quantum processor, yielding a logical magic state encoded in an error-correcting code with state-of-the-art logical fidelity. Our experiment is based on the first demonstration of code switching between color codes, from the fifteen-qubit quantum Reed-Muller code to the seven-qubit Steane code. We prepare an encoded magic state in the Steane code with 82.58% probability, with an infidelity of at most 5.1(2.7) x 10(-4). The reported infidelity is lower than the leading infidelity of the physical operations utilized in the protocol by a factor of at least 2.7, indicating the quantum processor is below the pseudothreshold. Furthermore, we create two copies of the magic state in the same quantum processor and perform a logical Bell basis measurement for a sample-efficient certification of the encoded magic state. The high-fidelity magic state can be combined with the alreadydemonstrated fault-tolerant Clifford gates, state preparation, and measurement of the 2D color code, completing a universal set of fault-tolerant computational primitives with logical error rates equal or better than the physical two-qubit error rate.

TI Complexity of Implementing Trotter Steps
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Quantum dynamics can be simulated on a quantum computer by exponentiating elementary terms from the Hamiltonian in a sequential manner. However, such an implementation of Trotter steps has gate com-plexity depending on the total Hamiltonian term number, comparing unfavorably to algorithms using more advanced techniques. We develop methods to perform faster Trotter steps with complexity sub-linear in the number of terms. We achieve this for a class of Hamiltonians whose interaction strength decays with distance according to power law. Our methods include one based on a recursive block encod-ing and one based on an average-cost simulation, overcoming the normalization-factor barrier of these advanced quantum simulation techniques. We also realize faster Trotter steps when certain blocks of Hamiltonian coefficients have low rank. Combining with a tighter error analysis, we show that it suf-fices to use (771/3n1/3 + n2/3/772/3) n1+o(1) gates to simulate uniform electron gas with n spin orbitals and 77 electrons in second quantization in real space, asymptotically improving over the best previous work. We obtain an analogous result when the external potential of nuclei is introduced under the Born-Oppenheimer approximation. We prove a circuit lower bound when the Hamiltonian coefficients take a continuum range of values, showing that generic n-qubit two-local Hamiltonians with commuting terms require at least S2 (n2) gates to evolve with accuracy e = S2 (1/poly(n)) for time t = S2 (e). Our proof is based on a gate-efficient reduction from the approximate synthesis of diagonal unitaries within the Hamming weight-2 subspace, which may be of independent interest. Our result thus suggests the use of Hamiltonian struc-tural properties as both necessary and sufficient to implement Trotter steps with lower gate complexity.

TI Distinguishing erbium dopants in Y2O3 by site
   symmetry: Ab initio theory of two spin-photon interfaces
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW MATERIALS
AB We present a first-principles study of the defect formation and electronic structure of erbium (Er)-doped yttria (Y2O3). This is an emerging material for spin-photon interfaces in quantum information science due to the narrow-linewidth optical emission from Er dopants at standard telecommunication wavelengths and their potential for quantum memories and transducers. We calculate formation energies of neutral and negatively and positively charged Er dopants and find the charge-neutral configuration to be the most stable, consistent with experiment. Of the two substitutional sites of Er for Y, the C-2 (more relevant for quantum memories) and C-3i (more relevant for quantum transduction), we identify the former as possessing the lowest formation energy. The electronic properties are calculated using the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof functional along with the Hubbard U parameter and spin-orbit coupling, which yields a similar to 6 mu(B) orbital and a similar to 3 mu(B) spin magnetic moment, and 11 electrons in the Er 4f shell, confirming the formation of charge-neutral Er3+. This standard density functional theory approach underestimates the band gap of the host and lacks a first-principles justification for U. To overcome these issues we performed screened hybrid functional calculations, including a negative U for the 4f orbitals, with mixing (alpha) and screening (w) parameters. These produced robust electronic features with slight modifications in the band gap and the 4f splittings depending on the choice of tuning parameters. We also computed the many-particle electronic excitation energies and compared them with experimental values from photoluminescence.

TI Improved Placement Precision of Donor Spin Qubits in Silicon using
   Molecule Ion Implantation
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB Donor spins in silicon-28 are among the best performing qubits in the solid state, offering unmatched coherence times, gate fidelities beyond 99% and the ability to fabricate arrays using deterministic ion implantation. Donor placement precision is improved upon, advantageous for qubit readout and coupling, by implanting molecule ions that carry bystander atoms to boost the detection confidence. Here, the suitability of phosphorus difluoride (PF2) molecule ions is demonstrated to fabricate 31P donor qubits. Using secondary ion mass spectrometry, it is confirmed that 19F (nuclear spin I=1/2$I=1/2$) diffuses away from the implant site while 31P remains close to its original location during a donor activation anneal. Electron spin resonance measurements are then performed on PF2-implanted qubit devices. A pure dephasing time of T2*=20.5 +/- 0.5 mu$T_2<^>*= 20.5\pm 0.5 \mu$s and a coherence time of T2Hahn=424 +/- 5 mu$T_2<^>{\text{Hahn}}=424\pm 5 \mu$s are extracted for the P donor electron- values comparable to those found in conventional atomic 31P-implanted qubit devices. Additionally, the P donor electron is not found to hyperfine couple to any 19F nuclear spins in its vicinity. Molecule ions therefore show great promise for producing high-precision deterministically-implanted arrays of long-lived donor spin qubits.

The method is based on the exact analytical solution we derived, which gives the necessary corrective transformation for polarization. Noise and imperfections in any realistic system require iterative application of the computed corrections. In our case, polarization drift compensation was completed on average in 2-3 iterations. This is an improvement by a factor of 10-100 compared to the common methods based on hill-climbing algorithms.

TI Theory of hole-spin qubits in strained germanium quantum dots
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB We theoretically investigate the properties of holes in a SixGe1-x/Ge/SixGe1-x quantum well in a perpendicular magnetic field that make them advantageous as qubits, including a large (>100 meV) intrinsic splitting between the light and heavy hole bands, a very light (similar to 0.05 m(0)) in-plane effective mass, consistent with higher mobilities and tunnel rates, and larger dot sizes that could ameliorate constraints on device fabrication. Compared to electrons in quantum dots, hole qubits do not suffer from the presence of nearby quantum levels (e.g., valley states) that can compete with spins as qubits. The strong spin-orbit coupling in Ge quantum wells may be harnessed to implement electric-dipole spin resonance, leading to gate times of several nanoseconds for single-qubit rotations. The microscopic mechanism of this spin-orbit coupling is discussed, along with its implications for quantum gates based on electric-dipole spin resonance, stressing the importance of coupling terms that arise from the underlying cubic crystal field. Our results provide a theoretical foundation for recent experimental advances in Ge hole-spin qubits.

TI The universal shear conductivity of Fermi liquids and spinon Fermi
   surface states and its detection via spin qubit noise magnetometry
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB We demonstrate a remarkable property of metallic Fermi liquids: the transverse conductivity assumes a universal value in the quasi-static (omega -> 0) limit for wavevectors q in the regime l(mfp)(-1) << q << p(F), where l(mfp) is the mean free path and p(F) is the Fermi momentum. This value is (e(2)/h)R-FS/q in two dimensions (2D), where R-FS measures the local radius of curvature of the Fermi surface (FS) in momentum space. Even more surprisingly, we find that U(1) spin liquids with a spinon FS have the same universal transverse conductivity. This means such spin liquids behave effectively as metals in this regime, even though they appear insulating in standard transport experiments. Moreover, we show that transverse current fluctuations result in a universal low-frequency magnetic noise that can be directly probed by a spin qubit, such as a nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond, placed at a distance z above of the 2D metal or spin liquid. Specifically the magnetic noise is given by C omega P-FS/z, where P-FS is the perimeter of the FS in momentum space and C is a combination of fundamental constants of nature. Therefore these observables are controlled purely by the geometry of the FS and are independent of kinematic details of the quasi-particles, such as their effective mass and interactions. This behavior can be used as a new technique to measure the size of the FS of metals and as a smoking gun probe to pinpoint the presence of the elusive spinon FS in two-dimensional systems. We estimate that this universal regime is within reach of current NV center spectroscopic techniques for several spinon FS candidate materials.

TI Simulating quantum collision models with Hamiltonian simulations using
   early fault-tolerant quantum computers
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We develop randomized quantum algorithms to simulate quantum collision models, also known as repeated interaction schemes, which provide a rich framework to model various open-system dynamics. The underlying technique involves composing time evolutions of the total (system, bath, and interaction) Hamiltonian and intermittent tracing out the environment degrees of freedom. This results in a unified framework where any near-term Hamiltonian simulation algorithm can be incorporated to implement an arbitrary number of such collisions on early fault-tolerant quantum computers: we do not assume access to specialized oracles such as block encodings and minimize the number of ancilla qubits needed. In particular, using the correspondence between Lindbladian evolution and completely positive trace-preserving maps arising out of memoryless collisions, we provide an end-to-end quantum algorithm for simulating Lindbladian dynamics. For a system of n-qubits, we exhaustively compare the circuit depth needed to estimate the expectation value of an observable with respect to the reduced state of the system after time t while employing different near-term Hamiltonian simulation techniques, requiring at most n + 2 qubits in all. We compare the CNOT gate counts of the various approaches for estimating the transverse field magnetization of a 10-qubit XX-Heisenberg spin chain under amplitude damping. Finally, we also develop a framework to efficiently simulate an arbitrary number of memory-retaining collisions, i.e., where environments interact, leading to non-Markovian dynamics. Overall, our methods can leverage quantum collision models for both Markovian and non-Markovian dynamics on early fault-tolerant quantum computers, shedding light on the advantages and limitations of simulating open systems dynamics using this framework.

AB Power flow (PF) analysis is a foundational computational method to study the flow of power in an electrical network. This analysis involves solving a set of non-linear and non-convex differential-algebraic equations. State-of-the-art solvers for PF analysis, therefore, face challenges with scalability and convergence, specifically for large-scale and/or ill-conditioned cases characterized by high penetration of renewable energy sources, among others. The adiabatic quantum computing paradigm has been proven to efficiently find solutions for combinatorial problems in the noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) era, and it can potentially address the limitations posed by state-of-the-art PF solvers. For the first time, we propose a novel adiabatic quantum computing approach for efficient PF analysis. Our key contributions are (i) a combinatorial PF algorithm and a modified version that aligns with the principles of PF analysis, termed the adiabatic quantum PF algorithm (AQPF), both of which use Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) and Ising model formulations; (ii) a scalability study of the AQPF algorithm; and (iii) an extension of the AQPF algorithm to handle larger problem sizes using a partitioned approach. Numerical experiments are conducted using different test system sizes on D-Wave's Advantage (TM) quantum annealer, Fujitsu's digital annealer V3, D-Wave's quantum-classical hybrid annealer, and two simulated annealers running on classical computer hardware. The reported results demonstrate the effectiveness and high accuracy of the proposed AQPF algorithm and its potential to speed up the PF analysis process while handling ill-conditioned cases using quantum and quantum-inspired algorithms.

TI A source of entangled photons based on a cavity-enhanced and
   strain-tuned GaAs quantum dot
SO ELIGHT
AB A quantum-light source that delivers photons with a high brightness and a high degree of entanglement is fundamental for the development of efficient entanglement-based quantum-key distribution systems. Among all possible candidates, epitaxial quantum dots are currently emerging as one of the brightest sources of highly entangled photons. However, the optimization of both brightness and entanglement currently requires different technologies that are difficult to combine in a scalable manner. In this work, we overcome this challenge by developing a novel device consisting of a quantum dot embedded in a circular Bragg resonator, in turn, integrated onto a micromachined piezoelectric actuator. The resonator engineers the light-matter interaction to empower extraction efficiencies up to 0.69(4). Simultaneously, the actuator manipulates strain fields that tune the quantum dot for the generation of entangled photons with corrected fidelities to a maximally entangled state up to 0.96(1). This hybrid technology has the potential to overcome the limitations of the key rates that plague QD-based entangled sources for entanglement-based quantum key distribution and entanglement-based quantum networks.

AB Motivated by limitations on the depth of near-term quantum devices, we study the depth-computation trade-off in the query model, where depth corresponds to the number of adaptive query rounds and the computation per layer corresponds to the number of parallel queries per round. We achieve the strongest known separation between quantum algorithms with r versus r-1 rounds of adaptivity. We do so by using the k-fold Forrelation problem introduced by Aaronson and Ambainis (SICOMP18). For k=2r, this problem can be solved using an r round quantum algorithm with only one query per round, yet we show that any r-1 round quantum algorithm needs an exponential (in the number of qubits) number of parallel queries per round.
   Our results are proven following the Fourier analytic machinery developed in recent works on quantum-classical separations. The key new component in our result are bounds on the Fourier weights of quantum query algorithms with bounded number of rounds of adaptivity. These may be of independent interest as they distinguish the polynomials that arise from such algorithms from arbitrary bounded polynomials of the same degree.

TI High-Purity Single-Photon Emission in the Telecom O-Band from
   Droplet-Epitaxy InAs Quantum Dots Integrated into a GaAs/AlGaAs Planar
   Microcavity on Vicinal GaAs(111)A Platform
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB Efficient single-photon emitters operating at telecom wavelengths are pivotal for implementing long-distance quantum communication through existing fiber-optic networks. Here, the realization of single-photon emission is reported in the second telecom window from droplet-epitaxy InAs quantum dots (QDs) integrated into a GaAs-based photonic structure. By employing an InAlAs metamorphic buffer layer to engineer strain, telecom-wavelength emission is achieved over a broad range of 1170-1360 nm, while maintaining compatibility with mature GaAs device platforms. Embedded in a planar GaAs/AlGaAs distributed Bragg reflector microcavity, these QDs exhibit high-purity single-photon emission, as indicated by a second-order correlation function g(2)(0)$g<^>{(2)}(0)$ = 0.012-0.012+0.051$0.012<^>{+0.051}_{-0.012}$ under continuous-wave excitation and g(2)(0)$g<^>{(2)}(0)$ = 0.069 +/- 0.032$0.069 \pm 0.032$ under pulsed above-band excitation. Time-resolved photoluminescence measurements yield a short average lifetime of about 0.98 ns, and the cavity design improves the extraction efficiency up to 5.8-fold, with a value of approximately 3.9%$\%$ to the first lens. These results highlight the potential of droplet-epitaxy InAs QDs for scalable, fiber-compatible quantum photonic technologies and pave the way for practical long-distance quantum communication.

TI Completely entangled subspaces from Moore-like matrices
SO PHYSICA SCRIPTA
AB Construction of completely entangled subspaces (CES) has gained a considerable attention, recently. These subspaces which contain only entangled states are of great importance for entanglement theory and also provide a valuable resource for quantum information processing tasks. The results of [Proc. Math. Sci., 114, 365 (2004)] and in particular using the properties of certain matrix, namely Vandermonde matrix, to build CES motivated us to search for new distinct CES's. Mainly, the stimulating question of whether there are other matrices that can lead to building CESs emerged. In the current paper we give an affirmative answer to this question by providing a method for constructing CESs using the properties of Moore-like matrices. In addition, we give few examples for the proposed subspaces in case of 3-qubit and 2-qutrit systems. Then a comparison between the resulted subspaces and those constructed from Vandermonde matrix has been given for the systems understudy. The results shows that the two methods give identically the same subspaces in case of multiqubit systems. However, for multipartite systems with local dimensions d & GE; 3 the two methods gave unequivalent CES subspaces. Interestingly, the properties of the proposed Moore-like matrices provided a far rich way for constructing CES subspaces. It leads to generating as many distinct CES's as we want for each multipartite quantum system. This is in contrary to Vandermonde-based method which can give only one CES per system. In addition, the basis for each of the given examples has been obtained in a simple form. Moreover, we evaluated the entanglement of uniformly mixed states over the obtained subspaces in terms of concurrence and geometric measure of entanglement. Since different parameters of a Moore-like matrix lead to distinct CESs for the same system, the realized results can open the door for more investigations and/or applications.

TI Statistical analysis on random quantum circuit sampling by Sycamore and
   Zuchongzhi quantum processors
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Random quantum circuit sampling, a task to sample bit strings from a random quantum circuit, is considered a suitable benchmark task to demonstrate the outperformance of quantum computers even with noisy qubits. Recently, random quantum circuit sampling was performed on the Sycamore quantum processor with 53 qubits [Nature (London) 574, 505 (2019)] and on the Zuchongzhi quantum processor with 56 qubits [Phys. Rev. Lett. 127, 180501 (2021)]. Here, we analyze and compare the statistical properties of the outputs of the random quantum circuit sampling by the Sycamore and Zuchongzhi processors. Using the Marchenko-Pastur law of random matrices of bit strings and the Wasssertein distances between bit strings, we find that the statistical properties of Sycamore bit strings are quite different from those of Zuchongzhi bit strings, while both processors score similar values of linear cross-entropy fidelity for random circuit sampling. Some bit strings sampled by the Zuchongzhi processor pass the NIST random number tests while both Sycamore and Zuchongzhi processors show similar patterns in the heat maps of bit strings. Zuchongzhi bit strings are much closer to classical uniform random bits than those of Sycamore. It is shown that the statistical properties of bit strings of both random quantum circuits change little as the depth of the random quantum circuits increases. Our findings raise a question about the computational reliability of noisy quantum processors because two quantum processors with similar noise levels and similar qubit structures produced statistically different outputs for the same random quantum circuit sampling.

TI Application of Quantum Neural Network for Solar Irradiance Forecasting:
   A Case Study Using the Folsom Dataset, California
SO ENERGIES
AB Merging machine learning with the power of quantum computing holds great potential for data-driven decision making and the development of powerful models for complex datasets. This area offers the potential for improving the accuracy of the real-time prediction of renewable energy production, such as solar irradiance forecasting. However, the literature on this topic is sparse. Addressing this knowledge gap, this study aims to develop and evaluate a quantum neural network model for solar irradiance prediction up to 3 h in advance. The proposed model was compared with Support Vector Regression, Group Method of Data Handling, and Extreme Gradient Boost classical models. The proposed framework could provide competitive results compared to its competitors, considering forecasting intervals of 5 to 120 min ahead, where it was the fourth best-performing paradigm. For 3 h ahead predictions, the proposed model achieved the second-best results compared with the other approaches, reaching a root mean squared error of 77.55 W/m2 and coefficient of determination of 80.92% for global horizontal irradiance forecasting. The results for longer forecasting horizons suggest that the quantum model may process spatiotemporal information from the input dataset in a manner not attainable by the current classical approaches, thus improving forecasting capacity in longer predictive windows.

AB The evolution toward agile, ultra-low-energy, high-capacity optical transport networks can benefit from solutions incorporating multi-band, multi-fiber, and point-to-multipoint (P2MP)/sliceable high-capacity transport technologies carefully designed to simplify network hierarchy and minimize optical-electrical-optical (OEO) conversions. To guarantee quantum-secure communications, these networks require a thorough reassessment of their security plane architecture, acting as a transversal plane to the data and control planes. In this paper, we propose a programmable Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) network built upon multi-protocol QKD systems, including entangled QKD for P2MP secure access/metro scenarios, Quantum Random Key Generation (QRNG) modules as alternative entropy sources for links where QKD system deployment is not economically viable, and hybrid classic/QKD/Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) primitives for greater flexibility and backward compatibility. Authentication services are performed through physically-unclonable-function (PUF) certification authorities, particularly implementing strong Rayleigh-backscattering-pattern or speckle-pattern-based optical Physically Unclonable Functions (OPUFs). These security technologies leverage on agnostic key management system (KMS) and quantum digital twin (QDT) assisted performance optimization, e.g. for artificial intelligence (AI)-based State of Polarization (SOP) compensation. Key relay between border nodes is realized by means of a combination of a centralized PUF and a procedure to securely exchange keys between KMSs based on ETSI-014 and PQC. The KMS can feed keys to encryptors implemented at the different data-plane layers, but the proposed architecture favors encryption relying on physical-layer security techniques to align with the above design principle aimed at a flatter network and fewer OEO conversions. Examples of this are Light Path SECurity (LPSec) techniques, consisting of two nested physical ciphers ensuring a high-security level, and all-optical steganography. Coexistence of classical and quantum signals is generally feasible in the access and metro segments, whereas in the backbone segment it needs to be evaluated on a case-by-case basis.

TI Multipartite EPR-steering and entanglement in a cavity magnomechanical
   system through coherent feedback
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Multipartite Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) steering plays a crucial role in realizing secure quantum communication. In this paper, we theoretically investigate bipartite and tripartite quantum correlations, including entanglement and Gaussian quantum steering, in a cavity magnomechanical system incorporating a coherent feedback loop. We quantify and compare entanglement and Gaussian steering for four coupled bipartite Gaussian modes. Our results show that tuning the beam splitter's reflectivity parameter significantly enhances entanglement in both bipartite and tripartite states. Furthermore, we verify Coffman-Kundu-Wootters (CKW)-type monogamy inequalities for Gaussian steering among three tripartite modes for specific reflectivity values, and reveal the presence of one-way steering. These findings validate our system and demonstrate its potential for robust detection of multipartite entanglement and steering.

TI Implementation of controlled phase gate based on superadiabatic shortcut
   in circuit quantum electrodynamics
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB With high speed and big storage power, quantum computer has received increasing attention. The operation on the quantum computer can be composed of several single-bit and multi-bit quantum logic gates, among which the controlled phase gate is one of the essential two-qubit logic gates. Usually, the quantum gate is realized in a real physical system, and the circuit quantum electrodynamics system (QED) has become a promising candidate due to its long coherent time, easily coupled with other physical system and scaled up to large scale. In this work, we propose a scheme to fast implement a two-qubit controlled phase gate based on the circuit QED by using the superadiabatic-based shortcut, in order to solve the problem that the adiabatic algorithm needs a long time in the process of system evolution. Here, a coding strategy is first designed for the circuit QED system and the two transmon qubits, and the effective Hamiltonian of the system is then presented by dividing different initial states in the rotating-wave approximation. By using the superadiabatic-based shortcut algorithm for two iterations, a correction term in the same form as the system effective Hamiltonian is obtained through anti-diabatic driving, so that the effective Hamiltonian can suppress unwanted transitions between different instantaneous eigenstates. According to the evolution path, the appropriate boundary conditions are also obtained to complete the preparation of the controlled phase gate. The numerical simulation results show the availability of the proposed scheme, that is, the -vertical bar 11 > state can be obtained by system evolution when the initial state is vertical bar 11 >, while the system does not change at all when the other initial states are prepared. Furthermore, the controlled phase gate with high-fidelity can be obtained . It is shown that the fidelity of the controlled phase gate is stable and greater than 0.991 when the evolution time is greater than 0.7t/ t(f). In addition, the proposed scheme can accelerate the evolution and is robust to decoherence. By the resonator decay and the spontaneous emission and dephasing of qubit, the final fidelity of the controlled phase gate is greater than 0.984. Since the controlled phase gate does not need additional parameters, the propsoed scheme is feasible in experiment.

TI More quantum chemistry with fewer qubits
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Quantum computation is one of the most promising new paradigms for the simulation of physical systems composed of electrons and atomic nuclei, with applications in chemistry, solid-state physics, materials science, and molecular biology. This requires a truncated representation of the electronic structure Hamiltonian using a finite number of orbitals. While it is, in principle, obvious how to improve on the representation by including more orbitals, this is usually unfeasible in practice (e.g., because of the limited number of qubits available) and severely compromises the accuracy of the obtained results. Here, we propose a quantum algorithm that improves on the representation of the physical problem by virtue of second-order perturbation theory. In particular, our quantum algorithm evaluates the second-order energy correction through a series of time-evolution steps under the unperturbed Hamiltonian. An important application is to go beyond the active-space approximation, allowing to include corrections of virtual orbitals, known as multireference perturbation theory. Here, we exploit the fact that the unperturbed Hamiltonian is diagonal for virtual orbitals and show that the number of qubits is independent of the number of virtual orbitals. This gives rise to more accurate energy estimates without increasing the number of qubits. Moreover, we demonstrate numerically for realistic chemical systems that the total runtime has highly favorable scaling in the number of virtual orbitals compared to previous studies. Numerical calculations confirm the necessity of the multireference perturbation theory energy corrections to reach accurate ground-state energy estimates. Our perturbation theory quantum algorithm can also be applied to symmetry-adapted perturbation theory. As such, we demonstrate that perturbation theory can help to reduce the quantum hardware requirements for quantum chemistry.

TI Physical coherent cancellation of optical addressing crosstalk in a
   trapped-ion experiment
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB We present an experimental investigation of coherent crosstalk cancellation methods for light delivered to a linear ion chain cryogenic quantum register. The ions are individually addressed using focused laser beams oriented perpendicular to the crystal axis, which are created by imaging each output of a multi-core photonic-crystal fibre waveguide array onto a single ion. The measured nearest-neighbor native crosstalk intensity of this device for ions spaced by 5 mu m is found to be similar to 10(-2). We show that we can suppress this intensity crosstalk from waveguide channel coupling and optical diffraction effects by a factor >10(3) using cancellation light supplied to neighboring channels which destructively interferes with the crosstalk. We measure a rotation error per gate on the order of & varepsilon;x similar to 10(-5) on spectator qubits, demonstrating a suppression of crosstalk error by a factor of >10(2). We compare the performance to composite pulse methods for crosstalk cancellation, and describe the appropriate calibration methods and procedures to mitigate phase drifts between these different optical paths, including accounting for problems arising due to pulsing of optical modulators.

AB The Quantum Charge-Coupled Device (QCCD) architecture is a modular design to expand trapped-ion quantum computer that relies on the coherent shuttling of qubits across an array of segmented electrodes. Leveraging trapped ions for their long coherence times and high-fidelity quantum operations, QCCD technology represents a significant advancement toward practical, large-scale quantum processors. However, shuttling increases thermal motion and consistently necessitates qubit swaps, significantly extend execution time and negatively affect application success rates. In this paper, we introduce S-SYNC - a compiler designed to co-optimize the number of shuttling and swapping operations. S-SYNC exploits the unique properties of QCCD and incorporates generic SWAP operations to efficiently manage shuttle and SWAP counts simultaneously. Building on the static topology formulation of QCCD, we develop scheduling heuristics to enhance overall performance. Our evaluations demonstrate that our approach reduces the shuttling number by 3.69x on average and improves the success rate of quantum applications by 1.73x on average. Moreover, we apply S-SYNC to gain insights into executing applications across various QCCD topologies and to compare the trade-offs between different initial mapping methods.

TI A quantum processor based on coherent transport of entangled atom arrays
SO NATURE
AB The ability to engineer parallel, programmable operations between desired qubits within a quantum processor is key for building scalable quantum information systems(1,2). In most state-of-the-art approaches, qubits interact locally, constrained by the connectivity associated with their fixed spatial layout. Here we demonstrate a quantum processor with dynamic, non-local connectivity, in which entangled qubits are coherently transported in a highly parallel manner across two spatial dimensions, between layers of single- and two-qubit operations. Our approach makes use of neutral atom arrays trapped and transported by optical tweezers; hyperfine states are used for robust quantum information storage, and excitation into Rydberg states is used for entanglement generation(3-5). We use this architecture to realize programmable generation of entangled graph states, such as cluster states and a seven-qubit Steane code state(6,7). Furthermore, we shuttle entangled ancilla arrays to realize a surface code state with thirteen data and six ancillary qubits(8) and a toric code state on a torus with sixteen data and eight ancillary qubits(9). Finally, we use this architecture to realize a hybrid analogue-digital evolution(2) and use it for measuring entanglement entropy in quantum simulations(10-12), experimentally observing non-monotonic entanglement dynamics associated with quantum many-body scars(13,14). Realizing a long-standing goal, these results provide a route towards scalable quantum processing and enable applications ranging from simulation to metrology.

TI Absorption-Based Diamond Spin Microscopy on a Plasmonic Quantum
   Metasurface
SO ACS PHOTONICS
AB Nitrogen vacancy (NV) centers in diamond have emerged as a leading quantum sensor platform, combining exceptional sensitivity with nanoscale spatial resolution by optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR). Because fluorescence-based ODMR techniques are limited by low photon collection efficiency and modulation contrast, there has been growing interest in infrared (IR)-absorption-based readout of the NV singlet state transition. IR readout can improve contrast and collection efficiency, but it has thus far been limited to long-path length geometries in bulk samples due to the small absorption cross section of the NV singlet state. Here, we propose to amplify the IR absorption by introducing a resonant diamond metallodielectric metasurface that concentrates the optical field near the diamond surface. This "plasmonic quantum sensing metasurface" (PQSM) supports plasmonic surface lattice resonances and achieves desired balance between field localization and sensing volume to optimize spin readout sensitivity. From combined electromagnetic and rate-equation modeling, we estimate a near-spin-projection-noise-limited sensitivity below 1 nT Hz(-1/2) per mu m(2) of sensing area using numbers for present-day NV diamond samples and fabrication techniques. The proposed PQSM enables a new form of microscopic ODMR sensing with infrared readout near the spin-projection-noise-limited sensitivity, making it appealing for the most demanding applications such as imaging through scattering tissues and spatially resolved chemical NMR detection.

TI Imaging inspired characterization of single photons carrying orbital
   angular momentum
SO AVS QUANTUM SCIENCE
AB We report on an imaging-inspired measurement of orbital angular momentum (OAM) using only a simple tilted lens and an intensified charged coupled device camera, allowing us to monitor the propagation of OAM structured photons over distance, which is crucial for free-space quantum communication networks. We demonstrate the measurement of OAM orders as high as l(s) = 14 in a heralded single-photon source and show, for the first time, the imaged self-interference of photons carrying OAM in a modified Mach-Zehnder interferometer. The described methods reveal both the charge and order of a photon's OAM and provide a proof of concept for the interference of a single OAM photon with itself. Using these tools, we are able to study the propagation characteristics of OAM photons over a distance, which is important for estimating transport in free-space quantum links. By translating these classical tools into the quantum domain, we offer a robust and direct approach for the complete characterization of a twisted single-photon source, an important building block of a quantum network.

TI Hybrid magnon-photon bundle emission from a
   ferromagnetic-superconducting system
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB We show that the hybrid magnon-photon bundle emission is possible to generate by employing a three-level A-type superconducting artificial atom. The single atom is dispersively coupled with two microwave cavities, one of which simultaneously couples to a yttrium iron garnet (YIG) sphere via the magnetic dipole interaction. Based on the virtual photon exchange, the indirect magnon-atom interaction is established with flexibly tunable coupling strength, thus leading to the consecutive emission of hybrid magnon-photon pairs. The super-Rabi oscillation and Purcell effect make such a hybrid bundle possible in the present three-level system, which is difficult to achieve in the two-level system. The present scheme may find potential applications in quantum information processing and quantum sensing technology.

What is the implication of the main finding? QESIF enhances IoT security in smart cities while maintaining low latency and energy efficiency. The framework offers practical quantum-ready IoT security without significant hardware overhead.Abstract Smart cities necessitate ultra-secure and scalable communication frameworks to manage billions of interconnected IoT devices, particularly in the face of the emerging quantum computing threats. This paper proposes the QESIF, a novel Quantum-Enhanced Secure IoT Framework that integrates Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) with classical IoT infrastructures via a hybrid protocol stack and a quantum-aware intrusion detection system (Q-IDS). The QESIF achieves high resilience against eavesdropping by monitoring quantum bit error rate (QBER) and leveraging entropy-weighted key generation. The simulation results, conducted using datasets TON IoT, Edge-IIoTset, and Bot-IoT, demonstrate the effectiveness of the QESIF. The framework records an average QBER of 0.0103 under clean channels and discards over 95% of the compromised keys in adversarial settings. It achieves Attack Detection Rates (ADRs) of 98.1%, 98.7%, and 98.3% across the three datasets, outperforming the baselines by 4-9%. Moreover, the QESIF delivers the lowest average latency of 20.3 ms and the highest throughput of 868 kbit/s in clean scenarios while maintaining energy efficiency with 13.4 mJ per session.

AB In the noisy intermediate-scale quantum era, scientists are trying to improve the entanglement swapping success rate by researching anti-noise technology on the physical level, thereby obtaining a higher generation rate of long-distance entanglement. However, we may improve the generation rate from another perspective, which is studying an efficient entanglement swapping strategy. This paper analyzes the challenges faced by existing entanglement swapping strategies, including the node allocation principle, time synchronization, and processing of entanglement swapping failure. We present Parallel Segment Entanglement Swapping (PSES) to solve these problems. The core idea of PSES is to segment the path and perform parallel entanglement swapping between segments to improve the generation rate of long-distance entanglement. We construct a tree-like model as the carrier of PSES and propose heuristic algorithms called Layer Greedy and Segment Greedy to transform the path into a tree-like model. Moreover, we realize the time synchronization and design the on-demand retransmission mechanism to process entanglement swapping failure. The experiments show that PSES performs superiorly to other entanglement swapping strategies, and the on-demand retransmission mechanism can reduce the average entanglement swapping time by 80% and the average entanglement consumption by 80%.

TI Full quantum simulation of Shockley-Read-Hall recombination in p-i-n and
   tunnel diodes
SO SOLID-STATE ELECTRONICS
AB We have included Shockley-Read-Hall (SRH) generation/recombination in Non-equilibrium Green's function (NEGF) calculations via a multiphonon relaxation model. The model has been used to study how the presence of defects affects the current-voltage characteristics of GaAs p-i-n diodes, and of an InGaAs tunnel diode. Regarding p-i-n diodes, we show that SRH generation/recombination is responsible for ideality factors approaching the theoretical value of two in the forward bias regime, while in reverse bias the recombination current density varies slowly with the applied voltage. In all the considered cases, the defects located in the center of the active region proved to be the most effective in allowing trap-assisted tunneling from the valence to the conduction band. Finally, the inclusion of SRH recombination in NEGF simulations of Esaki tunnel diodes permits to predict a realistic degradation of the peak-to-valley current ratio.

TI Systems-chart approach to the design of spin relaxation times in
   molecular qubits
SO DALTON TRANSACTIONS
AB Molecular qubits are a promising platform for future quantum information science technologies; however, to find success in novel devices requires that the molecules exhibit long spin relaxation times. Understanding and optimizing these relaxation times has been shown to be challenging and much experimental work has been done to understand how various chemical features of the molecular qubit influence relaxation times. Here we have curated a data set of relaxation times of metal complex molecular qubits and formulated systems design charts to provide a hierarchical organization of how chemical variables affect relaxation times via known physical processes. We demonstrate the utility of the systems charts by combining examples from the literature with calculated descriptors for molecules in the dataset. This approach helps reduce the complexity associated with de novo molecular design by providing a map of interdependencies and identifying features to prioritize during synthesis.
   The paper presents systems design charts for molecular qubits, mapping chemical variables to spin relaxation times for optimized qubit design.

TI Suppressing Polarization Mode Dispersion with the Quantum Zeno Effect
SO ENTROPY
AB Polarization mode dispersion can introduce quantum decoherence in polarization encoded information, limiting the range of quantum communications protocols. Therefore, strategies to nullify the effect would reduce quantum decoherence and potentially increase the operational range of such technology. We constructed a quantum model of polarization mode dispersion alongside a two-level absorbing material. The two-level material serves to destructively measure one of two orthogonal polarization modes, thus projecting the polarization onto the other state. The theoretical results are supported by a numerical simulation in Mathematica Documentation where we compare the evolution of the polarization state with and without the absorbing material. We find that this strategy is effective in suppressing the effects of polarization mode dispersion, and that this method produces a global phase shift related to the waveguide's birefringent properties.

TI Demonstration of a variational quantum eigensolver with a solid-state
   spin system under ambient conditions
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB Quantum simulators offer the potential to utilize the quantum nature of a physical system to study another physical system. In contrast to conventional simulation, which experiences an exponential increase in computational complexity, quantum simulation cost increases only linearly with increasing size of the problem, rendering it a promising tool for applications in quantum chemistry. The variational-quantumeigensolver algorithm is a particularly promising application for investigating molecular electronic structures. For its experimental implementation, spin-based solid-state qubits have the advantage of long decoherence time and high-fidelity quantum gates, which can lead to high accuracy in the ground-state finding. This study uses the nitrogen-vacancy-center system in diamond to implement the variationalquantum-eigensolver algorithm and successfully finds the eigenvalue of a specific Hamiltonian without the need for error-mitigation techniques. With a fidelity of 98.9% between the converged state and the ideal eigenstate, the demonstration provides an important step toward realizing a scalable quantum simulator in solid-state spin systems.

TI Optically Coherent Nitrogen-Vacancy Defect Centers in Diamond
   Nanostructures
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW X
AB Optically active solid-state spin defects have the potential to become a versatile resource for quantum information processing applications. Nitrogen-vacancy defect centers (NV) in diamond act as quantum memories and can be interfaced with coherent photons as demonstrated in entanglement protocols. However, particularly in diamond nanostructures, the effect of spectral diffusion leads to optical decoherence hindering entanglement generation. In this work, we present strategies to significantly reduce the electric noise in diamond nanostructures. We demonstrate single NVs in nanopillars exhibiting a lifetime-limited linewidth on a timescale of one second and long-term spectral stability with an inhomogeneous linewidth as low as 150 MHz over three minutes. Excitation power and energy-dependent measurements in combination with nanoscopic Monte Carlo simulations contribute to a better understanding of the impact of bulk and surface defects on the NV's spectral properties. Finally, we propose an entanglement protocol for nanostructure-coupled NVs providing entanglement generation rates up to hundreds of kHz.

TI A comparative analysis and noise robustness evaluation in quantum neural
   networks
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB In current noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices, hybrid quantum neural networks (HQNNs) offer a promising solution, combining the strengths of classical machine learning with quantum computing capabilities. However, the performance of these networks can be significantly affected by the quantum noise inherent in NISQ devices. In this paper, we conduct an extensive comparative analysis of various HQNN algorithms, namely Quantum Convolution Neural Network (QCNN), Quanvolutional Neural Network (QuanNN), and Quantum Transfer Learning (QTL), for image classification tasks. We evaluate the performance of each algorithm across quantum circuits with different entangling structures, variations in layer count, and optimal placement in the architecture. Subsequently, we select the highest-performing architectures and assess their robustness against noise influence by introducing quantum gate noise through Phase Flip, Bit Flip, Phase Damping, Amplitude Damping, and the Depolarization Channel. Our results reveal that the top-performing models exhibit varying resilience to different noise channels. However, in most scenarios, the QuanNN demonstrates greater robustness across various quantum noise channels, consistently outperforming other models. This highlights the importance of tailoring model selection to specific noise environments in NISQ devices.

TI Probabilistic partition of unity networks for high-dimensional
   regression problems
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR NUMERICAL METHODS IN ENGINEERING
AB We explore the probabilistic partition of unity network (PPOU-Net) model in the context of high-dimensional regression problems and propose a general framework focusing on adaptive dimensionality reduction. With the proposed framework, the target function is approximated by a mixture of experts model on a low-dimensional manifold, where each cluster is associated with a fixed-degree polynomial. We present a training strategy that leverages the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm. During the training, we alternate between (i) applying gradient descent to update the DNN coefficients; and (ii) using closed-form formulae derived from the EM algorithm to update the mixture of experts model parameters. Under the probabilistic formulation, step (ii) admits the form of embarrassingly paralleliazable weighted least-squares solves. The PPOU-Nets consistently outperform the baseline fully-connected neural networks of comparable sizes in numerical experiments of various data dimensions. We also explore the proposed model in applications of quantum computing, where the PPOU-Nets act as surrogate models for cost landscapes associated with variational quantum circuits.

TI Nuclear Spin Readout in a Cavity-Coupled Hybrid Quantum Dot-Donor System
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Nuclear spins show long coherence times and are well isolated from the environment, which are properties making them promising for quantum information applications. Here, we present a method for nuclear spin readout by probing the transmission of a microwave resonator. We consider a single electron in a silicon quantum dot-donor device interacting with a microwave resonator via the electric dipole coupling and subjected to a homogeneous magnetic field and a transverse magnetic field gradient. In our scenario, the electron spin interacts with a P-31 defect nuclear spin via the hyperfine interaction. We theoretically investigate the influence of the P nuclear spin state on the microwave transmission through the cavity and show that nuclear spin readout is feasible with current state-of-the-art devices. Moreover, we identify optimal readout points with strong signal contrast to facilitate the experimental implementation of nuclear spin readout. Furthermore, we investigate the potential for achieving coherent excitation exchange between a nuclear spin qubit and cavity photons.

TI Generation and characterization of polarization-entangled states using
   quantum dot single-photon sources
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Single-photon sources based on semiconductor quantum dots find several applications in quantum information processing due to their high single-photon indistinguishability, on-demand generation, and low multiphoton emission. In this context, the generation of entangled photons represents a challenging task with a possible solution relying on the interference in probabilistic gates of identical photons emitted at different pulses from the same source. In this work, we implement this approach via a simple and compact design that generates entangled photon pairs in the polarization degree of freedom. We operate the proposed platform with single photons produced through two different pumping schemes, the resonant excited one and the longitudinal-acoustic phonon-assisted configuration. We then characterize the produced entangled two-photon states by developing a complete model taking into account relevant experimental parameters, such as the second-order correlation function, Hong-Ou-Mandel visibility, multiphoton emission and pump laser filtering. Our source shows long-term stability and high quality of the generated entangled states, thus constituting a reliable building block for optical quantum technologies.

TI Measuring Analytic Gradients of General Quantum Evolution with the
   Stochastic Parameter Shift Rule
SO QUANTUM
AB Hybrid quantum-classical optimization algorithms represent one of the most promising application for near-term quantum computers. In these algorithms the goal is to optimize an observable quantity with respect to some classical parameters, using feedback from measurements performed on the quantum device. Here we study the problem of estimating the gradient of the function to be optimized directly from quantum measurements, generalizing and simplifying some approaches present in the literature, such as the so-called parameter-shift rule. We derive a mathematically exact formula that provides a stochastic algorithm for estimating the gradient of any multi-qubit parametric quantum evolution, without the introduction of ancillary qubits or the use of Hamiltonian simulation techniques. The gradient measurement is possible when the underlying device can realize all Pauli rotations in the expansion of the Hamiltonian whose coefficients depend on the parameter. Our algorithm continues to work, although with some approximations, even when all the available quantum gates are noisy, for instance due to the coupling between the quantum device and an unknown environment.

TI An efficient simulation for quantum secure multiparty computation
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB The quantum secure multiparty computation is one of the important properties of secure quantum communication. In this paper, we propose a quantum secure multiparty summation (QSMS) protocol based on (t, n) threshold approach, which can be used in many complex quantum operations. To make this protocol secure and realistic, we combine both the classical and quantum phenomena. The existing protocols have some security and efficiency issues because they use (n, n) threshold approach, where all the honest players need to perform the quantum multiparty summation protocol. We however use a (t, n) threshold approach, where only t honest players need to compute the quantum summation protocol. Compared to other protocols our proposed protocol is more cost-effective, realistic, and secure. We also simulate it using the IBM corporation's online quantum computer, or quantum experience.

TI Symmetry from entanglement suppression
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
AB Symmetry is among the most fundamental and powerful concepts in nature, whose existence is usually taken as given, without explanation. We explore whether symmetry can be derived from more fundamental principles from the perspective of quantum information. Starting with a two-qubit system, we show there are only two minimally entangling logic gates: the identity and the SWAP, which interchanges the two states of the qubits. We further demonstrate that, when viewed as an entanglement operator in the spinspace, the S-matrix in the two-body scattering of fermions in the s-wave channel is uniquely determined by unitarity and rotational invariance to be a linear combination of the identity and the SWAP. Realizing a minimally entangling S-matrix would give rise to global symmetries, as exemplified in Wigner's spinflavor symmetry and Schrodinger's conformal invariance in low energy quantum chromodynamics. For N-q species of qubit, the identity gate is associated with an [SU(2)]N-q symmetry, which is enlarged to SU(2N(q)) when there is a species-universal coupling constant.

TI Classical Correlated Light Holography Based on Orbital Angular Momentum
SO ACTA OPTICA SINICA
AB Objective Holography, an innovative optical technique for recording and reconstructing object information through wavefront modulation, was first introduced by physicist Dennis Gabor in 1948. As optical science has advanced, researchers have expanded beyond traditional interferometric methods to develop various holographic approaches, including digital holography and computational holography. Currently, multiple optical degrees of freedom-including polarization, wavelength, and temporal modes-have been utilized to enhance holographic systems. Among these, orbital angular momentum (OAM)-based holography emerges as particularly significant due to its inherent advantages. OAM, distinguished by theoretically infinite mode indices (corresponding to OAM quantum numbers), presents exceptional potential for expanding holographic information capacity through encoding data in spatially structured phase profiles. Traditional OAM holography has demonstrated benefits including high-dimensional multiplexing and enhanced channel capacity in holographic encoding. Recent developments extend OAM holography to entangled photon pairs, achieving superior precision and stability compared to classical implementations. However, the dependence on quantum entangled light sources, requiring complex experimental conditions, restricts practical scalability. Concurrently, classical optical systems that simulate quantum correlations have emerged as a viable alternative. This research presents an OAM holography scheme utilizing classical correlated light. Through comprehensive theoretical modeling and numerical simulations, we confirm its viability and demonstrate performance comparable to quantum entanglement-based methods. By connecting classical optics with quantum-inspired approaches, this work expands the theoretical framework of optical correlations while offering a cost-effective path to advance holographic technologies for practical applications. Methods This study investigates holographic techniques based on OAM using classically correlated light. First, we design a holographic scheme leveraging the properties of classical correlations and OAM. Subsequently, theoretical derivations are conducted to validate the feasibility of the proposed approach. Numerical simulations are then performed to model light field propagation, interference, and holographic reconstruction, thereby illustrating the theoretical performance of the scheme. Finally, a comparative analysis with quantum OAM holography is undertaken to highlight the advantages and potential applications of our classical approach. To ensure the practicality of the scheme, numerical simulations of the classically correlated light source are specifically implemented to verify its compliance with the incoherence condition-a prerequisite for exploiting statistical correlations in this study. Additionally, given the formal resemblance between the generated classical correlated light and quantum entangled sources, we adopt correlation detection methods analogous to quantum entanglement verification. Our results demonstrate that, under specific projection measurements, the classical correlated light exhibits properties akin to quantum entanglement. This finding further justifies its mathematical representation as a classical correlated state, reinforcing the validity of our theoretical framework. Results and Discussions We conduct numerical simulations of the proposed OAM-based classically correlated light holography process. The imaging results (Fig.
   5) demonstrate excellent agreement with theoretical predictions. Notably, the theoretically unbounded OAM quantum numbers enable our holographic scheme to achieve OAM-multiplexed holography for enhanced channel capacity. Compared to conventional OAM-based holography, our protocol exhibits inherent robustness against classical stray light interference (Fig. 7), as holographic information is encoded within the correlations of classical light fields. Furthermore, leveraging structural similarities between classical correlations and quantum entanglement, we demonstrate the feasibility of implementing high-security holographic encryption protocols (Fig. 8). Significantly, while the proposed classical correlated light holography shares comparable imaging processes, outcomes, and inherent advantages with quantum entangled OAM holography, it provides substantially improved experimental feasibility and cost-effectiveness. Conclusions This research presents a classical correlated light holography scheme based on OAM, with its theoretical viability thoroughly validated through theoretical derivation and numerical simulations. The proposed scheme demonstrates formal, characteristic, and imaging equivalency to quantum entanglement holography utilizing OAM. Significantly, it addresses practical limitations inherent in quantum-entangled light systems-including stringent preparation requirements, complex modulation protocols, transmission instability, and reduced operational robustness-thereby offering enhanced feasibility for real-world implementations. Compared with conventional classical holography, the OAM-based classical correlation scheme demonstrates superior robustness by maintaining holographic information integrity and accuracy under classical stray light interference, while achieving heightened security for holographic encryption relative to standard OAM-carrying classical light. Furthermore, the intrinsic properties of OAM and classical correlations suggest promising applications in cutting-edge domains such as high-channel-capacity holographic systems. These findings advance holography development while expanding its technical horizons. However, current research remains primarily theoretical, with experimental validation and practical performance evaluation requiring further investigation. Potential implementation challenges-including precision optical alignment, interferometer stability, and environmental noise suppression-demand thorough exploration to assess system adaptability and reliability in operational scenarios. Future work will focus on experimental optimization, comprehensive property characterization, and deeper investigation of the scheme's physical principles and technical advantages, thereby establishing a robust foundation for expanding its application spectrum.

TI Spin manipulation and decoherence in a quantum dot mediated by a
   synthetic spin-orbit coupling of broken T-symmetry
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB The electrical control of a spin qubit in a quantum dot (QD) relies on spin-orbit coupling (SOC), which could be either intrinsic to the underlying crystal lattice or heterostructure, or extrinsic via, for example, a micro-magnet. In experiments, micromagnets have been used as a synthetic SOC to enable strong coupling of a spin qubit in quantum dots with electric fields. Here we study theoretically the spin relaxation, pure dephasing, spin manipulation, and spin-photon coupling of an electron in a QD due to the synthetic SOC induced spin-orbit mixing. We find qualitative difference in the spin dynamics in the presence of a synthetic SOC compared with the case of the intrinsic SOC. Specifically, spin relaxation due to the synthetic SOC and deformation potential phonon emission (or Johnson noise) shows B-0(5) (or B-0) dependence with the magnetic field, which is in contrast with the B-0(7) (or B-0(3)) dependence in the case of the intrinsic SOC. Moreover, charge noise induces fast spin dephasing to the first order of the synthetic SOC, which is in sharp contrast with the negligible spin pure dephasing in the case of the intrinsic SOC. These qualitative differences are attributed to the broken time-reversal symmetry (T-symmetry) of the synthetic SOC. An SOC with broken T-symmetry (such as the synthetic SOC from a micro-magnet) eliminates the `Van Vleck cancellation' and causes a finite longitudinal spin- electric coupling that allows the longitudinal coupling between spin and electric field, and in turn allows spin pure dephasing. Finally, through proper choice of magnetic field orientation, the electric-dipole spin resonance via the synthetic SOC can be improved with potential applications in spin-based quantum computing.

TI One-Shot Randomized and Nonrandomized Partial Decoupling
SO COMMUNICATIONS IN MATHEMATICAL PHYSICS
AB We introduce a task that we call partial decoupling, in which a bipartite quantum state is transformed by a unitary operation on one of the two subsystems and then is subject to the action of a quantum channel. We assume that the subsystem is decomposed into a direct-sum-product form, which often appears in the context of quantum information theory. The unitary is chosen at random from the set of unitaries having a simple form under the decomposition. The goal of the task is to make the final state, for typical choices of the unitary, close to the averaged final state over the unitaries. We consider a one-shot scenario, and derive upper and lower bounds on the average distance between the two states. The bounds are represented simply in terms of smooth conditional entropies of quantum states involving the initial state, the channel and the decomposition. Thereby we provide generalizations of the one-shot decoupling theorem. The obtained result would lead to further development of the decoupling approaches in quantum information theory and fundamental physics.

TI Er:LiNbO3 with High Optical Coherence Enabling Optical
   Thickness Control
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB Integrated photonics capable of incorporating rare-earth ions with high optical coherence is desirable for realizing efficient quantum transducers, compact quantum memories, and hybrid quantum systems. Here we describe a photonic platform based on the SmartCut erbium-doped lithium niobate thin film, and explore its stable optical transitions at telecom wavelength in a dilution refrigerator. Optical coherence time of up to 180 mu s, rivaling the value of bulk crystals, is achieved in optical ridge waveguides and ring resonators. With this integrated platform, we demonstrate tunable light-ion interaction and flexible control of optical thickness by exploiting long waveguides, whose lengths are in principle variable. This unique ability to obtain high optical density using low-concentration ions further leads to the observation of multiecho pulse trains in centimeter-long waveguides. Our results establish a promising photonic platform for quantum information processing with rare-earth ions.

TI Multi-party simultaneous quantum identity authentication based on
   Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger states
SO EPL
AB A successful implementation of any secure communication protocols requires the identity authentication as a prerequisite. Quantum identity authentication (QIA) can ensure the unconditional security of identity code. In this paper, we propose a multi-party simultaneous quantum identity authentication (MSQIA) protocol based on the Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) state. In the protocol, N certified users can directly send their identity codes to the authenticator Alice simultaneously through quantum channels without classical communication, which enables Alice to authenticate their identity at the same time. Our protocol only requires Alice to perform the single-photon measurement. In theory, this protocol is unconditionally secure and one pair of (N + 1)-photon GHZ state can transmit N bits of identity codes. Our MSQIA protocol has application potential in the quantum communication field in the near future. Copyright (C) 2023 EPLA

TI Pseudochaotic many-body dynamics as a pseudorandom state generator
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Quantum chaos is central to understanding quantum dynamics and is crucial for generating random quantum states, a key resource for quantum information tasks. In this work, we introduce a new class of quantum many-body dynamics, termed pseudochaotic dynamics. Although distinct from chaotic dynamics, out-of-time-ordered correlators, the key indicators of quantum chaos, fail to distinguish them. Moreover, pseudochaotic dynamics generates pseudorandom states that are computationally indistinguishable from Haar-random states. We construct pseudochaotic dynamics by embedding a smaller k-qubit subsystem into a larger n-qubit system. We demonstrate that a subsystem of size k=omega(logn)\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$k=\omega (\log n)$$\end{document} is sufficient to induce pseudochaotic behavior in the entire n-qubit system. Furthermore, we construct a quantum circuit exhibiting pseudochaotic dynamics and demonstrate that it generates pseudorandom states within polylog(n)\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$${{{\rm{polylog}}}}(n)$$\end{document} depth. In summary, our results constitute the discovery of new quantum dynamics that are computationally indistinguishable from genuine quantum chaos, which provides efficient routes to generate useful pseudorandom states.

TI Lithography-Defined Semiconductor Moires with Anomalous In-Gap Quantum
   Hall States
SO NANO LETTERS
AB Quantum materials and phenomena have attracted great interest for their potential applications in next-generation microelectronics and quantum-information technologies. In one especially interesting class of quantum materials, moire superlattices (MSLs) formed by twisted bilayers of 2D materials, a wide range of novel phenomena are observed. However, there exist daunting challenges such as reproducibility and scalability of utilizing 2D MSLs for microelectronics and quantum technologies due to their exfoliate-tear-stack method. Here, we propose lithography-defined semiconductor MSLs, in which three fundamental parameters-electron-electron interaction, spin-orbit coupling, and band topology-are designable. We experimentally investigate quantum-transport properties in a moire specimen made in an InAs quantum well. Strong anomalous in-gap states are observed within the same integer quantum Hall state. Our work opens up new horizons for studying 2D quantum-materials phenomena in semiconductors featuring superior industry-level quality and state-of-the-art technologies, and they may potentially enable new quantum-information and microelectronics technologies.

TI Enhanced valley splitting in Si layers with oscillatory Ge concentration
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB The valley degeneracy in Si qubit devices presents problems for their use in quantum information processing. It is possible to lift this degeneracy by using the wiggle well architecture, in which an oscillatory Ge concentration couples the valleys. This paper presents the basic theory of this phenomenon together with model calculations using the empirical pseudopotential theory to obtain the overall magnitude of this effect and its dependence on the wavelength of the concentration oscillations. We derive an important selection rule which can limit the effectiveness of the wiggle well in certain circumstances.

TI Multiconfigurational study of the negatively charged nitrogen-vacancy
   center in diamond
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB Deep defects in wide band gap semiconductors have emerged as leading qubit candidates for realizing quantum sensing and information applications. Due to the spatial localization of the defect states, these deep defects can be considered as artificial atoms/molecules in a solid state matrix. Here we show that unlike single-particle treatments, the multiconfigurational quantum chemistry methods, traditionally reserved for atoms/molecules, accurately describe the many-body characteristics of the electronic states of these defect centers and correctly predict properties that single-particle treatments fail to obtain. We choose the negatively charged nitrogen-vacancy (NV-) center in diamond as the prototype defect to study with these techniques due to its importance for quantum information applications and because its properties are well known, which makes it an ideal benchmark system. By properly accounting for electron correlations and including spin-orbit coupling and dipolar spin-spin coupling in the quantum chemistry calculations, for the NV- center in diamond clusters, we are able to: (i) show the correct splitting of the ground (first-excited) spin-triplet state into two levels (four levels), (ii) calculate zero-field splitting values of the ground and excited spin-triplet states, in good agreement with experiment, (iii) determine many-body configurations of the spin-singlet states, and (iv) calculate the energy differences between the ground and exited spin-triplet and spin-singlet states, as well as their ordering, which are also found to be in good agreement with recent experimental data. The numerical procedure we have developed is general, and it can screen other color centers whose properties are not well known but promising for applications.

TI Coupling of a single tin-vacancy center to a photonic crystal cavity in
   diamond
SO APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS
AB We demonstrate optical coupling between a single tin-vacancy (SnV) center in diamond and a free-standing photonic crystal nanobeam cavity. The cavities are fabricated using quasi-isotropic etching and feature experimentally measured quality factors as high as similar to 11000. We investigate the dependence of a single SnV center's emission by controlling the cavity wavelength using a laser-induced gas desorption technique. Under resonance conditions, we observe an intensity enhancement of the SnV emission by a factor of 12 and a 16-fold reduction of the SnV lifetime. Based on the large enhancement of the SnV emission rate inside the cavity, we estimate the Purcell factor for the SnV zero-phonon line to be 37 and the coupling efficiency of the SnV center to the cavity, the beta factor, to be 95%. Our work paves the way for the realization of quantum photonic devices and systems based on efficient photonic interfaces using the SnV color center in diamond.

TI Alternative approach to quantum imaginary time evolution
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB There is increasing interest in quantum algorithms (QAs) that are based on the imaginary time evolution (ITE), a successful classical numerical approach to obtain ground states. However, most of the proposals so far require heavy postprocessing computational steps on a classical computer, such as solving linear equations. Here we provide an alternative approach to implement ITE. A key feature in our approach is the use of an orthogonal basis set: the propagated state is efficiently expressed in terms of orthogonal basis states at every step of the evolution. We argue that the number of basis states needed at those steps to achieve an accurate solution can be kept on the order of n, the number of qubits, by controlling the precision (number of significant digits) and the imaginary time increment. The number of quantum gates per imaginary time step is estimated to be polynomial in n. Additionally, while in many QAs the locality of the Hamiltonian is a key assumption, in our algorithm this restriction is not required. This characteristic of our algorithm renders it useful for studying highly nonlocal systems, such as the occupation-representation nuclear shell model. We illustrate our algorithm through numerical implementation on an IBM quantum simulator.

TI Spin supersolid and solid-state ultralow-temperature cooling:
   cutting-edge progress and applications
SO CHINESE SCIENCE BULLETIN-CHINESE
AB Ultralow-temperature environments below 1 Kelvin (K) are essential for advancing research in condensed matter physics, quantum computing, and deep-space exploration. Recent progress in quantum technology and space missions has intensified the need for innovative refrigeration methods capable of achieving these extreme conditions efficiently and sustainably. Traditional sub-Kelvin cooling techniques, such as dilution refrigerators and adiabatic demagnetization, often rely on scarce and expensive helium-3 (He-3), creating bottlenecks for large-scale applications. Against this backdrop, a groundbreaking study-selected as one of China's "Top 10 Scientific Advances of 2024"-has unveiled a promising solidstate alternative. Researchers from the Chinese Academy of Sciences and Beihang University discovered a spin supersolid state in the frustrated quantum magnet Na2BaCo(PO4)(2), which exhibits a giant magnetocaloric effect capable of achieving ultralow temperatures without helium-3. The discovery of the spin supersolid state represents a paradigm shift in sub-Kelvin refrigeration. Supersolids, which combine the crystalline order of solids with the frictionless flow of superfluids, were long theorized but only recently observed in quantum magnets. In Na2BaCo(PO4)(2), the frustrated spin interactions give rise to this exotic state, enabling efficient cooling when exposed to varying magnetic fields. Experimental validation confirmed that the material's magnetocaloric effect-the temperature change induced by magnetic field modulation-is significantly larger than in conventional paramagnetic salts. This breakthrough not only provides a He-3-free cooling solution but also opens new avenues for studying quantum phase transitions and exotic states of matter. Unlike dilution refrigerators, which require complex liquid helium mixtures, or pulse-tube coolers, spin supersolid-based coolers offer a compact, solid-state approach with potential for scalability and integration into quantum devices. Looking ahead, the development of spin supersolid refrigerators could revolutionize ultra-low-temperature technology. By comparing existing methods-such as adiabatic demagnetization, nuclear demagnetization, and hybrid systems-it becomes clear that each has limitations in cost, complexity, or temperature range. The spin supersolid approach addresses many of these challenges, though further research is needed to optimize its cooling power and operational stability. Potential applications span from quantum computing, where millikelvin temperatures are critical for qubit coherence, to space-based observatories requiring passive cooling solutions. As the demand for accessible and efficient sub-Kelvin cooling grows, the integration of quantum materials like Na2BaCo(PO4)(2 )into refrigeration systems may pave the way for next-generation cryogenics, reducing reliance on helium-3 and enabling new frontiers in science and technology.

TI Nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond: discovery of additional electronic
   states
SO MATERIALS FOR QUANTUM TECHNOLOGY
AB Nitrogen-vacancy (NV) defect centers in diamond are key to applications in quantum sensing and quantum computing. They create localized electronic states in the diamond lattice with distinct population relaxation pathways following photoexcitation that ultimately enable its unique properties. The defect is known to exist in two charge states: neutral and negative, with respectively one and two known optically-active electronic transitions. Here, we report on the observation of a large number of hitherto undiscovered excited electronic states in both charge states as evidenced by distinct optical transitions in the infrared to ultraviolet part of the spectrum. These transitions are observed by monitoring the electronic relaxation of NV centers after photoexcitation using transient absorption spectroscopy, directly probing transient phenomena occurring on timescales from femtoseconds to microseconds. We also for the first time probed the electron transfer dynamics from the 3E state of NV- to nearby single-substitutional nitrogen defects (N s ) that leads to the well-known effect of NV photoluminescence quenching.

TI Nonlocal nonreciprocal optomechanical circulator
SO CHINESE PHYSICS B
AB A nonlocal circulator protocol is proposed in a hybrid optomechanical system. By analogy with quantum communication, using the input-output relationship, we establish the quantum channel between two optical modes with long-range. The three-body nonlocal interaction between the cavity and the two oscillators is obtained by eliminating the optomechanical cavity mode and verifying the Bell-CHSH inequality of continuous variables. By introducing the phase accumulation between cyclic interactions, the unidirectional transmission of quantum state between the optical mode and two mechanical modes is achieved. The results show that nonreciprocal transmissions are achieved as long as the accumulated phase reaches a certain value. In addition, the effective interaction parameters in our system are amplified, which reduces the difficulty of the implementation of our protocol. Our research can provide potential applications for nonlocal manipulation and transmission control of quantum platforms.

TI Universal gate set for optical lattice based atom interferometry
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB In this paper, we propose a paradigm for atom interferometry and demonstrate that there exists a universal set of atom optic components for inertial sensing. These components constitute gates with which we carry out quantum operations and represent input-output matter wave transformations between lattice eigenstates. Each gate is associated with a modulation pattern of the position of the optical lattice according to machine-designed protocols. In this methodology, a sensor can be reprogramed to respond to an evolving set of design priorities without modifying the hardware. We assert that such a gate set is metrologically universal, in analogy to universal gate sets for quantum computing. Experimental confirmation of the designed operation is demonstrated via in situ imaging of the spatial evolution of a Bose-Einstein condensate in an optical lattice and by measurement of the momentum probabilities following time-of-flight expansion. The representation of several basic quantum sensing circuits is presented for the measurement of inertial forces, rotating reference frames, and gravity gradients.

TI Magic-Induced Computational Separation in Entanglement Theory
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Entanglement serves as a foundational pillar in quantum information theory, delineating the boundary between what is classical and what is quantum. The common assumption is that a higher degree of entanglement corresponds to a greater degree of "quantumness." However, this folk belief is challenged by the fact that classically simulable operations, such as Clifford circuits, can create highly entangled states. The simulability of these states raises the question: What are the differences between "low-magic" entanglement and "high-magic" entanglement? To understand this interplay between entanglement and magic, we take an operational approach by studying tasks such as entanglement estimation, distillation, and dilution. We uncover a separation of Hilbert space into two distinct regimes: the entanglement-dominated (ED) phase, where entanglement surpasses magic, and the magic-dominated (MD) phase, where magic dominates entanglement. This separation induces a computational phase transition: entanglement-related tasks are efficiently solvable in the ED phase, but become intractable in the MD phase. Our results find applications in diverse areas such as quantum error correction, many-body physics, and the study of quantum chaos, providing a unifying framework for understanding the behavior of quantum systems. We also offer theoretical explanations for previous numerical observations, highlighting the broad implications of the ED-MD distinction across various subfields of physics.

TI High-fidelity, low-latency polarization quantum state transmissions over
   a hollow-core conjoined-tube fiber at around 800 nm
SO PHOTONICS RESEARCH
AB Hollow-core fiber (HCF) promises to unify air-borne light propagation and non-line-of-sight transmission, thus holding great potential for versatile photonics-based quantum information applications. The early version of HCF based on photonic-bandgap guidance has not proven itself a reliable quantum channel because of the poor modal purity in both spatial and polarization domains, as well as significant difficulty in fabrication when the wavelength shifts to the visible region. In this work, based on the polarization degree of freedom, we demonstrate high-fidelity (similar to 0.98) single-photon transmission and distribution of entangled photons over a 36.4 m hollow-core conjoined-tube fiber (CTF) by using commercial silicon single-photon avalanche photodiodes. Our CTF realizes the combined merits of low loss, high spatial modal purity, low polarization degradation, and low chromatic dispersion. We also demonstrate single-photon low-latency (similar to 99.96% speed of light in vacuum) transmission, paving the way for extensive uses of HCF links in versatile photonics-based quantum information processing.

TI High-fidelity spin readout via the double latching mechanism
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Projective measurement of single-electron spins, or spin readout, is among the most fundamental technologies for spin-based quantum information processing. Implementing spin readout with both high-fidelity and scalability is indispensable for developing fault-tolerant quantum computers in large-scale spin-qubit arrays. To achieve high fidelity, a latching mechanism is useful. However, the fidelity can be decreased by spin relaxation and charge state leakage, and the scalability is currently challenging. Here, we propose and demonstrate a double-latching high-fidelity spin readout scheme, which suppresses errors via an additional latching process. We experimentally show that the double-latching mechanism provides significantly higher fidelity than the conventional latching mechanism and estimate a potential spin readout fidelity of 99.94% using highly spin-dependent tunnel rates. Due to isolation from error-inducing processes, the double-latching mechanism combined with scalable charge readout is expected to be useful for large-scale spin-qubit arrays while maintaining high fidelity.

TI Synthesis Techniques for Fault-tolerant Quantum Circuit Implementation
   using Clifford+ZN-group
SO ACM TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM COMPUTING
AB Decoherence jeopardizes the entanglement of fragile quantum states, and is among the foremost challenges towards engineering scalable quantum computers. Realizing quantum circuit implementation with small qubit count and shallow circuit depth is necessary due to the linear scaling of decoherence rate with qubit count and circuit depth. Conversely, reasonable correction of small unitary errors can be achieved by using surface codes along with a transversal gate set to protect quantum information from decoherence. In this paper, we analyze and report the upper bound of non-Clifford phase-depth for different mapping schemes and synthesis approaches. We introduce a synthesis methodology based on lookup-table (LUT) networks, wherein the Boolean logic translates into fault-tolerant quantum logic using Clifford+Z(N) group with zero ancillary cost. We also present fault-tolerant synthesis techniques for k-LUT network using additional ancillary lines with exponential phase-count and unit phase-depth.

TI Autonomous Estimation of High-Dimensional Coulomb Diamonds from Sparse
   Measurements
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB Quantum dot arrays possess ground states governed by Coulomb energies, utilized prominently by singly occupied quantum dots, each implementing a spin qubit. For such quantum processors, the con-trolled transitions between ground states are of operational significance, as these allow the control of quantum information within the array such as qubit initialization and entangling gates. For few-dot arrays, ground states are traditionally mapped out by performing dense raster-scan measurements in control -voltage space. These become impractical for larger arrays due to the large number of measurements needed to sample the high-dimensional gate-voltage hypercube and the comparatively little information extracted. We develop a hardware-triggered detection method based on reflectometry, to acquire measure-ments directly corresponding to transitions between ground states. These measurements are distributed sparsely within the high-dimensional voltage space by executing line searches proposed by a learning algorithm. Our autonomous software-hardware algorithm accurately estimates the polytope of Coulomb blockade boundaries, experimentally demonstrated in a 2 x 2 array of silicon quantum dots.

TI Opportunities for Long-Range Magnon-Mediated Entanglement of Spin Qubits
   via On- and Off-Resonant Coupling
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB The ability to manipulate entanglement between multiple spatially separated qubits is essential for quantum-information processing. Although nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond provide a promising qubit platform, developing scalable two-qubit gates remains a well-known challenge. To this end, magnon-mediated entanglement proposals have attracted attention due to their long-range spin-coherent propagation. Optimal device geometries and gate protocols of such schemes, however, have yet to be determined. Here we predict strong long-distance (mu m) NV-NV coupling via magnon modes with cooperativities exceeding unity in ferromagnetic bar and waveguide structures. Moreover, we explore and compare on-resonant transduction and off-resonant virtual-magnon exchange protocols, and discuss their suitability for generating or manipulating entangled states at low temperatures (T < 150 mK) under realistic experimental conditions. This work will guide future experiments that aim to entangle spin qubits in solids with magnon excitations.

TI Smooth input preparation for quantum and quantum-inspired machine
   learning
SO QUANTUM MACHINE INTELLIGENCE
AB Machine learning has recently emerged as a fruitful area for finding potential quantum computational advantage. Many of the quantum-enhanced machine learning algorithms critically hinge upon the ability to efficiently produce states proportional to high-dimensional data points stored in a quantum accessible memory. Even given query access to exponentially many entries stored in a database, the construction of which is considered a one-off overhead, it has been argued that the cost of preparing such amplitude-encoded states may offset any exponential quantum advantage. Here we prove using smoothed analysis that if the data analysis algorithm is robust against small entry-wise input perturbation, state preparation can always be achieved with constant queries. This criterion is typically satisfied in realistic machine learning applications, where input data is subjective to moderate noise. Our results are equally applicable to the recent seminal progress in quantum-inspired algorithms, where specially constructed databases suffice for polylogarithmic classical algorithm in low-rank cases. The consequence of our finding is that for the purpose of practical machine learning, polylogarithmic processing time is possible under a general and flexible input model with quantum algorithms or quantum-inspired classical algorithms in the low-rank cases.

TI Demonstration of Quantum Brachistochrones between Distant States of an
   Atom
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW X
AB Transforming an initial quantum state into a target state through the fastest possible route-a quantum brachistochrone-is a fundamental challenge for many technologies based on quantum mechanics. In two-level systems, the quantum brachistochrone solutions are long known. These solutions, however, are not applicable to larger systems, especially when the target state cannot be reached through a local transformation. Here, we demonstrate fast coherent transport of an atomic wave packet over a distance of 15 times its size-a paradigmatic case of quantum processes going beyond the two-level system. Our measurements of the transport fidelity reveal the existence of a minimum duration-a quantum speed limit-for the coherent splitting and recombination of matter waves. We obtain physical insight into this limit by relying on a geometric interpretation of quantum state dynamics. These results shed light on a fundamental limit of quantum state dynamics and are expected to find relevant applications in quantum sensing and quantum computing.

TI Experimental Realization and Characterization of Stabilized
   Pair-Coherent
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB The pair-coherent state (PCS) is a theoretical extension of the Glauber coherent state to two harmonic oscillators. It is an interesting class of non-Gaussian continuous-variable entangled state and it is also at the heart of a promising quantum error-correction code: the pair-cat code. Here, we report an experimental demonstration of the pair-coherent state of microwave photons in two superconducting cavities. We implement a cross-cavity pair-photon driven-dissipation process, which conserves the photon-number difference between cavities and stabilizes the state to a specific complex amplitude. We further introduce a technique of quantum subspace tomography, which enables direct measurements of individual coherence elements of a high-dimensional quantum state without global tomographic reconstruction. We characterize our two-mode quantum state with up to four photons in each cavity using this subspace tomography together with direct measurements of the photon-number difference and the joint Wigner function. We identify the spurious cross-Kerr interaction between the cavities and our dissipative reservoir mode as a prominent dephasing channel that limits the steady-state coherence in our current scheme. Our experiment provides a set of reservoir-engineering and state-characterization tools to study quantum optics and implement multimode bosonic codes in superconducting circuits.

TI Quantum simulation of Hawking radiation and curved spacetime with a
   superconducting on-chip black hole
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Hawking radiation is one of the quantum features of a black hole that can be understood as a quantum tunneling across the event horizon of the black hole, but it is quite difficult to directly observe the Hawking radiation of an astrophysical black hole. Here, we report a fermionic lattice-model-type realization of an analogue black hole by using a chain of 10 superconducting transmon qubits with interactions mediated by 9 transmon-type tunable couplers. The quantum walks of quasi-particle in the curved spacetime reflect the gravitational effect near the black hole, resulting in the behaviour of stimulated Hawking radiation, which is verified by the state tomography measurement of all 7 qubits outside the horizon. In addition, the dynamics of entanglement in the curved spacetime is directly measured. Our results would stimulate more interests to explore the related features of black holes using the programmable superconducting processor with tunable couplers.

TI Assessing the Nature of Chiral-Induced Spin Selectivity by Magnetic
   Resonance
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY LETTERS
AB Understanding chiral-induced spin selectivity (CISS), resulting from charge transport through helical systems, has recently inspired many experimental and theoretical efforts but is still the object of intense debate. In order to assess the nature of CISS, we propose to focus on electron-transfer processes occurring at the single-molecule level. We design simple magnetic resonance experiments, exploiting a qubit as a highly sensitive and coherent magnetic sensor, to provide clear signatures of the acceptor polarization. Moreover, we show that information could even be obtained from time-resolved electron paramagnetic resonance experiments on a randomly oriented solution of molecules. The proposed experiments will unveil the role of chiral linkers in electron transfer and could also be exploited for quantum computing applications.

TI Tunable chiral spin-spin interactions in a spin-mechanical hybrid
   system: application to causal-effect simulation
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB Long-range chiral interactions are very attractive due to their potential applications in quantum simulation and quantum information processing. Here we propose and analyze a novel spin-mechanical hybrid quantum device for designing and engineering chiral spin-spin interactions by integrating spin qubits into a programmable mechanical chain. After mapping the Hamiltonian of the mechanical lattice to the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model, we find that chiral spin-phonon bound states and spin-spin coupling interactions can be achieved. Specifically, the range and strength of chiral spin-spin couplings can be tuned in situ by the on-chip manipulation voltages. We further employ this setup to simulate the causal effects in long-range chiral-coupling systems, showing that the correlation functions propagate individually in two sublattices. These phenomena are very different from the situations in the conventional long-range coupling quantum systems without chiral symmetry.

TI Probing of nonlinear hybrid optomechanical systems via partial
   accessibility
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Hybrid optomechanical systems are emerging as a fruitful architecture for quantum technologies. Hence determining the relevant atom-light and light-mechanics couplings is an essential task in such systems. The fingerprint of these couplings is left in the global state of the system during nonequilibrium dynamics. However, in practice, performing measurements on the entire system is not feasible, and thus one has to rely on partial access to one of the subsystems, namely, the atom, the light, or the mechanics. Here we perform a comprehensive analysis to determine the optimal subsystem for probing the couplings. We find that if the light-mechanics coupling is known or irrelevant, depending on the range of the qubit-light coupling, then the optimal subsystem can be either the light or the qubit. In other scenarios, e.g., simultaneous estimation of the couplings, the light is usually the optimal subsystem. This can be explained as light is the mediator between the other two subsystems. Finally, we show that the widely used homodyne detection can extract a fair fraction of the information about the couplings from the light degrees of freedom.

TI Protection of quantum evolutions under parity-time-symmetric
   non-Hermitian Hamiltonians by dynamical decoupling
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Parity-time (PT)-symmetric non-Hermitian Hamiltonians bring about many novel features and interesting applications such as quantum gates faster than those in Hermitian systems and topological state transfer. The performance of evolutions under PT-symmetric Hamiltonians is degraded by the inevitable noise and errors due to system-environment interaction and experimental imperfections. In contrast to Hermitian Hamiltonians, the fluctuations in dissipative beams that are utilized to generate non-Hermitian contributions in the PT-symmetric Hamiltonians cause additional errors. Here we achieve the protection of PT-symmetric Hamiltonians against noise acting along the qubit's quantization axis by combining quantum evolutions with dynamical decoupling sequences. We demonstrate the performance of our method by numerical simulations. Realistic noise sources and parameters are chosen including constant detuning error, time-varying detuning noise, and dissipative-beam noise. The fidelity of states after protected evolutions is well above those after unprotected evolutions under all the above situations. Our work paves the way for further studies and applications of non-Hermitian PT-symmetric physics in noisy quantum systems.

TI On-chip Si3N4 grating outcoupler for
   magneto-optical trap in a cold atom system
SO CHINESE OPTICS LETTERS
AB Cold atoms play an important role in fundamental physics, precision timekeeping, quantum sensing, and quantum computing. The production of cold atoms requires magneto-optical traps (MOTs), but current MOTs consist of a variety of complex and bulky optical infrastructures that hamper their practical application. The development of integrated photonic circuits offers the opportunity to achieve integrated MOTs. Here, we take advantage of the ultra-low loss of the silicon nitride platform to design a grating outcoupler for coupling beams from waveguides to free space. The device operates at a wavelength of 780 nm with an experimental emission angle of 24.38 degrees. Additionally, by appropriately designing the positions of the grating outcouplers on the chip, we propose an on-chip emission system to demonstrate the MOT application. The intersection area is about 2 mm x 2 mm at a height of 6 mm on the chip. Our work provides the possibility of realizing on-chip MOTs.

TI An electrically controlled single-molecule spin switch
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Precise control of spin states and spin-spin interactions in atomic-scale magnetic structures is crucial for spin-based quantum technologies. A promising architecture is molecular spin systems, which offer chemical tunability and scalability for larger structures. An essential component, in addition to the qubits themselves, is switchable qubit-qubit interactions that can be individually addressed. In this study, we present an electrically controlled single-molecule spin switch based on a bistable complex adsorbed on an insulating magnesium oxide film. The complex, which consists of an Fe adatom coupled to an iron phthalocyanine (FePc) molecule, can be reversibly switched between two stable states using bias voltage pulses locally via the tip of a scanning tunnelling microscope. Inelastic electron tunnelling spectroscopy measurements and density functional theory calculations reveal a distinct change between a paramagnetic and a non-magnetic spin configuration. Lastly, we demonstrate the functionality of this molecular spin switch by using it to modify the electron spin resonance frequency of a nearby target FePc spin within a spin-spin coupled structure. Thus, we showcase how individual molecular machines can be utilized to create scalable and tunable quantum devices.

TI Sampling electronic structure quadratic unconstrained binary
   optimization problems (QUBOs) with Ocean and Mukai solvers
SO PLOS ONE
AB The most advanced D-Wave Advantage quantum annealer has 5000+ qubits, however, every qubit is connected to a small number of neighbors. As such, implementation of a fully-connected graph results in an order of magnitude reduction in qubit count. To compensate for the reduced number of qubits, one has to rely on special heuristic software such as qbsolv, the purpose of which is to decompose a large quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) problem into smaller pieces that fit onto a quantum annealer. In this work, we compare the performance of the open-source qbsolv which is a part of the D-Wave Ocean tools and a new Mukai QUBO solver from Quantum Computing Inc. (QCI). The comparison is done for solving the electronic structure problem and is implemented in a classical mode (Tabu search techniques). The Quantum Annealer Eigensolver is used to map the electronic structure eigenvalue-eigenvector equation to a QUBO problem, solvable on a D-Wave annealer. We find that the Mukai QUBO solver outperforms the Ocean qbsolv with one to two orders of magnitude more accurate energies for all calculations done in the present work, both the ground and excited state calculations. This work stimulates the further development of software to assist in the utilization of modern quantum annealers.

TI Attention-based quantum tomography
SO MACHINE LEARNING-SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB With rapid progress across platforms for quantum systems, the problem of many-body quantum state reconstruction for noisy quantum states becomes an important challenge. There has been a growing interest in approaching the problem of quantum state reconstruction using generative neural network models. Here we propose the 'attention-based quantum tomography' (AQT), a quantum state reconstruction using an attention mechanism-based generative network that learns the mixed state density matrix of a noisy quantum state. AQT is based on the model proposed in 'Attention is all you need' by Vaswani et al (2017 NIPS) that is designed to learn long-range correlations in natural language sentences and thereby outperform previous natural language processing (NLP) models. We demonstrate not only that AQT outperforms earlier neural-network-based quantum state reconstruction on identical tasks but that AQT can accurately reconstruct the density matrix associated with a noisy quantum state experimentally realized in an IBMQ quantum computer. We speculate the success of the AQT stems from its ability to model quantum entanglement across the entire quantum system much as the attention model for NLP captures the correlations among words in a sentence.

TI Influence of a non-linear interaction and Kerr medium on the emission
   spectrum and entropy squeezing of Su(1,1) algebra with single qubit
SO RESULTS IN PHYSICS
AB The interaction of a quantum algebraic system su(1, 1) interacting with a qubit is studied. A nonlinear function has been added to interaction with the presence of Kerr medium (KM). The general solution is obtained using the constants of motion and Heisenberg equation for the time-evolution operator. The effects of the nonlinear function and KM on the emission spectrum and entropy squeezing are calculated. The results showed that the emission spectrum is affected by the nonlinear function. Symmetric peaks are generated around the vertical axis with increasing influence of the nonlinear function. By activating the role of the KM, the emission spectrum loses symmetry around the vertical axis and the maximum values decrease. Moreover, the KM reduces the squeezing intervals, while the squeezing intervals are improved by increasing the effect of the nonlinear function.

TI Observable measurement-induced transitions
SO ANNALS OF PHYSICS
AB One of the main postulates of quantum mechanics is that measurements destroy quantum coherence (wave function collapse). Recently it was discovered that in a many-body system dilute local measurements still preserve some coherence across the entire system. As the measurement density is increased, a phase transition occurs that is characterized by the disentanglement of different parts of the system. Unfortunately, this transition is impossible to observe experimentally for macroscopic systems because it requires an exponentially costly full tomography of the many-body wave function or a comparison with the simulation on an oracle classical computer. In this work we report the discovery of another measurement-induced phase transition that can be observed experimentally if quantum dynamics can be reversed. On one side of this phase transition the quantum information encoded in some part of the Hilbert space is fully recovered after the time inversion. On the other side, all quantum information is corrupted. This transition also manifests itself as the change in the behavior of the probability to observe the same measurement outcome in the process that consists of identical blocks repeated many times. In each block the unitary evolution is followed by the measurement. On one side of the transition the probability decreases exponentially with the number of repetitions, on the other it tends to a constant as the number of repetitions is increased. We confirm the existence of the proposed phase transition through numerical simulations of realistic quantum circuits and analytical calculations using an effective random-matrix theory model.

TI Wavevector-resolved polarization entanglement from radiative cascades
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB The generation of entangled photons from radiative cascades has enabled milestone experiments in quantum information science with several applications in photonic quantum technologies. Significant efforts are being devoted to pushing the performances of near-deterministic entangled-photon sources based on single quantum emitters often embedded in photonic cavities, so to boost the flux of photon pairs. The general postulate is that the emitter generates photons in a nearly maximally entangled state of polarization, ready for application purposes. Here, we demonstrate that this assumption is unjustified. We show that in radiative cascades there exists an interplay between photon polarization and emission wavevector, which can be further amplified by embedding the emitters in micro-cavities. We discuss how the polarization entanglement of photon pairs from a biexciton-exciton cascade in quantum dots strongly depends on their propagation wavevector and we even observe entanglement vanishing for large emission angles. Our experimental results, backed by theoretical modeling, yield a brand-new understanding of cascaded emission for various quantum emitters. In addition, our model provides quantitative guidelines for designing optical microcavities that retain both a high degree of entanglement and collection efficiency, moving the community one step further towards an ideal source of entangled photons for quantum technologies.

TI Quantum simulation with fully coherent dipole-dipole interactions
   mediated by three-dimensional subwavelength atomic arrays
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Quantum simulators employing cold atoms are among the most promising approaches to tackle quantum many-body problems. Nanophotonic structures are widely employed to engineer the band structure of light and are thus investigated as a means to tune the interactions between atoms placed in their vicinity. A key shortcoming of this approach is that excitations can decay into free photons, limiting the coherence of such quantum simulators. Here, we overcome this challenge by proposing to use a simple cubic three-dimensional array of atoms to produce an omnidirectional band gap for light and show that it enables coherent, dissipation-free interactions between embedded impurities. We show explicitly that the band gaps persist for moderate lattice sizes and finite filling fraction, which makes this effect readily observable in experiment. Our paper paves the way toward analog spin quantum simulators with long-range interactions using ultracold atomic lattices, and is an instance of the emerging field of atomic quantum metamaterials.

TI Experimental Preparation and Manipulation of Squeezed Cat States via an
   All-Optical In-Line Squeezer
SO LASER & PHOTONICS REVIEWS
AB The squeezed cat state, an essential quantum resource, can be used for quantum error correction and slowing decoherence of the optical cat state. However, preparing a squeezed cat state with high generation rate, and effectively manipulating it, remain challenging. In this work, a high-performance all-optical in-line squeezer is developed to prepare a squeezed cat state and manipulate the phase of the quadrature squeezing. This scheme has the advantages that the phase of the quadrature squeezing of the squeezed cat state can be manipulated by changing the working condition of the squeezer, and that a higher generation rate can be achieved via the deterministic squeezing operation of the in-line squeezer. The generation rate of squeezed cat states reaches 2 kHz, the same as that of the initial cat state. The all-optical in-line squeezer proposed here removes the requirements of electro-optic and opto-electric conversions necessary for an off-line squeezer, thus enabling high-bandwidth squeezing operations on non-Gaussian states. These results provide an efficient method to prepare and manipulate optical squeezed cat states, which makes a step closer to their applications in all-optical quantum information processing.

TI Experimental realization of one-dimensional single-atom array based on
   microscale optical dipole traps
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB Neutral atom array serves as a crucial experimental platform for studying many-body physics, quantum computing, and quantum simulation. In this work, we describe in detail the experimental process of preparing a one-dimensional homogeneous single atom array containing 40 Cs atoms, including the dipole trap array generation device, atomic array fluorescence imaging, and the uniformity optimization of the dipole trap array. The beam waist of the dipole trap is about 1.8 mu m, and the spatial resolution of the imaging system is higher than 1.55 mu m. The non-uniformity of dipole trap array is mainly caused by the intermodulation effect of multi-tone signal during amplification. The uniformity of the dipole trap array is optimized to 2% (Fig. (a)) by measuring the fluctuations of the dipole trap intensity and the light shift of trapped atom, and providing feedback to adjust the phase and amplitude applied to the multi-tone RF signal on acousto-optic deflectors. Furthermore, the uniformity of oscillation frequency, loading rate, and lifetime for trapped atom in the dipole trap array are measured. These results show that oscillation frequency has a uniformity within 2% (Fig. (b)); mean loading rate is around 58% with a uniformity within 3%; and mean lifetime of single atom in dark trap is around 6(1) s with a uniformity within 8%.

TI Co-Designed Reflective and Leaky-Waveguide Low-Pass Filter for
   Superconducting Circuits
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON MICROWAVE THEORY AND TECHNIQUES
AB A stepped-impedance low-pass filter with integrated hollow waveguide absorbers is presented. The filter combines low insertion loss in the passband with strong attenuation at high frequencies, making it well suited for superconducting quantum computing applications, where qubits are sensitive to both near-band and far out-of-band radiation. The structure is implemented in a rectangular coaxial geometry, with inductive sections coupled to circular hollow waveguides oriented orthogonally to the transmission axis. Above their cutoff frequency, these waveguides efficiently couple to radiation inside the stepped-impedance filter, absorbing energy that would otherwise cause Cooper pair breaking in conventional superconductors. Optimal dimensions were obtained using a differential evolution (DE) algorithm applied to interpolated electromagnetic simulation data. A prototype was fabricated and characterized using a calibrated vector network analyzer (VNA) up to 67 GHz. Measurements confirm a 3-dB cutoff frequency at 13.7 GHz, insertion loss below 0.4 dB for frequencies under 8 GHz, and more than 48.5-dB rejection above 17.3 GHz. The design offers a compact, low-loss solution for near-band filtering and suppression of quasiparticle-generating radiation in cryogenic quantum systems.

TI Optimal provable robustness of quantum classification via quantum
   hypothesis testing
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Quantum machine learning models have the potential to offer speedups and better predictive accuracy compared to their classical counterparts. However, these quantum algorithms, like their classical counterparts, have been shown to also be vulnerable to input perturbations, in particular for classification problems. These can arise either from noisy implementations or, as a worst-case type of noise, adversarial attacks. In order to develop defense mechanisms and to better understand the reliability of these algorithms, it is crucial to understand their robustness properties in the presence of natural noise sources or adversarial manipulation. From the observation that measurements involved in quantum classification algorithms are naturally probabilistic, we uncover and formalize a fundamental link between binary quantum hypothesis testing and provably robust quantum classification. This link leads to a tight robustness condition that puts constraints on the amount of noise a classifier can tolerate, independent of whether the noise source is natural or adversarial. Based on this result, we develop practical protocols to optimally certify robustness. Finally, since this is a robustness condition against worst-case types of noise, our result naturally extends to scenarios where the noise source is known. Thus, we also provide a framework to study the reliability of quantum classification protocols beyond the adversarial, worst-case noise scenarios.

TI Light-matter interactions in quantum nanophotonic devices
SO NATURE REVIEWS PHYSICS
AB Nanophotonics offers opportunities for engineering and exploiting the quantum properties of light by integrating quantum emitters into nanostructures, and offering reliable paths to quantum technology applications such as sources of quantum light or new quantum simulators, among many others. In this Review, we discuss common nanophotonic platforms for studying light-matter interactions, explaining their strengths and experimental state-of-the-art. Each platform works at a different interaction regime: from standard cavity quantum electrodynamics (QED) setups to unique quantum nanophotonic devices, such as chiral and non-chiral waveguide QED experiments. When several quantum emitters are integrated into nanophotonic systems, collective interactions emerge, enabling miniaturized, versatile and fast-operating quantum devices. We conclude with a perspective on the near-term opportunities offered by nanophotonics in the context of quantum technologies.
   Quantum nanophotonics examines the interaction between emitters and light confined at the nanoscale. This Review highlights the experimental progress in the field, explains new light-matter interaction regimes and emphasizes their potential applications in quantum technologies.
   Nanophotonics is the field that studies how to control the properties of light at the nanoscale.It began in the late 1980s with the discovery of photonic crystals, followed by subsequent waves that harnessed metals and metamaterials to engineer unique photon flows at the (semi)classical level.Current experimental efforts aim at integrating these setups with natural and artificial atoms to control the light properties at the quantum level.Apart from reducing the mode volume of light and thus enhancing light-matter interactions, nanophotonic setups allow the exploration of new regimes that exploit non-trivial energy dispersions and polarization patterns.Quantum nanophotonics creates unique opportunities to develop a new generation of miniaturized, versatile and fast-operating quantum technologies.

TI Parity-dependent state transfer for direct entanglement generation
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB As quantum information technologies advance, challenges in scaling and connectivity persist, particularly the need for long-range qubit connectivity and efficient entanglement generation. Perfect State Transfer enables time-optimal state transfer between distant qubits using only nearest-neighbor couplings, enhancing device connectivity. Moreover, the transfer protocol results in effective parity-dependent non-local interactions, extending its utility to entanglement generation. Here, we experimentally demonstrate Perfect State Transfer and multi-qubit entanglement generation on a chain of six superconducting transmon qubits with tunable couplers, controlled via parametric drives. By simultaneously activating and engineering all couplings, we implement the transfer for up to six qubits, verifying single-excitation dynamics for different initial states. Extending the protocol to multiple excitations, we confirm its parity-dependent nature, where excitation number controls the phase of the transferred state. Finally, leveraging this property, we prepare a Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger state using a single transfer operation, showcasing potential of Perfect State Transfer for efficient entanglement generation.

TI Quantum Emitters in Hexagonal Boron Nitride: Principles, Engineering and
   Applications
SO ADVANCED FUNCTIONAL MATERIALS
AB Solid-state quantum emitters, molecular-sized complexes releasing a single photon at a time, have garnered much attention owing to their use as a key building block in various quantum technologies. Among these, quantum emitters in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) have emerged as front runners with superior attributes compared to other competing platforms. These attributes are attainable thanks to the robust, two-dimensional (2D) lattice of the material formed by the extremely strong B & horbar;N bonds. This review discusses the fundamental properties of quantum emitters in hBN and highlights recent progress in the field. The focus is on the fabrication and engineering of these quantum emitters facilitated by state-of-the-art equipment. Strategies to integrate the quantum emitters with dielectric and plasmonic cavities to enhance their optical properties are summarized. The latest developments in new classes of spin-active defects, their predicted structural configurations, and the proposed suitable quantum applications are examined. Despite the current challenges, quantum emitters in hBN have steadily become a promising platform for applications in quantum information science.

TI Parallel hybrid quantum-classical machine learning for kernelized
   time-series classification
SO QUANTUM MACHINE INTELLIGENCE
AB Supervised time-series classification garners widespread interest because of its applicability throughout a broad application domain including finance, astronomy, biosensors, and many others. In this work, we tackle this problem with hybrid quantum-classical machine learning, deducing pairwise temporal relationships between time-series instances using a time-series Hamiltonian kernel (TSHK). A TSHK is constructed with a sum of inner products generated by quantum states evolved using a parameterized time evolution operator. This sum is then optimally weighted using techniques derived from multiple kernel learning. Because we treat the kernel weighting step as a differentiable convex optimization problem, our method can be regarded as an end-to-end learnable hybrid quantum-classical-convex neural network, or QCC-net, whose output is a data set-generalized kernel function suitable for use in any kernelized machine learning technique such as the support vector machine (SVM). Using our TSHK as input to a SVM, we classify univariate and multivariate time-series using quantum circuit simulators and demonstrate the efficient parallel deployment of the algorithm to 127-qubit superconducting quantum processors using quantum multi-programming.

TI mRNA codon optimization with quantum computers
SO PLOS ONE
AB Reverse translation of polypeptide sequences to expressible mRNA constructs is a NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem. Each amino acid in the protein sequence can be represented by as many as six codons, and the process of selecting the combination that maximizes probability of expression is termed codon optimization. This work investigates the potential impact of leveraging quantum computing technology for codon optimization. A Quantum Annealer (QA) is compared to a standard genetic algorithm (GA) programmed with the same objective function. The QA is found to be competitive in identifying optimal solutions. The utility of gate-based systems is also evaluated using a simulator resulting in the finding that while current generations of devices lack the hardware requirements, in terms of both qubit count and connectivity, to solve realistic problems, future generation devices may be highly efficient.

TI Modular Approach to Creating Functionalized Surface Arrays of Molecular
   Qubits
SO ADVANCED MATERIALS
AB The quest for developing quantum technologies is driven by the promise of exponentially faster computations, ultrahigh performance sensing, and achieving thorough understanding of many-particle quantum systems. Molecular spins are excellent qubit candidates because they feature long coherence times, are widely tunable through chemical synthesis, and can be interfaced with other quantum platforms such as superconducting qubits. A present challenge for molecular spin qubits is their integration in quantum devices, which requires arranging them in thin films or monolayers on surfaces. However, clear proof of the survival of quantum properties of molecular qubits on surfaces has not been reported so far. Furthermore, little is known about the change in spin dynamics of molecular qubits going from the bulk to monolayers. Here, a versatile bottom-up method is reported to arrange molecular qubits as functional groups of self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) on surfaces, combining molecular self-organization and click chemistry. Coherence times of up to 13 mu s demonstrate that qubit properties are maintained or even enhanced in the monolayer.

TI Atom electronics in single-molecule transistors: single-atom access and
   manipulation
SO ADVANCES IN PHYSICS-X
AB The aim of atom electronics, i.e. the final scale of electronics, is to make use of specific individual atoms as active electronic components. Here, we review recent researches on atom electronics in single-molecule transistors (SMTs) through single-atom access and manipulation. We begin by describing the basic concepts and characteristics of atom electronics in SMTs, before discussing some of the most recent examples, including atomic transistors and atomic storage. In our concluding remarks, we discuss some perspectives on fabrication, integration, and other potential atomic devices in which high precision access to, and manipulation of single atoms could be of great significance. This will affect integrated circuits, quantum computing, and other devices that will drive the electronics of the future.

TI A solvable model for graph state decoherence dynamics
SO SCIPOST PHYSICS CORE
AB We present an exactly solvable toy model for the continuous dissipative dynamics of permutation-invariant graph states of N qubits. Such states are locally equivalent to an N-qubit Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) state, a fundamental resource in many quantum information processing setups. We focus on the time evolution of the state governed by a Lindblad master equation with the three standard single-qubit jump operators, the Hamiltonian part being set to zero. Deriving analytic expressions for the expectation values of observables expanded in the Pauli basis at all times, we analyze the nontrivial intermediate-time dynamics. Using a numerical solver based on matrix product operators, we simulate the time evolution for systems with up to 64 qubits and verify a numerically exact agreement with the analytical results. We find that the evolution of the operator space entanglement entropy of a bipartition of the system manifests a plateau whose duration increases logarithmically with the number of qubits, whereas all Pauli-operator products have expectation values decaying at most in constant time.

TI Quantum routings for single photons with different frequencies
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Controllable single-photon routing takes the central roles in optical quantum networks for quantum information processing. Given that most of the schemes previously proposed are specifically designed for the photons with selected frequencies, here we investigate how to implement the routings of single photons with different frequencies. We show that the routing capabilities of the photons with different frequencies are manipulatable by properly designing the configuration of the scatters such as the cavity with embedded atoms and the channel boundaries. This is particularly important to implement the bandwidth routings of photons in future. (C) 2021 Optical Society of America under the terms of the OSA Open Access Publishing Agreement

TI Software-Defined Networking Orchestration for Interoperable Key
   Management of Quantum Key Distribution Networks
SO ENTROPY
AB This paper demonstrates the use of software-defined networking (SDN) orchestration to integrate regionally separated networks in which different network parts use incompatible key management systems (KMSs) managed by different SDN controllers to ensure end-to-end QKD service provisioning to deliver the QKD keys between geographically different QKD networks. The study focuses on scenarios in which different parts of the network are managed separately by different SDN controllers, requiring an SDN orchestrator to coordinate and manage these controllers. In practical network deployments, operators often utilize multiple vendors for their network equipment. This practice also enables the expansion of the QKD network's coverage by interconnecting various QKD networks equipped with devices from different vendors. However, as coordinating different parts of the QKD network is a complex task, this paper proposes the implementation of an SDN orchestrator which acts as a central entity to manage multiple SDN controllers, ensuring end-to-end QKD service provisioning to address this challenge. For instance, when there are multiple border nodes to interconnect different networks, the SDN orchestrator calculates the path in advance for the end-to-end delivery of keys between initiating and target applications belonging to different networks. This path selection requires the SDN orchestrator to gather information from each SDN controller managing the respective parts of the QKD network. This work shows the practical implementation of SDN orchestration for interoperable KMS in commercial QKD networks in South Korea. By employing an SDN orchestrator, it becomes possible to coordinate multiple SDN controllers and ensure the efficient and secure delivery of QKD keys between different QKD networks with varying vendor equipment.

TI Scalable stable comb-to-tone integrated RF photonic drive for
   superconducting qubits
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB The recent advent of quantum computing has the potential to overhaul security, communications, and scientific modeling. Superconducting qubits are a leading platform that is advancing noise -tolerant intermediate -scale quantum processors. The implementation requires scaling to large numbers of superconducting qubits, circuit depths, and gate speeds, wherein high -purity RF signal generation and effective cabling transport are desirable. Fiber photonic-enhanced RF signal generation has demonstrated the principle of addressing both signal generation and transport requirements, supporting intermediate qubit numbers and robust packaging efforts; however, fiber -based approaches to RF signal distribution are often bounded by their phase instability. Here, we present a silicon photonic integrated circuit -based version of a photonic-enhanced RF signal generator that demonstrates the requisite stability, as well as a path towards the necessary signal fidelity.

TI Simulation of topological Zak phase in spin-phononic crystal networks
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Topological states of matter are particularly interesting for both fundamental research and practical applications. Simulating topological phases in a quantum system is of great interest due to the ability to explore a plethora of topologically nontrivial phenomena in a controllable fashion. We propose and analyze an efficient scheme for simulating topological Zak phase in two-dimensional spin-phononic crystal networks. We show that through a specially designed periodic driving, one can selectively control and enhance the bipartite silicon-vacancy center arrays, so as to obtain chiral-symmetry-protected spin-spin couplings. More importantly, the Floquet engineering spin-spin interactions support rich quantum phases associated with topological invariants. In momentum space, we analyze and simulate the topological nontrivial properties of the one- and two-dimensional systems. As an application in quantum information processing, we study the robust quantum state transfer via topologically protected edge states. This work opens up new prospects for studying quantum acoustics and offers an experimentally feasible platform for the study of topological phases of matter.

AB We propose a novel decentralized feature extraction approach in federated learning to address privacy-preservation issues for speech recognition. It is built upon a quantum convolutional neural network (QCNN) composed of a quantum circuit encoder for feature extraction, and a recurrent neural network (RNN) based end-to-end acoustic model (AM). To enhance model parameter protection in a decentralized architecture, an input speech is first up-streamed to a quantum computing server to extract Mel-spectrogram, and the corresponding convolutional features are encoded using a quantum circuit algorithm with random parameters. The encoded features are then down-streamed to the local RNN model for the final recognition. The proposed decentralized framework takes advantage of the quantum learning progress to secure models and to avoid privacy leakage attacks. Testing on the Google Speech Commands Dataset, the proposed QCNN encoder attains a competitive accuracy of 95.12% in a decentralized model, which is better than the previous architectures using centralized RNN models with convolutional features. We conduct an in-depth study of different quantum circuit encoder architectures to provide insights into designing QCNN-based feature extractors. Neural saliency analyses demonstrate a high correlation between the proposed QCNN features, class activation maps, and the input Mel-spectrogram. We provide an implementation(1) for future studies.

TI Ground state property calculations of LiHn complexes
   using IBM Qiskit's quantum simulator
SO AIP ADVANCES
AB In this study, the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) on a quantum simulator is used in calculating ground state electronic structure properties of the LiHn, n = 1-3, complexes including their singly charged ions. Results calculated using classical electronic structure algorithms are also included. We investigate the use of the unitary coupled cluster with singles and doubles (UCCSD) Ansatz using VQE within Qiskit and compare results to full configuration interaction (FCI) calculations. Computed ground state energies, electron affinities, ionization potentials, and dipole moments are considered. We report the first-of-its-kind simulated quantum computing results of selected LiHn species and use the parity orbital to qubit mapping scheme. We find that VQE/UCCSD results are comparable to classical coupled clusters with singles and doubles for all considered systems with respect to FCI. A VQE calculation cost evaluation is included in which we evaluate performance using both Jordan-Wigner and parity orbital to qubit mapping schemes. We also discuss some of the current limitations of utilizing VQE for the study of chemical systems. (c) 2024 Author(s).

TI Reverse annealing for nonnegative/binary matrix factorization
SO PLOS ONE
AB It was recently shown that quantum annealing can be used as an effective, fast subroutine in certain types of matrix factorization algorithms. The quantum annealing algorithm performed best for quick, approximate answers, but performance rapidly plateaued. In this paper, we utilize reverse annealing instead of forward annealing in the quantum annealing subroutine for nonnegative/binary matrix factorization problems. After an initial global search with forward annealing, reverse annealing performs a series of local searches that refine existing solutions. The combination of forward and reverse annealing significantly improves performance compared to forward annealing alone for all but the shortest run times.

TI The emergence of quantum energy science
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS-ENERGY
AB Quantum engineering seeks to create novel technologies based on the exploitation of distinctly nonclassical behaviors such as quantum coherence. The vast majority of currently pursued applications fall into the domain of quantum information science, with quantum computing as the most visible subdomain. However, other applications of quantum engineering are fast emerging. Here, we review the deployment of quantum engineering principles in the fields of solar energy, batteries, and nuclear energy. We identify commonalities across quantum engineering approaches in those apparently disparate fields and draw direct parallels to quantum information science. We find that a shared knowledge base is forming, which de facto corresponds to a new domain that we refer to as 'quantum energy science'. Quantum energy science bears the promise of substantial performance improvements across energy technologies such as organic solar cells, batteries, and nuclear fusion. The recognition of this emerging domain may be of great relevance to actors concerned with energy innovation. It may also benefit active researchers in this domain by increasing visibility and motivating the deployment of resources and institutional support.

TI Role of Confined Optical Phonons in Exciton Generation in Spherical
   Quantum Dot
SO MATERIALS
AB Optical control of excitonic states in semiconducting quantum dots has enabled it to be deployed as a qubit for quantum information processing. For self-assembled quantum dots, these excitonic states couple with phonons in the barrier material, for which the previous studies have shown that such exciton-phonon coupling can also lead to the generation of exciton, paving the way for their deployment in qubit-state preparation. Previous studies on self-assembled quantum dots comprising polar materials have considered exciton-phonon coupling by treating phonon modes as bulk acoustic modes only, owing to nearly the same acoustic property of the dot and barrier material. However, the dimensional confinement leads to significant modification phonon modes, even though acoustic confinement is weak but optical confinement cannot be overlooked. In this paper, we investigate for the first time the exciton-optical phonon coupling using dielectric continuum model duly accounting for the dimensional confinement leading to exciton generation. We report that at low temperatures (below 10 K), the exciton creation rate attributed to confined optical phonon is approximately 5.7 times (similar to 6) slower than bulk acoustic phonons, which cannot be ignored, and it should be accounted for in determining the effective phonon assisted exciton creation rate.

TI Analysis of Dissipation Mechanisms for Cesium Rydberg Atoms in
   Magic-Wavelength Optical Trap
SO PHOTONICS
AB A magic optical dipole trap (ODT) can confine atoms in the ground state and a highly excited state with the same light shifts, resulting in a long-range coherent lifetime between them, which plays an important role in high-fidelity quantum logic gates, multi-body physics and other quantum information. Here, we use a sum-over-states model to calculate the dynamic polarizabilities of the 6S1/2 ground state and 46S1/2 Rydberg state of Cs atoms and identify corresponding magic wavelengths and magic detunings for trapping the two states in the range of 900-1950 nm. Then, we analyze the robustness of the magic condition and the feasibility of the experimental operation. Furthermore, we estimate the trapping lifetime of Cs Rydberg atoms by considering different dissipation mechanisms, such as photon scattering and photoionization in the magic ODT. The photoexcitation and photoionization of Cs atoms under the action of three-step laser pulses are calculated by the rate equation. The presented results for magic-wavelength ODTs are of great significance for quantum information and quantum computing based on Rydberg atoms.

We show how to attain an effective dispersionless wave packet evolution using only two types of local unitary operators (quantum coins or gates), properly engineered to act at predetermined times and at specific lattice sites during the system's time evolution. In particular, we show that a qubit initially localized about a Gaussian distribution can be almost perfectly confined during long times or sent hundreds lattice sites away from its original location and later almost perfectly reconstructed using only Hadamard and sigma(x) gates.

TI Fracton topological order at finite temperature
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB As new kinds of stabilizer code models, fracton models have been promising in realizing quantum memory or quantum hard drives. However, it has been shown that the fracton topological order of 3D fracton models occurs only at zero temperature. In this Letter, we show that higher dimensional fracton models can support a fracton topological order below a nonzero critical temperature T-c. Focusing on a typical four-dimensional (4D) X-cube model, we show that there is a finite critical temperature T-c by analyzing its free energy from duality. We also obtained the expectation value of the 't Hooft loops in the 4D X-cube model, which directly shows a confinement-deconfinement phase transition at finite temperature. This finite-temperature phase transition can be understood as spontaneously breaking the Z(2) one-form subsystem symmetry. Moreover, we propose an alternative no-go theorem for finite-temperature quantum fracton topological order.

TI Ultra-compact electro-optic phase modulator based on a lithium niobate
   topological slow light waveguide
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Electro-optic modulators (EOMs) are essential devices of optical communications and quantum computing systems. In particular, ultra-compact EOMs are necessary for highly integrated photonic chips. Thin film lithium niobate materials are a promising platform for designing highly efficient EOMs. However, EOMs based on conventional waveguide structures are at a millimeter scale and challenging to scale down further, greatly hindering the capability of on-chip integration. Here, we design an EOM based on lithium niobate valley photonic crystal (VPC) structures for the first time. Due to the high effective refractive index introduced by the strong slow light effect, the EOM can achieve an ultra-compact size of 4 mu mx14 mu m with a half-wave voltage of 1.4 V. The EOM has a high transmittance of 0.87 in the 1068 nm because of the unique spin-valley locking effect in VPC structures. The design is fully compatible with current nanofabrication technology and immune to fabrication defects. Therefore, it opens a new possibility in designing lithium niobate electro-optic modulators and will find broad applications in optical communication and quantum photonic devices.

TI Violation of Bell inequality by photon scattering on a two-level emitter
SO NATURE PHYSICS
AB Entanglement, the non-local correlations present in multipartite quantum systems, is a key resource for quantum technologies. It is therefore a major priority to develop simple and energy-efficient methods for generating high-fidelity entangled states. In the case of light, entanglement can be realized by interactions with matter but the required nonlinear interaction is often impractically weak. Here we show how a single two-level emitter deterministically coupled to light in a nanophotonic waveguide can be used to realize photonic quantum entanglement by excitation at the single-photon level. Efficient optical coupling enables mediation of two-photon interactions by the emitter, creating a strong nonlinearity that leads to entanglement. We experimentally verify energy-time entanglement by violating a Bell inequality in an interferometric measurement of the two-photon scattering response. The on-chip two-level emitter acts as a passive scatterer, so that no advanced spin control is required. As such, our method may provide a more efficient approach to synthesizing photonic entangled states for quantum simulators or metrology.
   A semiconductor quantum dot can passively mediate interactions between two photons, enabling the creation of entangled photon states.

TI Nonlocal magnon entanglement generation in coupled hybrid cavity systems
SO OPTICS LETTERS
AB We investigate dynamical generation of macroscopic nonlocal entanglements between two remote massive magnon-superconducting-circuit hybrid systems. Two fiber-coupled microwave cavities are employed to serve as an interaction channel connecting two sets of macroscopic hybrid units, each containing a magnon (hosted by an yttrium-iron-garnet sphere) and a superconducting-circuit qubit. Surprisingly, it is found that stronger coupling does not necessarily mean faster entanglement generation. The proposed hybrid system allows the existence of an optimal fiber coupling strength that requires the shortest amount of time to generate a systematic maximal entanglement. Our theoretical results are shown to be within the scope of specific parameters that can be achieved with current technology. The noise effects on the implementation of systems are also treated in a general environment, suggesting the robustness of entanglement generation. Our discrete-variable qubit-like entanglement theory of magnons may lead to direct applications in various quantum information tasks. (C) 2021 Optical Society of America

TI Hybrid Classical-Quantum Transfer Learning for Cardiomegaly Detection in
   Chest X-rays
SO JOURNAL OF IMAGING
AB Cardiovascular diseases are among the major health problems that are likely to benefit from promising developments in quantum machine learning for medical imaging. The chest X-ray (CXR), a widely used modality, can reveal cardiomegaly, even when performed primarily for a non-cardiological indication. Based on pre-trained DenseNet-121, we designed hybrid classical-quantum (CQ) transfer learning models to detect cardiomegaly in CXRs. Using Qiskit and PennyLane, we integrated a parameterized quantum circuit into a classic network implemented in PyTorch. We mined the CheXpert public repository to create a balanced dataset with 2436 posteroanterior CXRs from different patients distributed between cardiomegaly and the control. Using k-fold cross-validation, the CQ models were trained using a state vector simulator. The normalized global effective dimension allowed us to compare the trainability in the CQ models run on Qiskit. For prediction, ROC AUC scores up to 0.93 and accuracies up to 0.87 were achieved for several CQ models, rivaling the classical-classical (CC) model used as a reference. A trustworthy Grad-CAM++ heatmap with a hot zone covering the heart was visualized more often with the QC option than that with the CC option (94% vs. 61%, p < 0.001), which may boost the rate of acceptance by health professionals.

TI Tighter monogamy relations in multiparty quantum systems
SO QUANTUM INFORMATION PROCESSING
AB We investigate tight monogamy relations of multiparty quantum entanglement in this paper. First, we obtain a class of lower bounds of multiparty quantum systems for the quantum states satisfying constraints, which improve the previous results. Next, we establish a class of tighter monogamy relations in tripartite quantum systems by means of the new inequality; then, we generalize these relations to multiparty quantum systems. Furthermore, we also draw several conclusions for any multiparty quantum states and prove the tightness of the lower bounds. Detailed examples are provided at last.

TI Theory of the divacancy in 4H-SiC: impact of Jahn-Teller effect on
   optical properties
SO NPJ COMPUTATIONAL MATERIALS
AB Understanding the optical properties of color centers in silicon carbide is essential for their use in quantum technologies, such as single-photon emission and spin-based qubits. In this work, first-principles calculations were employed using the r2SCAN density functional to investigate the electronic and vibrational properties of neutral divacancy configurations in 4H-SiC. Our approach addresses the dynamical Jahn-Teller effect in the excited states of axial divacancies. By explicitly solving the multimode dynamical Jahn-Teller problem, we compute emission and absorption lineshapes for axial divacancy configurations, providing insights into the complex interplay between electronic and vibrational degrees of freedom. The results show strong alignment with experimental data, underscoring the predictive power of the methodologies. Our calculations predict spontaneous symmetry breaking due to the pseudo Jahn-Teller effect in the excited state of the kh divacancy, accompanied by the lowest electron-phonon coupling among the four configurations and distinct polarizability. These unique properties facilitate its selective excitation, setting it apart from other divacancy configurations, and highlight its potential utility in quantum technology applications. These findings underscore the critical role of electron-phonon interactions and optical properties in spin defects with pronounced Jahn-Teller effects, offering valuable insights for the design and integration of quantum emitters for quantum technologies.

TI Strain-mediated ion-ion interaction in rare-earth-doped solids
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS-CONDENSED MATTER
AB It was recently shown that the optical excitation of rare-earth ions produces a local change of the host matrix shape, attributed to a change of the rare-earth ion's electronic orbital geometry. In this work we investigate the consequences of this piezo-orbital backaction and show from a macroscopic model how it yields a disregarded ion-ion interaction mediated by mechanical strain. This interaction scales as 1/r(3), similarly to the other archetypal ion-ion interactions, namely electric and magnetic dipole-dipole interactions. We quantitatively assess and compare the magnitude of these three interactions from the angle of the instantaneous spectral diffusion mechanism, and re-examine the scientific literature in a range of rare-earth doped systems in the light of this generally underestimated contribution.

TI Image Denoising Using Quantum Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial
   Network for Medical Images
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE SYSTEMS
AB A significant role is played by medical images in diagnosing diseases and planning the course of treatment. Noise can potentially degrade the quality of images which can lead to misdiagnosis. One of the oldest challenges in computer vision for restoring images that have been corrupted is image denoising. Generative adversarial networks (GANs) are among the most extensively used deep learning methods for various computer vision tasks. Utilizing an innovative quantum adversarial denoising architecture, denoised image samples are produced from a noisy distribution. In this paper, the authors employ an architecture of quantum deep convolutional generative adversarial networks (QDCGAN) for denoising medical images. The architecture of the DCGAN (deep convolutional generative adversarial networks) is augmented with a quantum computing layer to enhance the performance through quantum-generated inputs. The research is performed on the BraTS dataset via the TensorFlow Quantum platform. The study demonstrates that QDCGAN outperforms traditional methods. The proposed method achieves a better PSNR (peak signal-to-noise ratio) and SSIM (structural similarity index measure) value. The study underscores its effectiveness in improving the diagnostic quality of medical images with an 3.4% enhancement in SSIM and 7.35% in PSNR over existing methods, thereby offering tangible benefits for healthcare practitioners and patients alike.

TI Hybrid quantum ResNet for car classification and its hyperparameter
   optimization
SO QUANTUM MACHINE INTELLIGENCE
AB Image recognition is one of the primary applications of machine learning algorithms. Nevertheless, machine learning models used in modern image recognition systems consist of millions of parameters that usually require significant computational time to be adjusted. Moreover, adjustment of model hyperparameters leads to additional overhead. Because of this, new developments in machine learning models and hyperparameter optimization techniques are required. This paper presents a quantum-inspired hyperparameter optimization technique and a hybrid quantum-classical machine learning model for supervised learning. We benchmark our hyperparameter optimization method over standard black-box objective functions and observe performance improvements in the form of reduced expected run times and fitness in response to the growth in the size of the search space. We test our approaches in a car image classification task and demonstrate a full-scale implementation of the hybrid quantum ResNet model with the tensor train hyperparameter optimization. Our tests show a qualitative and quantitative advantage over the corresponding standard classical tabular grid search approach used with a deep neural network ResNet34. A classification accuracy of 0.97 was obtained by the hybrid model after 18 iterations, whereas the classical model achieved an accuracy of 0.92 after 75 iterations.

TI Improving qubit reduction for molecular simulations with randomized
   orbital sampling
SO AAPPS BULLETIN
AB Near-term quantum devices offer promising avenues for addressing the electronic structure problem in quantum chemistry, yet their limited qubits and susceptibility to noise constrain algorithmic scalability. Although the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) has shown potential for small-scale systems, further improvements are necessary to handle large basis sets and large many-electron molecules efficiently. In this work, we introduce RO-VQE, an improved approach derived from the earlier optimized orbital algorithm that employs a randomized procedure for selecting and optimizing orbitals. We evaluate RO-VQE on hydrogen chains systems (H2 and H4)-a well-established benchmark for quantum chemistry methods-using minimal, split-valence, and correlation-consistent basis sets. For these systems, RO-VQE improves ground-state energy estimations compared to conventional VQE methods, matching the accuracy of systematic strategies in these test cases. These proof-of-concept results suggest that randomized active-space selection may offer a practical compromise in NISQ-era quantum computations, offering a flexible alternative to more deterministic methods, particularly for systems constrained by limited quantum resources.

TI A comparison of calcium sources for ion-trap loading via laser ablation
SO APPLIED PHYSICS B-LASERS AND OPTICS
AB Trapped-ion technology is a leading approach for scalable quantum computing. A key element of ion trapping is reliable loading of atomic sources into the trap. While thermal atomic ovens have traditionally been used for this purpose, laser ablation has emerged as a viable alternative in recent years, offering the advantages of faster and more localized loading with lower heat dissipation. Calcium is a well-established ion for qubit applications. Here we examine a range of calcium sources for ablation and provide a comprehensive analysis of each. We consider factors such as ease of use, temperature and yield of the ablation plume, and the lifetime of ablation spots. For each target, we estimate the number of trappable atoms per ablation pulse for a typical surface and 3D ion trap.

Here we extend the enhanced time-evolving matrix product operator (eTEMPO) algorithm for quantum path integrals using tensor networks [Phys. Rev. Lett. 123, 240602 (2019) to open quantum systems with off-diagonal coupling beyond a single two level system. We exemplify the approach on a coupled cavity waveguide system with spatially separated quantum two-state emitters, though many other applications in material science are possible, including entangled photon propagation, photosynthesis spectroscopy, and on-chip quantum optics with realistic dissipation.

TI Laser-free trapped ion entangling gates with AESE: adiabatic elimination
   of spin-motion entanglement
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB We discuss a laser-free, two-qubit geometric phase gate technique for generating high-fidelity entanglement between two trapped ions. The scheme works by ramping the spin-dependent force on and off slowly relative to the gate detunings, which adiabatically eliminates the spin-motion entanglement (AESE). We show how gates performed with AESE can eliminate spin-motion entanglement with multiple modes simultaneously, without having to specifically tune the control field detunings. This is because the spin-motion entanglement is suppressed by operating the control fields in a certain parametric limit, rather than by engineering an optimized control sequence. We also discuss physical implementations that use either electronic or ferromagnetic magnetic field gradients. In the latter, we show how to 'AESE' the system by smoothly turning on the effective spin-dependent force by shelving from a magnetic field insensitive state to a magnetic field sensitive state slowly relative to the gate mode frequencies. We show how to do this with a Rabi or adiabatic rapid passage transition. Finally, we show how gating with AESE significantly decreases the gate's sensitivity to common sources of motional decoherence, making it easier to perform high-fidelity gates at Doppler temperatures.

TI Beyond Classical AI: Detecting Fake News with Hybrid Quantum Neural
   Networks
SO APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
AB The advent of quantum computing has introduced new opportunities for enhancing classical machine learning architectures. In this study, we propose a novel hybrid model, the HQDNN (Hybrid Quantum-Deep Neural Network), designed for the automatic detection of fake news. The model integrates classical fully connected neural layers with a parameterized quantum circuit, enabling the processing of textual data within both classical and quantum computational domains. To assess its effectiveness, we conducted experiments on the widely used LIAR dataset utilizing Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) features, as well as transformer-based DistilBERT embeddings. The experimental results demonstrate that the HQDNN achieves a superior recall performance-92.58% with TF-IDF and 94.40% with DistilBERT-surpassing traditional machine learning models such as Logistic Regression, Linear SVM, and Multilayer Perceptron. Additionally, we compare the HQDNN with SetFit, a recent CPU-efficient few-shot transformer model, and show that while SetFit achieves higher precision, the HQDNN significantly outperforms it in recall. Furthermore, an ablation experiment confirms the critical contribution of the quantum component, revealing a substantial drop in performance when the quantum layer is removed. These findings highlight the potential of hybrid quantum-classical models as effective and compact alternatives for high-sensitivity classification tasks, particularly in domains such as fake news detection.

AB Encoding quantum information via time-bin entangled states has had a profound impact on the development of quantum communications. However, dispersive propagation limits their achievable transmission distances. Here we describe a regime for nonlocal dispersion cancellation where the sum of arrival times of photons undergoing identical dispersion remains highly correlated. We exploit this effect to mitigate dispersive effects in a quantum key distribution fiber link, allowing an increase in the secret key rate by over a factor of 5 after 80 km of optical fiber dispersion.

AB We show that piezoelectric strain actuation of acoustomechanical interactions can produce large phase velocity changes in an existing quantum phononic platform: aluminum nitride on suspended silicon. Using finite element analysis, we demonstrate a piezo-acoustomechanical phase shifter waveguide capable of producing +/-pi phase shifts for GHz frequency phonons in 10s of mu m with 10s of volts applied. Then, using the phase shifter as a building block, we demonstrate several phononic integrated circuit elements useful for quantum information processing. In particular, we show how to construct programmable multi-mode interferometers for linear phononic processing and a dynamically reconfigurable phononic memory that can switch between an ultra-long-lifetime state and a state strongly coupled to its bus waveguide. From the master equation for the full open quantum system of the reconfigurable phononic memory, we show that it is possible to perform read and write operations with over 90% quantum state transfer fidelity for an exponentially decaying pulse.

TI Resonant dipole-dipole interactions in electromagnetically induced
   transparency
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Resonant dipole-dipole interaction (RDDI) emerges in strong light-matter interacting systems, which leads to many fascinating phenomena such as cooperative light scattering and collective radiation. Here, we theoretically investigate the role of RDDI in electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT). The resonant dipole-dipole interactions manifest themselves in the cooperative spontaneous emission of the probe light transition, which give rise a broadened linewidth and associated collective frequency shift. This cooperative linewidth originates from the nonlocal and long-range RDDI, which can be determined by the atomic density, optical depth, and macroscopic length scales of the atomic ensemble. We present the finding that EIT spectroscopy essentially demonstrates all-order multiple scattering of RDDI. Furthermore, we find that the EIT transparency window becomes narrower as the cooperative linewidth increases, which essentially reduces the storage efficiency of slow light as an EIT-based quantum memory application.

TI Prototype of a phonon laser with trapped ions
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB We propose a tunable phonon laser prototype with a large trapped ion array, where some of the ions are effectively pinned by optical tweezers, thus isolating a subset of ions that mimics an acoustic cavity used as a phonon lasing resonator. The cavity loss can then be controlled by the tweezer strength and the "wall thickness", the number of pinned ions for isolation. We pump the resonator by applying blue-sideband lasers, and investigate the lasing dynamics of the "cavity" motional modes such as threshold behavior, population distribution, the second-order coherence, and linewidth narrowing. This scheme can be generalized to multimode resonators, for which we report the mode competition phenomenon and lasing mode multistability. Our work provides an excellent platform for acoustic quantum state manipulation, paving the way towards phonon-mediated quantum computing, communications, and metrology.

TI Growth of topological insulator Bi2Se3 particles
   on GaAs via droplet epitaxy
SO JOURNAL OF VACUUM SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY A
AB The discovery of topological insulators (TIs) and their unique electronic properties has motivated research into a variety of applications, including quantum computing. It has been proposed that TI surface states will be energetically discretized in a quantum dot nanoparticle. These discretized states could then be used as basis states for a qubit that is more resistant to decoherence. In this work, prototypical TI Bi2Se3 nanoparticles are grown on GaAs (001) using the droplet epitaxy technique, and we demonstrate the control of nanoparticle height, area, and density by changing the duration of bismuth deposition and substrate temperature. Within the growth window studied, nanoparticles ranged from 5 to 15 nm in height with an 8-18 nm equivalent circular radius, and the density could be relatively well controlled by changing the substrate temperature and bismuth deposition time.

TI Superconducting Qubits above 20 GHz Operating over 200 mK
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Current state-of-the-art superconducting microwave qubits are cooled to extremely low temperatures to avoid sources of decoherence. Higher qubit operating temperatures would significantly increase the cooling power available, which is desirable for scaling up the number of qubits in quantum computing architectures and integrating qubits in experiments requiring increased heat dissipation. To operate superconducting qubits at higher temperatures, it is necessary to address both quasiparticle decoherence (which becomes significant for aluminum junctions above 160 mK) and dephasing from thermal microwave photons (which are problematic above 50 mK). Using low-loss niobium-trilayer junctions, which have reduced sensitivity to quasiparticles due to the higher superconducting transition temperature of niobium, we fabricate transmons with higher frequencies than previously studied, up to 24 GHz. We measure decoherence and dephasing times of about 1 mu s, corresponding to average qubit quality factors of approximately 10(5), and find that decoherence is unaffected by quasiparticles up to 1 K. Without relaxation from quasiparticles, we are able to explore dephasing from purely thermal sources, finding that our qubits can operate up to approximately 250 mK while maintaining similar performance. The thermal resilience of these qubits creates new options for scaling up quantum processors, enables hybrid quantum experiments with high heat-dissipation budgets, and introduces a material platform for even-higher-frequency qubits.

TI Realizing quantum convolutional neural networks on a superconducting
   quantum processor to recognize quantum phases
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Quantum neural networks could help analysing the output of quantum computers and quantum simulators of growing complexity. Here, the authors use a 7-qubit superconducting quantum processor to show how a quantum convolutional neural network can correctly recognise the phase of a quantum many-body state.
   Quantum computing crucially relies on the ability to efficiently characterize the quantum states output by quantum hardware. Conventional methods which probe these states through direct measurements and classically computed correlations become computationally expensive when increasing the system size. Quantum neural networks tailored to recognize specific features of quantum states by combining unitary operations, measurements and feedforward promise to require fewer measurements and to tolerate errors. Here, we realize a quantum convolutional neural network (QCNN) on a 7-qubit superconducting quantum processor to identify symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases of a spin model characterized by a non-zero string order parameter. We benchmark the performance of the QCNN based on approximate ground states of a family of cluster-Ising Hamiltonians which we prepare using a hardware-efficient, low-depth state preparation circuit. We find that, despite being composed of finite-fidelity gates itself, the QCNN recognizes the topological phase with higher fidelity than direct measurements of the string order parameter for the prepared states.

TI High-fidelity magic-state preparation with a biased-noise architecture
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Magic state distillation is a resource intensive subroutine that consumes noisy input states to produce highfidelity resource states that are used to perform logical operations in practical quantum-computing architectures. The resource cost of magic state distillation can be reduced by improving the fidelity of the raw input states. To this end, we propose an initialization protocol that offers a quadratic improvement in the error rate of the input magic states in architectures with biased noise. This is achieved by preparing an error-detecting code which detects the dominant errors that occur during state preparation. We obtain this advantage by exploiting the native gate operations of an underlying qubit architecture that experiences biases in its noise profile. We perform simulations to analyze the performance of our protocol with the XZZX surface code. Even at modest physical parameters with a two-qubit gate error rate of 0.7% and total probability of dominant errors in the gate O(103) larger compared to that of nondominant errors, we find that our preparation scheme delivers magic states with logical error rate O(10???8) after a single round of the standard 15-to-1 distillation protocol, two orders of magnitude lower than using conventional state preparation. Our approach therefore promises considerable savings in overheads with near-term technology.

TI A secure and efficient identity-based quantum signature scheme
SO AIP ADVANCES
AB In recent years, identity-based quantum signature protocols have received much attention due to their unique advantages. Based on Bell states, we propose an efficient identity-based quantum signature scheme. In our scheme, the signer's private key is generated from their identity information. The signer uses the private key and secret parameters to generate a signature for the verifier. The verifier, who possesses the identity information of the signer, can authenticate the signature. Our proposed scheme ensures signature non-forgeability and non-repudiation. In addition, the protocol does not require the preparation of long-term quantum memory or the performance of quantum swap tests, making it more efficient than previous schemes.<br /> (c) 2024 Author(s).

TI Mixed-State Long-Range Order and Criticality from Measurement and
   Feedback
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB We propose a general framework for using local measurements, local unitaries, and nonlocal classical communication to construct quantum channels, which can efficiently prepare mixed states with longrange quantum order or quantum criticality. As an illustration, symmetry-protected topological phases can be universally converted into mixed states with long-range entanglement, which can undergo phase transitions with quantum critical correlations of local operators and a logarithmic scaling of the entanglement negativity, despite coexisting with volume-law entropy. Within the same framework, we present two applications using fermion occupation-number measurement to convert (i) spinful free fermions in one dimension into a quantum critical mixed state with enhanced algebraic correlations between spins and (ii) Chern insulators into a mixed state with critical quantum correlations in the bulk. The latter is an example where mixed-state quantum criticality can emerge from a gapped state of matter in constant depth using local quantum operations and nonlocal classical communication.

TI Prediction of optical polarization and high-field hyperfine structure
   via a parametrized crystal-field model for low-symmetry centers in
   Er3+-doped Y2SiO5
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB We report on the development and application of a parametrized crystal-field model for both C-1 symmetry centers in trivalent erbium-doped Y2SiO5. High-resolution Zeeman and temperature dependent absorption spectroscopy was performed to acquire the necessary experimental data. The obtained data, in addition to the ground (I-4(15/2) Z(1)) state and exited (I-4(13/2) Y-1) state Zeeman and hyperfine structure, were simultaneously fitted in order to refine an existing crystal-field interpretation of the Er3+:Y2SiO5 system. We demonstrate that it is possible to account for the electronic, magnetic, and hyperfine structure of the full 4f(11) configuration of Er3+:Y2SiO5 and further, that it is possible to predict both optical polarization behavior and high magnetic field hyperfine structure of transitions in the 1.5-mu m telecommunications band.

TI R-LWE-Based Distributed Key Generation and Threshold Decryption
SO MATHEMATICS
AB Ever since the appearance of quantum computers, prime factoring and discrete logarithm-based cryptography have been questioned, giving birth to the so-called post-quantum cryptography. The most prominent field in post-quantum cryptography is lattice-based cryptography, protocols that are proved to be as difficult to break as certain hard lattice problems like Learning with Errors (LWE) or Ring Learning with Errors (R-LWE). Furthermore, the application of cryptographic techniques to different areas, like electronic voting, has also nourished a great interest in distributed cryptography. In this work, we will give two original threshold protocols based in the lattice problem R-LWE: one for key generation and one for decryption. We will prove them both correct and secure under the assumption of hardness of some well-known lattice problems. Finally, we will give a rough implementation of the protocols in C to give some tentative results about their viability, in particular our model generates keys in the order of 10(3) ms and decrypts and encrypts in the order of 10(2) ms.

TI Far-infrared frequency mode conversion using bulk acoustic phonon modes
SO APPLIED PHYSICS B-LASERS AND OPTICS
AB The ability to design, fabricate and control systems which can convert photons with dissimilar frequencies has technological implications in classical as well as quantum communications. Laser heating and thermal mechanical motion in conventional micro/nanoscale optomechanical systems hamper the use of these systems in quantum information processing networks. In contrast, we propose an unconventional system comprising of a bulk quartz crystal placed within a Fabry-Pe'rot cavity. The pumping laser is in the far-infrared region. We explore the possibility of efficient mode conversion between two optical modes supported by the system, mediated by the bulk acoustic phonons of the quartz crystal. Unlike the earlier optomechanical systems, the dark mode in our proposed system is not decoupled from the mechanical mode and yet it enables the efficient mode conversion. The novel results found in our study can be used to harness the dark state for quantum state transfer. The proposed system is robust against excessive heating.

TI Strong Relativistic Effects in Lanthanide-Based Single-Molecule Magnets
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY LETTERS
AB Lanthanide-based single-molecule magnets (SMMs) are promising building blocks for quantum memory and spintronic devices. Designing lanthanide-based SMMs with long spin relaxation time requires a detailed understanding of their electronic structure, including the crucial role of the spin-orbit coupling (SOC). While traditional calculations of SOC using the perturbation theory applied to a solution of the nonrelativistic Schro''dinger equation are valid for light atoms, this approach is questionable for systems containing heavy elements such as lanthanides. We investigate the accuracy of the perturbation estimates of SOC by variationally solving the Dirac equation for the [DyO]+ molecule, a prototype of a lanthanide-based SMM. We show that the energy splittings between the MJ states involved in spin relaxation depend on the interplay between strong SOC and dynamic electron correlation. We demonstrate that this interplay affects the resonances between the spin and vibrational transitions and, therefore, the spin relaxation time.

TI Quantum-inspired logic for advanced Transcriptional Programming
SO NUCLEIC ACIDS RESEARCH
AB The tenets of intelligent biological systems are (i) scalable decision-making, (ii) inheritable memory, and (iii) communication. This study aims to increase the complexity of decision-making operations beyond standard Boolean logic, while minimizing the metabolic burden imposed on the chassis cell. To this end, we present a new platform technology for constructing genetic circuits with multiple OUTPUT gene control using fewer INPUTs relative to conventional genetic circuits. Inspired by principles from quantum computing, we engineered synthetic bidirectional promoters, regulated by synthetic transcription factors, to construct 1-INPUT, 2-OUTPUT logical operations-i.e. biological QUBIT and PAULI-X logic gates-designed as compressed genetic circuits. We then layered said gates to engineer additional quantum-inspired logical operations of increasing complexity-e.g. FEYNMAN and TOFFOLI gates. In addition, we engineered a 2-INPUT, 4-OUTPUT quantum operation to showcase the capacity to utilize the entire permutation INPUT space. Finally, we developed a recombinase-based memory operation to remap the truth table between two disparate logic gates-i.e. converting a QUBIT operation to an antithetical PAULI-X operation in situ. This study introduces a novel and versatile synthetic biology toolkit, which expands the biocomputing capacity of Transcriptional Programming via the development of compressed and scalable multi-INPUT/OUTPUT logical operations.

By exploiting the phase shift of the beam rotator dependent on the orbital angular momentum of the optical modes, and modulating the phase imbalance in the auxiliary cavity, it is shown that the system dynamics is equivalent to that of a charged particle in a 1D lattice subject to both static and time-dependent electrical fields. We investigate interesting physics and phenomena such as Bloch oscillations that arise due to the simulated electrical fields, and discuss how they can be used for practical purposes such as storing optical signals in a quantum memory. We also present a powerful measurement scheme to detect the system dynamics that is non-intrusive and technically easy to perform.

TI Semidefinite Program for One-Shot Dilution of Quantum Coherence
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB Quantum coherence is one of the fundamental properties of quantum mechanics and also acts as a valuable resource for a variety of practical applications, which includes quantum computing and quantum information processing. Evaluating the dilution of coherence is a basic problem in the framework of resource theory. The coherence dilution problem is considered in the one-shot scenario. A semidefinite program of one-shot coherence dilution of pure state under maximally incoherent operation is identified. A similar but not semidefinite program form is provided under dephasing-covariant incoherent operation. Moreover, it is proved that the known lower bound of the one-shot dilution is strict. This numerical experiment clearly demonstrates that the maximally incoherent operation and dephasing-covariant incoherent operation have different power in the coherence dilution.

TI Development of a networked photonic-enabled staring radar testbed for
   urban surveillance
SO IET RADAR SONAR AND NAVIGATION
AB Urban surveillance of slow-moving small targets such as drones and birds in low to medium airspace using radar presents significant challenges. Detecting, locating and identifying such low observable targets in strong clutter requires both innovation in radar hardware design and optimisation of processing algorithms. To this end, the University of Birmingham (UoB) has set-up a testbed of two L-band staring radars to support performance benchmarking using datasets of target and clutter from realistic urban environment. This testbed is also providing the vehicle to understand how novel radar architectures can enhance radar capabilities. Some of the challenges in installing the radar at the UoB campus are highligted. Detailed benchmarking results are provided from urban monostatic and bistatic field trials that form the basis for performance comparison against future hardware modification. The solution to the challenge of interfacing the radar to the external oscillators is described and stand-alone bench tests with the candidate oscillators are reported. The testbed provides a valuable capability to undertake detailed analysis of performance of Quantum photonic-enabled radar and allows for its comparison with conventional oscillator technology for surveillance of low observable targets in the presence of urban clutter.

TI Non-Markovianity of an atom in a semi-infinite rectangular waveguide
SO CHINESE PHYSICS B
AB We investigate the non-Markovianity (NM) of a waveguide QED with a two-level atom as the system and a semi infinite rectangular waveguide as the environment, where the transverse magnetic (TMmn) modes define the quantum channels of guided photons. The perfect mirror imposed by the finite end exerts a retarded feedback mechanism to allow for information backflow, which leads to NM dynamics. For the energy separation of the atom far away from the cutoff frequencies of transverse modes, the delay differential equations are obtained with single-excitation initial in the atom. Our attention is focused on the effects of multiple quantum channels involved in guiding photons on the degree of nonMarkovian behavior. An asymptotic value of the non-Markovianity N-1 can be found as the atom-mirror distance is large enough, however, the asymptotic value of N-2 of the atom interacting with the effective double-modes is lower than that of the atom interacting with the effective single-mode. We also show that N-1 is a constant, and the analytical expression for N-2 is related to the parameters associated with the modes, which is related to the interference of the two modes.

TI Monolithic Three-Dimensional Tuning of an Atomically Defined Silicon
   Tunnel Junction
SO NANO LETTERS
AB A requirement for quantum information processors is the in situ tunability of the tunnel rates and the exchange interaction energy within the device. The large energy level separation for atom qubits in silicon is well suited for qubit operation but limits device tunability using in-plane gate architectures, requiring vertically separated top-gates to control tunnelling within the device. In this paper, we address control of the simplest tunnelling device in Si:P, the tunnel junction. Here we demonstrate that we can tune its conductance by using a vertically separated top-gate aligned with +/- 5 nm precision to the junction. We show that a monolithic 3D epitaxial top-gate increases the capacitive coupling by a factor of 3 compared to in-plane gates, resulting in a tunnel barrier height tunability of 0-186 meV. By combining multiple gated junctions in series we extend our monolithic 3D gating technology to implement nanoscale logic circuits including AND and OR gates.

TI MadQCI: a heterogeneous and scalable SDN-QKD network deployed in
   production facilities
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Current quantum key distribution (QKD) networks focus almost exclusively on transporting secret keys at the highest possible rate. Consequently, they are built as mostly fixed, ad hoc, logically, and physically isolated infrastructures designed to avoid any penalty to the quantum channel. This architecture is neither scalable nor cost-effective and future, real-world deployments will differ considerably. The structure of the MadQCI QKD network presented here is based on disaggregated components and modern paradigms especially designed for flexibility, upgradability, and facilitating the integration of QKD in the security and telecommunications-networks ecosystem. These underlying ideas have been tested by deploying many QKD systems from several manufacturers in a real-world, multi-tenant telecommunications network, installed in production facilities and sharing the infrastructure with commercial traffic. Different technologies have been used in different links to address the variety of situations and needs that arise in real networks, exploring a wide range of possibilities. Finally, a set of realistic use cases has been implemented to demonstrate the validity and performance of the network. The testing took place during a period close to three years, where most of the nodes were continuously active.

TI A Quantum-Inspired Predator-Prey Algorithm for Real-Parameter
   Optimization
SO ALGORITHMS
AB Quantum computing has opened up various opportunities for the enhancement of computational power in the coming decades. We can design algorithms inspired by the principles of quantum computing, without implementing in quantum computing infrastructure. In this paper, we present the quantum predator-prey algorithm (QPPA), which fuses the fundamentals of quantum computing and swarm optimization based on a predator-prey algorithm. Our results demonstrate the efficacy of QPPA in solving complex real-parameter optimization problems with better accuracy when compared to related algorithms in the literature. QPPA achieves highly rapid convergence for relatively low- and high-dimensional optimization problems and outperforms selected traditional and advanced algorithms. This motivates the application of QPPA to real-world application problems.

TI Nanoscale detection and real-time monitoring of free radicals in a
   single living cell under the stimulation of targeting moieties using a
   nanodiamond quantum sensor
SO FUNCTIONAL DIAMOND
AB Intracellular radicals play important roles in cell signaling and regulation of growth factors, cytokines, transcription, apoptosis, and immunomodulation, among others. To gain a more comprehensive understanding of their biological functions from a spatio-temporal perspective, there is a great need for nanoscale sensitive tools that allow real-time detection of these reactive species. Currently, intracellular radical probes are based on chemical reactions that could significantly alter radical levels during detection. Due to the excellent biocompatibility and favorable photophysical properties of nitrogen-vacancy (NV-) centers in fluorescent nanodiamonds (fNDs), the fNDs can serve as a powerful and chemically inert nanotool for intracellular radical detection. In this study, a positively charged nanogel (NG) coating was prepared to prevent the precipitation of fNDs and promote cellular internalization. After internalization of nanodiamond-nanogels (fND-NGs), different stimulators, namely somatostatin (SST), triphenylphosphonium (TPP), and trans-activator of transcription (TAT) peptide, which are widely used cell- or organelle-targeting ligands in medicine, drug delivery, and diagnostics, were applied to stimulate the cells. In parallel, the intracellular radical changes under stimulation of SST, TPP, and TAT ligands were monitored by fND-NGs in a home-built optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) microscope. Our method allows for detecting intracellular radicals in-situ and monitoring their real-time changes during incubation with the targeting ligands in a single living cell. We believe that our method will provide insights into the generation of radical stress in cells, which could improve our fundamental understanding of the pharmacology and signaling pathways of widely used cell- and organelle-targeting ligands associated with free radicals.

TI The Dynamical Ensemble of the Posner Molecule Is Not Symmetric
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY LETTERS
AB The Posner molecule, Ca-9(PO4)(6), has long been recognized to have biochemical relevance in various physiological processes. It has found recent attention for its possible role as a biological quantum information processor, whereby the molecule purportedly maintains long-lived nuclear spin coherences among its P-31 nuclei (presumed to be symmetrically arranged), allowing it to function as a room temperature qubit. The structure of the molecule has been of much dispute in the literature, although the S-6 point group symmetry has often been assumed and exploited in calculations. Using a variety of simulation techniques (including ab initio molecular dynamics and structural relaxation), rigorous data analysis tools, and by exploring thousands of individual configurations, we establish that the molecule predominantly assumes low-symmetry structures (C-s and C-i) at room temperature, as opposed to the higher-symmetry configurations explored previously. Our findings have important implications for the viability of this molecule as a qubit.

TI Hybrid light-matter networks of Majorana zero modes
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Topological excitations, such as Majorana zero modes, are a promising route for encoding quantum information. Topologically protected gates of Majorana qubits, based on their braiding, will require some form of network. Here, we propose to build such a network by entangling Majorana matter with light in a microwave cavity QED set-up. Our scheme exploits a light-induced interaction which is universal to all the Majorana nanoscale circuit platforms. This effect stems from a parametric drive of the light-matter coupling in a one-dimensional chain of physical Majorana modes. Our set-up enables all the basic operations needed in a Majorana quantum computing platform such as fusing, braiding, the crucial T-gate, the read-out, and importantly, the stabilization or correction of the physical Majorana modes.

TI Colloquium: Advances in automation of quantum dot devices control
SO REVIEWS OF MODERN PHYSICS
AB Arrays of quantum dots (QDs) are a promising candidate system to realize scalable, coupled qubit systems and serve as a fundamental building block for quantum computers. In such semiconductor quantum systems, devices now have tens of individual electrostatic and dynamical voltages that must be carefully set to localize the system into the single-electron regime and to realize good qubit operational performance. The mapping of requisite QD locations and charges to gate voltages presents a challenging classical control problem. With an increasing number of QD qubits, the relevant parameter space grows sufficiently to make heuristic control unfeasible. In recent years, there has been considerable effort to automate device control that combines script-based algorithms with machine learning (ML) techniques. In this Colloquium, a comprehensive overview of the recent progress in the automation of QD device control is presented, with a particular emphasis on silicon-and GaAs-based QDs formed in two-dimensional electron gases. Combining physics-based modeling with modern numerical optimization and ML has proven effective in yielding efficient, scalable control. Further integration of theoretical, computational, and experimental efforts with computer science and ML holds vast potential in advancing semiconductor and other platforms for quantum computing.

TI Postselected Quantum Hypothesis Testing
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION THEORY
AB We study a variant of quantum hypothesis testing wherein an additional 'inconclusive' measurement outcome is added, allowing one to abstain from attempting to discriminate the hypotheses. The error probabilities are then conditioned on a successful attempt, with inconclusive trials disregarded. We completely characterise this task in both the single-shot and asymptotic regimes, providing exact formulas for the optimal error probabilities. In particular, we prove that the asymptotic error exponent of discriminating any two quantum states rho and $\sigma $ is given by the Hilbert projective metric D-max(rho || sigma) + D-max( sigma || rho) in asymmetric hypothesis testing, and by the Thompson metricmax { D-max(rho || sigma ), D-max(sigma | rho ) } in symmetric hypothesis testing. This endows these two quantities with fundamental operational interpretations in quantum state discrimination. Our findings extend to composite hypothesis testing, where we show that the asymmetric error exponent with respect to any convex set of density matrices is given by a regularisation of the Hilbert projective metric. We apply our results also to quantum channels, showing that no advantage is gained by employing adaptive or even more general discrimination schemes over parallel ones, in both the asymmetric and symmetric settings. Our state discrimination results make use of no properties specific to quantum mechanics and are also valid in general probabilistic theories.

TI Practitioners' Rule of Thumb for Quantum Volume
SO QUANTUM REPORTS
AB Quantum volume (QV) is a widely recognized metric for assessing the practical capabilities of quantum computers, as it provides an estimate of the largest quantum circuit that can be reliably executed. However, measuring QV on a real device requires comparing experimental outcomes with ideal theoretical results-a process that rapidly becomes computationally expensive. By examining the cumulative impact of errors in two-qubit gates, we present a simple, accessible `rule of thumb' that relates the quantum volume directly to the average error rate of native gates. Our formula shows a strong agreement with experimental data from leading quantum computing platforms, including both superconducting and trapped-ion systems. This straightforward model offers a clear, intuitive guideline for predicting quantum hardware performance, enabling more informed decisions regarding circuit design and resource allocation.

TI Realizing Distance-Selective Interactions in a Rydberg-Dressed Atom
   Array
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Measurement-based quantum computing relies on the rapid creation of large-scale entanglement in a register of stable qubits. Atomic arrays are well suited to store quantum information, and entanglement can be created using highly-excited Rydberg states. Typically, isolating pairs during gate operation is difficult because Rydberg interactions feature long tails at large distances. Here, we engineer distance-selective interactions that are strongly peaked in distance through off-resonant laser coupling of molecular potentials between Rydberg atom pairs. Employing quantum gas microscopy, we verify the dressed interactions by observing correlated phase evolution using many-body Ramsey interferometry. We identify atom loss and coupling to continuum modes as a limitation of our present scheme and outline paths to mitigate these effects, paving the way towards the creation of large-scale entanglement.

TI An Isogeny-based Quantum-Resistant Secret Sharing Scheme
SO FILOMAT
AB In a secret sharing scheme, a secret is distributed among several participants in such a way that only any authorized subset of participants is able to recover the secret. So far, the security of many secret sharing schemes has been based on the hardness of some mathematical problems, such as discrete logarithm and factorization. These problems can be solved in polynomial time using Shor's algorithm for a quantum computer. In this paper, we propose an efficient multi-secret sharing scheme based on the hardness of computing isogenies between supersingular elliptic curves. The proposed scheme is based on De Feo and Jao key exchange protocol. We prove that our scheme is secure under computational assumptions in which there is no known efficient quantum algorithm.

AB The need to increase throughput and reduce the latency in the workload distribution and communications between different Data Centers (DCs) demands the use of dedicated or rented fibers. In view of enabling quantum secure communication in centralized and distributed DC, the integration of quantum key distribution (QKD) systems appears as a crucial milestone to safeguard data against quantum computing threats and the "Store-Now, Decrypt-Later" risk. Specifically, tailored technological solutions must be considered to enable practical deployment. In this context, continuous-variable QKD (CV-QKD) presents a promising approach due to its compatibility with optical systems and potential for cost savings and scalability. The adoption of photonic integrated circuits further enhances feasibility by enabling component miniaturization, reducing power consumption, and facilitating large-scale deployment. An important aspect to consider is optimizing fiber usage to support infrastructure sharing and resource efficiency. Therefore, the coexistence of the proposed QKD solutions with inter-DC communications must be carefully assessed. This invited contribution explores the integration of CV-QKD in DC networks to address flexible and efficient quantum secure connectivity. Envisioned co-propagation scenarios and associated challenges will be discussed, offering insights into the evolutionary path towards quantum secure DC infrastructures.

TI Organic molecule single-photon sources
SO OXFORD OPEN MATERIALS SCIENCE
AB Since the onset of the 1990s, the development of single-molecule spectroscopy has led to the discovery of various quantum optical signatures in organic single molecules. The single-photon nature of an organic chromophore is of particular importance because of its potential as a nonclassical photon source at room temperature for quantum information science and optical quantum computing. This condensed review focuses on the introduction of fundamental knowledge and basic experimental methods for single-photon sources and organic molecular photophysics and summarizes the research developments in this field, providing an understanding of quantum emission from organic single molecules.

TI Multi-Dimensional Resource Allocation in QKD-Enabled Cross-Domain Data
   Center Interconnection Networks
SO PHOTONICS
AB In recent years, cloud computing and edge computing have flourished, establishing data centers as pivotal hubs for information exchange. However, the security for the interconnection of these data centers faces increasingly severe challenges. Traditional cryptographic techniques face potential risks of being compromised under the threat of quantum computing, whereas quantum key distribution (QKD), which possesses information-theoretic security, provides an effective foundation for secure data center interconnection. This paper focuses on the QKD-enabled cross-domain data center interconnection network, delving into the multi-dimensional resource (i.e., computing, wavelength, and key resources) allocation problem. By constructing a QKD-enabled cross-domain data center interconnection network model, it integrates key resources with traditional computing and wavelength resources, forming a multi-dimensional resource allocation framework. Furthermore, we design two heuristic algorithms, i.e., the local balancing factor-based multi-dimensional resource allocation (LBF-MDRA) and the global balancing factor-based multi-dimensional resource allocation (GBF-MDRA) algorithms, which rationally perform virtual network function (VNF) node selection and efficiently allocate multi-dimensional resources. Simulation results indicate that the LBF-MDRA and GBF-MDRA algorithms can increase the success probability of cross-domain service requests by 24.53% and 30.91% compared to the benchmark algorithm, respectively.

TI Unpredictability and entanglement in open quantum systems
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB We investigate dynamical many-body systems capable of universal computation, which leads to their properties being unpredictable unless the dynamics is simulated from the beginning to the end. Unpredictable behavior can be quantitatively assessed in terms of a data compression of the states occurring during the time evolution, which is closely related to their Kolmogorov complexity. We analyze a master equation embedding of classical cellular automata and demonstrate the existence of a phase transition between predictable and unpredictable behavior as a function of the random error introduced by the probabilistic character of the embedding. We then turn to have this dynamics competing with a second process inducing quantum fluctuations and dissipatively driving the system to a highly entangled steady state. Strikingly, for intermediate strength of the quantum fluctuations, we find that both unpredictability and quantum entanglement can coexist even in the long time limit. Finally, we show that the required many-body interactions for the cellular automaton embedding can be efficiently realized within a variational quantum simulator platform based on ultracold Rydberg atoms with high fidelity.

TI Pulse-Engineered Controlled-V Gate and Its Applications on
   Superconducting Quantum Device
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM ENGINEERING
AB In this article, we demonstrate that, by employing the OpenPulse design kit for IBM superconducting quantum devices, the controlled-V gate (CV gate) can be implemented in about half the gate time to the controlled-X gate (CX or CNOT gate) and consequently 65.5% reduced gate time compared to the CX-based implementation of CV. Then, based on the theory of Cartan decomposition, we characterize the set of all two-qubit gates implemented with only two or three CV gates; using pulse-engineered CV gates, enables us to implement these gates with shorter gate time and possibly better gate fidelity than the CX-based one, as actually demonstrated in two examples. Moreover, we showcase the improvement of linearly coupled three-qubit Toffoli gate by implementing it with the pulse-engineered CV gate, both in gate time and the averaged output-state fidelity. These results imply the importance of our CV gate implementation technique, which, as an additional option for the basis gate set design, may shorten the overall computation time and consequently improve the precision of several quantum algorithms executed on a real device.

TI Nonreciprocal total cross section of quantum metasurfaces
SO NANOPHOTONICS
AB Nonreciprocity originating from classical interactions among nonlinear scatterers has been attracting increasing attention in the quantum community, offering a promising tool to control excitation transfer for quantum information processing and quantum computing. In this work, we explore the possibility of realizing largely nonreciprocal total cross sections for a pair of quantum metasurfaces formed by two parallel periodic arrays of two-level atoms. We show that large nonreciprocal responses can be obtained in such nonlinear systems by controlling the position of the atoms and their transition frequencies, without requiring that the environment in which the atoms are placed is nonreciprocal. We demonstrate the connection of this effect with the asymmetric population of a slowly decaying dark state, which is critical to obtain large nonreciprocal responses.

TI High-Fidelity Ion State Detection Using Trap-Integrated Avalanche

SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Integrated technologies greatly enhance the prospects for practical quantum information processing and sensing devices based on trapped ions. High-speed and high-fidelity ion state readout is critical for any such application. Integrated detectors offer significant advantages for system portability and can also greatly facilitate parallel operations if a separate detector can be incorporated at each ion-trapping location. Here, we demonstrate ion quantum state detection at room temperature utilizing single-photon avalanche diodes (SPADs) integrated directly into the substrate of silicon ion trapping chips. We detect the state of a trapped Sr+ ion via fluorescence collection with the SPAD, achieving 99.92(1)% average fidelity in 450 Its, opening the door to the application of integrated state detection to quantum computing and sensing utilizing arrays of trapped ions.

TI Fixed-point quantum continuous search algorithm with optimal query
   complexity
SO SCIENCE CHINA-PHYSICS MECHANICS & ASTRONOMY
AB Continuous search problems (CSPs), which involve finding solutions within a continuous domain, frequently arise in fields such as optimization, physics, and engineering. Unlike discrete search problems, CSPs require navigating an uncountably infinite space, presenting unique computational challenges. In this work, we propose a fixed-point quantum search algorithm that leverages continuous variables to address these challenges, achieving a quadratic speedup. Inspired by the discrete search results, we manage to establish a lower bound on the query complexity of arbitrary quantum search for CSPs, demonstrating the optimality of our approach. In addition, we demonstrate how to design the internal structure of the quantum search oracle for specific problems. Furthermore, we develop a general framework to apply this algorithm to a range of problem types, including optimization and eigenvalue problems involving continuous variables.

TI The power of quantum neural networks
SO NATURE COMPUTATIONAL SCIENCE
AB It is unknown whether near-term quantum computers are advantageous for machine learning tasks. In this work we address this question by trying to understand how powerful and trainable quantum machine learning models are in relation to popular classical neural networks. We propose the effective dimension-a measure that captures these qualities-and prove that it can be used to assess any statistical model's ability to generalize on new data. Crucially, the effective dimension is a data-dependent measure that depends on the Fisher information, which allows us to gauge the ability of a model to train. We demonstrate numerically that a class of quantum neural networks is able to achieve a considerably better effective dimension than comparable feedforward networks and train faster, suggesting an advantage for quantum machine learning, which we verify on real quantum hardware.

SO ACS PHOTONICS
AB Solid-state quantum emitters are pivotal to the advancement of quantum technologies, particularly in quantum computation and communication, where the polarization of single photons serves as a key information carrier. Precise characterization of polarization is essential for understanding the underlying dynamics and minimizing polarization-related errors in emitter design. In this study, we employ the Rotating Quarter-Wave Plate (RQWP) method to perform comprehensive polarization analysis of quantum emitters in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN). By capturing both time-averaged and time-resolved polarization characteristics, we present the first demonstration of dynamic Stokes parameter evolution from single-photon emitters in hBN. Our work demonstrates a powerful method for revealing complex polarization dynamics that were previously inaccessible and provides new insights into the behavior of solid-state quantum emitters. The methods introduced here are broadly applicable to polarization studies across a range of solid-state quantum systems.

TI Satellite image classification with neural quantum kernels
SO MACHINE LEARNING-SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Achieving practical applications of quantum machine learning (QML) for real-world scenarios remains challenging despite significant theoretical progress. This paper proposes a novel approach for classifying satellite images, a task of particular relevance to the earth observation industry, using QML techniques. Specifically, we focus on classifying images that contain solar panels, addressing a complex real-world classification problem. Our approach begins with classical pre-processing to reduce the dimensionality of the satellite image dataset. We then apply neural quantum kernels-quantum kernels derived from trained quantum neural networks-for classification. We evaluate several strategies within this framework, demonstrating results that are competitive with the best classical methods. Key findings include the robustness of or results and their scalability, with successful performance achieved up to 8 qubits.

TI Qubits on programmable geometries with a trapped-ion quantum processor
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Geometry and dimensionality have played crucial roles in our understanding of the fundamental laws of nature, with examples ranging from curved space time in general relativity to modern theories of quantum gravity. In quantum many-body systems, the entanglement structure can change if the constituents are connected differently, leading to altered bounds for correlation growth and difficulties for classical computers to simulate large systems. While a universal quantum computer can perform digital simulations, an analog-digital hybrid quantum processor offers advantages such as parallelism. Here, we engineer a class of high-dimensional Ising interactions using a linear one-dimensional ion chain with up to eight qubits through stroboscopic sequences of commuting Hamiltonians. In addition, we extend this method to noncommuting circuits and demonstrate the quantum XY and Heisenberg models using Floquet periodic drives with tunable symmetries. The realization of higher-dimensional spin models offers new opportunities ranging from studying topological phases of matter or quantum spin glasses to future fault-tolerant quantum computation.

TI First-Principles Predictions of Out-of-Plane Group IV and V Dimers as
   High-Symmetry, High-Spin Defects in Hexagonal Boron Nitride
SO ACS APPLIED MATERIALS & INTERFACES
AB Hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) has been recently found to host a variety of quantum point defects, which are promising candidates as single-photon sources for solid-state quantum nanophotonic applications. Most recently, optically addressable spin qubits in h-BN have been the focus of intensive research due to their unique potential in quantum computation, communication, and sensing. However, the number of high-symmetry, high-spin defects that are desirable for developing spin qubits in h-BN is highly limited. Here, we combine density functional theory (DFT) and quantum embedding theories to show that out-of-plane XNYi dimer defects (X, Y = C, N, P, and Si) form a new class of stable C-3v spin-triplet defects in h-BN. We find that the dimer defects have a robust (3)A(2) ground state and E-3 excited state, both of which are isolated from the h-BN bulk states. We show that E-1 and (1)A shelving states exist and they are positioned between the E-3 and (3)A(2) states for all the dimer defects considered in this study. To support future experimental identification of the XNYi dimer defects, we provide extensive characterization of the defects in terms of their spin and optical properties. We predict that the zero-phonon line of the spin-triplet XNYi defects lies in the visible range (800 nm to 500 nm). We compute the zero-field splitting of the dimers' spin to range from 1.79 GHz (SiNPi0) to 29.5 GHz (CNNi0). Our results broaden the scope of high-spin defect candidates that would be useful for the development of spin-based solid-state quantum technologies in two-dimensional hexagonal boron nitride.

TI Nonclassical kernels in continuous-variable systems
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Kernel methods are ubiquitous in classical machine learning, and recently their formal similarity with quantum mechanics has been established. To grasp the potential advantage of quantum machine learning, it is necessary to understand the distinction between nonclassical kernel functions and classical kernels. This paper builds on a recently proposed phase-space nonclassicality witness [Bohmann and Agudelo, Phys. Rev. Lett. 124, 133601 (2020)] to derive a witness for the kernel's quantumness in continuous-variable systems. We discuss the role of the kernel's nonclassicality in data distribution in the feature space and the effect of imperfect state preparation. Furthermore, we show that the nonclassical kernels lead to the quantum advantage in parameter estimation. Our work highlights the role of the phase-space correlation functions in understanding the distinction of classical machine learning from quantum machine learning.

TI Device-independent quantum randomness-enhanced zero-knowledge proof
SO PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF
   AMERICA
AB Zero-knowledge proof (ZKP) is a fundamental cryptographic primitive that allows a prover to convince a verifier of the validity of a statement without leaking any further information. As an efficient variant of ZKP, noninteractive zero-knowledge proof (NIZKP) adopting the Fiat-Shamir heuristic is essential to a wide spectrum of applications, such as federated learning, blockchain, and social networks. However, the heuristic is typically built upon the random oracle model that makes ideal assumptions about hash functions, which does not hold in reality and thus undermines the security of the protocol. Here, we present a quantum solution to the problem. Instead of resorting to a random oracle model, we implement a quantum randomness service. This service generates random numbers certified by the loophole-free Bell test and delivers them with postquantum cryptography (PQC) authentication. By employing this service, we conceive and implement NIZKP of the three-coloring problem. By bridging together three prominent research themes, quantum nonlocality, PQC, and ZKP, we anticipate this work to inspire more innovative applications that combine quantum information science and the cryptography field.

AB Quantum metrology leverages quantum correlations for enhanced parameter estimation. Recently, structured light enabled increased resolution and sensitivity in quantum metrology systems. However, lossy and complex setups impacting photon flux hinder true quantum advantage while using high dimensional structured light. We introduce a straightforward mechanical rotation quantum sensing mechanism, employing high-dimensional structured light and use it with a high-flux (45 000 coincidence counts per second) N00N state source with N = 2. The system utilizes two opposite spiral phase plates with topological charge of up to & ell; = 16 that converts mechanical rotation into wavefront phase shifts and exhibit a 16-fold enhanced super-resolution and 25-fold enhanced sensitivity between different topological charges, while retaining the acquisition times, and with negligible change in coincidence count. Furthermore, the high efficiency together with the high photon flux enables detection of mechanical angular acceleration in real-time. Our approach paves the way for highly sensitive quantum measurements, applicable to various interferometric schemes.

TI Non-Gaussian photonic state engineering with the quantum frequency
   processor
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Non-Gaussian quantum states of light are critical resources for optical quantum information processing, but methods to generate them efficiently remain challenging to implement. Here we introduce a generic approach for non-Gaussian state production from input states populating discrete frequency bins. Based on controllable unitary operations with a quantum frequency processor, followed by photon-number-resolved detection of ancilla modes, our method combines recent developments in both frequency-based quantum information and non-Gaussian state preparation. Leveraging and refining the K-function representation of quantum states in the coherent basis, we develop a theoretical model amenable to numerical optimization and, as specific examples, design quantum frequency processor circuits for the production of Schrodinger cat states, exploring the performance tradeoffs for several combinations of ancilla modes and circuit depth. Our scheme provides a valuable framework for producing complex quantum states in frequency bins, paving the way for single-spatial-mode, fiber-optic-compatible non-Gaussian resources.

TI Quantum Light Emission from Coupled Defect States in DNA-Functionalized
   Carbon Nanotubes
SO ACS NANO
AB Solid-state single-photon sources are essential building blocks for quantum photonics and quantum information technologies. This study demonstrates promising single-photon emission from quantum defects generated in single-wall carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) by covalent reaction with guanine nucleotides in their single-stranded DNA coatings. Low-temperature photoluminescence spectroscopy and photon-correlation measurements on individual guanine-functionalized SWCNTs (GF-SWCNTs) indicate that multiple, closely spaced guanine defect sites within a single ssDNA strand collectively form an exciton trapping potential that supports a localized quantum state capable of room-temperature single-photon emission. In addition, exciton traps from adjacent ssDNA strands are weakly coupled to give cross-correlations between their separate photon emissions. Theoretical modeling identifies coupling mechanism as a capture of band-edge excitons. Because the spatial pattern of nanotube functionalization sites can be readily controlled by selecting ssDNA base sequences, GF-SWCNTs should become a versatile family of quantum light emitters with engineered properties.

TI Metrics and geodesics on fuzzy spaces
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS A-MATHEMATICAL AND THEORETICAL
AB We study the fuzzy spaces (as special examples of noncommutative manifolds) with their quasicoherent states in order to find their pertinent metrics. We show that they are naturally endowed with two natural 'quantum metrics' which are associated with quantum fluctuations of 'paths'. The first one provides the length the mean path whereas the second one provides the average length of the fluctuated paths. Onto the classical manifold associated with the quasicoherent state (manifold of the mean values of the coordinate observables in the state minimising their quantum uncertainties) these two metrics provides two minimising geodesic equations. Moreover, fuzzy spaces being not torsion free, we have also two different autoparallel geodesic equations associated with two different adiabatic regimes in the move of a probe onto the fuzzy space. We apply these mathematical results to quantum gravity in BFSS matrix models, and to the quantum information theory of a controlled qubit submitted to noises of a large quantum environment.

TI Enhanced generation of angle correlated photon-pairs in nonlinear
   metasurfaces
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB We reveal that strongly enhanced generation of photon pairs with narrow frequency spectra and sharp angular correlations can be realised through spontaneous parametric down-conversion in metasurfaces. This is facilitated by creating meta-gratings through nano-structuring of nonlinear films of sub-wavelength thickness to support the extended bound state in the continuum resonances, associated with ultra-high Q-factors, at the biphoton wavelengths across a wide range of emission angles. Such spectral features of photons can be beneficial for various applications, including quantum imaging. Our modelling demonstrates a pronounced enhancement, compared to unpatterned films, of the total photon-pair generation rate normalized to the pump power reaching 1.75 kHz mW(-1), which is robust with respect to the angular bandwidth of the pump, supporting the feasibility of future experimental realisations.

TI One-Shot Hybrid State Redistribution
SO QUANTUM
AB We consider state redistribution of a "hybrid" information source that has both classical and quantum components. The sender transmits classical and quantum information at the same time to the receiver, in the presence of classical and quantum side information both at the sender and at the decoder. The available resources are shared entanglement, and noiseless classical and quantum communication channels. We derive one-shot direct and converse bounds for these three resources, represented in terms of the smooth conditional entropies of the source state. Various coding theorems for two-party source coding problems are systematically obtained by reduction from our results, including the ones that have not been addressed in previous literatures.

TI A Quantum Blind Multi-Signature Method for the Industrial Blockchain
SO ENTROPY
AB Traditional anti-quantum methods and multi-signature technologies to secure the blockchain against quantum attacks will quickly reduce the efficiency and scalability of the industrial blockchain, where the computational resources will experience a polynomial rise with the increasing number of traders. Here, a quantum blind multi-signature method is proposed for the multi-party transaction to provide anti-quantum security. First, the proposed multi-party transaction frame and quantum key distribution in the industrial blockchain are introduced. It integrates a novel quantum blind multi-signature algorithm that is based on the quantum entanglement mechanism, and it is absolutely secure in theory. Second, the anti-quantum multi-signature algorithm is illustrated, where there are four phases, i.e., initialization, signing, verification, and implementation. Third, the security and complexity of the proposed framework are analyzed and compared with related methods in references, and our proposed method is verified to be able to offer good computational performance and blockchain scalability for multi-party transaction. Last, the paper is summarized and future research directions are proposed.

TI Highly Polarized Single Photons from Strain-Induced Quasi-1D Localized
   Excitons in WSe2
SO NANO LETTERS
AB Single photon emission from localized excitons in two-dimensional (2D) materials has been extensively investigated because of its relevance for quantum information applications. Prerequisites are the availability of photons with high purity polarization and controllable polarization orientation that can be integrated with optical cavities. Here, deformation strain along edges of prepatterned square-shaped substrate protrusions is exploited to induce quasi-one-dimensional (1D) localized excitons in WSe2 monolayers as an elegant way to get photons that fulfill these requirements. At zero magnetic field, the emission is linearly polarized with 95% purity because exciton states are valley hybridized with equal shares of both valleys and predominant emission from excitons with a dipole moment along the elongated direction. In a strong field, one valley is favored and the linear polarization is converted to high-purity circular polarization. This deterministic control over polarization purity and orientation is a valuable asset in the context of integrated quantum photonics.

TI Local information flow in quantum quench dynamics
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We investigate the out-of-equilibrium dynamics of quantum information in one-dimensional systems undergoing a quantum quench using a local perspective based on the information lattice. This framework provides a scale-and space-resolved decomposition of quantum correlations, enabling a hydrodynamic description of the information flow through well-defined local densities-termed local information-and currents. We apply this framework to three local quenches in noninteracting fermionic chains: (i) the release of a single particle into an empty tight-binding chain, (ii) the connection of two critical chains via the removal of a central barrier, and (iii) the coupling of a topological Kitaev chain to a critical chain. In each case, the information lattice reveals the local structure of correlation buildup and information interface effects, going beyond global measures such as the von Neumann entropy. In particular, through the information lattice, we uncover the signatures in the local information flow associated with topological edge modes and analytically explain the fractional von Neumann entropy values observed in Majorana quench protocols. Our approach is general and applicable to interacting, disordered, and open systems, providing a powerful tool for characterizing quantum information dynamics.

TI Advances in Receiver and Detection Systems for Low Earth Orbit
   Nanosatellite Quantum Communications
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Satellite quantum communications have received a surge of interest in recent years, encouraged by the success of the QUESS experiments and as a reaction to advances in quantum computing. This work focuses on low Earth orbit nanosatellite missions, which offer several benefits (e.g. lower costs, greater launch availability, easier to replenish) over satellites at different orbit heights (medium Earth orbit, geosynchronous Earth orbit) and satellite size classes (e.g. small-sats, etc). Recent work on low Earth orbit satellite Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) has focused on transmitters and quantum sources, with less attention paid to the receiver side of the link. This review addresses that imbalance by focusing on the receiver and detection systems of satellite quantum communications. This work has found that two-way beacon acquisition and tracking systems are both a common element of state-of-the-art missions, and likely to remain a critical subsystem to ensure high-quality satellite-to-ground station links; however, improvements to detection and tracking algorithms could be made. For discrete variable QKD, receivers and detection systems in nanosatellites at low Earth orbit are likely to remain using silicon single photon avalanche diodes, while receivers and detection systems in optical ground stations may opt for superconducting nanowire single photon detectors, as cryogenic cooling is feasible. For continuous variable QKD, the receivers and detection systems, using coherent detection systems, share many hardware elements with classical optical satellite communications. Combined with coherent detection systems' inherent resilience to operating during daytime conditions, this makes continuous variable QKD an attractive prospect for future missions, if its fundamental challenges can be overcome.

TI Training saturation in layerwise quantum approximate optimization
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB The quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) is the most studied gate-based variational quantum algorithm today. We train QAOA one layer at a time to maximize overlap with an n qubit target state. Doing so we discovered that such training always saturates-called training saturation-at some depth p*, meaning that past a certain depth, overlap cannot be improved by adding subsequent layers. We formulate necessary conditions for saturation. Numerically, we find layerwise QAOA reaches its maximum overlap at depth p* = n for the problem of state preparation. The addition of coherent dephasing errors to training removes saturation, recovering robustness to layerwise training. This study sheds new light on the performance limitations and prospects of QAOA.

We highlight this fact from a number of perspectives including computational complexity, practical examples, and the full characterization of energy landscapes for simple systems.

TI Spin-defect qubits in two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides
   operating at telecom wavelengths
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Solid state quantum defects are promising candidates for scalable quantum information systems which can be seamlessly integrated with the conventional semiconductor electronic devices within the 3D monolithically integrated hybrid classical-quantum devices. Diamond nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center defects are the representative examples, but the controlled positioning of an NV center within bulk diamond is an outstanding challenge. Furthermore, quantum defect properties may not be easily tuned for bulk crystalline quantum defects. In comparison, 2D semiconductors, such as transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), are promising solid platform to host a quantum defect with tunable properties and a possibility of position control. Here, we computationally discover a promising defect family for spin qubit realization in 2D TMDs. The defects consist of transition metal atoms substituted at chalcogen sites with desirable spin-triplet ground state, zero-field splitting in the tens of GHz, and strong zero-phonon coupling to optical transitions in the highly desirable telecom band.

TI Taming numerical errors in simulations of continuous variable
   non-Gaussian state preparation
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Numerical simulation of continuous variable quantum state preparation is a necessary tool for optimization of existing quantum information processing protocols. A powerful instrument for such simulation is the numerical computation in the Fock state representation. It unavoidably uses an approximation of the infinite-dimensional Fock space by finite complex vector spaces implementable with classical digital computers. In this approximation we analyze the accuracy of several currently available methods for computation of the truncated coherent displacement operator. To overcome their limitations we propose an alternative with improved accuracy based on the standard matrix exponential. We then employ the method in analysis of non-Gaussian state preparation scheme based on coherent displacement of a two mode squeezed vacuum with subsequent photon counting measurement. We compare different detection mechanisms, including avalanche photodiodes, their cascades, and photon number resolving detectors in the context of engineering non-linearly squeezed cubic states and construction of qubit-like superpositions between vacuum and single photon states.

In this paper we focus on the QST of a pure quantum state using parallel unentangled measurements. Pure states are a small but useful subset of all quantum states, and their tomography requires fewer measurements and is essentially a phase recovery problem. Parallel unentangled measurements are easy to implement in practice because they allow the user to measure each qubit individually, e.g., using one-qubit Pauli measurements. We propose two sets of quantum measurements that one can make on a pure state as well as the algorithms that use the measurement outcomes in order to identify the state. We also discuss how those estimates can be fine tuned by finding the state that maximizes the likelihood of the measurements with different variants of the likelihood. The performances of the proposed three types of QST methods are validated by means of detailed numerical tests, including for mixed states that are close to being pure.

TI An exponential reduction in training data sizes for machine learning
   derived entanglement witnesses
SO MACHINE LEARNING-SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB We propose a support vector machine (SVM) based approach for generating an entanglement witness that requires exponentially less training data than previously proposed methods. SVMs generate hyperplanes represented by a weighted sum of expectation values of local observables whose coefficients are optimized to sum to a positive number for all separable states and a negative number for as many entangled states as possible near a specific target state. Previous SVM-based approaches for entanglement witness generation used large amounts of randomly generated separable states to perform training, a task with considerable computational overhead. Here, we propose a method for orienting the witness hyperplane using only the significantly smaller set of states consisting of the eigenstates of the generalized Pauli matrices and a set of entangled states near the target entangled states. With the orientation of the witness hyperplane set by the SVM, we tune the plane's placement using a differential program that ensures perfect classification accuracy on a limited test set as well as maximal noise tolerance. For N qubits, the SVM portion of this approach requires only O(6N) training states, whereas an existing method needs O(24N). We use this method to construct witnesses of 4 and 5 qubit GHZ states with coefficients agreeing with stabilizer formalism witnesses to within 3.7 percent and 1 percent, respectively. We also use the same training states to generate novel 4 and 5 qubit W state witnesses. Finally, we computationally verify these witnesses on small test sets and propose methods for further verification.

TI Quantum Information in the Protein Codes, 3-Manifolds and the Kummer
   Surface
SO SYMMETRY-BASEL
AB Every protein consists of a linear sequence over an alphabet of 20 letters/amino acids. The sequence unfolds in the 3-dimensional space through secondary (local foldings), tertiary (bonds) and quaternary (disjoint multiple) structures. The mere existence of the genetic code for the 20 letters of the linear chain could be predicted with the (informationally complete) irreducible characters of the finite group G(n) := Z(n) x 2O (with n = 5 or 7 and 2O the binary octahedral group) in our previous two papers. It turns out that some quaternary structures of protein complexes display n-fold symmetries. We propose an approach of secondary structures based on free group theory. Our results are compared to other approaches of predicting secondary structures of proteins in terms of alpha helices, beta sheets and coils, or more refined techniques. It is shown that the secondary structure of proteins shows similarities to the structure of some hyperbolic 3-manifolds. The hyperbolic 3-manifold of smallest volume-Gieseking manifold-some other 3 manifolds and the oriented hypercartographic group are singled out as tentative models of such secondary structures. For the quaternary structure, there are links to the Kummer surface.

TI Calibration of spin-light coupling by coherently induced Faraday
   rotation
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Calibrating the strength of the light-matter interaction is an important experimental task in quantum information and quantum state engineering protocols. The strength of the off-resonant light-matter interaction in multi-atom spin oscillators can be characterized by the readout rate Gamma(S). Here we introduce the method named Coherently Induced FAraday Rotation (CIFAR) for determining the readout rate. The method is suited for both continuous and pulsed readout of the spin oscillator, relying only on applying a known polarization modulation to the probe laser beam and detecting a known optical polarization component. Importantly, the method does not require changes to the optical and magnetic fields performing the state preparation and probing. The CIFAR signal is also independent of the probe beam photo-detection quantum efficiency, and allows direct extraction of other parameters of the interaction, such as the tensor coupling zeta(S), and the damping rate gamma(S). We verify this method in the continuous wave regime, probing a strongly coupled spin oscillator prepared in a warm cesium atomic vapour.

TI Temporal information processing induced by quantum noise
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Quantum computing has been moving from a theoretical phase to practical one, presenting daunting challenges in implementing physical qubits, which are subjected to noises from the surrounding environment. These quantum noises are ubiquitous in quantum devices and generate adverse effects in the quantum computational model, leading to extensive research on their correction and mitigation techniques. But do these quantum noises always provide disadvantages? We show that some abstract quantum noise models can induce useful information processing capabilities for temporal input data in a framework called quantum reservoir computing. We demonstrate this ability in several typical benchmarks and investigate the information processing capacity to clarify the framework's processing mechanism and memory profile. We verified our perspective by implementing the framework in a number of IBM quantum processors and obtained similar characteristic memory profiles with model analyses. As a surprising result, information processing capacity increased with quantum devices' higher noise levels and error rates. Our study opens up a path for diverting useful information from quantum computer noises into a more sophisticated information processor.

TI Electronic control and switching of entangled spin state using
   anisotropy and exchange in the three-particle paradigm
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS COMMUNICATIONS
AB We explore the control and switching of the entangled spin states of multi-spin particle qubit coupled to an electron using a three-particle spin model described by S-i (i = 1, 2, 3), in which S-1 = 1/2 is an electron and S-2,S-3 can have any spin with both exchange coupling and magnetic anisotropy. We derive a general formula for the existence of a switching (DJ) resonance for any spin S-2,S-3. We further contrast the entanglement switching mechanisms for the S-2,S-3 = 1/2 and S-2,S-3 = 1 spin models. We find that while the onsite magnetic anisotropy in the case of S-2,S-3 > 1/2 allows full control of their spin states via interaction with S-1, in order to achieve acceptable control of a Bloch vector within the S-2,S-3 = 1/2 model, additional mechanisms, such as anisotropic exchange coupling, are required.

TI Enhancing quantum utility: Simulating large-scale quantum spin chains on
   superconducting quantum computers
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB We present the quantum simulation of the frustrated quantum spin- 12 antiferromagnetic Heisenberg spin chain with competing nearest-neighbor (J1) and next-nearest-neighbor (J2) exchange interactions in the real superconducting quantum computer with qubits ranging up to 100. In particular, we implement the Hamiltonian with the next-nearest neighbor exchange interaction in conjunction with the nearest-neighbor interaction on IBM's superconducting quantum computer and carry out the time evolution of the spin chain by employing the first-order Trotterization. Furthermore, our implementation of the second-order Trotterization for the isotropic Heisenberg spin chain, involving only nearest-neighbor exchange interaction, enables precise measurement of the expectation values of staggered magnetization observable across a range of up to 100 qubits. Notably, in both cases, our approach results in a constant circuit depth in each Trotter step, independent of the number of qubits. Our demonstration of the accurate measurement of expectation values for the large-scale quantum system using superconducting quantum computers designates the quantum utility of these devices for investigating various properties of many-body quantum systems. This will be a stepping stone to achieving the quantum advantage over classical ones in simulating quantum systems before the fault tolerance quantum era.

TI Finding quantum codes via Riemannian optimization
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB We propose a novel optimization scheme designed to find optimally correctable subspace codes for a known quantum noise channel. To each candidate subspace code we first associate a universal recovery map, as if the code was perfectly correctable, and aim to maximize a performance functional that combines a modified channel fidelity with a tuneable regularization term that promotes simpler codes. With this choice optimization is performed only over the set of codes, and not over the set of recovery operators. The set of codes of fixed dimension is parametrized as a complex-valued Stiefel manifold: the resulting non-convex optimization problem is then solved by gradient-based local algorithms. When perfectly correctable codes cannot be found, a second optimization routine is run on the recovery Kraus map, also parametrized in a suitable Stiefel manifold via Stinespring representation. To test the approach, correctable codes are sought in different scenarios and compared to existing ones: three qubits subjected to bit-flip errors (single and correlated), four qubits undergoing local amplitude damping and five qubits subjected to local depolarizing channels. Approximate codes are found and tested for the previous examples as well pure non-Markovian dephasing noise acting on a 7/2 spin, induced by a 1/2 spin bath, and the noise of the first three qubits of IBM's ibm_kyoto quantum computer. The fidelity results are competitive with existing iterative optimization algorithms, with respect to which we maintain a strong computational advantage, while obtaining simpler codes.

TI Quantum interference of multidimensional quantum states via
   space-division multiplexing of a long-coherent single photon from a warm
    87Rb atomic ensemble
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB The high-dimensional encoding of single photons can offer various possibilities for enhancing quantum information processing. This work experimentally demonstrates the quantum interference of an engineered multidimensional quantum state through the space-division multiplexing of a heralded single-photon state with a spatial light modulator (SLM) and spatial-mode mixing of a single photon through a long multimode fiber (MMF). In our experiment, the heralded single photon generated from a warm Rb-87 atomic ensemble was bright, robust, and long-coherent. The multidimensional spatial quantum state of the long-coherent single photon was transported through a 4-m-long MMF and arbitrarily controlled using the SLM. We observed the quantum interference of a single-photon multidimensional spatial quantum state with a visibility of >95%. These results may have potential applications in quantum information processing, for example, in photonic variational quantum eigensolve with high-dimensional single photons and realizing high information capacity per photon for quantum communication.

TI Discretized quantum adiabatic process for free fermions and comparison
   with the imaginary-time evolution
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Motivated by recent progress of quantum technologies making small-scale programmable quantum computing possible, here we study a discretized quantum adiabatic process for a one-dimensional free-fermion system described by a variational wave function, i.e., a parametrized quantum circuit. The wave function is composed of M layers of two elementary sets of time-evolution operators, each set being decomposed into commutable local operators acting on neighboring sites. The evolution time of each time-evolution operator is treated as a variational parameter so as to minimize the expectation value of the energy. We show that the exact ground state is reached by applying the layers of time-evolution operators as many as a quarter of the system size, implying that at least in this case, the state is exactly prepared in a quantum circuit with linear depth. This is the minimum number M-B of layers set by the limit of speed, i.e., the Lieb-Robinson bound, for propagating quantum entanglement via the local time-evolution operators. Indeed, we show the mutual information of the variational wave function that reveals a causality-cone-like structure in the propagation of quantum entanglement. Quantities such as the energy E and the entanglement entropy S of the optimized variational wave function with the number M of layers less than M-B are independent of the system size L but fall into some universal functions of M, indicating that the entanglement generated in this variational ansatz with a finite M is bounded, as in the case of the matrix product states with a finite bond dimension. Furthermore, in this case, we find that these two quantities behave asymptotically as E/L - epsilon(infinity) similar to M-2 (epsilon(infinity): the exact ground-state energy per site in the thermodynamic limit) and S approximate to 1/3 ln M. The development of the entanglement in the variational ansatz through the discretized quantum adiabatic process is further manifested in the progressive propagation of single-particle orbitals in the variational wave function. We also find that the optimized variational parameters converge systematically to a smooth function of the discretized time, which provides the optimum scheduling function in the quantum adiabatic process, with the effective total evolution time of the variational ansatz to the exact ground state being proportional to the system size L. This is a drastic improvement compared to the evolution time proportional to L-2 for the continuous-time quantum adiabatic process with a linear scheduling and is attributed to diabaticity of the discretized quantum adiabatic process represented in the variational ansatz. Finally, we investigate the imaginary-time evolution counterpart of this variational wave function, where the causality relation is absent due to the nonunitarity of the imaginary-time evolution operators, and thus the norm of the wave function is no longer conserved. We find that the convergence to the exact ground state is exponentially fast, despite that the system is at the critical point, suggesting that implementation of the nonunitary imaginary-time evolution in a quantum circuit is highly promising to further shallow the circuit depth, provided that the local nonunitary operators are represented with a reasonable amount of unitary operators.

TI Singularities, mixing, and non-Markovianity of Pauli dynamical maps
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Quantum non-Markovianity of channels can be produced by mixing Markovian channels, as observed recently by various authors. We consider an analogous question of whether singularities of the channel can be produced by mixing nonsingular channels, i.e., ones that lack them. Here we answer the question in the negative in the context of qubit Pauli channels. On the other hand, mixing channels with a singularity can lead to the elimination of singularities in the resultant channel. We distinguish between two types of singular channels, which lead under mixing to broadly quite different properties of the singularity in the resultant channel. The connection to non-Markovianity (in the sense of completely positive indivisibility) is pointed out. These results impose nontrivial restrictions on the experimental realization of noninvertible quantum channels by a process of channel mixing.

TI Tight Upper Bound for the Maximal Expectation Value of the
   N-Partite Generalized Svetlichny Operator
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB Genuine multipartite non-locality is not only of fundamental interest but also serves as an important resource for quantum information theory. The N-partite scenario and provide an analytical upper bound on the maximal expectation value of the generalized Svetlichny inequality achieved by an arbitrary N-qubit system is considered. Furthermore, the constraints on quantum states for which the upper bound is tight are also presented and illustrated by noisy generalized Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger states. Especially, the new techniques proposed to derive the upper bound allow more insights into the structure of the generalized Svetlichny operator and enable us to systematically investigate the relevant properties. As an operational approach, the variation of the correlation matrix defined makes it more convenient to search for suitable unit vectors that satisfy the tightness conditions. Finally, the results give feasible experimental implementations in detecting the genuine multipartite non-locality and can potentially be applied to other quantum information processing tasks.

TI A simple model for entangled photon generation in resonant structures
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB The ability to engineer pairs of entangled photons is essential to quantum information science, and generating these states using spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) in nano-and micrometer-scale materials offers numerous advantages. To properly engineer such sources, a reliable model describing nano-and micrometer-scale SPDC is necessary; however, such a theoretical description remains a challenge. Here, we propose and derive a simplified model to describe SPDC in resonant structures, which considers the generation of photon pairs and the resonant enhancement of spectral bands to be separate processes, even though they actually occur simultaneously. We compare our simplified model to both the rigorous theory of SPDC in an etalon-a simple example of a resonant structure-and our experiments on SPDC in etalons and find agreement for low-gain SPDC. By simplifying the calculations required to generate photon pairs, our model promises to make designing complex resonant structures easier, and it promises to hasten the iteration of designs across the field of quantum state engineering.

TI Accurate and Efficient Spin-Phonon Coupling and Spin Dynamics
   Calculations for Molecular Solids
SO JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY
AB Molecular materials are poised to play a significant role in the development of future optoelectronic and quantum technologies. A crucial aspect of these areas is the role of spin-phonon coupling and how it facilitates energy transfer processes such as intersystem crossing, quantum decoherence, and magnetic relaxation. Thus, it is of significant interest to be able to accurately calculate the molecular spin-phonon coupling and spin dynamics in the condensed phase. Here, we demonstrate the maturity of ab initio methods for calculating spin-phonon coupling by performing a case study on a single-molecule magnet and showing quantitative agreement with the experiment, allowing us to explore the underlying origins of its spin dynamics. This feat is achieved by leveraging our recent developments in analytic spin-phonon coupling calculations in conjunction with a new method for including the infinite electrostatic potential in the calculations. Furthermore, we make the first ab initio determination of phonon lifetimes and line widths for a molecular magnet to prove that the commonplace Born-Markov assumption for the spin dynamics is valid, but such "exact" phonon line widths are not essential to obtain accurate magnetic relaxation rates. Calculations using this approach are facilitated by the open-source packages we have developed, enabling cost-effective and accurate spin-phonon coupling calculations on molecular solids.

TI Non-Majorana origin of anomalous current-phase relation and Josephson
   diode effect in Bi2SE3/NbSe2 Josephson
   junctions
SO SCIENCE ADVANCES
AB Josephson junctions (JJs) are key to superconducting quantum technologies and the search for self-conjugate quasiparticles potentially useful for fault-tolerant quantum computing. In topological insulator (TI)-based JJs, measuring the current-phase relation (CPR) can reveal unconventional effects such as Majorana bound states (MBS) and nonreciprocal transport. However, reconstructing CPR as a function of magnetic field has not been attempted. Here, we present a platform for field-dependent CPR measurements in planar JJs made of NbSe2 and few-layer Bi2Se3. When a flux quantum Phi 0 threads the junction, we observe anomalous peak-dip CPR structure and nonreciprocal supercurrent flow. We show that these arise from a nonuniform supercurrent distribution that also leads to a robust and tunable Josephson diode effect. Furthermore, despite numerous previous studies, we find no evidence of MBS. Our results establish magnetic field-dependent CPR as a powerful probe of TI-based superconducting devices and offer design strategies for nonreciprocal superconducting electronics.

TI Demonstration of Two-Dimensional Connectivity for a Scalable
   Error-Corrected Ion-Trap Quantum Processor Architecture
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW X
AB A major hurdle for building a large-scale quantum computer is increasing the number of qubits while maintaining connectivity between them. In trapped-ion devices, this connectivity can be achieved by moving subregisters consisting of a few ions across the processor. Here, we focus on an architecture, which we refer to as the quantum spring array (QSA), that is based on a rectangular two-dimensional lattice of linear strings of ions. Connectivity between adjacent ion strings can be controlled by adjusting their separation. This requires control of trapping potentials along two directions, one along the axis of the ion string and one radial to it. In this work, we investigate key elements of the QSA architecture along both directions: We show that the coupling rate between neighboring lattice sites increases with the number of ions per site and the motion of the coupled system can be resilient to electrical noise, both being key requisites for fast and high-fidelity quantum gate operations. The coherence of the coupling is assessed and an entangling gate between qubits stored in radially separated trapping regions is demonstrated. Moreover, we demonstrate control over radio-frequency signals to adjust the radial separation, and thus the coupling rate, between strings. We further present constructions for the implementation of parallelized, transversal gate operations, and map the QSA architecture to code primitives for fault-tolerant quantum error correction, providing a step towards a quantum processor architecture that is optimized for large-scale operation.

TI Synergizing quantum techniques with machine learning for advancing drug
   discovery challenge
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB The Quantum Computing for Drug Discovery Challenge, held at the 42nd International Conference on Computer-Aided Design (ICCAD) in 2023, was a multi-month, research-intensive competition. Over 70 teams from more than 65 organizations from 12 different countries registered, focusing on the use of quantum computing for drug discovery. The challenge centered on designing algorithms to accurately estimate the ground state energy of molecules, specifically OH+, using quantum computing techniques. Participants utilized the IBM Qiskit platform within the constraints of the Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ) era, characterized by noise and limited quantum computing resources. The contest emphasized the importance of accurate estimation, efficient use of quantum resources, and the integration of machine learning techniques. This competition highlighted the potential of hybrid classical-quantum frameworks and machine learning in advancing quantum computing for practical applications, particularly in drug discovery.

SO SCIPOST PHYSICS
AB Quantum gas microscopes are versatile and powerful tools for fundamental science as well as promising candidates for enticing applications such as in quantum simulation or quantum computation. Here we present a quantum gas microscopy setup for experiments with highly magnetic atoms of the lanthanoid elements erbium and dyspronumerical-aperture, in-vacuum microscope objective, mounted inside a glue-free quartz glass cell. The quartz glass cell is enclosed by a compact multi-shell ferromagnetic shield that passively suppresses external magnetic field noise by a factor of more than a thousand. Our setup will enable direct manipulation and probing of the rich quantum manybody physics of dipolar atoms in optical lattices, and bears the potential to put exciting theory proposals - including exotic magnetic phases and quantum phase transitions - to an experimental test.

TI Silicon carbide single-photon sources: challenges and prospects
SO MATERIALS FOR QUANTUM TECHNOLOGY
AB The search for an ideal single-photon source (SPS) with superior emission properties is still at the core of many research efforts in optical quantum technologies and the criteria identifying a perfect SPS are now well outlined in various roadmaps established to develop future quantum communication networks. While many efforts have been placed into optimizing quantum dots in hybrid nanophotonic structures, these sources are limited by low-temperature operation and characterized by not yet facile and scalable engineering processes. Alternative material platforms have emerged to address room temperature operation and more achievable scalability and control. One of these platforms is silicon carbide (SiC). In this perspective, we first provide a very broad timelined introduction on last 30 years' efforts developing SPSs, and then we provide a general outline of recent improvements in uncovering and evolving room-temperature SPSs in SiC viewed in a broader context. We will focus on some specific color centers or intra-bandgap defects and discuss challenges in their further expected development into scalable and robust integrated photonic platforms for nonlinear integrated photonics and spin-photon entanglement generation and distribution. A general comparison with other emerging platforms for SPS is also provided to identify comparative achievements, prospects, and challenges.

TI Decoherence Effects in a Three-Level System under Gaussian Process
SO SYMMETRY-BASEL
AB When subjected to a classical fluctuating field characterized by a Gaussian process, we examine the purity and coherence protection in a three-level quantum system. This symmetry of the three-level system is examined when the local random field is investigated further in the noiseless and noisy regimes. In particular, we consider fractional Gaussian, Gaussian, Ornstein-Uhlenbeck, and power law noisy regimes. We show that the destructive nature of the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck noise toward the symmetry of the qutrit to preserve encoded purity and coherence remains large. Our findings suggest that properly adjusting the noisy parameters to specifically provided values can facilitate optimal extended purity and coherence survival. Non-vanishing terms appear in the final density matrix of the single qutrit system, indicating that it is in a strong coherence regime. Because of all of the Gaussian noises, monotonic decay with no revivals has been observed in the single qutrit system. In terms of coherence and information preservation, we find that the current qutrit system outperforms systems with multiple qubits or qutrits using purity and von Neumann entropy. A comparison of noisy and noiseless situations shows that the fluctuating nature of the local random fields is ultimately lost when influenced using the classical Gaussian noises.

TI Continuous Variable Entanglement in an Optical Parametric Oscillator
   Based on a Nondegenerate Four Wave Mixing Process in Hot Alkali Atoms
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB We present the measurement of entanglement between twin beams generated with a doubly resonant optical parameter oscillator (OPO) based on four-wave mixing in hot 85Rb vapor above threshold. This is the first measurement of entanglement in an OPO with a chi o3 thorn media above threshold. We reconstruct the covariance matrix for several configurations and based on a full picture of the four side band mode state, we study entanglement between all possible bipartitions. We show a robust generation of entanglement with stronger generation for a specific pair of modes. For this system, we show that atomic density is a determinant factor for the generation and loss of quantum correlations. The generation of entangled fields with an atomic OPO operating close to atomic resonance of alkali atoms enables a natural integration into quantum networks.

TI Maximal Steered Coherence and Its Conversion to Entanglement in Multiple
   Bosonic Reservoirs
SO ANNALEN DER PHYSIK
AB The remote control of coherence is a crucial step for its application in quantum computation. The maximal steered coherence (MSC) and its conversion to entanglement in multiple bosonic reservoirs are investigated. It is shown that the MSC decays with time in the Markovian regime and behaves as damped oscillations in the non-Markovian regime. The MSC can also be connected directly to the strength of non-Markovianity, through which it is shown that it can be noticeably enhanced by taking full advantage of the non-Markovian effects. Besides, the MSC can be converted completely to entanglement via optimal incoherent operation applied to the steered qubit and an incoherent ancilla which is immune to decoherence, and the generated entanglement is stronger than the shared entanglement in prior. These findings suggest a potential way for remotely generating and manipulating coherence and entanglement in noisy environments.

TI A Graphical Calculus for Lagrangian Relations
SO ELECTRONIC PROCEEDINGS IN THEORETICAL COMPUTER SCIENCE
CT 4th International Conference on Applied Category Theory (ACT)
CY JUL 12-16, 2021
CL Cambridge, ENGLAND
AB Symplectic vector spaces are the phase spaces of linear mechanical systems. The symplectic form describes, for example, the relation between position and momentum as well as current and volt-age. The category of linear Lagrangian relations between symplectic vector spaces is a symmetric monoidal subcategory of relations which gives a semantics for the evolution - and more generally linear constraints on the evolution - of various physical systems. We give a new presentation of the category of Lagrangian relations over an arbitrary field as a 'doubled' category of linear relations. More precisely, we show that it arises as a variation of Selinger's CPM construction applied to linear relations, where the covariant orthogonal complement functor plays the role of conjugation. Furthermore, for linear relations over prime fields, this corre-sponds exactly to the CPM construction for a suitable choice of dagger. We can furthermore extend this construction by a single affine shift operator to obtain a category of affine Lagrangian relations. Using this new presentation, we prove the equivalence of the prop of affine Lagrangian relations with the prop of qudit stabilizer theory in odd prime dimensions. We hence obtain a unified graphical language for several disparate process theories, including electrical circuits, Spekkens' toy theory, and odd-prime-dimensional stabilizer quantum circuits.

TI High-fidelity realization of the AKLT state on a NISQ-era quantum
   processor
SO SCIPOST PHYSICS
AB The AKLT state is the ground state of an isotropic quantum Heisenberg spin-1 model. It exhibits an excitation gap and an exponentially decaying correlation function, with fractionalized excitations at its boundaries. So far, the one-dimensional AKLT model has only been experimentally realized with trapped-ions as well as photonic systems. In this work, we successfully prepared the AKLT state on a noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) era quantum device. In particular, we developed a non-deterministic algorithm on the IBM quantum processor, where the non-unitary operator necessary for the AKLT state preparation is embedded in a unitary operator with an additional ancilla qubit for each pair of auxiliary spin-1/2's. Such a unitary operator is effectively represented by a parametrized circuit composed of single-qubit and nearest-neighbor CX gates. Compared with the conventional operator decomposition method from Qiskit, our approach results in a much shallower circuit depth with only nearest-neighbor gates, while maintaining a fidelity in excess of 99.99% with the original operator. By simultaneously postselecting each ancilla qubit such that it belongs to the subspace of spin-up |up arrow & rang;, an AKLT state can be systematically obtained by evolving from an initial trivial product state of singlets plus ancilla qubits in spin-up on a quantum computer, and it is subsequently recorded by performing measurements on all the other physical qubits. We show how the accuracy of our implementation can be further improved on the IBM quantum processor with readout error mitigation.

TI Quantum and Classical Data Transmission through Completely Depolarizing
   Channels in a Superposition of Cyclic Orders
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Completely depolarizing channels are often regarded as the prototype of physical processes that are useless for communication: any message that passes through them along a well-defined trajectory is completely erased. When two such channels are used in a quantum superposition of two alternative orders, they become able to transmit some amount of classical information, but still no quantum information can pass through them. Here, we show that the ability to place N completely depolarizing channels in a superposition of N alternative causal orders enables a high-fidelity heralded transmission of quantum information with error vanishing as 1/N. This phenomenon highlights a fundamental difference with the N = 2 case, where completely depolarizing channels are unable to transmit quantum data, even when placed in a superposition of causal orders. The ability to place quantum channels in a superposition of orders also leads to an increase of the classical communication capacity with N, which we rigorously prove by deriving an exact single-letter expression. Our results highlight the more complex patterns of correlations arising from multiple causal orders, which are similar to the more complex patterns of entanglement arising in multipartite quantum systems.

TI A Novel Quantum Hash-Based Attribute-Based Encryption Approach for
   Secure Data Integrity and Access Control in Mobile Edge
   Computing-Enabled Customer Behavior Analysis
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB The domain of Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) has seen rapid growth, making consumer behavior research an essential element in many applications. Nevertheless, in MEC systems that are decentralized and have limited resources, challenges arise in ensuring both data integrity and access control. This paper introduces a new technique called Quantum Hash-Based Attribute-Based Encryption (QH-ABE) to address these issues. Previously, there were several methods available to guarantee data integrity and access control in MEC. However, these systems had limits in managing large and intricate datasets, lacked a standardized protocol for revocation, and incurred significant computational costs. We were prompted by these restrictions to suggest a more efficient technique, which included using the QH-ABE method in our study. The suggested solution integrates hash functions with quantum computing concepts to enhance security and control access in MEC-enabled consumer behavior research. The suggested technique provides several benefits compared to traditional hash algorithms by using hash functions. In this technique, we introduce a Recursive Non-Linear Polynomial graph-centered Integrity Algorithm (RNLPIA). RNLPIA enhances security by thwarting covert alterations to data and guaranteeing tamper-evident measures via the generation of unique hash values derived from the content of the data. The suggested method's efficacy and efficiency are proved by a comprehensive experimental assessment, highlighting its capability to fulfill the data integrity and access control needs of MEC situations. The performance of our technology showcases its potential and paves the way for using quantum computing technologies for accessing control and data security. This work contributes to the progress of privacy-preserving, secure consumer behavior analysis in the dynamic MEC environment.

TI Experimental generation of polarization entanglement from spontaneous
   parametric down-conversion pumped by spatiotemporally highly incoherent
   light
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We investigate the cross influence of the pump coherence on the entanglement produced from spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) in different degrees of freedom (DOFs). We experimentally demonstrate the generation of polarization entanglement from SPDC pumped by a spatiotemporally highly incoherent (STHI) light-emitting diode. Our quantum state tomography measurements using multimode collection fibers to avoid postselection yield a two-qubit state with the concurrence of 0.531 +/- 0.006 and purity of 0.647 +/- 0.005, in excellent agreement with our theoretically predicted concurrence of 0.552 and purity of 0.652. We find that using an STHI pump reduces the entanglement and purity of the output polarization two-qubit state due to a coupling between the spatiotemporal and polarization DOFs introduced by the birefringence and dispersion of the nonlinear crystal. The viability of SPDC with STHI pumps is important for two reasons: (i) STHI sources are ubiquitous and available at a wider range of wavelengths than lasers, and (ii) the generated STHI polarizationentangled two-photon states could potentially be useful in long-distance quantum communication schemes due to their robustness to scattering.

TI Quantumness Near the Schwarzschild Black Hole Based on W-State
SO ANNALEN DER PHYSIK
AB The certain quantumness in the vicinity of the Schwarzschild black hole is investigated by utilizing the W state. The influence of the Hawking effect on the l(1)-norm of quantum coherence, first-order coherence (FOC) is explored, concurrence-fill (CF) and global concurrence (GC) in Schwarzschild black hole, for systems with one, two and three physically accessible modes. It is concluded that the Hawking effect not only perturbs but also amplifies the quantum entanglement, while destroying the quantum coherence for systems with three physically accessible modes. For systems with one or two physically accessible modes, the Hawking effect has a beneficial effect on quantum coherence and entanglement. Moreover, the influence of both the Hawking effect and environmental noise (AD channels) on l(1)-norm of quantum coherence, FOC, CF and GC is studied. It is demonstrated that for systems with three physically accessible modes, the Hawking effect disrupts quantum coherence but exerts a positive influence on quantum entanglement under the AD channels. The remaining two scenarios exhibit the same behavior as the previous conclusions.

TI Improved upper bounds on the stabilizer rank of magic states
SO QUANTUM
AB In this work we improve the runtime of recent classical algorithms for strong simulation of quantum circuits composed of Clifford and T gates. The improvement is obtained by establishing a new upper bound on the stabilizer rank of m copies of the magic state vertical bar T  = root 2(-1)(vertical bar 0  + e(i pi/4)vertical bar 1 ) in the limit of large m. In particular, we show that vertical bar T (circle times m) can be exactly expressed as a superposition of at most O(2(alpha m)) stabilizer states, where alpha <= 0.3963, improving on the best previously known bound alpha <= 0.463. This furnishes, via known techniques, a classical algorithm which approximates output probabilities of an n-qubit 'Clifford + T' circuit U with m uses of the T gate to within a given inverse polynomial relative error using a runtime poly(n, m)2(alpha m). We also provide improved upper bounds on the stabilizer rank of symmetric product states vertical bar psi (circle times m) more generally; as a consequence we obtain a strong simulation algorithm for circuits consisting of Clifford gates and m instances of any (fixed) single-qubit Z-rotation gate with runtime poly(n, m)2(m/2). We suggest a method to further improve the upper bounds by constructing linear codes with certain properties.

TI Thin film aluminum nitride surface acoustic wave resonators for quantum
   acoustodynamics
SO APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS
AB Quantum excitations of macroscopic surface acoustic waves (SAWs) have been tailored to control, communicate, and transduce stationary and flying quantum states. However, the limited lifetime of these hybrid quantum systems remains critical obstacles to extend their applications in quantum information processing. Here, we present potentials of thin film aluminum nitride to on-chip integrated phonons with superconducting qubits over previous bulk piezoelectric substrates. We have reported high-quality thin film GHz-SAW resonators with the highest internal quality factor Q(i) of 4:92 x 10(4) in the quantum regime. The internal losses of SAW resonators are systematically investigated by tuning the parameters of sample layout, power, and temperature. Our results manifest that SAWs on piezoelectric films are readily integrated with standard fabrication of Josephson junction quantum circuits and offer excellent acoustic platforms for high-coherence quantum acoustodynamics architectures.

TI Engineering Entangled Photons for Transmission in Ring-Core Optical
   Fibers
SO FRONTIERS IN PHYSICS
AB The capacity of optical communication channels can be increased by space division multiplexing in structured optical fibers. Radial core optical fibers allows for the propagation of twisted light-eigenmodes of orbital angular momentum, which have attracted considerable attention for high-dimensional quantum information. Here we study the generation of entangled photons that are tailor-made for coupling into ring core optical fibers. We show that the coupling of photon pairs produced by parametric down-conversion can be increased by close to a factor of three by pumping the non-linear crystal with a perfect vortex mode with orbital angular momentum l, rather than a gaussian mode. Moreover, the two-photon orbital angular momentum spectrum has a nearly constant shape. This provides an interesting scenario for quantum state engineering, as pumping the crystal with a superposition of perfect vortex modes can be used in conjunction with the mode filtering properties of the ring core fiber to produce simple and interesting quantum states.

TI Directly measured squeeze factors over GHz bandwidth from monolithic
   PPKTP resonators
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB Squeezed vacuum states of light with bandwidths in the gigahertz range are required for ultrafast quantum sensors, for high-speed continuous-variable (CV) one-sided device independent QKD and for CV optical quantum computers. Here we report on the detailed investigation of the current performance limits of the established method for the generation and direct measurement of squeezed light with GHz bandwidth. We present squeeze factors of diffraction limited laser beams from monolithic periodically poled KTP resonators measured with two laboratory-built balanced homodyne detectors (BHDs) with gigahertz bandwidth. We realize two complete systems without selection of optical or electronic hardware components to test the reproducibility without rejects. As expected, the systems show clear spectral differences. However, both achieve directly measured squeeze factors in the order of 3 dB over a GHz bandwidth, which is achieved here for the first time. Since the speed of CV quantum protocols scales proportionally to the bandwidth used, our layout for BHDs is suitable for increasing the speed of all these protocols.

TI Quantum integration of elementary particle processes
SO PHYSICS LETTERS B
AB We apply quantum integration to elementary particle-physics processes. In particular, we look at scattering processes such as e(+)e(-)-> q (q) over bar and e(+)e(-)-> q (q) over bar /W. The corresponding probability distributions can be first appropriately loaded on a quantum computer using either quantum Generative Adversarial Networks or an exact method. The distributions are then integrated using the method of Quantum Amplitude Estimation which shows a quadratic speed-up with respect to classical techniques. In simulations of noiseless quantum computers, we obtain per-cent accurate results for one- and twodimensional integration with up to six qubits. This work paves the way towards taking advantage of quantum algorithms for the integration of high-energy processes. (c) 2022 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier B.V.

TI A Robust Hybrid Classical and Quantum Model for Short-Term Wind Speed
   Forecasting
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Power scheduling by power utilities is more difficult than in the past decades because of a high penetration of renewable power generation, such as wind power generation, with highly uncertain and stochastic characteristics. To address this issue, a highly accurate technique for forecasting wind speed must be developed. In this work, a hybrid classical-quantum model is developed to exploit the advantages of two powerful models, a long short-term memory (LSTM) and a quantum neural network. Quantum neural networks, also known as parameterized quantum circuits, act like machine learning models but with greater expressive power. They comprise quantum gates that apply the principles of quantum mechanics in order to achieve quantum advantage. Additionally, to obtain a robust design that is insensitive to seasonal changes in the data, the Taguchi method is used to set up orthogonal experiments to set the hyperparameters of the proposed model. Historical data from seven sites in various countries (Taiwan, the Philippines, China, and South Korea) are used to forecast 24-hour-ahead wind speeds at the Fuhai wind farm near Taiwan. Comparative simulation results show that the proposed robust hybrid classical-quantum model outperforms current state-of-art models, such as classical nonlinear autoregressive network, random forest, extreme gradient boosting, support vector regression, and classical LSTM.

TI Enhancing Dynamic Security Assessment in Smart Grids Through Quantum
   Federated Learning
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON AUTOMATION SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING
AB Dynamic Security Assessment (DSA) is critical for maintaining stability in large-scale smart grids, especially with the growing integration of renewable energy sources and the inherent uncertainties. Traditional model-based analytical methods are increasingly inadequate under these complex conditions. To address these challenges, we propose a pioneering Quantum Federated Learning-based DSA (QFLDSA) method by combining hybrid quantum-classical machine learning and federated learning. QFLDSA offers an effective way to deal with high-dimensional data and uncertainties inherent in the grid. Moreover, QFLDSA leverages the unique capabilities of quantum computing to enhance the processing of differential-algebraic equations that underpin grid stability. This paper demonstrates through extensive simulations that QFLDSA significantly outperforms traditional methods, achieving the highest average F1-score performance at 97.94%, while maintaining 97.67 $\pm$ 0.17% prediction accuracy on both classical and quantum computing devices only with fewer transmitted model parameters (reducing up to $\sim$ 1000X). These enhancements enable more reliable and rapid deployment of preventive stability control measures across smart grids. Our results underscore QFLDSA's potential as a robust solution for the dynamic security challenges of modern smart grids, paving the way for future innovations in grid management technology. Note to Practitioners-In the rapidly evolving world of smart cyber-physical grids, ensuring the stability of electric power systems is paramount. Failures in these systems can lead to catastrophic blackouts, affecting countless homes and businesses. Traditional DSA methods to assess and ensure this stability, while effective, are becoming increasingly complex and vulnerable to single points of failure or cyberattacks. Enter the QFLDSA method, a novel approach we introduce in this paper. In simple terms, this method combines the strengths of quantum machine learning and federated learning to analyze data efficiently across a distributed system. Here's why these matters: 1) Localized Analysis: Instead of relying on a central hub to analyze all data, QFLDSA allows for localized data analysis. This means that if one part of the system fails, it does not bring down the entire grid's analysis capabilities. It is akin to having multiple control rooms instead of one, ensuring that a problem in one room does not halt the entire operation. 2) Future-Ready: As we move towards a future where quantum computing becomes more prevalent, QFLDSA is designed to work seamlessly with both today's classical devices and tomorrow's quantum devices. This ensures that as technology evolves, our method remains relevant and efficient. 3) Proven Performance: We have not just introduced a new method; we have rigorously tested it. Our theoretical proofs and practical tests confirm that QFLDSA offers accurate and efficient data analysis for smart grids. For industry professionals, the takeaway is clear: if looking for a resilient, future-ready, and proven method to ensure the stability of smart grid, QFLDSA offers a compelling solution.

TI Parameterized coherence measure
SO RESULTS IN PHYSICS
AB Quantifying coherence is an essential endeavor for both quantum mechanical foundations and quantum technologies. We present a bona fide measure of quantum coherence by utilizing the Tsallis relative operator (������, ������)-entropy. We first prove that the proposed coherence measure fulfills all the criteria of a well defined coherence measure, including the strong monotonicity in the resource theories of quantum coherence. We then study the ordering of the Tsallis relative operator (������, ������)-entropy of coherence, Tsallis relative ������-entropies of coherence, Renyi ������-entropy of coherence and ������1 norm of coherence for both pure and mixed qubit states. This provides a new method for defining new coherence measure and entanglement measure, and also provides a new idea for further study of quantum coherence.

TI Phase-space methods for representing, manipulating, and correcting
   Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill qubits
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB The Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) encoding of a qubit into a bosonic mode is a promising bosonic code for quantum computation due to its tolerance for noise and all-Gaussian gate set. We present a toolkit for phase-space description and manipulation of GKP encodings that includes Wigner functions for ideal and approximate GKP states, for various types of mixed GKP states, and for GKP-encoded operators. One advantage of a phase-space approach is that Gaussian unitaries, required for computation with GKP codes, correspond to simple transformations on the arguments of Wigner functions. We use this fact and our toolkit to describe GKP error correction, including magic-state preparation, entirely in phase space using operations on Wigner functions. While our focus here is on the square-lattice GKP code, we provide a general framework for GKP codes defined on any lattice.

TI One-particle Green's functions from the quantum equation of motion

SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Many-body Green's functions encode all the properties and excitations of interacting electrons. While these are challenging to be evaluated accurately on a classical computer, recent efforts have been directed toward finding quantum algorithms that may provide a quantum advantage for this task, exploiting architectures that will become available in the near future. In this work we introduce a novel near-term quantum algorithm for computing one-particle Green's functions via their Lehmann representation. The method is based on a generalization of the quantum equation of motion algorithm that gives access to the charged excitations of the system. We demonstrate the validity of the present proposal by computing the Green's function of a two-site Fermi-Hubbard model on a IBM quantum processor.

TI Quantum and coherent signal transmission on a single-frequency channel
   via the electro-optic serrodyne technique
SO SCIENCE ADVANCES
AB Fiber-optical networks are well established to accommodate global data traffic via coherent information transmission. The next generation of telecommunications will require the integration of quantum information into fiber-optic networks, e.g., for quantum key distribution. A promising and scalable route to enable quantum networking is encoding quantum information into the frequency of photons. While the cointegration of frequency-entangled photons with coherent information transmission is achieved via spectral multiplexing, more resource-efficient approaches are required. In this work, we introduce and experimentally demonstrate a transceiver concept that enables the transmission of coherent and frequency-entangled photons over a single-frequency channel. Our concept leverages the serrodyne technique via electro-optic phase modulation leading to very different dynamics for entangled and coherent photons. This enables temporal multiplexing of the respective signals. We demonstrate the preservation of entanglement over the channel in the presence of coherent light. Our approach reveals a strong potential for efficient bandwidth use in hybrid networks.

TI Genuinely noncyclic geometric gates in two-pulse schemes
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB While most approaches to geometric quantum computation are based on geometric phases in cyclic evolution, noncyclic geometric gates have been proposed to increase further the flexibility. While these gates remove the dynamical phase of the computational basis, they do not, in general, remove it from the eigenstates of the time evolution operator, which makes the geometric nature of the gates ambiguous. Here, we resolve this ambiguity by proposing a scheme for genuinely noncyclic geometric gates. These gates are obtained by evolving the computational basis along open paths consisting of geodesic segments, and simultaneously assuring that no dynamical phase is acquired by the eigenstates of the time evolution operator. While we illustrate the scheme for the simplest nontrivial case of two geodesic segments starting at each computational basis state of a single qubit, the scheme can be straightforwardly extended to more elaborate paths, more qubits, or even qudits.

TI Theory for Equivariant Quantum Neural Networks
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Quantum neural network architectures that have little to no inductive biases are known to face trainability and generalization issues. Inspired by a similar problem, recent breakthroughs in machine learning address this challenge by creating models encoding the symmetries of the learning task. This is materialized through the usage of equivariant neural networks the action of which commutes with that of the symmetry. In this work, we import these ideas to the quantum realm by presenting a comprehensive theoretical framework to design equivariant quantum neural networks (EQNNs) for essentially any relevant symmetry group. We develop multiple methods to construct equivariant layers for EQNNs and analyze their advantages and drawbacks. Our methods can find unitary or general equivariant quantum channels efficiently even when the symmetry group is exponentially large or continuous. As a special implementation, we show how standard quantum convolutional neural networks (QCNNs) can be generalized to group-equivariant QCNNs where both the convolution and pooling layers are equivariant to the symmetry group. We then numerically demonstrate the effectiveness of a SU(2)-equivariant QCNN over symmetryagnostic QCNN on a classification task of phases of matter in the bond-alternating Heisenberg model. Our framework can be readily applied to virtually all areas of quantum machine learning. Lastly, we discuss about how symmetry-informed models such as EQNNs provide hopes to alleviate central challenges such as barren plateaus, poor local minima, and sample complexity.

TI Fabrication of low-loss quasi-single-mode PPLN waveguide and its
   application to a modularized broadband high-level squeezer
SO APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS
AB A continuous-wave (CW) broadband high-level optical quadrature squeezer is essential for high-speed large-scale fault-tolerant quantum computing on a time-domain-multiplexed continuous-variable optical cluster state. CW THz-bandwidth squeezed light can be obtained with a waveguide optical parametric amplifier (OPA); however, the squeezing level has been insufficient for applications of fault-tolerant quantum computation because of degradation of the squeezing level due to their optical losses caused by the structural perturbation and pump-induced phenomena. Here, by using mechanical polishing processes, we fabricated a low-loss quasi-single-mode periodically poled LiNbO3 (PPLN) waveguide, which shows 7% optical propagation loss with a waveguide length of 45 mm. Using the waveguide, we assembled a low-loss fiber-pigtailed OPA module with a total insertion loss of 21%. Thanks to its directly bonded core on a LiTaO3 substrate, the waveguide does not show pump-induced optical loss even under a condition of hundreds of milliwatts pumping. Furthermore, the quasi-single-mode structure prohibits excitation of higher-order spatial modes and enables us to obtain larger squeezing level. Even with including optical coupling loss of the modularization, we observe 6.3-dB squeezed light from the DC component up to a 6.0-THz sideband in a fully fiber-closed optical system. By excluding the losses due to imperfections of the modularization and detection, the squeezing level at the output of the PPLN waveguide is estimated to be over 10 dB. Our waveguide squeezer is a promising quantum light source for high-speed large-scale fault-tolerant quantum computing.(c) 2021 Author(s).

TI Measurement of the g Factor of Ground-State 87Sr at the
   Parts-per-Million Level Using Co-Trapped Ultracold Atoms
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB We demonstrate nuclear magnetic resonance of optically trapped ground-state ultracold 87Sr atoms. Using a scheme in which a cloud of ultracold 87Rb is co-trapped nearby, we improve the determination of the nuclear g factor, gI, of atomic 87Sr by more than two orders of magnitude, reaching accuracy at the parts-per-million level. We achieve similar accuracy in the ratio of relevant g factors between Rb and Sr. This establishes ultracold 87Sr as an excellent linear in-vacuum magnetometer. More generally, our Letter demonstrates how ultracold neutral atoms can be used for the precise determination of highly relevant atomic and nuclear magnetic properties. These results are important for ongoing efforts toward quantum simulation, quantum computation and optical atomic clocks employing 87Sr, and other neutral alkaline-earth and alkaline-earth-like atoms.

TI Heisenberg-Limited Ground-State Energy Estimation for Early
   Fault-Tolerant Quantum Computers
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Under suitable assumptions, the quantum-phase-estimation (QPE) algorithm is able to achieve Heisenberg-limited precision scaling in estimating the ground-state energy. However, QPE requires a large number of ancilla qubits and a large circuit depth, as well as the ability to perform inverse quantum Fourier transform, making it expensive to implement on an early fault-tolerant quantum computer. We propose an alternative method to estimate the ground-state energy of a Hamiltonian with Heisenberg-limited precision scaling, which employs a simple quantum circuit with one ancilla qubit, and a classical postprocessing procedure. Besides the ground-state energy, our algorithm also produces an approximate cumulative distribution function of the spectral measure, which can be used to compute other spectral properties of the Hamiltonian.

TI Advances and Perspectives in Single Photon Detectors: Principles,
   Materials, Cooling Systems, and Applications
SO ADVANCED OPTICAL MATERIALS
AB Efficient detection of ultra-weak optical signals, particularly at the single-photon level, is critical for the advancement of technologies such as LiDAR and quantum communication. Conventional linear optical detectors exhibit insufficient sensitivity to meet the rigorous demands of these applications. Single-photon detectors, with their unparalleled sensitivity and ultrafast response, offer substantial promise. However, their performance is limited by factors including material properties, device architecture, and environmental noise. Current research efforts are focused on optimizing materials, refining device designs, and enhancing cooling technologies, yet a systematic theoretical framework remains lacking. This review addresses these challenges by exploring the fundamental principles, material innovations, and cooling strategies essential to overcoming existing limitations. It emphasizes the inherent trade-off in achieving high detection efficiency, low dark count rates, and minimal afterpulse probability. An integrated optimization approach is proposed, aligning front-end device design with back-end application needs, balancing detection efficiency, dark count rates, and temporal resolution. This strategy aims to facilitate the practical deployment of high-performance single-photon detectors.

AB Optimizing objective functions stands to benefit significantly from leveraging quantum computers, promising enhanced solution quality across various application domains in the future. However, harnessing the potential of quantum solvers necessitates formulating problems according to the Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) model, demanding significant expertise in quantum computation and QUBO formulations. This expertise barrier limits access to quantum solutions.
   Fortunately, automating the conversion of conventional optimization problems into QUBO formulations presents a solution for promoting accessibility to quantum solvers. This article addresses the unmet need for a comprehensive automatic framework to assist users in utilizing quantum solvers for optimization tasks while preserving interfaces that closely resemble conventional optimization practices. The framework prompts users to specify variables, optimization criteria, as well as validity constraints and, afterwards, allows them to choose the desired solver. Subsequently, it automatically transforms the problem description into a format compatible with the chosen solver and provides the resulting solution. Additionally, the framework offers instruments for analyzing solution validity and quality.
   Comparative analysis against existing libraries and tools in the literature highlights the comprehensive nature of the proposed framework. Two use cases (the knapsack problem and linear regression) are considered to show the completeness and efficiency of the framework in real-world applications.
   Finally, the proposed framework represents a significant advancement towards automating quantum computing solutions and widening access to quantum optimization for a broader range of users.
   The framework is publicly available on GitHub (https://github.com/cda-tum/mqt-qao) as part of the Munich Quantum Toolkit (MQT).

TI Quantum kernel t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Data visualization is important in understanding the characteristics of data that are difficult to see directly. It is used to visualize loss landscapes and optimization trajectories to analyze optimization performance. Popular optimization analysis is performed by visualizing a loss landscape around the reached local or global minimum using principal component analysis. However, this visualization depends on the variational parameters of a quantum circuit rather than quantum states, which makes it difficult to understand the mechanism of the optimization process through the property of quantum states. Here, we propose a quantum data visualization method using quantum kernels, which enables us to offer fast and highly accurate visualization of quantum states. In our numerical experiments, we visualize a hand-written digits data set and apply a k-nearest neighbor algorithm to the low-dimensional data to quantitatively evaluate our proposed method compared with a classical kernel method. As a result, our proposed method achieves comparable accuracy to the state-of-the-art classical kernel method, meaning that the proposed visualization method based on quantum machine learning does not degrade the separability of the input higher-dimensional data. Furthermore, we visualize the optimization trajectories of finding the ground states of the transverse field Ising model, and we successfully find the trajectory characteristics. Since quantum states are higher-dimensional objects that can only be seen via observables, our visualization method, which inherits the similarity of quantum data, would be useful in understanding the behavior of quantum circuits and algorithms.

TI An Image Encryption Scheme Based on Logistic Quantum Chaos
SO ENTROPY
AB This paper proposes an image encryption scheme based on logistic quantum chaos. Firstly, we use compressive sensing algorithms to compress plaintext images and quantum logistic and Hadamard matrix to generate the measurement matrix. Secondly, the improved flexible representation of the quantum images (FRQI) encoding method is utilized for encoding the compressed image. The pixel value scrambling operation of the encoded image is realized by rotating the qubit around the axis. Finally, the quantum pixel is encoded into the pixel value in the classical computer, and the bit-level diffusion and scrambling are performed on it. Numerical analysis and simulation results show that our proposed scheme has the large keyspace and strong key sensitivity. The proposed scheme can also resist standard attack methods such as differential attacks and statistical analysis.

TI Tomography-assisted noisy quantum circuit simulator using matrix product
   density operators
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB In recent years, efficient quantum circuit simulations incorporating ideal noise assumptions have relied on tensor network simulators, particularly leveraging the matrix product density operator (MPDO) framework. However, experiments on real noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices often involve complex noise profiles, encompassing uncontrollable elements and instrument-specific effects such as crosstalk. To address these challenges, we employ quantum process tomography (QPT) techniques to directly capture the operational characteristics of the experimental setup and integrate them into numerical simulations using MPDOs. Our QPT-assisted MPDO simulator is then applied to explore a variational approach for generating noisy entangled states, comparing the results with standard noise numerical simulations and demonstrations conducted on the Quafu cloud quantum computation platform. Additionally, we investigate noisy MaxCut problems, as well as the effects of crosstalk and noise truncation. Our results provide valuable insights into the impact of noise on NISQ devices and lay the foundation for enhanced design and assessment of quantum algorithms in complex noise environments.

TI Superior dark-state cooling via nonreciprocal couplings in trapped atoms
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB Cooling the trapped atoms toward their motional ground states is key to applications of quantum simulation and quantum computation. By utilizing nonreciprocal couplings between two atoms, we present an intriguing dark-state cooling scheme in ?-type three-level structure, which is shown superior than the conventional electromagnetically-induced-transparency cooling in a single atom. The effective nonreciprocal couplings can be facilitated either by an atom-waveguide interface or a free-space photonic quantum link. By tailoring system parameters allowed in dark-state cooling, we identify the parameter regions of better cooling performance with an enhanced cooling rate. We further demonstrate a mapping to the dark-state sideband cooling under asymmetric laser driving fields, which shows a distinct heat transfer and promises an outperforming dark-state sideband cooling assisted by collective spin-exchange interactions.

TI Multimode photon blockade
SO NATURE PHYSICS
AB Interactions are essential for the creation of correlated quantum many-body states. Although two-body interactions underlie most natural phenomena, three- and four-body interactions are important for the physics of nuclei(1), exotic few-body states in ultracold quantum gases(2), the fractional quantum Hall effect(3), quantum error correction(4) and holography(5,6). Recently, a number of artificial quantum systems have emerged as simulators for many-body physics, featuring the ability to engineer strong interactions. However, the interactions in these systems have largely been limited to the two-body paradigm and require building up multibody interactions by combining two-body forces. Here we implement a scheme to create a higher-order interaction between photons stored in multiple electromagnetic modes of a microwave cavity. The system is dressed such that there is collectively no interaction until a target total photon number is reached across multiple distinct modes, at which point the photons interact strongly. In our demonstration, we create interactions involving up to three bodies and across up to five modes. We harness the interaction to prepare single-mode Fock states and multimode W states, which we verify by introducing a multimode Wigner tomography method.

TI Real-field Hong-Ou-Mandel interference of indistinguishable coherent
   photons via long optical injection-locking over 50 km fiber
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Measurement-device-independent quantum key distribution (MDI-QKD) has garnered significant attention for enabling security-loophole-free quantum communication. Successful MDI-QKD protocols rely on performing a two-photon Bell-state measurement at an intermediate node, where achieving a high-visibility Hong-Ou-Mandel (HOM) interference pattern between two independent coherent photons is crucial. In this study, we present an approach for developing indistinguishable coherent photon sources over 50 km of optical fiber under real-world conditions. We introduce the long optical injection-locking (long-OIL) technique, which enables frequency locking between two long-distance coherent photons separated by distances exceeding the coherence length of the master laser. Utilizing the long-OIL technique, we achieved time-resolved HOM interference with a visibility of 48(2)%, which is close to the theoretical limits of 50% for two independent continuous-wave coherent photons. Our results indicate that the long-OIL platform is a promising solution for MDI-QKD with repeaterless secret-key capacity.

TI Low-Loss Polarization-Maintaining Router for Single and Entangled
   Photons at a Telecom Wavelength
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB Photon polarization serves as an essential quantum information carrier in quantum information and measurement applications. Routing of arbitrarily polarized single photons and polarization-entangled photons is a crucial technology for scaling up quantum information applications. Here, a low-loss, noiseless, polarization-maintaining routing of arbitrarily polarized single photons and, crucially, multi-photon entangled states is demonstrated where the entanglement is encoded in orthogonal polarization bases, at the telecom L-band. The interferometer-based router is constructed by optics with a low angle of incidence and cross-aligned electro-optic crystals, achieving the polarization-maintaining operation with a minimal number of optical components. The routing of arbitrarily-polarized heralded single photons with a 0.057 dB (1.3%) loss, a 22 dB switching extinction ratio, and 99% polarization process fidelity to ideal identity operation is demonstrated. Moreover, the high-quality router achieves the routing of two-photon N00N-type entangled states with a highly maintained interference visibility of 97%. The demonstrated router scheme preserving multi-photon polarization state paves the way toward polarization-encoded photonic quantum network as well as multi-photon entanglement synthesis via spatial- and time-multiplexing techniques.

SO SCIENCE ADVANCES
AB Quantum technologies involving qubit measurements based on electronic interferometers rely critically on accurate single-particle emission. However, achieving precisely timed operations requires exquisite control of the single-particle sources in the time domain. Here, we demonstrate accurate control of the emission time statistics of a dynamic single-electron transistor by measuring the waiting times between emitted electrons. By ramping up the modulation frequency, we controllably drive the system through a crossover from adiabatic to nonadiabatic dynamics, which we visualize by measuring the temporal fluctuations at the single-electron level and explain using detailed theory. Our work paves the way for future technologies based on the ability to control, transmit, and detect single quanta of charge or heat in the form of electrons, photons, or phonons.

TI 648 Hilbert-space dimensionality in a biphoton frequency comb:
   entanglement of formation and Schmidt mode decomposition
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Qudit entanglement is an indispensable resource for quantum information processing since increasing dimensionality provides a pathway to higher capacity and increased noise resilience in quantum communications, and cluster-state quantum computations. In continuous-variable time-frequency entanglement, encoding multiple qubits per photon is only limited by the frequency correlation bandwidth and detection timing jitter. Here, we focus on the discrete-variable time-frequency entanglement in a biphoton frequency comb (BFC), generating by filtering the signal and idler outputs with a fiber Fabry-Perot cavity with 45.32 GHz free-spectral range (FSR) and 1.56 GHz full-width-at-half-maximum (FWHM) from a continuous-wave (cw)-pumped type-II spontaneous parametric downconverter (SPDC). We generate a BFC whose time-binned/frequency-binned Hilbert space dimensionality is at least 324, based on the assumption of a pure state. Such BFC's dimensionality doubles up to 648, after combining with its post-selected polarization entanglement, indicating a potential 6.28 bits/photon classical-information capacity. The BFC exhibits recurring Hong-Ou-Mandel (HOM) dips over 61 time bins with a maximum visibility of 98.4% without correction for accidental coincidences. In a post-selected measurement, it violates the Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (CHSH) inequality for polarization entanglement by up to 18.5 standard deviations with an S-parameter of up to 2.771. It has Franson interference recurrences in 16 time bins with a maximum visibility of 96.1% without correction for accidental coincidences. From the zeroth- to the third-order Franson interference, we infer an entanglement of formation (E-of) up to 1.89 +/- 0.03 ebits-where 2 ebits is the maximal entanglement for a 4 x 4 dimensional biphoton-as a lower bound on the 61 time-bin BFC's high-dimensional entanglement. To further characterize time-binned/frequency-binned BFCs we obtain Schmidt mode decompositions of BFCs generated using cavities with 45.32, 15.15, and 5.03 GHz FSRs. These decompositions confirm the time-frequency scaling from Fourier-transform duality. Moreover, we present the theory of conjugate Franson interferometry-because it is characterized by the state's joint-temporal intensity (JTI)-which can further help to distinguish between pure-state BFC and mixed state entangled frequency pairs, although the experimental implementation is challenging and not yet available. In summary, our BFC serves as a platform for high-dimensional quantum information processing and high-dimensional quantum key distribution (QKD).

TI Coherent transfer of the higher-order polarization state of photons to
   the spin structure state of electrons in a semiconductor
SO OPTICA QUANTUM
AB Quantum state conversion from the higher-order polarization states of photons on a higher-order Poincar & eacute; sphere (HOPS) with spin angular momentum (SAM) and orbital angular momentum (OAM) to an electron system in a semiconductor host is an interesting topic for high-density quantum media conversion with high degrees of freedom (DoFs). In this paper, we present the spatial spin structure states of electrons on a higher-order Bloch sphere, corresponding to HOPS states, using the similarity between the electron states on the Bloch sphere and the polarization states on the Poincar & eacute; sphere. Furthermore, the coherent transfer of the spatial structure of photon polarization to the spin structure state of electrons was demonstrated for the first time in GaAs/AlGaAs quantum wells using a V-shaped three-level system. The results provide insights into the simultaneous coherent transfer of SAM and OAM from the extended states of photon-to-electron systems, leading to the realization of the quantum state transfer of the high-dimensional entangled states of photons to electron spins with different DoFs.

TI Cryogenic integrated spontaneous parametric down-conversion
SO OPTICA
AB Scalable quantum photonics relies on interfacing many optical components under mutually compatible operating conditions. To that end, we demonstrate that spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) in nonlinear waveguides, a standard technology for generating entangled photon pairs, squeezed states, and heralded single photons, is fully compatible with cryogenic operating conditions required for superconducting detectors. This is necessary for the proliferation of integrated quantum photonics in integration platforms exploiting quasiphase-matched second-order nonlinear interactions. We investigate how cryogenic operation at 4 K affects the SPDC process by comparing the heralding efficiency, second-order correlation function, and spectral properties with operation at room temperature.

TI Polarization bases compensation towards advantages in satellite-based
   QKD without active feedback
SO COMMUNICATIONS PHYSICS
AB Scaling-up quantum key distribution to large distances, although imperative for realizing a globally secure quantum internet, inevitably suffers from polarization fluctuations. This work demonstrates an alternative approach to resource intensive active polarization tracking in mitigating the said challenge, by optimizing measurement bases at the receiver end.
   Long-distance photonic implementations of quantum key distribution protocols have gained increased interest due to the promise of information-theoretic security against unauthorized eavesdropping. However, a significant challenge in this endeavor is photon-polarization getting affected due to the birefringence of fibers in fiber-based implementations, or variation of reference frames due to satellite movement in long-haul demonstrations. Conventionally, active feedback-based mechanisms are employed for real-time polarization tracking. Here, we propose and demonstrate an alternative approach via a proof-of-principle experiment over an in-lab entanglement-based (BBM92) protocol. In this approach, we perform a quantum state tomography to arrive at optimal measurement bases for any one party resulting in maximal (anti-)correlation in measurement outcomes of both parties. Our polarization-entangled bi-photons have 94% fidelity with a singlet state and a Concurrence of 0.92. By considering a representative 1 ns coincidence window span, we achieve a quantum-bit-error-rate (QBER) of approximate to 5%, and a key rate of approximate to 35 Kbps. The performance of our implementation is independent of any local polarization rotation. Finally, using optimization methods we achieve the best trade-off between the key rate, QBER, and balanced key symmetry. Our approach obviates the need for active polarization tracking. It is also applicable to such demonstrations with non-maximally entangled states and prepare-and-measure-based protocols with partially polarized single-photon sources.

TI Isolation of Single Donors in ZnO
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB The shallow donor in zinc oxide (ZnO) is a promising semiconductor spin qubit with optical access. Single indium donors are isolated in a commercial ZnO substrate using plasma focused ion beam (PFIB) milling. Quantum emitters are identified optically by spatial and frequency filtering. The indium donor assignment is based on the optical bound exciton transition energy and magnetic dependence. The emission stability of these single donors in terms of both intensity and frequency, alongside their transition linewidths less than twice the lifetime limit, highlight the promise of single In donors as optically accessible spin qubits. The optical stability of single donors after FIB fabrication is promising for optical device integration required for scalable quantum technologies based on single donors in direct band gap semiconductors.

TI Dynamically tunable long-range coupling enabled by bound state in the
   continuum
SO LIGHT-SCIENCE & APPLICATIONS
AB Formation and dynamic control of strong coupling among cavities are essential to realize advanced functional photonic and quantum circuits. Especially for cavities at distant distance or arbitrary locations. Conventional approaches suffer from short coupling distance, poor controllability, fixed locations and low wavelength uniformity, significantly restricting the scalability of photonic and quantum networks. Here, we exploit the intrinsic advantages of optical bound state in the continuum (BIC) and demonstrate an all-in-one solution for long-range coupled cavities. BIC metasurface can support a series of finite-sized quasi-BIC microlasers at arbitrary locations. The quasi-BICs microlasers have the same wavelength and are inherently connected through BIC metasurface. Consequently, the coupling distances in experiment increase significantly from subwavelength to tens of micrometers. Such long-range interaction in BIC metasurface enables scaling to two-dimensional architectures and ultrafast control of internal laser actions, e.g., non-Hermitian zero-mode lasing. This research shall facilitate the advancement of scalable and reconfigurable photonic networks.

TI Probing Bioinorganic Electron Spin Decoherence Mechanisms with an
   Fe2S2 Metalloprotein
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY B
AB Recent efforts have sought to develop paramagnetic molecular quantum bits (qubits) as a means to store and manipulate quantum information. Emerging structure-property relationships have shed light on electron spin decoherence mechanisms. While insights within molecular quantum information science have derived from synthetic systems, biomolecular platforms would allow for the study of decoherence phenomena in more complex chemical environments and further leverage molecular biology and protein engineering approaches. Here we have employed the exchange-coupled S-T = 1/2 Fe2S2 active site of putidaredoxin, an electron transfer metalloprotein, as a platform for fundamental mechanistic studies of electron spin decoherence toward spin-based biological quantum sensing. At low temperatures, decoherence rates were anisotropic, reflecting a hyperfine-dominated decoherence mechanism, standing in contrast to the anisotropy of molecular systems observed previously. This mechanism provided a pathway for probing spatial effects on decoherence, such as protein vs solvent contributions. Furthermore, we demonstrated spatial sensitivity to single point mutations via site-directed mutagenesis and temporal sensitivity for monitoring solvent isotope exchange. Thus, this study demonstrates a step toward the design and construction of biomolecular quantum sensors.

TI Demonstration of Algorithmic Quantum Speedup
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Despite the development of increasingly capable quantum computers, an experimental demonstration of a provable algorithmic quantum speedup employing today's non-fault-tolerant devices has remained elusive. Here, we unequivocally demonstrate such a speedup within the oracular model, quantified in terms of the scaling with the problem size of the time-to-solution metric. We implement the single-shot Bernstein-Vazirani algorithm, which solves the problem of identifying a hidden bitstring that changes after every oracle query, using two different 27-qubit IBM Quantum superconducting processors. The speedup is observed on only one of the two processors when the quantum computation is protected by dynamical decoupling but not without it. The quantum speedup reported here does not rely on any additional assumptions or complexity-theoretic conjectures and solves a bona fide computational problem in the setting of a game with an oracle and a verifier.

TI Spin-valley coupling in single-electron bilayer graphene quantum dots
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Understanding how the electron spin is coupled to orbital degrees of freedom, such as a valley degree of freedom in solid-state systems, is central to applications in spin-based electronics and quantum computation. Recent developments in the preparation of electrostatically-confined quantum dots in gapped bilayer graphene (BLG) enable to study the low-energy single-electron spectra in BLG quantum dots, which is crucial for potential spin and spin-valley qubit operations. Here, we present the observation of the spin-valley coupling in bilayer graphene quantum dots in the single-electron regime. By making use of highly-tunable double quantum dot devices we achieve an energy resolution allowing us to resolve the lifting of the fourfold spin and valley degeneracy by a Kane-Mele type spin-orbit coupling of approximate to 60 mu eV. Furthermore, we find an upper limit of a potentially disorder-induced mixing of the K and K' states below 20 mu eV.

TI Unlocking photon-magnon interplay via saturation magnetization
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB Photon-magnon hybrid systems present a promising platform for the development of next-generation devices in quantum information processing and quantum sensing technologies. In this study, we investigate the control of photon-magnon coupling (PMC) strength through systematic variation of the saturation magnetization (Ms) in a planar hexagonal-ring resonator integrated with a yttrium iron garnet (YIG) thin film configuration. Using full-wave numerical simulations in CST Microwave Studio, we demonstrate that tuning the Ms of the YIG film from 175 mT to 90 mT enables systematic control over the coupling strength across the 127-51 MHz range at room temperature. To explain the observed PMC dynamics, we develop a semiclassical analytical model based on electromagnetic theory, that accurately reproduces the observed coupling behavior, revealing the key role of spin density in mediating the light-matter interaction. The model is further extended to include the effects of variable magnon damping across different Ms values, enabling broader frequency control. These findings establish Ms as a key tuning parameter for tailoring PMC, with direct implications for the design of tunable hybrid systems for reconfigurable quantum devices.

TI Deterministic Constant-Depth Preparation of the AKLT State on a Quantum
   Processor Using Fusion Measurements
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB The ground state of the spin-1 Affleck, Kennedy, Lieb, and Tasaki (AKLT) model is a paradigmatic example of both a matrix product state and a symmetry-protected topological phase and additionally holds promise as a resource state for measurement-based quantum computation. Having a nonzero correlation length, the AKLT state cannot be exactly prepared by a constant-depth unitary circuit composed of local gates. In this work, we demonstrate that this no-go limit can be evaded by augmenting a constantdepth circuit with fusion measurements, such that the total preparation time is independent of system size and entirely deterministic. We elucidate our preparation scheme using the language of tensor networks and, furthermore, show that the Z2 x Z2 symmetry of the AKLT state directly affords this speed-up over previously known preparation methods. To demonstrate the practical advantage of measurement-assisted preparation on noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices, we carry out our protocol on an IBM Quantum processor. We measure both the string order and entanglement spectrum of prepared AKLT chains and, employing these as metrics, find improved results over the known (purely unitary) sequential preparation approach. We conclude with a demonstration of quantum teleportation using the AKLT state prepared by our measurement-assisted scheme. This work thus serves to provide an efficient strategy to prepare a specific resource in the form of the AKLT state and, more broadly, experimentally demonstrates the possibility for realizable improvement in state preparation afforded by measurement-based circuit depth reduction strategies on NISQ-era devices.

TI Noise-assisted purification of a single-photon source
SO OPTICA QUANTUM
AB Scalable quantum networks and photonic quantum technologies require single-photon sources with extremely high purity. In resonantly driven two-level systems typically employed in realizing such sources, photon purity is generally limited by multiphoton emission and residual laser scattering, traditionally treated as independent noise sources. Here, we reveal that residual laser scatter can be coherently engineered to interfere destructively with unwanted multiphoton emission, dramatically enhancing single-photon purity. Through theoretical modeling, we identify optimal excitation conditions where phase-sensitive interference harnesses noise to boost emission purity by several orders of magnitude without sacrificing brightness. These results introduce a new design paradigm for quantum light sources, where scattered light becomes a powerful resource for advancing scalable, high-purity single-photon generation in integrated photonic platforms.

TI Efficient DNA-Driven Nanocavities for Approaching Quasi-Deterministic
   Strong Coupling to a Few Fluorophores
SO ACS NANO
AB Strong coupling between light and matter is the foundation of promising quantum photonic devices such as deterministic single photon sources, single atom lasers, and photonic quantum gates, which consist of an atom and a photonic cavity. Unlike atom-based systems, a strong coupling unit based on an emitter-plasmonic nanocavity system has the potential to bring these devices to the microchip scale at ambient conditions. However, efficiently and precisely positioning a single or a few emitters into a plasmonic nanocavity is challenging. In addition, placing a strong coupling unit on a designated substrate location is a demanding task. Here, fluorophore-modified DNA strands are utilized to drive the formation of particle- on-film plasmonic nanocavities and simultaneously integrate the fluorophores into the high field region of the nanocavities. High cavity yield and fluorophore coupling yield are demonstrated. This method is then combined with e-beam lithography to position the strong coupling units on designated locations of a substrate. Furthermore, polariton energy under the detuning of fluorophore embedded nanocavities can fit into a model consisting of three sets of two-level systems, implying vibronic modes may be involved in the strong coupling. Our system makes strong coupling units more practical on the microchip scale and at ambient conditions and provides a stable platform for investigating fluorophore-plasmonic nanocavity interaction.

TI Quantum simulations of hadron dynamics in the Schwinger model using 112
   qubits
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
AB Hadron wave packets are prepared and time evolved in the Schwinger model using 112 qubits of IBM 's 133-qubit Heron quantum computer ibm_torino . The initialization of the hadron wave packet is performed in two steps. First, the vacuum is prepared across the whole lattice using the recently developed SC-ADAPT-VQE algorithm and workflow. SC-ADAPT-VQE is then extended to the preparation of localized states, and used to establish a hadron wave packet on top of the vacuum. This is done by adaptively constructing low -depth circuits that maximize the overlap with an adiabatically prepared hadron wave packet. Due to the localized nature of the wavepacket, these circuits can be determined on a sequence of small lattices using classical computers , and then robustly scaled to prepare wave packets on large lattices for simulations using quantum computers . Time evolution is implemented with a second -order Trotterization. To reduce both the required qubit connectivity and circuit depth, an approximate quasilocal interaction is introduced. This approximation is made possible by the emergence of confinement at long distances, and converges exponentially with increasing distance of the interactions. Using multiple errormitigation strategies, up to 14 Trotter steps of time evolution are performed, employing 13,858 two-qubit gates (with a CNOT depth of 370). The propagation of hadrons is clearly identified, with results that compare favorably with Matrix Product State simulations. Prospects for a near -term quantum advantage in simulations of hadron scattering are discussed.

TI Quantum Mimicry With Inorganic Chemistry
SO COMMENTS ON INORGANIC CHEMISTRY
AB Quantum objects, such as atoms, spins, and subatomic particles, haveunique physical properties that could be useful for many different applications, ranging from quantum information processing to magnetic resonance imaging. Molecular species also exhibit these quantum properties, and, importantly, these properties are fundamentally tunable by synthetic design, unlike ions isolated in a quadrupolar trap, for example. In this comment, we distill multiple, distinct, scientific efforts into an emergent field that is devoted to designing molecules that mimic the quantum properties of objects like trapped atoms or defects in solids. Mimicry is endemic in inorganic chemistry and featured heavily in the research interests of groups across the world. We describe this new field of using molecular inorganic chemistry to mimic the quantum properties (e.g. the lifetime of spin superpositions, or the resonant frequencies thereof) of other quantum objects as "quantum mimicry. " In this comment, we describe the philosophical design strategies and recent exciting results from the application of these strategies.

TI Noise-specific beating in the higher-level Ramsey curves of a transmon
   qubit
SO APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS
AB In the higher levels of superconducting transmon devices and more generally charge sensitive devices, T-2* measurements made in the presence of low-frequency time-correlated 1 / f charge noise and quasiparticle-induced parity flips can give an underestimation of the total dephasing time. The charge variations manifest as beating patterns observed in the overlay of several Ramsey fringe curves and are reproduced with a phenomenological Ramsey curve model, which accounts for the charge variations. T-2* dephasing times, which more accurately represent the total dephasing time, are obtained. The phenomenological model is compared with a Lindblad master equation model. Both models are found to be in agreement with one another and the experimental data. Finally, the phenomenological formulation enables a simple method in which the power spectral density for the low-frequency noise can be inferred from the overlay of several Ramsey curves.

TI Leggett-Garg-like Inequalities from a Correlation Matrix Construction
SO QUANTUM REPORTS
AB The Leggett-Garg Inequality (LGI) constrains, under certain fundamental assumptions, the correlations between measurements of a quantity Q at different times. Here, we analyze the LGI and propose similar but somewhat more elaborate inequalities, employing a technique that utilizes the mathematical properties of correlation matrices, which was recently proposed in the context of nonlocal correlations. We also find that this technique can be applied to inequalities that combine correlations between different times (as in LGI) and correlations between different locations (as in Bell inequalities). All the proposed bounds include additional correlations compared to the original ones and also lead to a particular form of complementarity. A possible experimental realization and some applications are briefly discussed.

TI Capacities of the covariant Pauli channel
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We study four well-known capacities of a two-parameter family of qubit Pauli channels. These are the channels that are covariant under the SO(2) group and contain the depolarizing channel as a special case. We find exact expressions for the classical capacity and entanglement-assisted capacities, and analytically determine the regions where the quantum capacity of the channel vanishes. We then use a flag extension to find upper bound for the quantum capacity and private capacity of these channels in the entire region of parameter space and also obtain the lower bound for the quantum capacity by calculating the single-shot quantum capacity numerically. In conjunction with previous results on depolarizing channels, our result is one step forward for determining the capacities of the full Pauli channel.

TI High-Yield Assembly of Plasmon-Coupled Nanodiamonds Using DNA Origami
   for Tuned Emission
SO SMALL STRUCTURES
AB Controlling the spatial arrangement of optically active elements is crucial for the advancement of engineered photonic systems. Color centers in nanodiamonds (NDs) offer unique advantages for quantum sensing and information processing; however, their integration into complex optical architectures is limited by challenges in precise and reproducible positioning, as well as efficient coupling. DNA origami provides an elegant solution, as demonstrated by recent studies that showcase the nanoscale positioning of fluorescent NDs and plasmonic gold nanoparticles (NPs). A scalable and robust method is presented for covalently functionalizing NDs with DNA, enabling a high-yield and spatially controlled assembly of diamond and gold NPs onto DNA origami. By precisely controlling the interparticle spacing, this approach reveals the distance-dependent modulation of a nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center photoluminescence (PL). These findings indicate selective plasmon-driven effects. This work overcomes key limitations in current nanodiamond assembly strategies and provides insights into engineering NV PL by plasmonic coupling. These advancements bring closer to quantum photonic and sensing applications.

TI Quick Quantum Steering: Overcoming Loss and Noise with Qudits
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW X
AB A primary requirement for a robust and unconditionally secure quantum network is the establishment of quantum nonlocal correlations over a realistic channel. While loophole-free tests of Bell nonlocality allow for entanglement certification in such a device-independent setting, they are extremely sensitive to loss and noise, which naturally arise in any practical communication scenario. Quantum steering relaxes the strict technological constraints of Bell nonlocality by reframing it in an asymmetric manner, with a trusted party only on one side. However, tests of quantum steering still require either extremely high-quality entanglement or very low loss. Here we introduce a test of quantum steering that harnesses the advantages of high-dimensional entanglement to be simultaneously noise robust and loss tolerant. Despite being constructed for qudits, our steering test is designed for single-detector measurements and is able to close the fair-sampling loophole in a time-efficient manner. We showcase the improvements over qubit-based systems by experimentally demonstrating quantum steering in up to 53 dimensions, free of the fair-sampling loophole, through simultaneous loss and noise conditions corresponding to 14.2-dB loss equivalent to 79 km of telecommunication fiber, and 36% of white noise. We go on to show how the use of high dimensions counterintuitively leads to a dramatic reduction in total measurement time, enabling a quantum steering violation almost 2 orders of magnitude faster obtained by simply doubling the Hilbert space dimension. Our work conclusively demonstrates the significant resource advantages that high-dimensional entanglement provides for quantum steering in terms of loss, noise, and measurement time, and opens the door toward practical quantum networks with the ultimate form of security.

TI Spatial, spin, and charge symmetry projections for a Fermi-Hubbard model
   on a quantum computer
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We propose an extended version of the symmetry-adapted variational-quantum-eigensolver (VQE) and apply it to a two-component Fermi-Hubbard model on a bipartite lattice. In the extended symmetry-adapted VQE method, the Rayleigh quotient for the Hamiltonian and a parametrized quantum state in a properly chosen subspace is minimized within the subspace and is optimized among the variational parameters implemented on a quantum circuit to obtain variationally the ground state and the ground-state energy. The corresponding energy derivative with respect to a variational parameter is expressed as a Hellmann-Feynman-type formula of a generalized eigenvalue problem in the subspace, which thus allows us to use the parameter-shift rules for its evaluation. The natural-gradient-descent method is also generalized to optimize variational parameters in a quantum-subspace-expansion approach. As a subspace for approximating the ground state of the Hamiltonian, we consider a Krylov subspace generated by the Hamiltonian and a symmetry-projected variational state, and therefore the approximated ground state can restore the Hamiltonian symmetry that is broken in the parametrized variational state prepared on a quantum circuit. We show that spatial symmetry operations for fermions in an occupation basis can be expressed as a product of the nearest-neighbor fermionic SWAP operations on a quantum circuit. We also describe how the spin and charge symmetry operations, i.e., rotations, can be implemented on a quantum circuit. By numerical simulations, we demonstrate that the spatial, spin, and charge symmetry projections can improve the accuracy of the parametrized variational state, which can be further improved systematically by expanding the Krylov subspace without increasing the number of variational parameters.

TI An advanced quantum support vector machine for power quality disturbance
   detection and identification
SO EPJ QUANTUM TECHNOLOGY
AB Quantum algorithms have demonstrated extraordinary potential across numerous fields, offering significant advantages in solving practical problems. Power Quality Disturbances (PQDs) have always been a critical factor affecting the stability and safety of electrical power systems, and accurately detecting and identifying PQDs is crucial for ensuring reliable system operation. This paper explores the application of quantum algorithms in the field of power quality and proposes a novel method using Quantum Support Vector Machines (QSVM) to detect and identify PQDs, which marks the first application of QSVM in PQD analysis. The QSVM model employed involves three main stages: quantum feature mapping, quantum kernel computation, and model training. Quantum feature mapping uses quantum circuits to map classical data into a high-dimensional Hilbert space, enhancing feature separability. Quantum kernel computation calculates the inner products between features for model training. Rigorous theoretical and experimental analyses validate our approach. This method achieves a time complexity of O(N2log(N))\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$O(N<^>{2} \log (N))$\end{document}, superior to classical SVM algorithms. Simulation results show high accuracy in PQDs detection, achieving a 100% detection rate and a 96.25% accuracy rate in single PQD identification. Experimental outcomes demonstrate robustness, maintaining over 87% accuracy even with increased noise levels, confirming its effectiveness in PQDs detection and identification.

TI Toward Designing High-Speed Cost-Efficient Quantum Reversible Carry
   Select Adders
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON EMERGING TOPICS IN COMPUTING
AB Compared to classical computing implementations, reversible arithmetic adders offer a valuable platform for implementing quantum computation models in digital systems and specific applications, such as cryptography and natural language processing. Reversible logic efficiently prevents energy wastage through thermal dissipation. This study presents a comprehensive exploration introducing new carry-select adders (CSLA) based on quantum and reversible logic. Five reversible CSLA designs are proposed and compared, evaluating various criteria, including speed, quantum cost, and area, compared to previously published schemes. These comparative metrics are formulated for arbitrary n-bit size blocks. Each design type is described generically, capable of implementing carry-select adders of any size. As the best outcome, this study proposes an optimized reversible adder circuit that addresses quantum propagation delay, achieving an acceptable trade-off with quantum cost compared to its counterparts. This article reduces calculation delay by 66%, 73%, 82%, and 87% for 16, 32, 64, and 128 bits, respectively, while maintaining a lower quantum cost in all cases.

TI Holographic Storage of Ultrafast Photonic Qubit in Molecules
SO ADVANCED PHOTONICS RESEARCH
AB Herein, it is demonstrated that ultrashort spatially structured beams can sculpt a sample of gas-phase molecules like a 4D material to produce a spatial pattern of aligned molecules whose shape and temporal evolution allow to restore the spatial light information on a time-delayed reading pulse. To do so, the spatial phase and amplitude information of ultrashort light beams are encoded into rotational coherences of molecules by exploiting the interplay between spin angular momentum and orbital angular momentum. The field-free molecular alignment resulting from the interaction leads to an inhomogeneous spatial structuring of the sample allowing to transfer the encoded information into a time-delayed probe beam. The demonstration is conducted in CO2$\left(\text{CO}\right)_{2}$ molecules. Besides applications in terms of THz bandwidth buffer memory, the strategy features interesting prospects for establishing versatile optical processing of orbital angular momentum (OAM) fields, for studying various molecular processes, or for designing new photonic devices enabling to impart superpositions of OAM modes to light beams.

TI Adiabatic elimination for composite open quantum systems: Reduced-model
   formulation and numerical simulations
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB A numerical method is proposed for simulation of composite open quantum systems. It is based on Lindblad master equations and adiabatic elimination. Each subsystem is assumed to converge exponentially towards a stationary subspace, slightly impacted by some decoherence channels and weakly coupled to the other subsystems. This numerical method is based on a perturbation analysis with an asymptotic expansion. It exploits the formulation of the slow dynamics with reduced dimension. It relies on the invariant operators of the local and nominal dissipative dynamics attached to each subsystem. Second-order expansion can be computed only with local numerical calculations. It avoids computations on the tensor-product Hilbert space attached to the full system. This numerical method is particularly well suited for autonomous quantum error correction schemes. Simulations of such reduced models agree with complete full model simulations for typical gates acting on one and two cat qubits (Z, ZZ, and CNOT) when the mean photon number of each cat qubit is less than eight. For larger mean photon numbers and gates with three cat qubits (ZZZ and CCNOT), full model simulations are almost impossible whereas reduced model simulations remain accessible. In particular, one observes numerically the simultaneous capture of the dominant phase-flip error rate and of the very small bit-flip error rate with its exponential suppression versus the mean photon number.

TI Relating Measurement Patterns to Circuits via Pauli Flow
SO ELECTRONIC PROCEEDINGS IN THEORETICAL COMPUTER SCIENCE
CT 18th International Conference on Quantum Physics and Logic
CY JUN 07-11, 2021
CL POLAND
AB The one-way model of Measurement-Based Quantum Computing and the gate-based circuit model give two different presentations of how quantum computation can be performed. There are known methods for converting any gate-based quantum circuit into a one-way computation, whereas the reverse is only efficient given some constraints on the structure of the measurement pattern. Causal flow and generalised flow have already been shown as sufficient, with efficient algorithms for identi-fying these properties and performing the circuit extraction. Pauli flow is a weaker set of conditions that extends generalised flow to use the knowledge that some vertices are measured in a Pauli basis. In this paper, we show that Pauli flow can similarly be identified efficiently and that any measurement pattern whose underlying graph admits a Pauli flow can be efficiently transformed into a gate-based circuit without using ancilla qubits. We then use this relationship to derive simulation results for the effects of graph-theoretic rewrites in the ZX-calculus using a more circuit-like data structure we call the Pauli Dependency DAG.

TI Quantum-assisted Hilbert-space Gaussian process regression
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Gaussian processes are probabilistic models that are commonly used as functional priors in machine learning. Due to their probabilistic nature, they can be used to capture prior information on the statistics of noise, smoothness of the functions, and training data uncertainty. However, their computational complexity quickly becomes intractable as the size of the data set grows. We propose a Hilbert-space approximation-based quantum algorithm for Gaussian process regression to overcome this limitation. Our method consists of a combination of classical basis function expansion with quantum computing techniques of quantum principal component analysis, conditional rotations, and Hadamard and SWAP tests. The quantum principal component analysis is used to estimate the eigenvalues, while the conditional rotations and the Hadamard and SWAP tests are employed to evaluate the posterior mean and variance of the Gaussian process. Our method provides polynomial computational complexity reduction over the classical method.

TI Determining Ground-State Phase Diagrams on Quantum Computers via a
   Generalized Application of Adiabatic State Preparation
SO SYMMETRY-BASEL
AB Quantum phase transitions materialize as level crossings in the ground-state energy when the parameters of the Hamiltonian are varied. The resulting ground-state phase diagrams are straightforward to determine by exact diagonalization on classical computers, but are challenging on quantum computers because of the accuracy needed and the near degeneracy of the competing states close to the level crossings. On the other hand, classical computers are limited to small system sizes, which quantum computers may help overcome. In this work, we use a local adiabatic ramp for state preparation to allow us to directly compute ground-state phase diagrams on a quantum computer via time evolution. This methodology is illustrated by examining the ground states of the XY model with a magnetic field in the z-direction in one dimension. We are able to calculate an accurate phase diagram on both two- and three-site systems using IBM quantum machines.

TI Applying quantum approximate optimization to the heterogeneous vehicle
   routing problem
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Quantum computing offers new heuristics for combinatorial problems. With small- and intermediate-scale quantum devices becoming available, it is possible to implement and test these heuristics on small-size problems. A candidate for such combinatorial problems is the heterogeneous vehicle routing problem (HVRP): the problem of finding the optimal set of routes, given a heterogeneous fleet of vehicles with varying loading capacities, to deliver goods to a given set of customers. In this work, we investigate the potential use of a quantum computer to find approximate solutions to the HVRP using the quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA). For this purpose we formulate a mapping of the HVRP to an Ising Hamiltonian and simulate the algorithm on problem instances of up to 21 qubits. We show that the number of qubits needed for this mapping scales quadratically with the number of customers. We compare the performance of different classical optimizers in the QAOA for varying problem size of the HVRP, finding a trade-off between optimizer performance and runtime.

TI Ergodiscord: An operational and distinct notion of quantumness of
   correlations
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Nonclassicality in composite quantum systems depicts several puzzling manifestations, with Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen entanglement, Schr & ouml;dinger steering, and Bell nonlocality being the most celebrated ones. In addition to those, an unentangled quantum state can also exhibit nonclassicality, as evidenced from notions such as quantum discord and work deficit. In this paper, we present a general framework for exploring quantumness of correlations in multipartite quantum states. By exploiting the different signatures reflected on observable quantities depending on whether subsystems of a composite system are probed jointly or independently, we introduce an operational quantifier of nonclassicality, termed ergodiscord. As we show, this proposed quantifier faithfully captures nonclassicality in any bipartite quantum state while being fundamentally distinct from the original quantum discord. Moreover, ergodiscord uncovers an intriguing phenomenon called nonlocal energy locking, where a useful form of energy (i.e., work) gets locked in correlations of nonclassical states. We also show that a mixed nonclassical state can lock more work than the maximally entangled state of the corresponding system, establishing an interesting superadditivity phenomenon of nonlocal energy locking. This paper may inspire designs of quantum energy storage devices by utilizing nonclassical correlations in composite quantum systems.

TI Highly 28Si enriched silicon by localised focused ion beam
   implantation
SO COMMUNICATIONS MATERIALS
AB Solid-state spin qubits within silicon crystals at mK temperatures show great promise in the realisation of a fully scalable quantum computation platform. Qubit coherence times are limited in natural silicon owing to coupling to the Si-29 isotope which has a non-zero nuclear spin. This work presents a method for the depletion of Si-29 in localised volumes of natural silicon wafers by irradiation using a 45 keV Si-28 focused ion beam with fluences above 1 x 10(19) ions cm(-2). Nanoscale secondary ion mass spectrometry analysis of the irradiated volumes shows residual Si-29 concentration down to 2.3 +/- 0.7 ppm and with residual C and O comparable to the background concentration in the unimplanted wafer. After annealing, transmission electron microscopy lattice images confirm the solid phase epitaxial re-crystallization of the as-implanted amorphous enriched volume extending over 200 nm in depth.

TI Nonlinear-linear duality for multipath quantum interference
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB In quantum optics, the postselection amplitude of a nondegenerate parametric down-conversion (PDC) process is linked to a beamsplitter (BS) via partial time reversal, up to a normalization coefficient which is related to the parametric gain [Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 117, 33107 (2020)]. A special example where the gain is low is reminiscent of Klyshko's advanced-wave picture in quantum imaging. Here we propose and prove a generalized duality for multiple spatial paths connecting a quantum nonlinear interference setup consisting of nondegenerate PDCs and linear optical systems to a linear one, where the PDCs are directly replaced by hypothetical wavelength-shifting BSs. This replacement preserves the geometry of the original setup, and cascaded PDCs become optical cavities whose calculation involves the Redheffer star product. Additional terms in the normalization coefficient are related to the contribution of looping photons inside the cavities. Then we discuss the case of coherent state input and postselection for Q-function calculation. This theorem will be helpful in the development of quantum photonic devices beyond the low-gain limit.

TI Plug-and-play generation of non-Gaussian states of light at a telecom

SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB In the context of emerging quantum technologies, this work marks an important progress towards practical quantum optical systems in the continuous variable regime. It shows the feasibility of experiments where non-Gaussian state generation entirely relies on plug-and-play components from guided-wave optics technologies. This strategy is successfully demonstrated with the heralded preparation of low amplitude Schrodinger cat states via single-photon subtraction from a squeezed vacuum. All stages of the experiment are based on off-the-shelf fiber components. This leads to a stable, compact, and easily re-configurable realization, fully compatible with existing fiber networks and, more in general, with future out-of-the-laboratory applications.

TI Cooper-pair condensates with nonclassical long-range order on quantum
   devices
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB An important problem in quantum information is the practical demonstration of nonclassical long-range order on quantum computers. One of the best known examples of a quantum system with nonclassical long-range order is a superconductor. Here we achieve Cooper-like pairing of qubits on a quantum computer, which can be interpreted as superconducting or superfluid states via a Jordan-Wigner mapping. We rigorously confirm the quantum long-range order by measuring the large O(N) eigenvalue of the two-electron reduced density matrix. The demonstration of maximal quantum long-range order is an important step toward more complex modeling of phenomena with significant quantum long-range order on quantum computers such as superconductivity and superfluidity.

TI Quantum-data-driven dynamical transition in quantum learning
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Quantum neural networks, parameterized quantum circuits optimized under a specific cost function, provide a paradigm for achieving near-term quantum advantage in quantum information processing. Understanding QNN training dynamics is crucial for optimizing their performance. However, the role of quantum data in training for supervised learning such as classification and regression remains unclear. We reveal a quantum-data-driven dynamical transition where the target values and data determine the convergence of the training. Through analytical classification over the fixed points of the dynamical equation, we reveal a comprehensive 'phase diagram' featuring seven distinct dynamics originating from a bifurcation with multiple codimension. Perturbative analyses identify both exponential and polynomial convergence classes. We provide a non-perturbative theory to explain the transition via generalized restricted Haar ensemble. The analytical results are confirmed with numerical simulations and experimentation on IBM quantum devices. Our findings provide guidance on constructing the cost function to accelerate convergence in QNN training.

TI Complex Dynamics of a Cournot Quantum Duopoly Game with Memory and
   Heterogeneous Players
SO ENTROPY
AB Previous authors tend to consider a certain range of values of the parameters involved in a game, not taking into account other possible values. In this article, a quantum dynamical Cournot duopoly game with memory and heterogeneous players (one of them is boundedly rational and the other one, a naive player) is studied, where the quantum entanglement can be greater than one and the speed of adjustment can be negative. In this context, we analyzed the behavior of the local stability and the profit in those values. Considering the local stability, it is observed that the stability region increases in the model with memory regardless of whether the quantum entanglement is greater than one or whether the speed of adjustment is negative. However, it is also shown that the stability is greater in the negative than in the positive zone of the speed of adjustment and, therefore, it improves the results obtained in previous experiments. This increase of stability enables higher values of speed of adjustment and, as a result of that, the system reaches the stability faster, resulting in a remarkable economic advantage. Regarding the behavior of the profit with these parameters, the principal effect shown is that the application of memory causes a certain delay in the dynamics. Through this article, all these statements are analytically proved and widely supported with several numerical simulations, using different values of the memory factor, the quantum entanglement, and the speed of adjustment of the boundedly rational player.

TI Photoluminescence lifetime engineering via organic resonant films with
   molecular aggregates
SO NANOPHOTONICS
AB Manipulating the spontaneous emission rate of fluorophores is vital in creating bright incoherent illumination for optical sensing and imaging, as well as fast single-photon sources for quantum technology applications. This can be done via increasing the Purcell effect by using non-monolithic optical nanocavities; however, achieving the desired performance is challenging due to difficulties in fabrication, precise positioning, and frequency tuning of cavity-emitter coupling. Here, we demonstrate a simple approach to achieve a wavelength-dependent photoluminescence (PL) lifetime modification using monolithic organic molecular aggregates films. These single monolithic organic films are designed to have a Lorentzian dispersion, including epsilon-near-zero (ENZ) and epsilon-near-pole (ENP) spectral regions with increased and decreased photonic density of states, respectively. This dispersion leads to enhanced and depressed PL decay rates at different wavelengths. Both time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) and fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) measurements are implemented to verify the validity of this approach. This approach offers a promising way to design dual-functional optical sources for a variety of applications, including bioimaging, sensing, data communications, and quantum photonics applications.

AB Fixed-frequency transmon quantum computers (QCs) have advanced in coherence times, addressability, and gate fidelities. Unfortunately, these devices are restricted by the number of on-chip qubits, capping processing power and slowing progress toward fault-tolerance. Although emerging transmon devices feature over 100 qubits, building QCs large enough for meaningful demonstrations of quantum advantage requires overcoming many design challenges. For example, today's transmon qubits suffer from significant variation due to limited precision in fabrication. As a result, barring significant improvements in current fabrication techniques, scaling QCs by building ever larger individual chips with more qubits is hampered by device variation. Severe device variation that degrades QC performance is referred to as a defect. Here, we focus on a specific defect known as a frequency collision.
   When transmon frequencies collide, their difference falls within a range that limits two-qubit gate fidelity. Frequency collisions occur with greater probability on larger QCs, causing collision-free yields to decline as the number of on-chip qubits increases. As a solution, we propose exploiting the higher yields associated with smaller QCs by integrating quantum chiplets within quantum multi-chip modules (MCMs). Yield, gate performance, and application-based analysis show the feasibility of QC scaling through modularity. Our results demonstrate that chiplet architectures, relative to monolithic designs, benefit from average yield improvements ranging from 9.6 - 92.6 x for less than or similar to 500 qubit machines. In addition, our simulations explore the design space of chiplet systems and discover configurations that demonstrate average two-qubit gate infidelity reductions that are at best 0.815 x their monolithic counterpart. Finally, we observe that carefully-selected modular systems achieve fidelity improvements on a range of benchmark circuits.

TI Two-photon driven Kerr quantum oscillator with multiple spectral
   degeneracies
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Kerr nonlinear oscillators driven by a two-photon process are promising systems to encode quantum infor-mation and to ensure a hardware-efficient scaling towards fault-tolerant quantum computation. In this paper, we show that an extra control parameter, the detuning of the two-photon drive with respect to the oscillator resonance, plays a crucial role in the properties of the defined qubit. At specific values of this detuning, we benefit from strong symmetries in the system, leading to multiple degeneracies in the spectrum of the effective confinement Hamiltonian. Overall, these degeneracies lead to a stronger suppression of bit-flip errors. We also study the combination of such Hamiltonian confinement with colored dissipation to suppress leakage outside of the bosonic code space. We show that the additional degeneracies allow us to perform fast and high-fidelity gates while preserving a strong suppression of bit-flip errors.

TI Temporal filtering characteristics of gated InGaAs/InP single-photon
   detectors for coincidence measurement
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB Semiconductor single-photon avalanche detectors (SPADs) have played an important role in practical quantum communication technology due to their advantages of small size, low cost and easy operation. Among them, InGaAs/InP SPADs have been widely used in fiber-optic quantum key distribution systems due to their response wavelength range in a near-infrared optical communication band. In order to avoid the influence of dark count and afterpulsing on single photon detection, the gated quenching technologies are widely applied to the InGaAs/InP SPADs. Typically, the duration of gate pulse is set to be as short as a few nanoseconds or even less. As the detection of the arrival of single photons depends on the coincidence between the arrival time of gate pulse and the arrival time of photon, the gate pulse duration of the InGaAs/InP SPADs inevitably affects the effective detection of the single photons. Without the influence of dispersion, the temporal width of the transmitted photons is usually on the order of picoseconds or even less, which is much shorter than the gate width of the InGaAs/InP SPAD. Therefore, the gate width normally has no influence on the temporal measurement of the detected photons. However, in quantum systems involving large dispersion, such as the long-distance fiber-optic quantum communication system, the temporal width of the transmitted photons is significantly broadened by the experienced dispersion so that it may approach to or even exceed the gate width of the single-photon detector. As a result, the effect of the gate width on the recording of the arrival time of the dispersed photons should be taken into account. In this paper, the influence of the gate width coupled to the InGaAs/InP single photon detectors on the measurement of the two-photon coincidence time width is studied both theoretically and experimentally. The theoretical analysis and experimental results are in good agreement with each other, showing that the finally measured coincidence time width of the two-photon state after dispersion is not more than half of the effective gate pulses width. The maximum observable coincidence time width based on the gated single photon detector is fundamentally limited by the gate width, which restricts its applications in quantum information processing based on the two-photon temporal correlation measurement.

TI Quantum Simulation of SU(3) Lattice Yang-Mills Theory at Leading Order
   in Large-Nc Expansion
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Quantum simulations of the dynamics of QCD have been limited by the complexities of mapping the continuous gauge fields onto quantum computers. By parametrizing the gauge invariant Hilbert space in terms of plaquette degrees of freedom, we show how the Hilbert space and interactions can be expanded in inverse powers of Nc. At leading order in this expansion, the Hamiltonian simplifies dramatically, both in the required size of the Hilbert space as well as the type of interactions involved. Adding a truncation of the resulting Hilbert space in terms of local energy states we give explicit constructions that allow simple representations of SU(3) gauge fields on qubits and qutrits. This formulation allows a simulation of the real time dynamics of a SU(3) lattice gauge theory on a 5 x 5 and 8 x 8 lattice on ibm_torino with a CNOT depth of 113.

TI Energy transfer between localized emitters in photonic cavities from
   first principles
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Radiative and nonradiative resonant couplings between defects are ubiquitous phenomena in photonic devices used in classical and quantum information technology applications. In this work, we present a first-principles approach to enable quantitative predictions of the energy transfer between defects in photonic cavities, beyond the dipole-dipole approximation and including the many-body nature of the electronic states. As an example, we discuss the energy transfer from a dipolelike emitter to an F center in MgO in a spherical cavity. We show that the cavity can be used to controllably enhance or suppress specific spin-flip and spin-conserving transitions. Specifically, we predict that an 10-100 enhancement in the resonant energy transfer rate can be gained in the case of the F center in MgO at 10 nm distances from a dipolar source, using rather moderate cavity with quality factor Q 400. We also show that a similar suppression in the transfer rate can be achieved by offtuning the cavity resonance relative to the emitter transition energy. The framework presented here is general and readily applicable to a wide range of devices where localized emitters are embedded in microspheres, core-shell nanoparticles, and dielectric Mie resonators. Hence, our approach paves the way to predict how to control energy transfer in quantum memories and in ultrahigh-density optical memories, and in a variety of quantum information platforms.

TI Exact quantum speed limits
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB The traditional quantum speed limits are not attainable for many physical processes, as they tend to be loose and fail to determine the exact time taken by quantum systems to evolve. To address this we derive exact quantum speed limits for the unitary dynamics of pure-state quantum systems that outperform the existing quantum speed limits. Using these exact quantum speed limits, we can precisely estimate the evolution time for two- and higher-dimensional quantum systems. Additionally, for both finite- and infinite-dimensional quantum systems, we derive an improved Mandelstam-Tamm bound for pure states and show that this bound always saturates for any unitary generated by self-inverse Hamiltonians. Furthermore, we show that our speed limits establish an upper bound on the quantum computational circuit complexity and yield a tighter quantum Cram & eacute;r-Rao bound. These results will have a significant impact on our understanding of quantum physics as well as rapidly developing quantum technologies, such as quantum computing, quantum control, and quantum batteries.

TI Laser-induced thermal source for cold atoms
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB We demonstrate a simple and compact approach to laser cool and trap atoms based on laser-induced thermal ablation (LITA) of a pure solid granule. A rapid thermalisation of the granule leads to a fast recovery of the ultra-high vacuum condition required for a long trapping lifetime of the cold gas. We give a proof-of-concept of the technique, performing a magneto-optical trap on the 461 nm S-1(0) -> P-1(1) transition of strontium. We get up to 3.5 million of cold strontium-88 atoms with a trapping lifetime of more than 4 s. The lifetime is limited by the pressure of the strontium-free residual background vapour. We also implement an original configuration of permanent magnets to create the quadruple magnetic field of the magneto-optical trap. The LITA technique can be generalized to other atomic elements such as transition metals and lanthanide atoms, and shows a strong potential for applications in quantum technologies ranging from quantum computing to precision measurements such as outdoor inertial sensing.

TI Clifford Group and Unitary Designs under Symmetry
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB We have generalized the well-known statement that the Clifford group isa unitary 3-design into symmetric cases by extending the notion of unitary design. Concretely, we have proven that a symmetric Clifford group is a symmetric unitary 3-design if and only if the symmetry constraint is described by some Pauli subgroup. We have also found a complete and unique construction method of symmetric Clifford groups with simple quantum gates for Pauli symmetries. For the overall understanding, we have also considered physically relevant U(1) and SU(2) symmetry constraints, which cannot be described by a Pauli subgroup, and have proven that the symmetric Clifford group is a symmetric unitary 1-design but not a 2-design under those symmetries. Our findings are numerically verified by computing the frame potentials, which measure the difference in randomness between the uniform ensemble on the symmetric group of interest and the symmetric unitary group. This work will open a new perspective into quantum information processing, such as randomized benchmarking, and give a deep understanding to many-body systems, such as monitored random circuits.

TI Electric Quadrupole Transitions from Ground State to Metastable State of
   117Yb+ Ions
SO ACTA OPTICA SINICA
AB Objective Due to long coherence time and exceptional controllability, trapped-ion systems have become a fundamental experimental platform for frontier research fields, including large-scale quantum computing, high-precision atomic clocks, and weak force measurements. Among the various ions suitable for experimental research, Yb-117(+) has gained significant attention in recent years due to its nonzero nuclear spin and complex electronic structure of the excited states, which give rise to a rich energy level spectrum. A detailed investigation of its level structure deepens the understanding of its transition mechanisms. In particular, its long-lived metastable states serve as ideal reference for clock transitions and enable qubit encoding. The electric quadrupole (E2) transition between the ground and metastable states is more complex than electric dipole transitions, as it is influenced by the polarization and external magnetic field geometry. Consequently, a comprehensive study of E2 transitions in Yb-117(+) not only provides crucial experimental guidance for optimizing energy-level selection and transition efficiency in high-precision optical clocks but also expands precision measurement techniques based on quadrupole transitions. These techniques can be applied to probing potential variations in fundamental physical constants in fundamental physics. Moreover, the long-lived metastable states and multi-level structure of Yb-117(+) hold significant potential for quantum information processing. In contrast to standard qubit encoding that relies on two-level systems, utilizing the metastable states allows for qudit encoding, thereby enhancing storage capacity and computational efficiency in quantum computing. Additionally, the dependence of E2 transitions on light field polarization can be exploited to engineer highly controllable photon-atom interactions, which enables the simulation of topological phases and non-Hermitian quantum systems. Methods We investigate the E2 transition of Yb-117(+) ions through theoretical analysis and experimental measurements. Theoretically, we construct a Hamiltonian incorporating multipole interactions and apply the Wigner-Eckart theorem to derive E2 transition matrix elements, which enables the calculation of transition strength coefficients from the ground to the metastable state. Experimentally, a single Yb-117(+) ion is confined in a linear Paul trap with four gold-plated ceramic blade electrodes. A combination of radiofrequency (RF) and direct current (DC) fields generates a stable three-dimensional trapping potential. Three pairs of Helmholtz coils provide a controlled magnetic field along orthogonal directions, calibrated via Zeeman splitting of the S-2(1/2) state. The experiment is controlled using the advanced real-time infrastructure for quantum physics (ARTIQ), which precisely regulates acousto-optic modulators (AOMs) and microwave channels. The experimental sequence consists of four stages: Doppler cooling, state preparation, E2 transition manipulation, and state detection. The ion is cooled to the Doppler limit with a 369.5 nm laser and initialized to the S-2(1/2) F = 0 . The E2 transition is then driven by a single-frequency 435.5 nm laser, whose frequency is precisely tuned via AOM control. A 369.5 nm laser is used to perform fluorescence detection on the S-2(1/2) F = 1 , and the population distribution is statistically analyzed.
   By scanning the laser frequency, Zeeman sublevels of D-2(3/2) are selectively excited, which enables the measurement of their Zeeman splitting. To examine geometric effects on the E2 transition, we vary the laser polarization angle relative to the magnetic field while keeping the field and laser propagation directions fixed. This allows precise measurement of the coupling strength variation in the S-2(1/2)-> D-2(3/2) transition, providing insights into the role of geometric factors. To further enhance spectral resolution and improve experimental measurement precision, we employ the Pound-Drever-Hall (PDH) stabilization technique to frequency-lock the 435.5 nm laser. Results and Discussions We calculate the energy level structure of the ytterbium ion below 60000 cm(-1,) including the even-parity levels 4f(14)6s, 4f(14)5d, 4f(13)6s6p, and 4f(13)5d6p, as well as the odd-parity levels 4f(13)6s(2), 4f146p, 4f(13)5d6s, and 4f(13)5d(2), covering electronic configurations of 6s-4f-5d-6p (Fig. 1). By constructing the multipole interaction Hamiltonian between the ion and the optical field, we derive the matrix elements for the E2 transition and calculate the relative strength coefficients for transitions from the ground state to metastable states in 171 Yb+ (Table 1). Experimentally, we utilize 435.5 nm laser light to realize transitions from S-2(1/2) to D-2(3/2) in a 171 Yb+ ion. By adjusting the angle cent between the laser polarization vector and the projection of the magnetic field on the wavefront plane of laser while keeping the field direction and laser propagation axis fixed, we further investigate the variation of the E2 transition coupling strength between F = 1 state and D-2(3/2) F = 2,M = -/+ 1. As cent increases from 0 degrees to 90 degrees , fluorescence intensity exhibits a decreasing trend, which indicates that the E2 coupling strength for the S-2(1/2)-> D-2(3/2) transition gradually weakens [Fig. 4(d)]. This trend is consistent with theoretical calculations, which predicts that xi(+/- 1) ( 90 degrees, 0 degrees )> xi(+/- 1) ( 90 degrees, 45 degrees )> xi(+/- 1) ( 90 degrees, 90 degrees )= 0. By changing the magnetic field direction, specific level transitions can be selectively coupled [Figs. 4(c) and 5(c)]. Furthermore, by employing the PDH stabilization technique, we achieve a linewidth of the observed fluorescence peak on the order of kHz [Fig. 5(d)]. In this condition, the measurement precision of Zeeman splitting is increased by three times compared to the wavelength-meter-based stabilization results shown in Fig. 4. Our study systematically reveals the critical role of geometric factors in determining the E2 transition coupling strength, thereby providing experimental evidence for precise control of transition selectivity. Conclusions We systematically investigate the energy level structure of the 171 Yb+ ion, including excited states spanning the 6s-4f-5d-6p shells and their common hyperfine levels. Based on angular momentum theory, the E2 transition matrix elements are derived, with their explicit forms given by Wigner 3-j and 6-j symbols. The transition strength coefficients from the ground state to the metastable state of the 171 Yb+ ion are also calculated.
   Experimental results on the E2 transition from the S-2(1/2) to the D-2(3/2) state of the(117)Yb(+) ion show that transition occurs only under specific magnetic field directions and the laser polarization configurations at the resonant frequency. We lay the foundation for precise control of electric quadrupole transitions between the magnetic sublevels of the ground and metastable states and provide an experimental basis for further advancements in quantum information processing and quantum simulation research.

TI Magneto-optical imaging of coherent spin dynamics in ferrites
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB The explosive development of quantum magnonics is associated with the possibility of its use as macroscopic quantum systems. In particular, they can find an application for quantum computing processors and other devices. The recently discovered phenomenon of magnon Bose-Einstein condensation and coherent precession of magnetization can be used for these purposes. Our letter describes a method for the optical observation of the coherently precessing magnetization in conditions when the concentration of magnons reaches the value necessary for their quantum condensation. The investigations were conducted in the out-of-plane magnetized yttrium iron garnet films. The required magnon density was achieved by magnetic resonance technique. The magneto-optical imaging method provides such important parameters of the coherent spin dynamics as the amplitude and phase distributed all over the sample. It should become an indispensable read-out tool for the upcoming quantum technologies based on the magnon Bose-Einstein condensation.

TI Quantum resetting in continuous measurement induced dynamics of a qubit
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS A-MATHEMATICAL AND THEORETICAL
AB We study the evolution of a two-state system that is monitored continuously but with interactions with the detector tuned so as to avoid the Zeno affect. The system is allowed to interact with a sequence of prepared probes. The post-interaction probe states are measured and this leads to a stochastic evolution of the system's state vector, which can be described by a single angle variable. The system's effective evolution consists of a deterministic drift and a stochastic resetting to a fixed state at a rate that depends on the instantaneous state vector. The detector readout is a counting process. We obtain analytic results for the distribution of number of detector events and the time-evolution of the probability distribution. Earlier work on this model found transitions in the form of the steady state on increasing the measurement rate. Here we study transitions seen in the dynamics. As a spin-off we obtain, for a general stochastic resetting process with diffusion, drift and position dependent jump rates, an exact and general solution for the evolution of the probability distribution.

TI Efficient nonlinear witnessing of non-absolutely separable states with
   lossy detectors
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Entangled states are undoubtedly an integral part of various quantum information processing tasks. On the other hand, absolutely separable states which cannot be made entangled under any global unitary operations are useless from the resource theoretic perspective, and hence, identifying non-absolutely separable states can be an important issue for designing quantum technologies. Here we report that nonlinear witness operators provide significant improvements in detecting non-absolutely separable states over their linear analogs, by invoking examples of states in various dimensions. We also address the problem of closing the detection loophole and we find the critical efficiency of detectors above which no fake detection of non-absolutely separable (non- absolutely positive partial transposed) states is possible.

TI Gaussian Elimination versus Greedy Methods for the Synthesis of Linear
   Reversible Circuits
SO ACM TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM COMPUTING
AB Linear reversible circuits represent a subclass of reversible circuits with many applications in quantum computing. These circuits can be efficiently simulated by classical computers and their size is polynomially bounded by the number of qubits, making them a good candidate to deploy efficient methods to reduce computational costs. We propose a new algorithm for synthesizing any linear reversible operator by using an optimized version of the Gaussian elimination algorithm coupled with a tuned LU factorization. We also improve the scalability of purely greedy methods. Overall, on random operators, our algorithms improve the state-of-the-art methods for specific ranges of problem sizes: The custom Gaussian elimination algorithm provides the best results for large problem sizes (n > 150), while the purely greedy methods provide quasi optimal results when n < 30. On a benchmark of reversible functions, we manage to significantly reduce the CNOT count and the depth of the circuit while keeping other metrics of importance (T-count, T-depth) as low as possible.

TI Structured volume-law entanglement in an interacting, monitored Majorana
   spin liquid
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Monitored quantum circuits allow for unprecedented dynamical control of many-body entanglement. Here we show that random, measurement-only circuits, implementing the competition of bond and plaquette couplings of the Kitaev honeycomb model, give rise to a structured volume-law entangled phase with subleading L ln L liquid scaling behavior. This interacting Majorana liquid takes up a highly symmetric, spherical parameter space within the entanglement phase diagram obtained when varying the relative coupling probabilities. The sphere itself is a critical boundary with quantum Lifshitz scaling separating the volume-law phase from proximate area-law phases, a color code or a toric code. An exception is a set of tricritical, self-dual points exhibiting effective (1+1)d conformal scaling at which the volume-law phase and both area-law phases meet. From a quantum information perspective, our results define error thresholds for the color code in the presence of projective error and stochastic syndrome measurements.

TI Optimal control for state preparation in two-qubit open quantum systems
   driven by coherent and incoherent controls via GRAPE approach
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MODERN PHYSICS A
AB In this work, we consider a model of two qubits driven by coherent and incoherent time-dependent controls. The dynamics of the system is governed by a Gorini- Kossakowski-Sudarshan-Lindblad master equation, where coherent control enters into the Hamiltonian and incoherent control enters into both the Hamiltonian (via Lamb shift) and the dissipative superoperator. We consider two physically different classes of interaction with coherent control and study the optimal control problem of state preparation formulated as minimization of the Hilbert-Schmidt distance's square between the final density matrix and a given target density matrix at some fixed target time.Taking into account that incoherent control by its physical meaning is a non-negative function of time, we derive an analytical expression for the gradient of the objective and develop optimization approaches based on adaptation for this problem of GRadient Ascent Pulse Engineering (GRAPE). We study evolution of the von Neumann entropy, purity, and one-qubit reduced density matrices under optimized controls and observe a significantly different behavior of GRAPE optimization for the two classes of interaction with coherent control in the Hamiltonian.

TI Quantum Methods for Neural Networks and Application to Medical Image
   Classification
SO QUANTUM
AB Quantum machine learning techniques have been proposed as a way to potentially enhance performance in machine learn-ing applications. In this paper, we intro-duce two new quantum methods for neural networks. The first method is quantum -assisted neural networks, where a quan-tum computer is used to perform inner product estimation for inference and train-ing of classical neural networks. The sec-ond is a quantum orthogonal neural net-work, which is based on a quantum pyra-midal circuit as the building block for im-plementing orthogonal matrix multiplica-tion. We provide an efficient way for train-ing such orthogonal neural networks; novel algorithms are detailed for both classical and quantum hardware, where both are proven to scale asymptotically better than previously known training algorithms. Extensive experiments applied to medi-cal image classification tasks using current state of the art quantum hardware are presented, where different quantum meth-ods are compared with classical ones, on both real quantum hardware and simula-tors. Our results show that the proposed quantum networks generate similar level of accuracy compared with classical neu-ral networks while demonstrating compet-itive scalability, supporting the promise that quantum methods can be useful in solving visual tasks, given the advent of better quantum hardware.

TI CGHS Black Hole Analog Moving Mirror and Its Relativistic Quantum
   Information as Radiation Reaction
SO ENTROPY
AB The Callan-Giddings-Harvey-Strominger black hole has a spectrum and temperature that correspond to an accelerated reflecting boundary condition in flat spacetime. The beta coefficients are identical to a moving mirror model, where the acceleration is exponential in laboratory time. The center of the black hole is modeled by the perfectly reflecting regularity condition that red-shifts the field modes, which is the source of the particle creation. In addition to computing the energy flux, we find the corresponding moving mirror parameter associated with the black hole mass and the cosmological constant in the gravitational analog system. Generalized to any mirror trajectory, we derive the self-force (Lorentz-Abraham-Dirac), consistently, expressing it and the Larmor power in connection with entanglement entropy, inviting an interpretation of acceleration radiation in terms of information flow. The mirror self-force and radiative power are applied to the particular CGHS black hole analog moving mirror, which reveals the physics of information at the horizon during asymptotic approach to thermal equilibrium.

TI Versatile Chip-Scale Platform for High-Rate Entanglement Generation
   Using an AlGaAs Microresonator Array
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Integrated photonic microresonators have become an essential resource for generating photonic qubits for quantum information processing, entanglement distribution and networking, and quantum communications. The pair-generation rate is enhanced by reducing the microresonator radius, but this comes at the cost of increasing the frequency-mode spacing and reducing the quantum information spectral density. Here, we circumvent this rate-density trade-off in an AlGaAs-on-insulator photonic device by multiplexing an array of 20 small-radius microresonators, each producing a 650-GHz-spaced comb of time-energy entangled-photon pairs. The resonators can be independently tuned via integrated thermooptic heaters, enabling control of the mode spacing from degeneracy up to a full free spectral range. We demonstrate simultaneous pumping of five resonators with up to 50-GHz relative comb offsets, where each resonator produces pairs exhibiting time-energy entanglement visibilities up to 95%, coincidence- to-accidental ratios exceeding 5000, and an on-chip pair rate up to 2.6 GHz/mW2 per comb line-an improvement over prior work by more than a factor of 40. As a demonstration, we generate frequency-bin qubits in a maximally entangled two-qubit Bell state with fidelity exceeding 87% (90% with background correction) and detected frequency-bin entanglement rates up to 7 kHz (an approximately 70 MHz on-chip pair rate) using a pump power of approximately 250 mu W. Multiplexing small-radius microresonators combines the key capabilities required for programmable and dense photonic qubit encoding while retaining high pair-generation rates, heralded single-photon purity, and entanglement fidelity.

TI Stability of a two-electron system under pressure confinement:
   structural and quantum information theoretical analysis
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS B-ATOMIC MOLECULAR AND OPTICAL PHYSICS
AB The stability of a two-electron Zee system trapped inside an impenetrable spherical cavity is analyzed using an explicitly correlated multi-exponent Hylleraas-type basis set in the framework of the Ritz variational method. The wave function is considered to be consistent with Dirichlet's boundary condition. Four different Z is an element of [1, (Z(c))(b), 0.25, 0.0] values are considered, where (Z(c))(b) denotes the critical nuclear charge beyond which the system is embedded in a discrete positive energy continuum due to the impenetrable nature of the cavity. The energy contribution due to the total correlation (in the presence of both radial and angular correlation) effect, the radial correlation limit, and the angular correlation limit are also studied in detail. The thermodynamic pressure felt by the two-electron Zee system inside the cavity is estimated, and a formula replicating the behavior between the pressure and volume of the cavity is deduced by a fitting procedure. Different geometrical properties, e.g. radial moments (< r(1)(p)>, < r(1)r(2 >), < r(12)(p)>, < r(<)>, < r(>)>; p = 1 -3), angular moments (< cos theta(1 >), < cos theta(12)>), and related important physical quantities, are determined. The variation of Kirkwood and Buckingham polarizabilities w.r.t. the pressure felt by the two-electron Zee system is analyzed. A one-electron radial density is estimated for each pair of (Z, R), which has been employed to generate the electrostatic potential as well as different information theoretical measures like Shannon entropy, Fisher entropy, Renyi entropy, Tsallis entropy, and Onicescu informational energy. The chosen information theoretical measures have been found to be sensitive tools for describing changes in the electronic structure due to spatial confinement. An interesting interplay between the electronic and nuclear contribution to the classical electrostatic potential is observed, leading to a shift in the position of its characteristic minimum due to compression. Wherever possible, a comparison is made in order to ascertain the high accuracy of our numerical results. The procedure of analytic evaluation of the integrals needed to estimate the atomic properties under consideration is discussed in detail.

TI The role of data embedding in equivariant quantum convolutional neural
   networks
SO QUANTUM MACHINE INTELLIGENCE
AB Geometric deep learning refers to the scenario in which the symmetries of a dataset are used to constrain the parameter space of a neural network and thus, improve their trainability and generalization. Recently, this idea has been incorporated into the field of quantum machine learning, which has given rise to equivariant quantum neural networks (EQNNs). In this work, we investigate the role of classical-to-quantum embedding on the performance of equivariant quantum convolutional neural networks (EQCNNs) for the classification of images. We discuss the connection between the data embedding method and the resulting representation of a symmetry group and analyze how changing representation affects the expressibility of an EQCNN. We numerically compare the classification accuracy of EQCNNs with three different basis-permuted amplitude embeddings to the one obtained from a non-equivariant quantum convolutional neural network (QCNN). Our results show a clear dependence of classification accuracy on the underlying embedding, especially for initial training iterations. The improvement in classification accuracy of EQCNN over non-equivariant QCNN may be present or absent depending on the particular embedding and dataset used. The noisy simulation using simple noise models shows that certain EQCNNs are more robust to noise than non-equivariant QCNNs. It is expected that the results of this work can be useful to the community for a better understanding of the importance of data embedding choice in the context of geometric quantum machine learning.

TI Quantum Simulation Study of Ultrascaled Label-Free DNA Sensors Based on
   Sub-10 nm Dielectric-Modulated TMD FETs: Sensitivity Enhancement Through
   Downscaling
SO MICROMACHINES
AB In this article, the role of downscaling in boosting the sensitivity of a novel label-free DNA sensor based on sub-10 nm dielectric-modulated transition metal dichalcogenide field-effect transistors (DM-TMD FET) is presented through a quantum simulation approach. The computational method is based on self-consistently solving the quantum transport equation coupled with electrostatics under ballistic transport conditions. The concept of dielectric modulation was employed as a label-free biosensing mechanism for detecting neutral DNA molecules. The computational investigation is exhaustive, encompassing the band profile, charge density, current spectrum, local density of states, drain current, threshold voltage behavior, sensitivity, and subthreshold swing. Four TMD materials were considered as the channel material, namely, MoS2, MoSe2, MoTe2, and WS2. The investigation of the scaling capability of the proposed label-free gate-all-around DM-TMDFET-based biosensor showed that gate downscaling is a valuable approach not only for producing small biosensors but also for obtaining high biosensing performance. Furthermore, we found that reducing the device size from 12 nm to 9 nm yields only a moderate improvement in sensitivity, whereas a more aggressive downscaling to 6 nm leads to a significant enhancement in sensitivity, primarily due to pronounced short-channel effects. The obtained results have significant technological implications, showing that miniaturization enhances the sensitivity of the proposed nanobiosensor.

AB Providing strong security margins against cryptanalytic attackers equipped with quantum computers is a major research direction fostered by the US National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Post-quantum Cryptography Standardization process. Among the viable candidates, code-based asymmetric cryptosystems are one of the prominent approaches. In this work, we propose the first fully detailed quantum circuit to compute the solution to the Information Set Decoding problem, the main cryptanalytic tool against such cryptosystems. We evaluate the cryptanalytic effort with our circuit design on actual parameters from cryptosystems admitted to the final stage of the NIST standardization process and compare it with the previous conservative asymptotic estimates. We show that the actual computational effort of our solution is smaller than the one estimated via asymptotics by a factor of 24. We also perform a comparison of our results with the quantum-computational effort of breaking the AES cipher, following the guidelines of the US NIST in evaluating the security of the ciphers. To do this, we translate our design on gates of the Clifford+T gate set only, one of the most promising candidate for fault-tolerant quantum computation, and report that the parameter choices for Classic McEliece and BIKE, two candidates admitted to the final round of the NIST standardization process provide an adequate security margin with respect to our ISD solution technique.

TI Quantum Information Orbitals (QIO): Unveiling Intrinsic Many-Body
   Complexity by Compressing Single-Body Triviality
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY LETTERS
AB The simultaneous treatment of static and dynamic correlations in strongly correlated electron systems is a critical challenge. In particular, finding a universal scheme for identifying a single-particle orbital basis that minimizes the representational complexity of the many-body wave function is a formidable and longstanding problem. As a contribution toward its solution, we show that the total orbital correlation actually reveals and quantifies the intrinsic complexity of the wave function, once it is minimized via orbital rotations. To demonstrate the power of this concept in practice, an iterative scheme is proposed to optimize the orbitals by minimizing the total orbital correlation calculated by the tailored coupled cluster singles and doubles (TCCSD) ansatz. The optimized orbitals enable the limited TCCSD ansatz to capture more nontrivial information on the many-body wave function, indicated by the improved wave function and energy. An initial application of this scheme shows great improvement of TCCSD in predicting the singlet ground state potential energy curves of the strongly correlated C-2 and Cr-2 molecule.

TI Revealing the finite-frequency response of a bosonic quantum impurity
SO SCIPOST PHYSICS
AB Quantum impurities are ubiquitous in condensed matter physics and constitute the most stripped-down realization of many-body problems. While measuring their finitefrequency response could give access to key characteristics such as excitations spectra or dynamical properties, this goal has remained elusive despite over two decades of studies in nanoelectronic quantum dots. Conflicting experimental constraints of very strong coupling and large measurement bandwidths must be met simultaneously. We get around this problem using cQED tools, and build a precisely characterized quantum simulator of the boundary sine-Gordon model, a non-trivial bosonic impurity problem. We succeeded to fully map out the finite frequency linear response of this system. Its reactive part evidences a strong renormalisation of the nonlinearity at the boundary in agreement with non-perturbative calculations. Its dissipative part reveals a striking many-body broadening caused by multi-photon conversion. The experimental results are matched quantitatively to a perturbative calculation based on a microscopically calibrated model. Furthermore, we push the device into a regime where perturbative calculations break down, which calls for more advanced theoretical tools to model many-body quantum circuits. We also critically examine the technological limitations of cQED platforms to reach universal scaling laws. This work opens exciting perspectives for the future such as quantifying quantum entanglement in the vicinity of a quantum critical point or accessing the dynamical properties of non-trivial many-body problems.

TI Dynamic-threshold-based pre-relaying for enhanced key allocation in
   quantum-secured networks
SO JOURNAL OF OPTICAL COMMUNICATIONS AND NETWORKING
AB Quantum key distribution (QKD) is experiencing a rapid increase of interest due to its security advantages in the face of quantum computers. However, typical QKD deployments are point-to-point and limited in terms of distance, which significantly restricts their utilization for end-user applications. To overcome these restrictions, trusted relays are adopted as intermediate nodes to allow the transition to QKD networks (QKDNs), where one of the hallmarks is the key management system. In this work, we investigate different key allocation strategies as a method to enhance the performance of key management systems in QKDN from the perspective of key allocation success rate and key delivery delay. We first describe an upgrade model from classical to QKDN at three distinct network layers-quantum, key management, and service. Then, we propose a novel, to our knowledge, key allocation strategy leveraging the benefits of key storage and relaying as a solution to improve the QKDN performance. To achieve this, our method makes use of end-to-end virtual quantum key pools (VQKPs) implemented between non-adjacent nodes requesting key material. We introduce static and dynamic upper and lower threshold limits at the VQKP level, with the dynamic thresholds adapted according to application demand, to control the key distribution in the network and fill the pools ahead of end-user requests. We demonstrate through simulations that the introduction of thresholds achieves performance enhancement and explain the trade-off between the key allocation success rate and key delivery delay evaluation metrics in comparison with different on-demand key allocation strategies.

TI A Comparative Study of Post-Quantum Cryptosystems for Internet-of-Things
   Applications
SO SENSORS
AB The existence of quantum computers and Shor's algorithm poses an imminent threat to classical public-key cryptosystems. These cryptosystems are currently used for the exchange of keys between servers and clients over the Internet. The Internet of Things (IoT) is the next step in the evolution of the Internet, and it involves the connection of millions of low-powered and resource-constrained devices to the network. Because quantum computers are becoming more capable, the creation of a new cryptographic standard that cannot be compromised by them is indispensable. There are several current proposals of quantum-resistant or post-quantum algorithms that are being considered for future standards. Given that the IoT is increasing in popularity, and given its resource-constrained nature, it is worth adapting those new standards to IoT devices. In this work, we study some post-quantum cryptosystems that could be suitable for IoT devices, adapting them to work with current cryptography and communication software, and conduct a performance measurement on them, obtaining guidelines for selecting the best for different applications in resource-constrained hardware. Our results show that many of these algorithms can be efficiently executed in current IoT hardware, providing adequate protection from the attacks that quantum computers will eventually be capable of.

TI Solar Irradiance Forecasting Using a Hybrid Quantum Neural Network: A
   Comparison on GPU-Based Workflow Development Platforms
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Modern renewable power operations can be enhanced by integrating deep neural networks, particularly for forecasting solar irradiance. Recent advancements in quantum computing have shown potential improvements in classical deep neural networks. However, current challenges with quantum hardware, such as susceptibility to noise and decoherence, pose risks to its practicality. Hybrid quantum neural networks (HQNNs) are found to mitigate these issues, especially when integrated with graphics processing unit (GPU)-based pipelines. This paper presents a comparative study of different software platforms for developing HQNNs, using multi-location very short-term solar irradiance forecasting as an example. A classical benchmark model is initially designed based on statistical analysis of a 10-minute resolution solar irradiance dataset, with its parameters further optimized using Bayesian Optimization. The experimental design of this paper includes a loss comparison between classical neural networks and HQNNs across different seasons and a performance comparison between Pennylane, Torchquantum, and CUDA Quantum (CUDA-Q) as HQNN development platforms. Experimental results show that HQNNs achieve up to a 92.30% improvement in testing loss compared to classical neural networks. Regarding HQNN development platforms, Pennylane shows an 81.54% testing loss reduction from classical models, Torchquantum shows a 90.34% improvement, and CUDA-Q shows a 92.30% improvement in testing loss. Implementing hardware acceleration libraries for GPU-based state vector simulation demonstrates an approximate 275% speedup in average latency per epoch, a 218% speedup in inference time, and a 10.20% improvement in testing loss compared to CPU-based simulations. CUDA-Q achieves a training time 2.7 times shorter and an inference time 2.9 times shorter compared to Pennylane, while it is 32.3 times faster in training and 31 times faster in inference compared to Torchquantum.

TI Triphasic circularly polarized luminescence switch quantum simulation of
   a topologically chiral catenane
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY C
AB The realm of molecular topology has witnessed a profound paradigm shift with the emergence of chiral catenanes, and their interactions with circularly polarized light are opening new perspectives in the study of chirality. Recently, the first mechanically interlocked platform based on catenane architecture acting as a multi-sequence switch of circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) was expertly designed. This unique chiral luminophore offered us the opportunity to survey the connection between the topological features and its chiral emission properties. In these terms, a theoretical DFT protocol for this CPL spectral prediction is urgent. Herein, we present a robust but accessible computational workflow able to accurately predict a triple-responsive CPL switch (on, off, and boosted signals). Taking advantage of a preliminary DFT benchmark, we decided to use the LC-wHBPE functional to realize a conformational analysis of the pyrene excimer installed in the catenane structure (for the three switchable forms) in the first excited state by means of Born-Oppenheimer molecular dynamics. Consequently, an exhaustive TD-DFT treatment demonstrated the PW6B95D3/6-311G(d,p) level to be the most valuable method to capture skillfully both the band positions and intensities for the on, off and enhanced CPL outputs generated by the interlaced molecular system.

TI Multivariate bicycle codes
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Quantum error correction suppresses noise in quantum systems to allow for high-precision computations. In this Letter, we introduce multivariate bicycle quantum low-density parity-check (QLDPC) codes, via an extension of the framework developed by Bravyi et al. [S. Bravyi, A. W. Cross, J. M. Gambetta, D. Maslov, P. Rall, and T. J. Yoder, Nature (London) 627, 778 (2024)], and particularly focus on trivariate bicycle (TB) codes. Unlike the weight-6 codes proposed in their study, we offer concrete examples of weight-5 TB-QLDPC codes which promise to be more amenable to near-term experimental setups. We show that TB-QLDPC codes up to weight 6 have a biplanar structure and often possess a two-dimensional toric layout. Under circuit level noise, we find substantially better encoding rates than comparable surface codes while offering similar error suppression capabilities. For example, we can encode four logical qubits with distance 5 into 60 physical qubits using weight-5 check measurements of circuit depth 7, while a surface code with these parameters requires 200 physical qubits. The high encoding rate and compact layout make our codes highly suitable candidates for near-term hardware implementations, paving the way for a realizable quantum error correction protocol.

AB Integrated quantum photonics is rapidly emerging as a transformative platform for realizing scalable, chip-based quantum technologies, from secure communication to advanced sensing and computing. At the heart of this revolution are solid-state quantum emitters: atom-like light sources embedded in a variety of host materials that enable single-photon generation, quantum interference, and spin-photon coupling. We begin by discussing quantum emitters across bulk crystals, van der Waals materials, and chemically synthesized nanostructures, highlighting their performance trade-offs and integration potential. We then examine nanophotonic cavities that enhance the light-matter interaction, from photonic crystals to metasurfaces and Moir & eacute; resonators. Next, we discuss fabrication techniques with sub-10 nm precision, including material-specific etching strategies and hybrid integration schemes. Finally, we address emerging approaches for deterministic placement, cavity tuning, and on-chip scalability. By bringing together insights from materials science, nanofabrication, and quantum optics, this Review provides a comprehensive perspective on the design and integration of high-performance quantum emitters for scalable photonic platforms.

TI Readout error mitigated quantum state tomography tested on
   superconducting qubits
SO COMMUNICATIONS PHYSICS
AB Quantum technologies rely heavily on accurate control and reliable readout of quantum systems. Current experiments are limited by numerous sources of noise that can only be partially captured by simple analytical models and additional characterization of the noise sources is required. We test the ability of readout error mitigation to correct noise found in systems composed of quantum two-level objects (qubits). To probe the limit of such methods, we designed a beyond-classical readout error mitigation protocol based on quantum state tomography (QST), which estimates the density matrix of a quantum system, and quantum detector tomography (QDT), which characterizes the measurement procedure. By treating readout error mitigation in the context of state tomography the method becomes largely readout mode-, architecture-, noise source-, and quantum state-independent. We implement this method on a superconducting qubit and evaluate the increase in reconstruction fidelity for QST. We characterize the performance of the method by varying important noise sources, such as suboptimal readout signal amplification, insufficient resonator photon population, off-resonant qubit drive, and effectively shortened T1 and T2 coherence. As a result, we identified noise sources for which readout error mitigation worked well, and observed decreases in readout infidelity by a factor of up to 30.
   Significant efforts have been dedicated to mitigate gate errors in quantum devices, while comparatively little attention has been given to the increasing issue of readout errors. The authors present an explicit protocol for comprehensive readout error mitigation with quantum state tomography, and demonstrate its applicability experimentally on a superconducting qubit device.

TI Deterministic optimal quantum cloning via a quantum-optical neural
   network
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Quantum machine learning represents a promising approach to disclose novel possibilities for quantum information protocols. Thus, recent efforts have been dedicated to determine how to merge, or extend, machine learning approaches in the quantum domain. A relevant example is provided by a quantum-optical neural network (QONN), a class of physical systems that aim to represent the quantum-optical version of classical neural networks. This architecture was first introduced to identify the structure of optical circuits in analogy to their classical counterpart, showing the possibility of tackling different quantum tasks. However, the full potential of such an approach still needs to be explored. In this work, we provide a step forward in this direction by employing it to tackle the fundamental task of optical quantum cloning. The employed architecture has been successfully trained to perform deterministic universal quantum cloning on a photonic platform, achieving results that are very close to that of an optimal universal quantum cloner. Furthermore, we have verified numerically the robustness of this approach with respect to experimental imperfections relevant for future implementations. This work thus shows the capabilities and flexibility of QONNs, which might prove important for designing even more complex optical circuits.

TI Generation and characterization of ultrabroadband polarization-frequency
   hyperentangled photons
SO OPTICS LETTERS
AB We generate ultrabroadband photon pairs entangled in both polarization and frequency bins through an all-waveguided Sagnac source covering the entire optical C-and L-bands (1530-1625 nm). We perform comprehensive characterization of high-fidelity states in multiple dense wavelength -division multiplexed channels, achieving full tomography of effective four-qubit systems. Additionally, leveraging the inherent high dimensionality of frequency encoding and our electro-optic measurement approach, we demonstrate the scalability of our system to higher dimensions, reconstruct-ing states in a 36-dimensional Hilbert space consisting of two polarization qubits and two frequency-bin qutrits. Our findings hold potential significance for quantum networking, particularly dense coding and entanglement distillation in wavelength-multiplexed quantum networks.(c) 2023 Optica Publishing Group

TI Non-unitary Trotter circuits for imaginary time evolution
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB We propose an imaginary time equivalent of the well-established Pauli gadget primitive for Trotter-decomposed real time evolution, using mid-circuit measurements on a single ancilla qubit. Imaginary time evolution (ITE) is widely used for obtaining the ground state (GS) of a system on classical hardware, computing thermal averages, and as a component of quantum algorithms that perform non-unitary evolution. Near-term implementations on quantum hardware rely on heuristics, compromising their accuracy. As a result, there is growing interest in the development of more natively quantum algorithms. Since it is not possible to implement a non-unitary gate deterministically, we resort to the implementation of probabilistic ITE (PITE) algorithms, which rely on a unitary quantum circuit to simulate a block encoding of the ITE operator-that is, they rely on successful ancillary measurements to evolve the system non-unitarily. Compared with previous PITE proposals, the suggested block encoding in this paper results in shorter circuits and is simpler to implement, requiring only a slight modification of the Pauli gadget primitive. This scheme was tested on the transverse Ising model and the fermionic Hubbard model and is demonstrated to converge to the GS of the system.

TI Low-overhead fault-tolerant error correction scheme based on quantum
   stabilizer codes
SO CHINESE PHYSICS B
AB Fault-tolerant error-correction (FTEC) circuit is the foundation for achieving reliable quantum computation and remote communication. However, designing a fault-tolerant error correction scheme with a solid error-correction ability and low overhead remains a significant challenge. In this paper, a low-overhead fault-tolerant error correction scheme is proposed for quantum communication systems. Firstly, syndrome ancillas are prepared into Bell states to detect errors caused by channel noise. We propose a detection approach that reduces the propagation path of quantum gate fault and reduces the circuit depth by splitting the stabilizer generator into X-type and Z-type. Additionally, a syndrome extraction circuit is equipped with two flag qubits to detect quantum gate faults, which may also introduce errors into the code block during the error detection process. Finally, analytical results are provided to demonstrate the fault-tolerant performance of the proposed FTEC scheme with the lower overhead of the ancillary qubits and circuit depth.

TI (Almost-)Quantum Bell Inequalities and Device- Independent Applications
SO QUANTUM
AB Investigations of the boundary of the quantum correlation set have gained increased attention in recent years. This is done through the derivation of quantum Bell inequalities, which are related to Tsirelson's problem and have significant applications in device-independent (DI) information processing. However, determining quantum Bell inequalities is a notoriously difficult task and only isolated examples are known. In this paper, we present families of (almost- )quantum Bell inequalities and highlight four foundational and DI applications. Firstly, it is known that quantum correlations on the non-signaling boundary are of crucial importance in the task of DI randomness extraction from weak sources. In the practical Bell scenario of two players with two k-outcome measurements, we derive quantum Bell inequalities that demonstrate a separation between the quantum boundary and certain portions of the boundaries of the no-signaling polytope of dimension up to 4k-8, -8, extending previous results from nonlocality distillation and the collapse of communication complexity. Secondly as an immediate by-product, we give a general proof of Aumann's Agreement theorem for quantum systems as well as the almost-quantum correlations, which implies Aumann's agreement theorem is a reasonable physical principle in the context of epistemics to pick out both quantum theory and almost-quantum correlations from general no-signaling theories. Thirdly, we present a family of quantum Bell inequalities in the two players with m binary measurements scenarios, that we prove serve to self-test the two-qubit singlet and the corresponding 2m measurements. Interestingly, this claim generalizes the result for m = 2 discovered by Tsirelson-Landau-Masanes and shows an improvement over the state-of-the-art Device-Independent Randomness-Amplification (DIRA). Lastly, we use our quantum Bell inequalities to derive the general form of the principle of no advantage in nonlocal computation, which is an information-theoretic principle that serves to characterize the quantum correlation set.

TI Integrated photonic platform with high-speed entanglement generation and
   witnessing
SO OPTICA
AB High-speed generation and efficient entanglement detection on a photonic chip are essential for quantum information applications but hard to achieve due to common photonic chips' material properties and limited component performance. In this work, we experimentally demonstrate an entanglement witness on a silicon photonic chip, with multi-rail single-photon entanglement generation based on decoy-state techniques. The detection is based on balanced homodyne detectors on the same photonic chip with a bandwidth of up to 12.5 GHz, which allows room-temperature operation. A loss-equivalent analysis method compensates for optical losses and system noises. Experimental results quantify an entangled state fidelity of 92% in quantum state tomography and a Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt violation lower bound of 2.59. These results establish a viable path toward fully integrated, high-bandwidth, room-temperature quantum photonic systems, with potential applications in on-chip quantum optics and quantum random number generation.

TI Plasmonically engineered nitrogen-vacancy spin readout
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Ultra -precise readout of single nitrogen -vacancy (NV) spins holds promise for major advancements in quantum sensing, computing, and communication technologies. Here we present a rigorous open quantum theory capable of simultaneously capturing the optical, vibronic, and spin interactions of the negatively charged NV center, both in the presence and absence of plasmonic interaction. Our theory is verified against existing experiments in the literature. We predict orders of magnitude brightness and contrast enhancements in optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) and NV spin qubit readout arising from plasmonic interaction. Such optimal enhancements occur in carefully engineered parameter regions, necessitating rigorous modelling prior to experimentation. Our theory equips the community with a tool to identify such regions. (c) 2024 Optica Publishing Group under the terms of the Optica Open Access Publishing Agreement

TI Indistinguishable single photons from nanowire quantum dots in the
   telecom O-band
SO APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS
AB On-demand single-photon sources operating at telecom wavelengths are crucial for quantum communication and photonic quantum technologies. In this work, we demonstrate high-purity, indistinguishable single-photon generation in the telecom O-band from an InAsP/InP nanowire quantum dot. We measured a single-photon purity of g(2) ( 0 ) = 0.006 +/- 0.003 under above-band excitation. Furthermore, we characterize two-photon interference via Hong-Ou-Mandel measurements and achieve a photon indistinguishability of 81.1 % +/- 3.7 % with a temporal postselection of a 300 ps time window and 5.6 % +/- 1.5 % without temporal postselection. We estimate a first-lens source efficiency of similar to 28 % . These results highlight the potential of nanowire quantum dots as a promising source of telecom single photons for photonic quantum applications, offering deterministic positioning, efficient photon extraction, and scalable production.

The relational holism of Divine entanglement helps clarify how deep incarnation is possible. The pandemic is then approached as an example of evolutionary theodicy that can be addressed through such entangled deep incarnation. This in turn provides the basis for deep resurrection, which, while acknowledging suffering and death in the natural world, also affirms hope and life in Christ.

TI Stacking classical-quantum hybrid learning approach for corrosion
   inhibition efficiency of N-heterocyclic compounds
SO RESULTS IN SURFACES AND INTERFACES
AB This study introduces the stacking classical-quantum model (SCQM) as a novel approach to predicting N-heterocyclic compounds' corrosion inhibition efficiency (CIE). SCQM integrates classical models such as Multi-Layer Perceptron Neural Network (MLPNN) and Random Forest (RF) as base learners, with Quantum Neural Network (QNN) as the meta-learner. Experimental results demonstrate SCQM's superior performance with a coefficient of determination (R2) value of 0.98 and root mean squared error (RMSE) of 0.92, outperforming classical models. Predictions of new derivatives PP1 and PP2 yielded CIE values of 95.39% and 94.05%, aligning with experimental results. The novelty lies in the hybrid framework's ability to leverage quantum feature maps, offering a groundbreaking method to explore anti-corrosion materials through quantum machine learning (QML).

TI Quantum solvability of noisy linear problems by divide-and-conquer
   strategy
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Noisy linear problems have been studied in various science and engineering disciplines. A class of `hard' noisy linear problems can be formulated as follows: Given a matrix A and a vector b constructed using a finite set of samples, a hidden vector or structure involved in b is obtained by solving a noise-corrupted linear equation Ax approximate to b + eta, where eta is a noise vector that cannot be identified. For solving such a noisy linear problem, we consider a quantum algorithm based on a divide-and-conquer strategy, wherein a large core process is divided into smaller subprocesses. The algorithm appropriately reduces both the computational complexities and size of a quantum sample. More specifically, if a quantum computer can access a particular reduced form of the quantum samples, polynomial quantum-sample and time complexities are achieved in the main computation. The size of a quantum sample and its executing system can be reduced, e.g., from exponential to sub-exponential with respect to the problem length, which is better than other results we are aware. We analyse the noise model conditions for such a quantum advantage, and show when the divide-and-conquer strategy can be beneficial for quantum noisy linear problems.

Our numerical results showed an increase in the accuracy of the location of the predicted particles occurring in the position space. Also, our results show that the sum of the position and momentum entropies satisfies the lower-bound Berkner, Bialynicki-Birula, and Mycieslki inequality and Fisher information was also satisfied for the different eigenstates.

AB Particle identification (PID) is one of the most fundamental tools in various physics research conducted in collider experiments. In recent years, machine learning methods have gradually become one of the mainstream methods in the PID field of high-energy physics experiments, often providing superior performance. The emergence of quantum machine learning may potential arm a powerful new toolbox for machine learning. In this work, targeting at the pi(+/-)/K-+/- discrimination problem at the STCF experiment, a convolutional neural network (CNN) in the endcap PID system is developed. By combining the hit position and arrival time of each Cherenkov photon at the sensors, a two-dimensional pixel map is constructed as the CNN input. The preliminary results show that the CNN model has a promising performance. In addition, based on the classical CNN, a quantum convolution neural network (QCNN) is developed as well, exploring possible quantum advantages provided by quantum machine learning methods.

TI High-dimensional entanglement witnessed by correlations in arbitrary
   bases
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Certifying entanglement is an important step in the development of many quantum technologies, especially for higher-dimensional systems, where entanglement promises increased capabilities for quantum communication and computation. A key feature distinguishing entanglement from classical correlations is the occurrence of correlations for complementary measurement bases. In particular, mutually unbiased bases (MUBs) are a paradigmatic example that is well-understood and routinely employed for entanglement certification. However, implementing unbiased measurements exactly is challenging and not generically possible for all physical platforms. Here, we extend the entanglement-certification toolbox from correlations in MUBs to arbitrary bases. This practically significant simplification paves the way for efficient characterizations of high-dimensional entanglement in a wide range of physical systems. Furthermore, we introduce a simple three-MUBs construction for all dimensions without using the Wootters-Fields construction, potentially simplifying experimental requirements when measurements in more than two MUBs are needed, especially in high-dimensional settings.

TI High-efficiency entanglement of microwave fields in cavity
   opto-magnomechanical systems
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB We demonstrate a scheme to realize high-efficiency entanglement of two microwave fields in a dual opto-magnomechanical system. The magnon mode simultaneously couples with the microwave cavity mode and phonon mode via magnetic dipole interaction and magnetostrictive interaction, respectively. Meanwhile, the phonon mode couples with the optical cavity mode via radiation pressure. Each magnon mode and optical cavity mode adopts a strong red detuning driving field to activate the beam splitter interaction. Therefore, the entangled state generated by the injected two-mode squeezed light in optical cavities can be eventually transferred into two microwave cavities. A stationary entanglement E-a1a2 = 0.54 is obtained when the input two-mode squeezed optical field has a squeezing parameter r = 1. The entanglement E-a1a2 increases as the squeezing parameter r increases, and it shows the flexible tunability of the system. Meanwhile, the entanglement survives up to an environmental temperature about 385 mK, which shows high robustness of the scheme. The proposed scheme provides a new mechanism to generate entangled microwave fields via magnons, which enables the degree of the prepared microwave entanglement to a more massive scale. Our result is useful for applications which require high entanglement of microwave fields like quantum radar, quantum navigation, quantum teleportation, quantum wireless fidelity (Wi-Fi) network, etc. (c) 2023 Optica Publishing Group under the terms of the Optica Open Access Publishing Agreement

TI Efficient Estimation of Pauli Observables by Derandomization
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB We consider the problem of jointly estimating expectation values of many Pauli observables, a crucial subroutine in variational quantum algorithms. Starting with randomized measurements, we propose an efficient derandomization procedure that iteratively replaces random single-qubit measurements by fixed Pauli measurements; the resulting deterministic measurement procedure is guaranteed to perform at least as well as the randomized one. In particular, for estimating any L low-weight Pauli observables, a deterministic measurement on only of order log(L) copies of a quantum state suffices. In some cases, for example, when some of the Pauli observables have high weight, the derandomized procedure is substantially better than the randomized one. Specifically, numerical experiments highlight the advantages of our derandomized protocol over various previous methods for estimating the ground-state energies of small molecules.

TI On a model of a Josephson junction with a single quantum channel
   featuring a "deformed" Andreev reflection coefficient
SO LOW TEMPERATURE PHYSICS
AB This paper presents calculations of the current-voltage, dI/dV- and d(2)I/dV(2)-characteristics for a Josephson junction with a short one-dimensional channel, taking into account a "deformed" (anomalous) energy-dependent Andreev reflection function. Depending on the degree of deviation from the classical Andreev reflection coefficient, the "anomalous" functions are conditionally divided into weakly and strongly deformed coefficients. The excess Andreev current decrease is demonstrated with increasing anomaly factor due to the low probability of multiple Andreev reflections compared to the classical case. It has been shown that anomalous fractional (fractal) gap structures arise in the spectra, which require experimental verification. The analysis shows that on the spectrum of modified dynamic conductivity, when considering the anomalous function of Andreev reflections, the second Andreev feature becomes more pronounced as a minimum and the first feature manifests as a notable kink, which is absent in the classical dependencies for cases of high transparency obtained within the Averin-Bardas model. In the anomalous mode, the Andreev features appear as "dips" in the relatively high-energy region, which have also been detected in the Josephson junction spectra, indicating the possibility of generating high-frequency phonons.

TI Variational optimization for quantum problems using deep generative
   networks
SO COMMUNICATIONS PHYSICS
AB Optimization drives advances in quantum science and machine learning, yet most generative models aim to mimic data rather than to discover optimal answers to challenging problems. Here we present a variational generative optimization network that learns to map simple random inputs into high quality solutions across a variety of quantum tasks. We demonstrate that the network rapidly identifies entangled states exhibiting an optimal advantage in entanglement detection when allowing classical communication, attains the ground state energy of an eighteen spin model without encountering the barren plateau phenomenon that hampers standard hybrid algorithms, and-after a single training run-outputs multiple orthogonal ground states of degenerate quantum models. Because the method is model agnostic, parallelizable and runs on current classical hardware, it can accelerate future variational optimization problems in quantum information, quantum computing and beyond.

TI Quantum Continual Learning Overcoming Catastrophic Forgetting
SO CHINESE PHYSICS LETTERS
AB Catastrophic forgetting describes the fact that machine learning models will likely forget the knowledge of previously learned tasks after the learning process of a new one. It is a vital problem in the continual learning scenario and recently has attracted tremendous concern across different communities. We explore the catastrophic forgetting phenomena in the context of quantum machine learning. It is found that, similar to those classical learning models based on neural networks, quantum learning systems likewise suffer from such forgetting problem in classification tasks emerging from various application scenes. We show that based on the local geometrical information in the loss function landscape of the trained model, a uniform strategy can be adapted to overcome the forgetting problem in the incremental learning setting. Our results uncover the catastrophic forgetting phenomena in quantum machine learning and offer a practical method to overcome this problem, which opens a new avenue for exploring potential quantum advantages towards continual learning.

TI Transitionless Quantum Driving in Spin Echo
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB Spin echo can be used to refocus random dynamical phases caused by inhomogeneities in control fields and thereby retain the purity of a spatial distribution of quantum spins. This technique for accurate spin control is an essential ingredient in many applications, such as nuclear magnetic resonance, magnetic resonance imaging, and quantum information processing. Here, we show how all the elements of a spin echo sequence can be performed at high speed by means of transitionless quantum driving. This technique promises accurate control of rapid quantum spin evolution. We apply the scheme to universal nonadiabatic geometric single-and two-qubit gates in a nuclear magnetic resonance setting.

TI Estimating the gradient and higher-order derivatives on quantum hardware
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB For a large class of variational quantum circuits, we show how arbitrary-order derivatives can be analytically evaluated in terms of simple parameter-shift rules, i.e., by running the same circuit with different shifts of the parameters. As particular cases, we obtain parameter-shift rules for the Hessian of an expectation value and for the metric tensor of a variational state, both of which can be efficiently used to analytically implement second-order optimization algorithms on a quantum computer. We also consider the impact of statistical noise by studying the mean-square error of different derivative estimators. Some of the theoretical techniques for evaluating quantum derivatives are applied to their typical use case: the implementation of quantum optimizers. We find that the performance of different estimators and optimizers is intertwined with the values of different hyperparameters, such as the step size or the number of shots. Our findings are supported by several numerical and hardware experiments, including an experimental estimation of the Hessian of a simple variational circuit and an implementation of the Newton optimizer.

TI Training robust and generalizable quantum models
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Adversarial robustness and generalization are both crucial properties of reliable machine learning models. In this paper, we study these properties in the context of quantum machine learning based on Lipschitz bounds. We derive parameter-dependent Lipschitz bounds for quantum models with trainable encoding, showing that the norm of the data encoding has a crucial impact on the robustness against data perturbations. Further, we derive a bound on the generalization error which explicitly involves the parameters of the data encoding. Based on these theoretical results, we propose a practical strategy for training robust and generalizable quantum models by regularizing the Lipschitz bound in the cost. Moreover, we show that, for fixed and nontrainable encodings, as those frequently employed in quantum machine learning, the Lipschitz bound cannot be influenced by tuning the parameters. Thus trainable encodings are crucial for systematically adapting robustness and generalization during training. The practical implications of our theoretical findings are illustrated with numerical results.

TI Superconducting surface trap chips for microwave-driven trapped ions
SO EPJ QUANTUM TECHNOLOGY
AB Microwave-driven trapped ion logic gates offer a promising avenue for advancing beyond laser-based logic operations. In future microwave-based operations, however, the joule heat produced by large microwave currents flowing through narrow microwave electrodes would potentially hinder improvements in gate speed and fidelity. Moreover, scalability, particularly in cryogenic trapped ion systems, is impeded by the excessive joule heat. To address these challenges, we present a novel approach: superconducting surface trap chips that integrate high-Q microwave resonators with large current capacities. Utilizing sub-ampere microwave currents in superconducting Nb resonators, we generate substantial magnetic field gradients with significantly reduced losses compared to conventional metal chips. By harnessing the high Q factors of superconducting resonators, we propose a power-efficient two-qubit gate scheme capable of achieving a sub-milliwatt external microwave input power at a gate Rabi frequency of 1 kHz.

TI Quantum squeezing induced nonreciprocal enhancement of optomechanical
   cooling
SO FRONTIERS IN PHYSICS
AB We theoretically propose how to achieve nonreciprocal enhancement of mechanical cooling in a compound cavity optomechanical system composed of an optomechanical resonator and a chi(2)-nonlinear resonator. By parametric pumping the chi(2)-nonlinear resonator unidirectionally with a classical coherent field, quantum squeezing of the resonator mode emerges in one direction but not in the other, resulting in asymmetric optical detuning and a tunable chiral photon interaction between two resonators. As a result, nonreciprocal mechanical cooling is achieved. More importantly, enhanced mechanical cooling deep into the ground-state can be achieved in the selected directions due to the squeezing effect. These results provide an experimentally feasible way to realize nonreciprocal ground-state cooling of mechanical resonator, which may have a wide range of applications in quantum communication and quantum technologies.

AB Generating high fidelity link-level entanglements is essential for the distribution of end-to-end connectivity across quantum communication networks. The efficiency of entanglement buffering is, however, limited by the short lifetime of the required qubits as noise causes a rapid decay in their fidelities. Entanglement purification, which is essentially a probabilistic operation, counteracts this decay. In its simplest form it uses two entanglements to obtain a higher fidelity one. In this paper, we combine entanglement buffering and purification by applying a purification protocol that acts on the stored entanglements beyond their generation time. Considering a link-level system with a few quantum memories to buffer entanglements in addition to application requests for entanglement, we use a Markov Chain model to derive the steady state distribution of the service performance metrics, specifically, (i) the fidelity of the entanglements that are consumed by application requests and (ii) the distribution of their waiting time in the request queue. Our evaluations show a trade-off between the fidelity and the request waiting time, specifically, given purification as well as for different memory sizes.

TI Robust entanglement by continuous dynamical decoupling of the
   J-coupling interaction
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB We propose a sigma ( z ) circle times sigma ( z ) laser-free entangling gate which uses the intrinsic J-coupling of ions in a static magnetic gradient. Dephasing of the interaction is suppressed by means of continuous dynamical decoupling using pairs of microwave fields. The gate is virtually insensitive to common amplitude noise of the microwave fields and enables high fidelities despite qubit frequency fluctuations, while the J-coupling interaction's inherent robustness to motional decoherence is retained. Errors far below the fault-tolerant threshold can be achieved at high initial temperatures, negating the requirement of sideband cooling below the Doppler temperature. By adjusting the powers of the continuous microwave fields, the J-coupling interaction can be tuned and can be used to implement parallel entangling gates within an ion chain.

TI Quantum version of Prisoners' Dilemma under interacting environment
SO QUANTUM INFORMATION PROCESSING
AB Quantum game theory is a rapidly evolving subject that extends beyond physics. In this research work, a schematic picture of quantum game theory has been provided with the help of the famous game Prisoners' Dilemma, where both of the prisoners possess an entangled qubit. Increasing the payoffs of the prisoners, quantum theory introduces a new Nash equilibrium. It has been considered that the shared qubits may interact with the environment, which is a bath of simple harmonic oscillators. This interaction introduces decoherence. Calculating the decoherence factor, we have shown that as time increases, the new Nash equilibrium disappears and accordingly the corresponding payoffs reduce. The decoherence factor has been analyzed for different time regions, and a characteristic time scale of decoherence has also been provided. A critical time scale, below which Alice and Bob can use the quantum strategy to achieve a higher payoff, has been described with its connection to the off-diagonal elements of the reduced density matrix of the prisoners. The critical time scale has also been discussed based on whether the decoherence occurred once or twice. A comparative discussion establishes that the process of decoherence is faster when it occurs twice. It needs to be mentioned here that the total time of decoherence is the same in both cases.

AB The Polynomial Reconstruction Problem (PRP) was introduced in 1999 as a new hard problem in post-quantum cryptography. Augot and Finiasz were the first to design a cryptographic system based on a univariate PRP, which was published at Eurocrypt 2003 and was broken in 2004. In 2013, a bivariate PRP was proposed. The design is a modified version of Augot and Finiasz's design. Our strategic method, comprising the modified Berlekamp-Welch algorithm and Coron strategies, allowed us to obtain certain secret parameters of the bivariate PRP. This finding resulted in us concluding that the bivariate PRP is not secure against Indistinguishable Chosen-Plaintext Attack (IND-CPA).

TI Toward structure-preserving quantum encodings
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Harnessing the potential computational advantage of quantum computers for machine learning tasks relies on the uploading of classical data onto quantum computers through what are commonly referred to as quantum encodings. The choice of such encodings may vary substantially from one task to another, and there exist only a few cases where structure has provided insight into their design and implementation, such as symmetry in geometric quantum learning. Here, we propose the perspective that category theory offers a natural mathematical framework for analyzing encodings that respect structure inherent in datasets and learning tasks. We illustrate this with pedagogical examples, which include geometric quantum machine learning, quantum metric learning, topological data analysis, and more. Moreover, such a perspective provides a language in which to ask meaningful and mathematically precise questions for the design of quantum encodings and circuits for quantum machine learning tasks.

TI Universal structure of measurement-induced information in many-body
   ground states
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB Unlike unitary dynamics, measurements of a subsystem can induce long-range entanglement via quantum teleportation. The amount of measurement-induced entanglement or mutual information depends jointly on the measurement basis and the entanglement structure of the state (before measurement), and has operational significance for whether the state is a resource for measurement-based quantum computing, as well as for the computational complexity of simulating the state using quantum or classical computers. In this paper, we examine entropic measures of measurement-induced entanglement (MIE) and information (MII) for the ground states of quantum many-body systems in one and two spatial dimensions. From numerical and analytic analysis of a variety of models encompassing critical points, quantum Hall states, string-net topological orders, and Fermi liquids, we identify universal features of the long-distance structure of MIE and MII that depend only on the underlying phase or critical universality class of the state. We argue that, whereas in 1D the leading contributions to long-range MIE and MII are universal, in 2D, the existence of a teleportation transition for finite-depth circuits implies that trivial 2D states can exhibit long-range MIE, and the universal features lie in subleading corrections. We introduce modified MIE measures that directly extract these universal contributions. As a corollary, we show that the leading contributions to strange correlators, used to numerically identify topological phases, are in fact nonuniversal in two or more dimensions, and explain how our modified constructions enable one to isolate universal components. We discuss the implications of these results for classical- and quantum- computational simulation of quantum materials.

TI Magnetic tuning of the tunnel coupling in an optically active quantum
   dot molecule
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB Self-assembled optically active quantum dot molecules (QDMs) allow the creation of protected qubits via singlet-triplet spin states. The qubit energy splitting of these states is defined by the tunnel coupling strength and is, therefore, determined by the potential landscape and is fixed during growth. Applying an in-plane magnetic field increases the confinement of the hybridized wave functions within the quantum dots, leading to a decrease of the tunnel coupling strength. We achieve a tuning of the coupling strength by 53.4% +/- 1.7%. The ability to fine-tune this coupling is essential for quantum network and computing applications that require quantum systems with near identical performance.

TI A new method of constructing adversarial examples for quantum
   variational circuits
SO CHINESE PHYSICS B
AB A quantum variational circuit is a quantum machine learning model similar to a neural network. A crafted adversarial example can lead to incorrect results for the model. Using adversarial examples to train the model will greatly improve its robustness. The existing method is to use automatic differentials or finite difference to obtain a gradient and use it to construct adversarial examples. This paper proposes an innovative method for constructing adversarial examples of quantum variational circuits. In this method, the gradient can be obtained by measuring the expected value of a quantum bit respectively in a series quantum circuit. This method can be used to construct the adversarial examples for a quantum variational circuit classifier. The implementation results prove the effectiveness of the proposed method. Compared with the existing method, our method requires fewer resources and is more efficient.

TI Temporal witnesses of non-classicality and conservation laws
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS A-MATHEMATICAL AND THEORETICAL
AB A general entanglement-based witness of non-classicality has recently been proposed, which can be applied to testing quantum effects in gravity. This witness is based on generating entanglement between two quantum probes via a mediator. In this paper we provide a 'temporal' variant of this witness, using a single quantum probe to assess the non-classicality of the mediator. Within the formalism of quantum theory, we show that if a system M is capable of inducing a coherent dynamical evolution of a quantum system Q, in the presence of a conservation law, then M must be non-classical. This argument supports witnesses of non-classicality relying on a single quantum probe, which can be applied to a number of open issues, notably in quantum gravity or quantum biology.

TI Quench dynamics of entanglement from crosscap states
SO SCIPOST PHYSICS
AB The linear growth of entanglement after a quench from a state with short-range correlations is a universal feature of many body dynamics. It has been shown to occur in integrable and chaotic systems undergoing either Hamiltonian, Floquet or circuit dynamics and has also been observed in experiments. The entanglement dynamics emerging from long-range correlated states is far less studied, although no less viable using modern quantum simulation experiments. In this work, we investigate the dynamics of the bipartite entanglement entropy and mutual information from initial states which have long-range entanglement with correlation between antipodal points of a finite and periodic system. Starting from these crosscap states, we study both brickwork quantum circuits and Hamiltonian dynamics and find distinct patterns of behaviour depending on the type of dynamics and whether the system is integrable or chaotic. Specifically, we study both dual unitary and random unitary quantum circuits as well as free and interacting fermion Hamiltonians. For integrable systems, we find that after a time delay the entanglement experiences a linear in time decrease followed by a series of revivals, while, in contrast, chaotic systems exhibit constant entanglement entropy. On the other hand, both types of systems experience an immediate linear decrease of the mutual information in time. In chaotic systems this then vanishes, whereas integrable systems instead experience a series of revivals. We show how the quasiparticle and membrane pictures of entanglement dynamics can be modified to describe this behaviour, and derive explicitly the quasiparticle picture in the case of free fermion models which we then extend to all integrable systems.

TI A Conjugate Gradient Method: Quantum Spectral Polak-Ribiére-Polyak
   Approach for Unconstrained Optimization Problems
SO MATHEMATICS
AB Quantum computing is an emerging field that has had a significant impact on optimization. Among the diverse quantum algorithms, quantum gradient descent has become a prominent technique for solving unconstrained optimization (UO) problems. In this paper, we propose a quantum spectral Polak-Ribiere-Polyak (PRP) conjugate gradient (CG) approach. The technique is considered as a generalization of the spectral PRP method which employs a q-gradient that approximates the classical gradient with quadratically better dependence on the quantum variable q. Additionally, the proposed method reduces to the classical variant as the quantum variable q approaches closer to 1. The quantum search direction always satisfies the sufficient descent condition and does not depend on any line search (LS). This approach is globally convergent with the standard Wolfe conditions without any convexity assumption. Numerical experiments are conducted and compared with the existing approach to demonstrate the improvement of the proposed strategy.

SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM ENGINEERING

We first show that running Grover's routine with a reduced number of iterations but allowing several trials presents a complexity advantage while keeping the same success probability. Then, by a theoretical analysis of the performance, we provide a generic procedure to parameterize the number of iterations k within one shot of Grover's algorithm and the maximum number of trials T, given a targeted success pand the size of the database N. At the end, we highlight that this new approach permits to reduce the computational time by at least 10% for p >= 0.999 independently of the size of the database.

TI Controlled-Controlled-Phase Gates for Superconducting Qubits Mediated by
   a Shared Tunable Coupler
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB Applications for noisy intermediate-scale quantum computing devices rely on the efficient entanglement of many qubits to reach a potential quantum advantage. Although entanglement is typically generated using two-qubit gates, direct control of strong multiqubit interactions can improve the efficiency of the process. Here, we investigate a system of three superconducting transmon-type qubits coupled via a single flux-tunable coupler. Tuning the frequency of the coupler by adiabatic flux pulses enables us to control the conditional energy shifts between the qubits and directly realize multiqubit interactions. To accurately adjust the resulting controlled relative phases, we describe a gate protocol involving refocusing pulses and adjustable interaction times. This enables the implementation of the full family of pairwise controlled -phase and controlled-controlled-phase gates. Numerical simulations result in fidelities around 99% and gate times below 300 ns using currently achievable system parameters and decoherence rates.

Qibosoq connects the RFSoC firmware provided by Qick, a Quantum Instrumentation Control Kit, with Qibo, a quantum computing middleware framework that enables both experimental and gate-based applications. It simplifies the work of experimentalists and developers by managing client-server communication protocols, implementing tests, and validation procedures, thereby reducing the complexity of experimental setups. The client-side integration is achieved with dedicated drivers implemented in Qibolab, the specialized software module of Qibo for quantum hardware control. Therefore, this setup provides a seamless mechanism to deploy circuit-based algorithms on custom self-hosted quantum hardware platforms controlled by RFSoC electronics.

TI Fidelity-enhanced variational quantum optimal control
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Creating robust quantum operations is a major challenge in the current noisy intermediate-scale quantum computing era. Recently, the importance of noise-resilient control methods has become more pronounced in the field. Ordinarily, noisy quantum systems are described by the Lindblad equation. However, minimizing noise susceptibility using this equation has proven challenging because of its irreversibility. In this study, we propose a method for creating robust pulses based on the stochastic Schr & ouml;dinger equation. This equation describes individual noise realizations under any colored noise process, contrary to the Lindblad equation, which describes mean system behavior under white noise. Using stochastic optimal control techniques, our method, fidelity-enhanced variational quantum optimal control, is able to construct higher-fidelity paths than its nonstochastic counterpart. By accounting for both environmental noise sources as well as noise sources inherent to the control system, highly significant increases in fidelity are noted for both single- and multiple-qubit state preparations.

TI A Divide-and-Conquer Approach to Dicke State Preparation
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM ENGINEERING
AB We present a divide-and-conquer approach to deterministically prepare Dicke states vertical bar D-k(n)> (i.e., equal-weight superpositions of all n-qubit states with Hamming weight k) on quantum computers. In an experimental evaluation for up to n = 6 qubits on IBM Quantum Sydney and Montreal devices, we achieve significantly higher state fidelity compared to previous results. The fidelity gains are achieved through several techniques: our circuits first "divide" the Hamming weight between blocks of n/2 qubits, and then "conquer" those blocks with improved versions of Dicke state unitaries (Bartschi et al. FCT'2019). Due to the sparse connectivity on IBM's heavy-hex-architectures, these circuits are implemented for linear nearest neighbor topologies. Further gains in (estimating) the state fidelity are due to our use of measurement error mitigation and hardware progress.

TI Quantum-enhanced intelligent system for personalized adaptive
   radiotherapy dose estimation
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB This research introduces a novel quantum-enhanced intelligent system tailored for personalized adaptive radiotherapy dose estimation. The system efficiently models radiation transport and predicts patient-specific dose distributions by integrating quantum algorithms, deep learning, and Monte Carlo simulations. Quantum-enhanced Monte Carlo simulations, employing algorithms such as Harrow-Hassidim-Lloyd (HHL) and Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE), achieve computational speedups of 8-15 times compared to classical methods while maintaining high accuracy. The deep learning architecture leverages convolutional and recurrent neural networks to capture complex anatomical and dosimetric patterns. Validation on simulated datasets demonstrates a 50-70% reduction in mean absolute error and 2-3% improvements in gamma index metrics compared to conventional approaches. Dose-volume histogram analysis further highlights enhanced Dice coefficients and reduced Hausdorff distances. These advancements underscore the potential for precise, efficient, and clinically relevant dose estimations, paving the way for improved outcomes in personalized adaptive radiotherapy.

TI Bayesian Quantum Multiphase Estimation Algorithm
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB Quantum phase estimation (QPE) is the key subroutine of several quantum computing algorithms as well as a central ingredient in quantum computational chemistry and quantum simulation. While QPE strategies have focused on the estimation of a single phase, applications to the simultaneous estimation of several phases may bring substantial advantages; for instance, in the presence of spatial or temporal constraints. In this work, we study a Bayesian algorithm for the parallel (simultaneous) estimation of multiple arbitrary phases. The protocol gives access to correlations in the Bayesian multiphase distribution resulting in covariance matrix elements scaling as O(N-T(-2)), with respect to the total number of quantum resources N-T. The parallel estimation allows to surpass the sensitivity of sequential single-phase estimation strategies for optimal linear combinations of phases. Furthermore, the algorithm proves a certain noise resilience and can be implemented using single photons and standard optical elements in currently accessible experiments.

The objective of this was to simulate the addition of environmental noise in a digital setting. Using the newly designed digital qubits, a few quantum logic gates have been designed to work on the FPGA platform using Verilog. These logic gates have then been used to implement entanglement on a digital hardware platform. Furthermore, this paper implements communication between two digital quantum computers over both wired and wireless media by transmitting alphabetical messages as qubits and compares the same with transmission involving classical digital bits only.

TI Effect of the readout efficiency of quantum measurement on the system
   entanglement
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Monitored quantum systems evolve along stochastic trajectories correlated with the observer's knowledge of the system's state. Under such dynamics, certain quantum resources like entanglement may depend on the observer's state of knowledge. Here, we quantify the entanglement for a particle on a one-dimensional (1D) quantum random walk under inefficient monitoring using a mixed state-entanglement measure: the configuration coherence. We find that the system's maximal mean entanglement at the measurement-induced quantum-to-classical crossover is suppressed in different ways by the measurement strength and inefficiency. In principle, strong measurements can lower the amount of entanglement indefinitely. However, at a given measurement strength, efficient readout can crucially increase the system entanglement, making high-fidelity detectors essential for successful quantum computing. Our results bear impact for a broad range of fields, ranging from quantum simulation platforms of random walks to questions related to measurement-induced phase transitions.

AB The non-local feature of topological states of matter is the key for the topological protection of quantum information and enables robust non-local manipulation in quantum information. Here we propose to manifest the non-local feature of a Majorana-hosted superconducting island by measuring the temperature dependence of Coulomb blockade peak conductance in different regimes. In the low-temperature regime, we discover a coherent double Majorana-assisted teleportation (MT) process, where any independent tunneling process always involves two coherent non-local MTs; and we also find an anomalous universal scaling behavior, i.e., a crossover from a [max(T,eV)](6) power-law to a [max(T,eV)](3) power-law conductance behavior when energy scale increases - in stark contrast to the usual exponential suppression due to certain local transport. In the high-temperature regime, the conductance is instead proportional to the temperature inverse, indicating a non-monotonic temperature-dependence of the conductance. Both the anomalous power law and non-monotonic temperature-dependence of the conductance can be distinguished from the conductance peak in the traditional Coulomb block, and therefore, together serve as a hallmark for the non-local feature in the Majorana-hosted superconducting island.

TI High-Performance Hardware Implementation of the Saber Key Encapsulation
   Protocol
SO ELECTRONICS
AB Information is pivotal in contemporary society, highlighting the necessity for a secure cryptographic system. The emergence of quantum algorithms and the swift advancement of specialized quantum computers will render traditional cryptography susceptible to quantum attacks in the foreseeable future. The lattice-based Saber key encapsulation protocol holds significant value in cryptographic research and practical applications. In this paper, we propose three types of polynomial multipliers for various application scenarios including lightweight Schoolbook multiplier, high-throughput multiplier based on the TMVP-Schoolbook algorithm and improved pipelined NTT multiplier. Other principal modules of Saber are designed encompassing the hash function module, sampling module and functional submodule. Based on our proposed multiplier, we implement the overall hardware circuits of the Saber key encapsulation protocol. Experimental results demonstrate that our overall hardware circuits have different advantages. Our lightweight implementation has minimal resource consumption. Our high-throughput implementation only needs 23.28 mu s to complete the whole process, which is the fastest among the existing works. The throughput rate is 10,988 Kbps and the frequency is 416 MHz. Our hardware implementation based on the improved pipelined NTT multiplier achieved a good balance between area and performance. The overall frequency can reach 357 MHz.

TI Rapid parallel atomic array assembly method via reduced path-planning
   algorithm
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Precisely controllable, defect-free neutral atom arrays have emerged as an outstanding platform for exploring complex quantum many-body systems and advancing quantum simulation and quantum computing. A method that boosts the rapid and efficient rearrangement is of great significance for expanding the scale of atomic arrays. Here, we present a fast parallel atomic array assembly method based on a PPM algorithm, i.e., position matching, path planning, and move in parallel. By optimizing atom-to-target trajectories using reduced position matching and introducing trajectory correction and target exchange in path planning, the PPM method can effectively minimize movement steps and displacement. The simulation of assembling atoms in parallel into arbitrary geometries shows a reduction of 49% and 35% in steps and displacement compared with the previous parallel algorithm, respectively. Our PPM simulation demonstrates the achievement of a defect-free arrangement of 1,024 atoms in only 35 steps.

TI Sequence of penalties method to study excited states using VQE
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB We propose an extension of the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) that leads to more accurate energy estimations and can be used to study excited states. The method is based on the introduction of a sequence of increasing penalties in the cost function. This approach does not require circuit modifications and thus can be applied with no additional depth cost. Through numerical simulations, we show that we are able to produce variational states with desired physical properties, such as total spin and charge. We assess its performance both on classical simulators and on currently available quantum devices, calculating the potential energy curves of small molecular systems in different physical configurations. Finally, we compare our method to the original VQE and to another extension, obtaining a better agreement with exact simulations for both energy and targeted physical quantities.

TI Provable super-exponential quantum advantage for learning secrets in
   Mastermind
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Quantum computing can speed up the solution of certain computational problems. However, a large proportion of such problems discovered so far are either contrived or do not directly correspond to real-world applications. Here, we prove super-exponential quantum speedups for a learning problem called Mastermind where Alice hopes to learn the secret string from Bob by doing as few interactive question-answering as possible. It first appeared as a popular game and then was abstracted to a combinatorial optimization problem with a wide range of applications. To establish the quantum advantage, we propose non-adaptive and adaptive quantum algorithms for this problem, both demonstrating super-exponential quantum speedups over their classical counterparts. The non-adaptive one has a promising experimental realizability on near-term quantum computers since it is simply to run a shallow quantum circuit. Our work adds a new member to the zoo of super-exponential quantum speedups and demonstrates quantum advantages for problems with potential applications.

TI Improving quantum genetic optimization through granular computing
SO GRANULAR COMPUTING
AB Quantum computers promise to revolutionize the world of computing thanks to some features of quantum mechanics that can enable massive parallelism in computation. This benefit may be particularly relevant in the design of evolutionary algorithms, where the quantum paradigm could support the exploration of multiple regions of the search space in a concurrent way. Although some efforts in this research field are ongoing, the potential of quantum computing is not yet fully expressed due to the limited number of qubits of current quantum processors. This limitation is even more acute when one wants to deal with continuous optimization problems, where the search space is potentially infinite. The goal of this paper is to address this limitation by introducing a hybrid and granular approach to quantum algorithm design, specifically designed for genetic optimization. This approach is defined as hybrid, because it uses a digital computer to evaluate fitness functions, and a quantum processor to evolve the genetic population; moreover, it uses granular computing to hierarchically reduce the size of the search space of a problem, so that good near-optimal solutions can be identified even on small quantum computers. As shown in the experiments, where IBM Q family processors are used, the usage of a granular computation scheme statistically enhances the performance of the state-of-the-art evolutionary algorithm implemented on quantum computers, when it is run to optimize well-known benchmark continuous functions.

TI Multiplayer conflict avoidance through entangled quantum walks
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Quantum computing has the potential to solve complex problems faster and more efficiently than classical computing. It can achieve speedups by leveraging quantum phenomena like superposition, entanglement, and tunneling. Quantum walks (QWs) form the foundation for many quantum algorithms. Unlike classical random walks, QWs exhibit quantum interference, leading to unique behaviors such as linear spreading and localization. These properties make QWs valuable for various applications, including universal computation, time series prediction, encryption, and quantum hash functions. One emerging application of QWs is decision-making. Previous research has used QWs to model human decision processes and solve multiarmed bandit problems. This paper extends QWs to collective decision-making, focusing on minimizing decision conflicts, cases where multiple agents choose the same option, leading to inefficiencies like traffic congestion or overloaded servers. Prior research using quantum interference has addressed two-player conflict avoidance but struggled with three-player scenarios. This paper proposes a method using QWs to entirely eliminate decision conflicts in three-player cases, demonstrating its effectiveness in collective decision-making.

TI Noncontextual Pauli Hamiltonians
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS A-MATHEMATICAL AND THEORETICAL
AB Contextuality is a key feature of quantum mechanics, and identification of noncontextual subtheories of quantum mechanics is of both fundamental and practical importance. Recently, noncontextual Pauli Hamiltonians have been defined in the setting of variational quantum algorithms. In this work we rigorously establish a number of properties of noncontextual Pauli Hamiltonians. We prove that these Hamiltonians can be composed of more Pauli operators than diagonal Hamiltonians. This establishes that noncontextual Hamiltonians are able to describe a greater number of physical interactions. We then show that the eigenspaces admit an efficient classical description. We analyze the eigenspace of these Hamiltonians and prove that for every eigenvalue there exists an associated eigenvector whose stabilizer rank scales linearly with the number of qubits. We prove that further structure in these Hamiltonians allow us to derive where degeneracies in the eigenspectrum can arise. We thus open the field to a new class of efficiently simulatable states.

The versatility of this nuclear spin setup is verified by monitoring the Na-23 nucleus of a lyotropic liquid crystal sample at the nematic phase. The quantum state tomography and the Wigner quasiprobability distribution function are performed to characterize the accuracy of the experimental implementation.

TI Quantum lattice Boltzmann method for simulating nonlinear fluid dynamics
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Quantum computing holds transformative potential for simulating nonlinear physical systems, such as fluid turbulence. However, mapping nonlinear dynamics to the linear operations required by quantum hardware remains a fundamental challenge. Here, we bridge this gap by introducing a novel node-level ensemble description of a lattice gas, which enables the simulation of nonlinear fluid dynamics on quantum computers. This approach combines the advantages of the lattice Boltzmann method with low-dimensional representation (computational cost) and lattice gas cellular automata with linear collision treatment (quantum compatibility). Building on this framework, we propose a quantum lattice Boltzmann method that relies on linear operations with medium dimensionality, offering the potential for quantum speedup. We validated the algorithm through simulations of vortex-pair merging and decaying turbulence on up to 16.8 million computational grid points. The results demonstrate remarkable agreement with direct numerical simulation, effectively capturing the essential nonlinear mechanisms of fluid dynamics. This work potentially advances the development of quantum algorithms for other nonlinear problems across various transport phenomena in engineering.

TI Fixed-point oblivious quantum amplitude-amplification algorithm
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB The quantum amplitude amplification algorithms based on Grover's rotation operator need to perform phase flips for both the initial state and the target state. When the initial state is oblivious, the phase flips will be intractable, and we need to adopt oblivious amplitude amplification algorithm to handle. Without knowing exactly how many target items there are, oblivious amplitude amplification also suffers the "souffle problem", in which iterating too little "undercooks" the state and too much "overcooks" the state, both resulting in a mostly non-target final state. In this work, we present a fixed-point oblivious quantum amplitude-amplification (FOQA) algorithm by introducing damping based on methods proposed by A. Mizel. Moreover, we construct the quantum circuit to implement our algorithm under the framework of duality quantum computing. Our algorithm can avoid the "souffle problem", meanwhile keep the square speedup of quantum search, serving as a subroutine to improve the performance of quantum algorithms containing oblivious amplitude amplification procedure.

TI Searching for anomalous quartic gauge couplings at muon colliders using
   principal component analysis
SO EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL C
AB Searching for new physics (NP) is one of the areas of high-energy physics that requires the most processing of large amounts of data. At the same time, quantum computing has huge potential advantages when dealing with large amounts of data. The principal component analysis (PCA) algorithm may be one of the bridges connecting these two aspects. On the one hand, it can be used for anomaly detection, and on the other hand, there are corresponding quantum algorithms for PCA. In this paper, we investigate how to use PCA to search for NP. Taking the example of anomalous quartic gauge couplings in the tri-photon process at muon colliders, we find that PCA can be used to search for NP. Compared with the traditional event selection strategy, the expected constraints on the operator coefficients obtained by PCA based event selection strategy are even better.

TI A differentiable quantum phase estimation algorithm
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB The simulation of electronic properties is a pivotal issue in modern electronic structure theory, driving significant efforts over the past decades to develop protocols for computing energy derivatives. In this work, we address this problem by developing a strategy to integrate the quantum phase estimation algorithm within a fully differentiable framework. This is accomplished by devising a smooth estimator able to tackle arbitrary initial states. We provide analytical expressions to characterize the statistics and algorithmic cost of this estimator. Furthermore, we provide numerical evidence that the estimation accuracy is retained when an arbitrary state is considered and that it exceeds the one of standard majority rule. We explicitly use this procedure to estimate chemically relevant quantities, demonstrating our approach through ground-state and triplet excited state geometry optimization with simulations involving up to 19 qubits. This work paves the way for new quantum algorithms that combine interference methods and quantum differentiable programming.

TI Amplitude-noise-resilient entangling gates for trapped ions
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB Noise resilience of quantum information processing is a crucial precondition to reach the fault-tolerance threshold. While resilience to many types of noise can be achieved through suitable control schemes, resilience to amplitude noise seems to be elusive within the common harmonic approximation for the bus mode of trapped ions. We show that weak anharmonicities admit control schemes that achieve amplitude-noise resilience consistent with state-of-the-art experimental requirements and that the required anharmonicities can be achieved with current standards of microstructured traps or even the intrinsically anharmonic Coulomb interaction. This approach applies broadly to any platform that employs a bosonic bus as a qubit coupler.

SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Utilizing optimal control to simulate a model Hamiltonian is an emerging strategy that leverages the intrinsic physics of a device with digital quantum simulation methods. Here we evaluate optimal control for probing the nonequilibrium properties of symmetry-protected topological (SPT) states simulated with superconducting hardware. Assuming a tunable transmon architecture, we cast the evolution of these SPT states as a series of one- and two-site pulse optimization problems that are solved in the presence of leakage constraints. From the generated pulses, we classically simulate the time-dependent melting of the perturbed SPT string order across a six-site model with an average state infidelity of 10(-3). The feasibility of these pulses as well as their efficient application indicate that high-fidelity simulations of string order melting are within reach of current quantum computing systems.

TI Experimental demonstration of free-space two-photon interference
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Quantum interference plays an essential role in understanding the concepts of quantum physics. Moreover, the interference of photons is indispensable for large-scale quantum information processing. With the development of quantum networks, interference of photons transmitted through long-distance fiber channels has been widely implemented. However, quantum interference of photons using free-space channels is still scarce, mainly due to atmospheric turbulence. Here, we report an experimental demonstration of Hong-Ou-Mandel interference with photons transmitted by free-space channels. Two typical photon sources, i.e., correlated photon pairs generated in spontaneous parametric down conversion (SPDC) process and weak coherent states, are employed. A visibility of 0.744 +/- 0.013 is observed by interfering with two photons generated in the SPDC process, exceeding the classical limit of 0.5. Our results demonstrate that the quantum property of photons remains even after transmission through unstable free-space channels, indicating the feasibility and potential application of free-space-based quantum interference in quantum information processing.

TI Angular Bloch oscillations and their applications
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB To advance inertial navigation, we present the scheme for a compact quantum sensor which is based on the quantum phenomenon of the angular Bloch oscillations and measuring exclusively the angular acceleration of slow external rotation. We study the dynamics of ultra-cold atoms confined in a toroidal trap with a ring-lattice along the azimuth angle, realized with the superposition of two copropagating Laguerre-Gaussian beams. In the presence of external rotation with a small angular acceleration, or a prescribed linear chirp between the two beams, the measured angular momentum of the trapped atoms exhibits a specific periodic behaviour in time, which we call as the angular Bloch oscillations. This quantum phenomenon is shown to be a key element of fruitful applications for (i) an efficient transfer of quantized angular momentum from the light to the atoms by controlling the chirp, and (ii) the direct determination of the angular acceleration of external rotation by measuring the Bloch period.

AB The synthesis of quantum circuits for multiplicative inverse over GF(2(8)) are discussed in this paper. We first convert the multiplicative inverse operation in GF(2(8)) to arithmetic operations in the composite field GF((2(4))(2)), and then discuss the expressions of the square calculation, the inversion calculation and the multiplication calculation separately in the finite field GF(2 4 ), where the expressions of multiplication calculation in GF(2(4)) are given directly in GF(2(4)) and given through being transformed into the composite field GF((2(2))(2)). Then the quantum circuits of these calculations are realized one by one. Finally, two quantum circuits for multiplicative inverse over GF(2(8)) are synthesized. They both use 21 qubits, the first quantum circuit uses 55 Toffoli gates and 107 CNOT gates and the second one uses 37 Toffoli gates and 209 CNOT gates. As an example of the application of multiplication inverse, we apply these quantum circuits to the implementations of the S-box quantum circuit of the AES cryptographic algorithm. Two quantum circuits for implementing the S-box of the AES cryptographic algorithm are presented. The first quantum circuit uses 21 qubits, 55 Toffoli gates, 131 CNOT gates and 4 NOT gates and the second one uses 21 qubits, 37 Toffoli gates, 233 CNOT gates and 4 NOT gates. Through the evaluation of quantum cost, the two quantum circuits of the S-box of AES cryptographic algorithm use less quantum resources than the existing schemes.

TI Quantum-Resistant Lattice-Based Proxy Signature
SO SYMMETRY-BASEL
AB With the advancement of quantum computing, the utilization of quantum algorithms such as Shor's algorithm enables the efficient resolution of problems that are intractable in classical computing paradigms, posing a significant threat to traditional signature schemes. Lattice-based cryptography is considered one of the most promising post-quantum cryptographic algorithms due to its computational advantages and potential resistance to quantum attacks. Proxy signature is an authorization mechanism that allows the original signer to delegate the signing power to a proxy. The security of existing proxy signature schemes is mostly based on classical hard problems, which cannot guarantee security under quantum attacks. Therefore, this paper combines lattice-based cryptography with proxy signatures to propose a new lattice-based proxy signature scheme (NLBPS). NLBPS constructs signatures using lattice-based trapdoor sampling algorithms and preimage sampling algorithms. Comparative analysis shows that the proposed scheme has relatively smaller key and signature sizes compared to some existing lattice-based proxy signature schemes, and it also offers a certain improvement in computational efficiency.

TI An algorithm based on quantum phase estimation for the identification of
   patterns
SO QUANTUM INFORMATION PROCESSING
AB The quantum phase estimation algorithm has been utilized by a variety of quantum algorithms, most notably Shor's algorithm, to obtain information regarding the period of a function that is appropriately encoded into a unitary operator. In many cases, it is desired to estimate whether a specific state exhibits a certain pattern quickly. In this paper, we exhibit a methodology based on the QPE algorithm to identify certain patterns. In particular, starting from a properly encoded state, we demonstrate how to construct unitary operators whose eigenvectors correspond to states with proper diagonals. QPE will then output an eigenphase equal to zero with certainty for these states, thereby identifying this class of matrices. For partial matches, our algorithm, based on the tolerance threshold used, will show areas of high similarity, and it will outperform classical ones when the number of mismatches defined by the tolerance is significantly low when compared to the size of the diagonal.

TI Generating symmetry-protected long-range entanglement
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Entanglement between spatially distant qubits is perhaps the most counterintuitive and vital resource for distributed quantum computing. However, despite a few special cases, there is no known general procedure to maximally entangle two distant parts of an interacting many-body system. Here we present a symmetry-based approach, whereby one applies several timed pulses to drive a system to a particular symmetry sector with maximal bipartite long-range entanglement. As a concrete example, we demonstrate how a simple sequence of on-site pulses on a qubit array can efficiently produce multiple stable nonlocal Bell pairs, realizable in present-day atomic and photonic experimental platforms. More generally, our approach paves a route for exotic state preparation by harnessing symmetry. For instance, we show how it allows the creation of long-sought-after superconducting eta pairs in a repulsive Hubbard model.

TI Dynamical Anyon Generation in Kitaev Honeycomb Non-Abelian Spin Liquids
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Relativistic Mott insulators known as ???Kitaev materials??? potentially realize spin liquids hosting non -Abelian anyons. Motivated by fault-tolerant quantum-computing applications in this setting, we introduce a dynamical anyon-generation protocol that exploits universal edge physics. The setup features holes in the spin liquid, which define energetically cheap locations for non-Abelian anyons, connected by a narrow bridge that can be tuned between spin liquid and topologically trivial phases. We show that modulating the bridge from trivial to spin liquid over intermediate time scales???quantified by analytics and extensive simulations???deposits non-Abelian anyons into the holes with O(1) probability. The required bridge manipulations can be implemented by integrating the Kitaev material into magnetic tunnel junction arrays that engender locally tunable exchange fields. Combined with existing readout strategies, our protocol reveals a path to topological qubit experiments in Kitaev materials at zero applied magnetic field.

TI Entangled matter waves for quantum enhanced sensing
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB The ability to create and harness entanglement is crucial to the fields of quantum sensing and simulation, and ultracold-atom-cavity systems offer pristine platforms for this undertaking. Here, we present a method for creating and controlling entanglement between solely the motional states of atoms in a cavity without the need for electronic interactions. We show this interaction arises from a general atom-cavity model and discuss the role of the cavity frequency shift in response to atomic motion. This cavity response leads to many different squeezing interactions between the atomic momentum states. Furthermore, we show that when the atoms form a density grating, the collective motion leads to one-axis twisting, a many-body energy gap, and metrologically useful entanglement even in the presence of noise. Notably, an experiment recently demonstrated this regime leads to an effective momentum-exchange interaction between atoms in a common cavity mode [Luo et al., , Science 384, , 551 (2024)]. This system offers a highly tunable, many-body quantum sensor and simulator.

TI Characterization of Asymmetric Gap-Engineered Josephson Junctions and 3D
   Transmon Qubits
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON APPLIED SUPERCONDUCTIVITY
AB We have fabricated and characterized asymmetric gap-engineered junctions and transmon devices. To create Josephson junctions with asymmetric gaps, Ti was used to proximitize and lower the superconducting gap of the Al counter-electrode. DC IV measurements of these small, proximitized Josephson junctions show a reduced gap and larger excess current for voltage biases below the superconducting gap when compared to standard Al/AlOx/Al junctions. The energy relaxation time constant for an Al/AlOx/Al/Ti 3D transmon was T-1 = 1 mu s, over two orders of magnitude shorter than the measured T-1 = 134 mu s of a standard Al/AlOx/Al 3D transmon. Intentionally adding disorder between the Al and Ti layers reduces the proximity effect and subgap current while increasing the relaxation time to T-1 = 32 mu s.

TI Hyperfine Coupling Constants on Quantum Computers: Performance, Errors,
   and Future Prospects
SO JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL THEORY AND COMPUTATION
AB We present the first implementation and computation of electron spin resonance isotropic hyperfine coupling constants (HFCs) on a quantum hardware. As illustrative test cases, we compute the HFCs for the hydroxyl radical (OH center dot), nitric oxide (NO center dot), and triplet hydroxyl cation (OH+). Our approach integrates the qubit-ADAPT method with unrestricted orbital optimization in an active space framework. To accurately measure the necessary spin one-electron-reduced density matrices on current hardware, we employ a combination of error mitigation, error suppression, and postselection, including our in-house developed ansatz-based readout and gate error mitigation. The HFCs obtained from the quantum hardware experiments align with results from unrestricted complete active space self-consistent field calculations on classical hardware. These results mark a significant step toward leveraging quantum computing for chemically relevant molecular properties and highlight the critical role of multimethod error strategies in the noisy intermediate-scale quantum era.

TI Signal amplification in a solid-state sensor through asymmetric
   many-body echo
SO NATURE
AB Electronic spins of nitrogen-vacancy centres in diamond constitute a promising system for micro- and nanoscale magnetic sensing1, 2, 3-4, because of their operation under ambient conditions5, ease of placement in close proximity to sensing targets6 and biological compatibility7. At high densities, the electronic spins interact through dipolar coupling, which typically limits8 but can also potentially enhance9 sensing performance. Here we report the experimental demonstration of many-body signal amplification in a solid-state, room-temperature quantum sensor. Our approach uses time-reversed two-axis-twisting interactions, engineered through dynamical control of the quantization axis and Floquet engineering10 in a two-dimensional ensemble of nitrogen-vacancy centres. We observe that optimal amplification occurs when the backward evolution time equals twice the forward evolution time, in sharp contrast to the conventional Loschmidt echo11,12. These observations can be understood as resulting from an underlying time-reversed mirror symmetry of the microscopic dynamics, providing key insights into signal amplification and opportunities for practical entanglement-enhanced quantum sensing.

TI A novel quantum model of forward kinematics based on quaternion/Pauli
   gate equivalence: Application to a six-jointed industrial robotic arm
SO RESULTS IN ENGINEERING
AB A novel quantum-based kinematic model for computing the position and the orientation of the six-jointed IRB 140 ABB robotic arm is presented. Position is determined through successive elementary translations and rotations from the end effector down to the base frame, whereas orientation is derived from quaternion representation. The model is based on the equivalence between quaternions and Pauli matrices or gates. Based on comparison to experimental results, the quantum kinematic model is valid. Its main advantage is that it uses only one qubit to model both position and orientation, which represents a major saving in terms of computing resources and time. This model could guide development of other quantum models and simulation software to be used in future quantum computers and could also inform classical computing theory for robotic arm kinematics modeling.

TI Quantifying dynamics and interactions of individual spurious low-energy
   fluctuators in superconducting circuits
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB Understanding the nature and dynamics of material defects in superconducting circuits is of paramount importance for improving qubit coherence and parameter stability and much needed for implementing large-scale quantum computing. Here we present measurements on individual highly coherent environmental two-level systems (TLS). We trace the spectral diffusion of specific TLS and demonstrate that it originates from the TLS coupling to a small number of low energy incoherent fluctuators. From the analysis of these fluctuations, we access the relevant parameters of low energy fluctuators: dipole moments, switching energies, and, more importantly, interaction energies. Our approach opens up the possibility of deducing the macroscopic observables in amorphous glassy media from direct measurements of local fluctuator dynamics at the microscopic level-a route towards substantiating commonly accepted, but so far phenomenological, models for the decohering environment.

TI Exploiting the Central Reduction in Lattice-Based Cryptography
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB This paper questions the side-channel security of central reduction technique, which is widely adapted in efficient implementations of Lattice-Based Cryptography (LBC). We show that the central reduction leads to a vulnerability by creating a strong dependency between the power consumption and the sign of sensitive intermediate values. We exploit this dependency by introducing the novel absolute value prediction function, which can be employed in higher-order non-profiled multi-query Side-Channel Analysis (SCA) attacks. Our results reveal that - compared to classical reduction algorithms - employing the central reduction scheme leads to a two-orders-of-magnitude decrease in the number of required SCA measurements to exploit secrets of masked implementations. We particularly show that our approach is valid for the prime moduli employed by Kyber and Dilithium, the lattice-based post-quantum algorithms selected by NIST. We practically evaluate our introduced approach by performing second-order non-profiled attacks against an open-source masked implementation of Kyber on an ARM Cortex-M4 micro-processor. In our experiments, we revealed the full secret key of the aforementioned masked implementation with only 250 power traces without any forms of profiling or choosing the ciphertexts.

TI Polaritonic Unitary Coupled Cluster for Quantum Computations
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY LETTERS
AB In the field of polaritonic chemistry, strong light-matter interactions are used to alter chemical reactions inside optical cavities. To understand these processes, the development of reliable theoretical models is essential. While traditional methods have to balance accuracy and system size, new developments in quantum computing offer a path for accurate calculations on currently available quantum devices. Here, we introduce the quantum electrodynamics unitary coupled cluster (QED-UCC) method combined with the Variational Quantum Eigensolver algorithm, as well as the quantum electrodynamics equation-of-motion (QED-EOM) method formulated in the qubit basis that allow accurate calculations of ground-state and excited-state properties of strongly coupled light-matter systems suitable for quantum computers. These methods show excellent agreement with the exact reference results and can outperform their traditional counterparts when strong electronic correlations become significant. This work sets the stage for future developments of polaritonic quantum chemistry methods suitable for both classical and quantum computers.

TI Laplacian pair state transfer in Q-graph☆
SO DISCRETE APPLIED MATHEMATICS
AB In 2018, Chen and Godsil proposed the concept of Laplacian perfect pair state transfer which is a brilliant generalization of Laplacian perfect state transfer. Studying Laplacian pair state transfer will provide a theoretical foundation for constructing quantum communication networks capable of quantum state transfer. In this paper, we study the existence of Laplacian perfect pair state transfer in the Q-graph of an r-regular graph for r >= 2. By combining the spectral decomposition of the graph with the Laplacian eigenvalue support of pair state, we prove that the Q-graph of an r-regular graph does not have Laplacian perfect pair state transfer when r + 1 is prime or a power of 2. By contrast, we also give sufficient conditions for Q-graph to have Laplacian pretty good pair state transfer. The approach used in this paper can effectively verify the existence of Laplacian perfect (or pretty good) pair state transfer in other families of graphs. (c) 2025 Elsevier B.V.

TI Novel quantum solutions to privacy-preserving point-line relation
   determination
SO PHYSICA SCRIPTA
AB Secure multiparty computational geometry is an essential field of secure multiparty computation. It involves solving geometric problems without disclosing any private geometric information from each participating party. Privacy-preserving point-line relation determination, a pivotal branch of secure multiparty computational geometry, holds significant potential for applications in various domains, including business, engineering, and military. In this paper, leveraging the assistance of a third party, we introduce a quantum solution to privacy-preserving point-line relation determination. This approach incorporates quantum key distribution and one-time pad encryption. Under the condition that the third party does not conspire with any participant, our protocol ensures heightened security and enhanced privacy protection compared to classical methods. This superiority is attributed to the underlying principles of quantum mechanics and the utilization of one-time pad encryption. Furthermore, we extend our protocol to involve multiple third parties, employing the technology of quantum secret sharing. In scenarios where these third parties refrain from colluding with any single participant, no information is divulged to the other participant.

TI A review of mathematical and computational aspects of CSIDH algorithms
SO JOURNAL OF ALGEBRA AND ITS APPLICATIONS
AB CSIDH is a post-quantum key-exchange scheme based on the action of ideal class groups on supersingular elliptic curves over prime fields. Its short keys and ciphertexts, together with its flexibility as a building block to construct complex cryptographic primitives, has motivated significant research on the efficiency of CSIDH and its resistance against side-channel attacks. In this work, some cutting-edge results from recent contributions are reviewed in a unified treatment, focusing on the mathematical ideas lying behind them rather than on cryptographic and low-level implementation techniques. In particular, we first describe ways to speed up the class-group-action evaluation, which range from the use of different models of elliptic curves to working with different ideal class groups. We then survey some constant-time variants of CSIDH, that make the time and memory consumption during the computation of a public/shared key independent of the secret key. Finally, we examine the computation of the ideal class action when the structure of the ideal class group is known, which is the case for a specific set of CSIDH parameters.

TI High-Q plasmonic resonances from a transfer-printed diamond ring
   on a silver surface
SO JAPANESE JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS
AB Optically addressable point defects in diamond are promising physical platforms in quantum technologies. In particular, defects embedded in plasmonic devices can interact strongly with photons and provide a robust approach to engineering spin-photon interfaces. However, diamond-based plasmonic devices have low quality factors of Q less than or similar to 10 , constrained by fabrication difficulties. This study demonstrates the high- Q plasmonic resonance of optical emissions from nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond ring structures onto a silver surface, and experimentally shows that Q approximate to 179 . The proposed device can be easily fabricated using the transfer printing technique. These results address the lack of high- Q plasmonic cavities in diamond-based technologies.

TI Magnifying Side-Channel Leakage of Lattice-Based Cryptosystems With
   Chosen Ciphertexts: The Case Study of Kyber
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON COMPUTERS
AB Lattice-based cryptography, as an active branch of post-quantum cryptography (PQC), has drawn great attention from side-channel analysis researchers in recent years. Despite the various side-channel targets examined in previous studies, detail on revealing the secret-dependent information efficiently is less studied. In this paper, we propose adaptive EM side-channel attacks with carefully constructed ciphertexts on Kyber, which is a finalist of NIST PQC standardization project. We demonstrate that specially chosen ciphertexts allow an adversary to modulate the leakage of a target device and enable full key extraction with a small number of traces through simple power analysis. Compared to prior research, our techniques require fewer traces and avoid building complex templates. We practically evaluate our methods using both a reference implementation and the ARM-specific implementation in pqm4 library. For the reference implementation, we target the leakage of the output of the inverse NTT computation and recover the full key with only four traces. For the pqm4 implementation, we develop a message-recovery attack that leads to extraction of the full secret key with between eight and 960 traces, depending on the compiler optimization level. We discuss the relevance of our findings to other lattice-based schemes and explore potential countermeasures.

TI Optimizing Sensitivity of Quantum Interferometers: Mechanisms, Advances,
   and Future Challenges (Invited)
SO ACTA OPTICA SINICA
AB Significance A quantum interferometer is one of the core tools in the field of quantum precision measurement, combining quantum manipulation technology with interferometric measurement technology to achieve precision measurements beyond classical limits. Leveraging the advantages of quantum resources, this technology demonstrates significant application potential in quantum sensing fields such as displacement measurement, imaging, magnetic field measurement, angular velocity measurement, and electric field measurement. The typical workflow of a quantum interferometer includes quantum state preparation, phase modulation, interferometric measurement, and signal extraction. Based on interferometer structures, they are primarily classified into two types: linear interferometers and nonlinear interferometers. The core principle of linear quantum interferometers is to utilize the linear coherent superposition and interference effects of quantum states for phase measurement. This architecture combines the advantages of classical interferometers in terms of large phase-sensitive particle numbers with quantum advantages and high measurement precision, and has been successfully applied to quantum-enhanced detection of gravitational waves. Unlike linear quantum interferometers, nonlinear quantum interferometers utilize nonlinear interactions to control the interference process of quantum states. Their primary operational mechanisms include nonlinear phase-sensitive amplification and quantum correlation enhancement. As a result, they possess inherent advantages in suppressing nonlinear noise and amplifying signals, demonstrating greater adaptability in terms of environmental robustness. Optimization research on quantum interferometers will break through classical limits, laying the technological foundation for practical applications in the field of quantum sensing. Progress In the field of quantum interferometers, researchers have proposed and realized two configurations: linear interference (Fig. 1) and nonlinear interference (Fig. 2). Additionally, they have innovatively proposed a hybrid interferometer combining light and atoms on the physical carrier of the interference arm (Fig. 3). Due to the inherent fragility and complexity of quantum resources, the challenge of how to fully leverage quantum advantages in lossy environments to enhance the phase sensitivity of quantum interferometers has become a key obstacle to advancing their practical applications. In linear quantum interferometers, researchers have proposed optimal quantum resource allocation schemes (Fig. 5) to address internal losses and optimized quantum amplification compensation schemes (Fig. 6) to address external losses. Both types of schemes can reduce the impact of losses on quantum resources. In nonlinear quantum interferometers, researchers have proposed various optimization schemes, including: an asymmetric gain optimization scheme applicable to both external (Fig. 7) and internal (Fig. 8) losses; coherent feedback optimization (Fig. 9); and photon-level operations (Fig. 10). In the application field of quantum interferometers, typical technological breakthroughs include: LIGO achieving a 3 dB quantum noise advantage in low-frequency (around 50 Hz) gravitational wave detection (Fig. 11); approximately 1.2 dB electric field quantum enhancement measurement being achieved using common-path interference (Fig. 12); achieving a 5.
   5 dB quantum enhancement measurement of magnetic fields using entangled beams generated via four-wave mixing, with sensitivity reaching 18fT/(cm & sdot; Hz ) at 20 Hz (Fig. 13); achieving approximately 0.95 (degrees )/h angular rate bias stability by combining entangled photon pairs with a fiber-optic gyroscope (Fig. 14); quantum interference effects being used to suppress four-wave mixing noise in quantum memory (Fig. 15); a photon number quantum non-destructive measurement scheme based on light-atom hybrid interference being proposed (Fig. 16). Additionally, to maintain long-term stability of the quantum state, a multi-parameter dynamic optimization model constructed using deep neural networks is employed to achieve stable quantum state output for 2 h (Fig. 17). Conclusions and Prospects Quantum interferometers surpass the standard quantum limit (SQL) by leveraging quantum state resources, yet their phase sensitivity advantage is highly susceptible to degradation from photon loss and limited detection efficiency. Maintaining this quantum advantage presents a core challenge: achieving stable, high-sensitivity quantum manipulation. This paper systematically reviews research progress in this field. Theoretically, new mechanisms like optimal resource allocation and gain compensation have been developed. Technically, key breakthroughs include high-loss-tolerant designs and noise suppression techniques. Although existing loss mitigation schemes show significant promise, the fundamental problem of absolute sensitivity decaying with loss remains unresolved. Notably, multi-parameter control techniques based on artificial intelligence have effectively enhanced quantum light source stability, offering new pathways to suppress environmental disturbances. Developing intelligent control methods to simultaneously address quantum decoherence and phase instability will be critical for realizing practical quantum precision measurement systems.

AB Indistinguishability is a crucial element for quantuminterferencein scalable quantum information processing. Here, we demonstrate theability to erase the distinguishability of a nondegenerate two-photonstate using Bragg-scattering four-wave mixing (BS-FWM) by tuning theidler-photon frequency.

TI Generating arbitrary analytically solvable two-level systems
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS A-MATHEMATICAL AND THEORETICAL
AB We present a new approach for generating arbitrary analytically solvable two-level systems. This method offers the ability to completely derive all analytically solvable Hamiltonians for any analytical evolutions of two-level systems. To demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach, we reconstruct the Rosen-Zener model and generate several new exact solutions. Using this approach, we present the exact evolution of the semi-classical Rabi model with new analytical properties. The parameters used to generate Hamiltonians have direct physical interpretations within the Bloch sphere, the quantum speed limit, and the geometric phase. As a result, the physical properties of the generated Hamiltonian are highly controllable, which plays a significant role in the fields of quantum control, quantum computing, and quantum information.

TI Steady-state entanglement in a hybrid optomechanical system enhanced by
   optical parametric amplifiers
SO OPTICS CONTINUUM
AB In this paper, we investigate the degree of steady-state entanglement using a hybrid optomechanical system, where the separate cavities contain a degenerate optical parametric amplifier (DOPA). Particularly, under the linearization approximation, the steady-state entan-glement is quantified through logarithmic negativity. The bipartite entanglement between cavity-mechanical oscillator modes and two cavity modes is analyzed through the applicable choice of nonlinear gain of OPA, optical cavity detuning, and cavity-cavity coupling strength. It is found that the steady-state entanglement increases with the nonlinear gain of OPA medium and normalized detuning. We further emphasize the influence of cavity-cavity coupling parameter on the bipartite entanglement, and the generation of entanglement can be transferred entirely due to the coupling strengths. The main contribution of coupling parameters on the entanglement of the two modes of mechanical oscillators significantly altered and increased. The observed possibility of transferring the emerging entanglement of the states of light in the two cavities to the modes of the accompanying mechanical oscillators is expected to be a valuable asset in the practical realization of quantum information processing.

TI Recurrent quantum embedding neural network and its application in
   vulnerability detection
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB In recent years, deep learning has been widely used in vulnerability detection with remarkable results. These studies often apply natural language processing (NLP) technologies due to the natural similarity between code and language. Since NLP usually consumes a lot of computing resources, its combination with quantum computing is becoming a valuable research direction. In this paper, we present a Recurrent Quantum Embedding Neural Network (RQENN) for vulnerability detection. It aims to reduce the memory consumption of classical models for vulnerability detection tasks and improve the performance of quantum natural language processing (QNLP) methods. We show that the performance of RQENN achieves the above goals. Compared with the classic model, the space complexity of each stage of its execution is exponentially reduced, and the number of parameters used and the number of bits consumed are significantly reduced. Compared with other QNLP methods, RQENN uses fewer qubit resources and achieves a 15.7% higher accuracy in vulnerability detection.

TI Interaction induced non-reciprocal three-level quantum transport*
SO CHINESE PHYSICS B
AB Besides its fundamental importance, non-reciprocity has also found many potential applications in quantum technology. Recently, many quantum systems have been proposed to realize non-reciprocity, but stable non-reciprocal process is still experimentally difficult in general, due to the needed cyclical interactions in artificial systems or operational difficulties in solid state materials. Here, we propose a new kind of interaction induced non-reciprocal operation, based on the conventional stimulated-Raman-adiabatic-passage (STIRAP) setup, which removes the experimental difficulty of requiring cyclical interaction, and thus it is directly implementable in various quantum systems. Furthermore, we also illustrate our proposal on a chain of three coupled superconducting transmons, which can lead to a non-reciprocal circulator with high fidelity without a ring coupling configuration as in the previous schemes or implementations. Therefore, our protocol provides a promising way to explore fundamental non-reciprocal quantum physics as well as realize non-reciprocal quantum device.

Using two atoms in individually controlled optical tweezers coupled to a nanofabricated photonic crystal cavity, we demonstrate entanglement generation, fast nondestructive readout, and full quantum control of atomic qubits. The entangled state is verified in free space after being transported away from the cavity by encoding the qubits into long-lived states and using dynamical decoupling. Our approach bridges quantum operations at an optical link and in free space with a coherent one-way transport, potentially enabling an integrated optical interface for atomic quantum processors.

TI Quantum Secure Communication Between Service Provider and Sim
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB In resource-constrained devices such as Subscriber Identity Module (SIM), the possibility of using authentication and key exchange methods, which include the mutual verification of two parties to ensure the security of communication, provides a significant advantage. As the cost efficient computations may not be efficiently performed on resource-constrained devices, security is the main problem for SIMs. With the advancing technology and the use of quantum computers, it is predicted that this may lead to threats. It is a well-known fact that security on traditional public key cryptosystems will become vulnerable by using quantum computers due to Shor's algorithm. In this paper, two different resistant to quantum attacks structures are proposed to ensure secure communication between SIM and service providers. In the proposed methods, Advanced Encryption Standard (AES-256) is used for communication with resource-constrained devices, and N-th degree Truncated polynomial Ring Units (NTRU) encryption system is used for communication with servers. Two methods are proposed, one with the private key and one without the private key in the production phase. This protocol provides authentication, data privacy and integrity for post-quantum SIM cards. The proposed method is inspired by the FLAT (Federated Lightweight Authentication) protocol. However, the main difference from the FLAT protocol is that it has more nodes and is resistant to quantum attacks.

TI Fast Adiabatic Control of an Optomechanical Cavity
SO ENTROPY
AB The development of quantum technologies present important challenges such as the need for fast and precise protocols for implementing quantum operations. Shortcuts to adiabaticity (STAs) are a powerful tool for achieving these goals, as they enable us to perform an exactly adiabatic evolution in finite time. In this paper, we present a shortcut to adiabaticity for the control of an optomechanical cavity with two moving mirrors. Given reference trajectories for the mirrors, we find analytical expressions that give us effective trajectories which implement an STA for the quantum field inside the cavity. We then solve these equations numerically for different reference protocols, such as expansions, contractions and rigid motions, thus confirming the successful implementation of the STA and finding some general features of these effective trajectories.

TI Evidence of the inverse proximity effect in tunnel magnetic josephson
   junctions
SO LOW TEMPERATURE PHYSICS
AB Magnetic Josephson junctions (MJJs) are a special class of hybrid systems where antagonistic correlations coexist, thus providing a key for advances in weak superconductivity, superconducting spintronics, and quantum computation. So far, the memory properties of MJJs have been mostly investigated in view of digital electronics and for spintronic devices at liquid-helium temperature. At the operating temperature of quantum circuits, a magnetic order can rise in a superconductor (S) at the S/ferromagnet (F) interface, i.e., the inverse proximity effect (IPE), thus leading to a significant modification of the magnetic field patterns in MJJs. In this work, we have carried out a comparative investigation of the magnetic behavior of tunnel MJJs with a strong ferromagnetic layer inserted in the layout of both Nb and Al JJs, respectively. The comparative analysis validates the crucial role of the temperature, the fundamental scaling energies of S/F coupling systems, and the transparency of the S/F interface. This investigation points out that the IPE is a key aspect to consider when designing tunnel MJJs operating well below 4 K and thus in the perspective of hybrid superconducting quantum architectures.

TI Concomitant Entanglement and Control Criticality Driven by Collective
   Measurements
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Adaptive quantum circuits-where a quantum many-body state is controlled using measurements and conditional unitary operations-are a powerful paradigm for state preparation and quantum error- correction tasks. They can support two types of nonequilibrium quantum phase transitions: measurement- induced transitions between volume- and area-law-entangled steady states and control-induced transitions where the system falls into an absorbing state or, more generally, an orbit visiting several absorbing states. Within this context, nonlocal conditional operations can alter the critical properties of the two transitions and the topology of the phase diagram. Here, we consider the scenario where the measurements are nonlocal, in order to engineer efficient control onto dynamical trajectories. Motivated by Rydberg-atom arrays, we consider a locally constrained model with global sublattice magnetization measurements and local correction operations to steer the system's dynamics onto a many-body orbit with finite recurrence time. The model has a well-defined classical limit, which we leverage to aid our analysis of the control transition. As a function of the density of local correction operations, we find control and entanglement transitions with continuously varying critical exponents. For sufficiently high densities of local correction operations, we find that both transitions acquire a dynamical critical exponent z < 1, reminiscent of criticality in longrange power-law interacting systems. At low correction densities, we find that the criticality reverts to a short-range nature with z greater than or similar to 1. In the long-range regime, the control and entanglement transitions are indistinguishable to within the resolution of our finite-size numerics, while in the short-range regime we find evidence that the transitions become distinct. We conjecture that the effective long-range criticality mediated by collective measurements is essential in driving the two transitions together.

TI Low variance estimations of many observables with tensor networks and
   informationally-complete measurements
SO QUANTUM
AB Accurately estimating the properties of quantum systems is a central challenge in quantum computing and quantum information. We propose a method to obtain unbiased estimators of multiple observables with low statistical error by post-processing informationally complete measurements using tensor networks. Compared to other observable estimation protocols based on classical shadows and measurement frames, our approach offers several advantages: (i) it can be optimized to provide lower statistical error, resulting in a reduced measurement budget to achieve a a large number of qubits due to the tensor network structure; (iii) it can be applied to any measurement protocol with measurement operators that have an efficient tensor-network representation. We benchmark the method through various numerical examples, including spin and chemical systems, and show that our orders of magnitude lower than the ones given by classical shadows.

AB The Poisson equation has many applications across the broad areas of science and engineering. Most quantum algorithms for the Poisson solver presented so far, either suffer from lack of accuracy and/or are limited to very small sizes of the problem, and thus have no practical usage. Here we present an advanced quantum algorithm for solving the Poisson equation with high accuracy and dynamically tunable problem size. After converting the Poisson equation to the linear systems through the finite difference method, we adopt the Harrow-Hassidim-Lloyd (HHL) algorithm as the basic framework. Particularly, in this work we present an advanced circuit that ensures the accuracy of the solution by implementing non-truncated eigenvalues through eigenvalue amplification as well as by increasing the accuracy of the controlled rotation angular coefficients, which are the critical factors in the HHL algorithm. We show that our algorithm not only increases the accuracy of the solutions, but also composes more practical and scalable circuits by dynamically controlling problem size in the NISQ devices. We present both simulated and experimental results, and discuss the sources of errors. Finally, we conclude that overall results on the quantum hardware are dominated by the error in the CNOT gates.

TI Long-Distance Superexchange between Semiconductor Quantum-Dot Electron
   Spins
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Because of their long coherence times and potential for scalability, semiconductor quantum-dot spin qubits hold great promise for quantum information processing. However, maintaining high connectivity between quantum-dot spin qubits, which favor linear arrays with nearest neighbor coupling, presents a challenge for large-scale quantum computing. In this work, we present evidence for long-distance spinchain-mediated superexchange coupling between electron spin qubits in semiconductor quantum dots. We weakly couple two electron spins to the ends of a two-site spin chain. Depending on the spin state of the chain, we observe oscillations between the distant end spins. We resolve the dynamics of both the end spins and the chain itself, and our measurements agree with simulations. Superexchange is a promising technique to create long-distance coupling between quantum-dot spin qubits.

TI Evolution of 1/f Flux Noise in Superconducting Qubits with Weak Magnetic
   Fields
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB The microscopic description of 1/f magnetic flux noise in superconducting circuits has remained an open question for several decades despite extensive experimental and theoretical investigation. Recent progress in superconducting devices for quantum information has highlighted the need to mitigate sources of qubit decoherence, driving a renewed interest in understanding the underlying noise mechanism(s). Though a consensus has emerged attributing flux noise to surface spins, their identity and interaction mechanisms remain unclear, prompting further study. Here, we apply weak in-plane magnetic fields to a capacitively shunted flux qubit (where the Zeeman splitting of surface spins lies below the device temperature) and study the flux-noise-limited qubit dephasing, revealing previously unexplored trends that may shed light on the dynamics behind the emergent 1/f noise. Notably, we observe an enhancement (suppression) of the spin-echo (Ramsey) pure-dephasing time in fields up to B 1/4 100 G. With direct noise spectroscopy, we further observe a transition from a 1/f to approximately Lorentzian frequency dependence below 10 Hz and a reduction of the noise above 1 MHz with increasing magnetic field. We suggest that these trends are qualitatively consistent with an increase of spin cluster sizes with magnetic field. These results should help to inform a complete microscopic theory of 1/f flux noise in superconducting circuits.

TI Variational Hamiltonian simulation for translational invariant systems
   via classical pre-processing
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB The simulation of time evolution of large quantum systems is a classically challenging and in general intractable task, making it a promising application for quantum computation. A Trotter-Suzuki approximation yields an implementation thereof, where a higher approximation accuracy can be traded for an increased gate count. In this work, we introduce a variational algorithm which uses solutions of classical optimizations to predict efficient quantum circuits for time evolution of translationally invariant quantum systems. Our strategy can improve upon the Trotter-Suzuki accuracy by several orders of magnitude. It translates into a reduction in gate count and hence gain in overall fidelity at the same algorithmic accuracy. This is important in noisy intermediate scale quantum-applications where the fidelity of the output state decays exponentially with the number of gates. The performance advantage of our classical assisted strategy can be extended to open boundaries with translational symmetry in the bulk. We can extrapolate our method to beyond classically simulatable system sizes, maintaining its total fidelity advantage over a Trotter-Suzuki approximation making it an interesting candidate for beyond classical time evolution.

TI Fast-forwarding quantum evolution
SO QUANTUM
AB We investigate the problem of fast-forwarding quantum evolution, whereby the dynamics of certain quantum systems can be simulated with gate complexity that is sublinear in the evolution time. We provide a definition of fast-forwarding that considers the model of quantum computation, the Hamiltonians that induce the evolution, and the properties of the initial states. Our definition accounts for any asymptotic complexity improvement of the general case and we use it to demonstrate fast-forwarding in several quantum systems. In particular, we show that some local spin systems whose Hamiltonians can be taken into block diagonal form using an efficient quantum circuit, such as those that are permutation-invariant, can be exponentially fast-forwarded. We also show that certain classes of positive semidefinite local spin systems, also known as frustration-free, can be polynomially fast-forwarded, provided the initial state is supported on a subspace of sufficiently low energies. Last, we show that all quadratic fermionic systems and number-conserving quadratic bosonic systems can be exponentially fast-forwarded in a model where quantum gates are exponentials of specific fermionic or bosonic operators, respectively. Our results extend the classes of physical Hamiltonians that were previously known to be fast-forwarded, while not necessarily requiring methods that diagonalize the Hamiltonians efficiently. We further develop a connection between fast-forwarding and precise energy measurements that also accounts for polynomial improvements.

TI Uniquely identifying topological order based on boundary-bulk duality
   and anyon condensation
SO NATIONAL SCIENCE REVIEW
AB Topological order is a new quantum phase that is beyond Landau's symmetry-breaking paradigm. Its defining features include robust degenerate ground states, long-range entanglement and anyons. It was known that R and F matrices, which characterize the fusion-braiding properties of anyons, can be used to uniquely identify topological order. In this article, we explore an essential question: how can the R and F matrices be experimentally measured? We show that the braidings, i.e. the R matrices, can be completely determined by the half braidings of boundary excitations due to the boundary-bulk duality and the anyon condensation. The F matrices can also be measured by comparing the quantum states involving the fusion of three anyons in two different orders. Thus we provide a model-independent experimental protocol to uniquely identify topological order. By using quantum simulations based on a toric code model with boundaries encoded in three- and four-qubit systems and state-of-the-art technology, we obtain the first experimental measurement of R and F matrices by means of an NMR quantum computer at room temperature.
   A protocol to uniquely identify topological orders by measuring the fingerprints of anyons is proposed and demonstrated in few-qubit systems.

SO REPORTS ON PROGRESS IN PHYSICS
AB We review the mathematical speed limits on quantum information processing in many-body systems. After the proof of the Lieb-Robinson Theorem in 1972, the past two decades have seen substantial developments in its application to other questions, such as the simulatability of quantum systems on classical or quantum computers, the generation of entanglement, and even the properties of ground states of gapped systems. Moreover, Lieb-Robinson bounds have been extended in non-trivial ways, to demonstrate speed limits in systems with power-law interactions or interacting bosons, and even to prove notions of locality that arise in cartoon models for quantum gravity with all-to-all interactions. We overview the progress which has occurred, highlight the most promising results and techniques, and discuss some central outstanding questions which remain open. To help bring newcomers to the field up to speed, we provide self-contained proofs of the field's most essential results.

TI Triplet-ground-state nonalternant nanographene with high stability and
   long spin lifetimes
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB High-spin carbon-based polyradicals exhibit significant potential for applications in quantum information storage and sensing; however, their practical application is hampered by limited structural diversity and chemical instability. Here, we report a straightforward synthetic and isolation method for synthesizing a nonalternant nanographene (1) with a triplet ground state. Moving beyond the classic m-xylylene scaffold for high-spin organic molecules, seven-five-seven (7-5-7)-membered rings are introduced to create stable high-spin diradicals with half-lives (t1/2) as long as 101 days. Moreover, considering the spin relaxation of compound 1, with a spin-lattice relaxation time (T1) of 53.55 ms and a coherence time (Tm) of 3.41 mu s at 10 K, the compound 1 shows great promise for applications in spin-based information retention and quantum computing.

AB Quantum circuits can be reduced through optimization to better fit the constraints of quantum hardware. One such method, initial-state dependent optimization (ISDO), reduces gate count by leveraging knowledge of the input quantum states.
   Surprisingly, we found that ISDO is broadly applicable to the downstream circuits produced by circuit cutting. Circuit cutting also requires measuring upstream qubits and has some flexibility of selection observables to do reconstruction. Therefore, we propose a state-dependent optimization (SDO) framework that incorporates ISDO, our newly proposed measure-state dependent optimization (MSDO), and a biased observable selection strategy. Building on the strengths of the SDO framework and recognizing the scalability challenges of circuit cutting, we propose non-separate circuit cutting-a more flexible approach that enables optimizing gates without fully separating them.
   We validate our methods on noisy simulations of QAOA, QFT, and BV circuits. Results show that our approach consistently mitigates noise and improves overall circuit performance, demonstrating its promise for enhancing quantum algorithm execution on near-term hardware.

AB We demonstrate an important step toward on-chip integration of single-photon sources at room temperature. Excellent photon directionality is achieved with a hybrid metal-dielectric bullseye antenna, while back-excitation is permitted by placement of the emitter in a subwavelength hole positioned at its center. The unique design enables a direct back-excitation and very efficient front coupling of emission either to a low numerical aperture (NA) optics or directly to an optical fiber. To show the versatility of the concept, we fabricate devices containing either a colloidal quantum dot or a nanodiamond containing silicon-vacancy centers, which are accurately positioned using two different nanopositioning methods. Both of these back-excited devices display front collection efficiencies of similar to 70% at NAs as low as 0.5. The combination of back-excitation with forward directionality enables direct coupling of the emitted photons into a proximal optical fiber without any coupling optics, thereby facilitating and simplifying future integration.

TI Reference Frame Induced Symmetry Breaking on Holographic Screens
SO SYMMETRY-BASEL
AB Any interaction between finite quantum systems in a separable joint state can be viewed as encoding classical information on an induced holographic screen. Here we show that when such an interaction is represented as a measurement, the quantum reference frames (QRFs) deployed to identify systems and pick out their pointer states induce decoherence, breaking the symmetry of the holographic encoding in an observer-relative way. Observable entanglement, contextuality, and classical memory are, in this representation, logical and temporal relations between QRFs. Sharing entanglement as a resource requires a priori shared QRFs.

TI A hyperdeterminant on fermionic Fock space
SO ANNALES DE L INSTITUT HENRI POINCARE D
AB Twenty years ago, Cayley's hyperdeterminant, the degree four invariant of the polynomial ring C[C-2 circle times C-2 circle times C-2](SL2(C)x3),was popularized in modern physics as it separates genuine entanglement classes in the three-qubit Hilbert space and is connected to entropy formulas for special solutions of black holes. In this note, we compute the analogous invariant on the fermionic Fock space for N = 8, i.e., spin particles with four different locations, and show how this invariant projects to other well-known invariants in quantum information. We also give combinatorial interpretations of these formulas.

TI Generalized entropic quantum speed limits
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We present a class of generalized entropic quantum speed limits based on alpha-z-R & eacute;nyi relative entropy, a real-valued, contractive, two-parameter family of distinguishability measures. The quantum speed limit (QSL) falls into the class of Mandelstam-Tamm bounds, and it applies to finite-dimensional quantum systems that undergo a general physical process, i.e., their effective dynamics can be modeled by unitary or nonunitary evolutions. The results cover pure or mixed, separable, and entangled probe quantum states. The QSL time depends on the smallest and largest eigenvalues of the probe and instantaneous states of the system, and its evaluation requires low computational cost. In addition, it is inversely proportional to the time-average of the Schatten speed of the instantaneous state, which in turn is fully characterized by the considered dynamics. We specialize our results to the case of unitary and nonunitary evolutions. In the former case, the QSL scales with the inverse of the energy fluctuations, while the latter depends on the Schatten 1-norm of the rate of change of the quantum channel Kraus operators. We illustrate our findings for single-qubit and two-qubit states, and unitary and nonunitary evolutions. Our results may find applications in the study of entropic uncertainty relations, quantum metrology, and also entanglement entropies signaled by generalized entropies.

TI On-Chip 3D Printing of Polymer Waveguide-Coupled Single-Photon Emitter
   Based on Colloidal Quantum Dots
SO POLYMERS
AB In the field of quantum technology, there has been a growing interest in fully integrated systems that employ single photons due to their potential for high performance and scalability. Here, a simple method is demonstrated for creating on-chip 3D printed polymer waveguide-coupled single-photon emitters based on colloidal quantum dots (QDs). By using a simple low-one photon absorption technique, we were able to create a 3D polymeric crossed-arc waveguide structure with a bright QD on top. These waveguides can conduct both excitation laser and emitted single photons, which facilitates the characterization of single-photon signals at different outputs with a conventional confocal scanning system. To optimize the guiding effect of the polymeric waveguide structures, comprehensive 3D finite-difference time-domain simulations were performed. Our method provides a straightforward and cost-effective way to integrate high-performance single-photon sources with on-chip photonic devices, enabling scalable and versatile quantum photonic circuits for various applications.

TI Quantum image encryption algorithm based on four-dimensional chaos
SO FRONTIERS IN PHYSICS
AB Background: Quantum image processing is rapidly developing in the field of quantum computing, and it can be successfully implemented on the Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) device. Quantum image encryption holds a pivotal position in this domain. However, the encryption process often encounters security vulnerabilities and entails complex computational complexities, thereby consuming substantial quantum resources. To address this, the present study proposes a quantum image encryption algorithm based on four-dimensional chaos.Methods: The classical image is first encoded into quantum information using the Generalized Quantum Image Representation (GQIR) method. Subsequently, the trajectory of the four-dimensional chaotic system is randomized, and multi-dimensional chaotic keys are generated to initially encrypt the pixel values of the image. Then, the Arnold transformation is applied to randomly encrypt the pixel positions, resulting in the encrypted image. During the decryption process, the inverse process of encryption is employed to restore the original image.Results: We simulated this process in the Python environment, and the information entropy analysis experiment showed that the information entropy of the three encrypted images reached above 7.999, so the system has good encryption. At the same time, the correlation of the pixel distribution after the encryption algorithm is weak, which proves that the control parameters of the chaotic system can effectively reduce the correlation between pixels in the image. In the final key space analysis, the key space issued by our encryption can reach $10140\gg 2128$.Conclusion: Our method is resistant to destructive attacks and can produce scrambled images with higher encryption and usability. This algorithm solves the problems of general encryption algorithms such as periodicity, small key space, and vulnerability to statistical analysis, and proposes a reliable and effective encryption scheme. By making full use of the characteristics of Arnold transformation permutation, ergodicity and the randomness of the four-dimensional chaotic system, the encryption algorithm uses the larger key space provided by the four-dimensional Lorenz system.

TI Nonreciprocal single-photon state conversion between microwave and
   optical modes in a hybrid magnonic system
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB Coherent quantum transduction between microwave and optical signals is of great importance for long-distance quantum communication. Here we propose a novel scheme for the implementation of nonreciprocal single-photon state conversion between microwave and optical modes based on a hybrid magnonic system. A yttrium-iron-garnet (YIG) sphere with both the optomechanical and the optomagnetic properties is exploited to couple with a three-dimensional superconducting microwave resonator. The magnetostatic mode of the YIG sphere is treated as an intermediate to interact with the microwave and optical modes simultaneously. By manipulating the amplitudes and phase differences between the couplings via external driving fields, we show that the nonreciprocal microwave-light single-photon state conversion can be realized via the quantum interference effect.

TI Lower bounds for quantum-inspired classical algorithms via communication
   complexity
SO QUANTUM
AB Quantum-inspired classical algorithms provide us with a new way to understand the computational power of quantum computers for practically-relevant problems, especially in machine learning. In the past several years, numerous efficient algorithms for various tasks have been found, while an analysis of lower bounds is still missing. Using communication complexity, in this work we propose the first method to study lower bounds for these tasks. We mainly focus on lower bounds for solving linear regresand Hamiltonian simulations. For those problems, we prove a quadratic lower bound in terms of the Frobenius norm of the underlying matrix. As quantum algorithms are linear in the Frobenius norm for those problems, our results mean that the quantumclassical separation is at least quadratic. As a generalisation, we extend our method to study lower bounds analysis of quantum query algorithms for matrix-related problems using quantum communication complexity. Some applications are given.

TI Generalized quantum geometric tensor for excited states using the path
   integral approach
SO PHYSICA SCRIPTA
AB The quantum geometric tensor, composed of the quantum metric tensor and Berry curvature, fully encodes the parameter space geometry of a physical system. We first provide a formulation of the quantum geometrical tensor in the path integral formalism that can handle both the ground and excited states, making it useful to characterize excited state quantum phase transitions (ESQPT). In this setting, we also generalize the quantum geometric tensor to incorporate variations of the system parameters and the phase-space coordinates. This gives rise to an alternative approach to the quantum covariance matrix, from which we can get information about the quantum entanglement of Gaussian states through tools such as purity and von Neumann entropy. Second, we demonstrate the equivalence between the formulation of the quantum geometric tensor in the path integral formalism and other existing methods. Furthermore, we explore the geometric properties of the generalized quantum metric tensor in depth by calculating the Ricci tensor and scalar curvature for several quantum systems, providing insight into this geometric information.

TI Direct generation of entangled photon pairs in nonlinear optical
   waveguides
SO NANOPHOTONICS
AB Entangled photons are pivotal elements in emerging quantum information technologies. While several schemes are available for the production of entangled photons, they typically require the assistance of cumbersome optical elements to couple them to other components involved in logic operations. Here, we introduce a scheme by which entangled photon pairs are directly generated as guided mode states in optical waveguides. The scheme relies on the intrinsic nonlinearity of the waveguide material, circumventing the use of bulky optical components and their associated phase-matching constraints. Specifically, we consider an optical waveguide under normal illumination, so that photon down-conversion can take place to waveguide states emitted with opposite momentum into a spectral region populated by only two accessible modes. By additionally configuring the external illumination to interfere different incident directions, we can produce maximally entangled photon-pair states, directly generated as waveguide modes with conversion efficiencies that are competitive with respect to existing macroscopic schemes. These results should find application in the design of more efficient and compact quantum optics devices.

TI Entanglement dynamics for two-level quantum systems coupled with massive
   scalar fields
SO PHYSICS LETTERS A
AB Entanglement is essential in quantum information science. Typically, the inevitable coupling between quantum systems and environment inhibits entanglement from being created between long-distance subsystems and being maintained for a long time. In this paper, we show that when the environment is composed of a bath of massive scalar fields, the region of the separation within which entanglement can be generated is significantly enlarged, and the decay rate of entanglement is significantly slowed down compared with those in the massless case, when the mass of the field mis smaller than but close to the transition frequency of the qubits omega. When m >= omega, the initial entanglement can be maintained for an arbitrarily long time, regardless of the environmental temperature. Therefore, in principle, it is possible to achieve long-distance entanglement generation and long-lived entanglement by manipulating the energy level spacing of the two-level systems with respect to the mass of the field.

TI Computationally efficient zero-noise extrapolation for
   quantum-gate-error mitigation
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Zero-noise extrapolation (ZNE) is a widely used technique for gate-error mitigation on near-term quantum computers because it can be implemented in software and does not require knowledge of the quantum computer noise parameters. Traditional ZNE requires a significant resource overhead in terms of quantum operations. A recent proposal using a targeted (or random) instead of fixed identity insertion method (RIIM versus FIIM) requires significantly fewer quantum gates for the same formal precision. We start by showing that RIIM can allow for ZNE to be deployed on deeper circuits than FIIM but requires many more measurements to achieve the same level of statistical uncertainty. We develop two extensions to FIIM and RIIM. The list identity insertion method allows us to mitigate the error from certain controlled-NOT (CNOT) gates, typically those with the largest error. The set identity insertion method naturally interpolates between the measurement-efficient FIIM and the gate-efficient RIIM, allowing us to trade off fewer CNOT gates for more measurements. Finally, we investigate a way to boost the number of measurements, namely, to run ZNE in parallel, utilizing as many quantum devices as are available. We explore the performance of RIIM in a parallel setting where there is a nontrivial spread in noise across sets of qubits within or across quantum computers.

TI Optimization of Interval Type-2 Fuzzy Logic Controller Using Real-Coded
   Quantum Clonal Selection Algorithm
SO ELEKTRONIKA IR ELEKTROTECHNIKA
AB In recent years, quantum computing has gained immense popularity with the production of real quantum computers. Researchers have developed quantum-inspired evolutionary algorithms (QIEAs) to solve combinatorial optimization problems and have obtained successful results. As a special case of QIEAs, real-coded quantum evolutionary algorithm (RCQEA) is used in the optimization of high-dimensional complex problems. In this study, a novel mechanism of the quantum rotation gate (QRG) that is used to determine the rotation angle of the qubit in the RCQEA is introduced and implemented to accelerate the evolutionary process and increase the possibility of finding the optimal solution. Moreover, the skeleton of RCQEA is modified by using a clonal selection mechanism, and the real-coded quantum clonal selection algorithm (RCQCSA) is developed. Our proposed QRG accelerates the convergence speed of the algorithm. The main purpose of this study is to present a more effective algorithm that inspires quantum computing principles for optimizing the interval type-2 fuzzy logic controller (IT2FLC) membership functions (MFs). In this study, four different comparisons are made with these two different algorithms that have the original version of QRG and our proposed QRG. Optimized IT2FLC provides stabilization of the inverted pendulum system. The results show that the RCQCSA having our proposed QRG outperforms RCQEA in stabilizing the inverted pendulum system by optimizing the IT2FLC parameters.

TI Constacyclic codes over FqST and their applications
SO AKCE INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GRAPHS AND COMBINATORICS
AB Let q=pr, where p is an odd prime and r is a positive integer. Consider a ring FqST, where S=Fq+uFq+vFq+uvFq with u2=1,v2=1,uv=vu and T=Fq+uFq+vFq+wFq+uvFq+uwFq+vwFq+uvwFq with u2=1,v2=1,w2=1,uv=vu,uw=wu,vw=wv. In this paper, we examine the algebraic structure of constacyclic codes over the ring FqST of block length (alpha,beta,gamma). Further, a construction of quantum error-correcting codes (QECCs) from constacyclic codes over FqST is also given. Moreover, we derive a number of new QECCs.

TI Utilizing quantum processor for the analysis of strongly correlated
   materials
SO PHYSICA SCRIPTA
AB This study introduces a systematic approach for analyzing strongly correlated systems by adapting the conventional quantum cluster method to a quantum circuit model. We have developed a more concise formula for calculating the cluster's Green's function, requiring only real-number computations on the quantum circuit instead of complex ones. This approach is inherently more suited to quantum circuits, which primarily yield statistical probabilities. As an illustrative example, we explored the Hubbard model on a 2D lattice. The ground state was determined utilizing Xiaohong, a superconducting quantum processor equipped with 66 qubits, supplied by QuantumCTek Co., Ltd. Subsequently, we employed the circuit model with controllable noise to compute the real-time retarded Green's function for the cluster, which is then used to determine the lattice Green's function. We conducted an examination of the band structure in the insulator phase of the lattice system. This preliminary investigation lays the groundwork for exploring a wealth of innovative physics within the field of condensed matter physics.

TI THE FREDKIN GATE IN REVERSIBLE AND QUANTUM ENVIRONMENTS
SO FACTA UNIVERSITATIS-SERIES ELECTRONICS AND ENERGETICS
AB Reversible Computing circuits are characterized by low power consumption and their proximity to circuits for quantum computing. The Fredkin gate was one of the earliest proposed controlled reversible circuits, which however, was soon superseded by the Toffoli gate, the NOT, and CNOT gates, which constituting a flexible functionally complete set could also realize the Fredkin gate as a building block. In quantum computing circuits, the Fredkin gate (under the name controlled SWAP) plays an important role regarding the superposition of states. The present paper studies extensions of the Fredkin gate in terms of mixed polarity in the reversible domain and an application in quantum computing.

TI Renormalized Von Neumann entropy with application to entanglement in
   genuine infinite dimensional systems
SO QUANTUM INFORMATION PROCESSING
AB A renormalized version of the von Neumann quantum entropy (which is finite and continuous in general, infinite dimensional case) which obeys several of the natural physical demands (as expected for a "good" measure of entanglement in the case of general quantum states describing bipartite and infinite-dimensional systems) is proposed. The renormalized quantum entropy is defined by the explicit use of the Fredholm determinants theory. To prove the main results on continuity and finiteness of the introduced renormalization, the fundamental Grothendick approach, which is based on the infinite dimensional Grassmann algebra theory, is applied. Several features of majorization theory are preserved under the introduced renormalization as it is proved in this paper. This fact allows to extend most of the known (mainly, in the context of two-partite, finite-dimensional quantum systems) results of the LOCC comparison theory to the case of genuine infinite-dimensional, two-partite quantum systems.

TI Enhanced Entanglement of the Two Cavity Modes in the Laguerre-Gaussian
   Cavity Optorotating System via an Optical Parametric Amplifier
SO PHOTONICS
AB Quantum entanglement in macroscopic systems plays an important role in quantum information processing. Here, we show that the steady-state entanglement between the two cavity modes in the macroscopic Laguerre-Gaussian (L-G) cavity optorotating system can be enhanced by placing a degenerate optical parametric amplifier (OPA) inside the cavity. The two L-G cavity modes are coupled to the same rotating mirror and are respectively driven at the red and blue mechanical sidebands. We use the logarithmic negativity to quantify the steady-state entanglement between the two cavity modes. We study the influences of the nonlinear gain and phase of the OPA, the temperature of the environment, and the angular momentums of the two cavity modes on the entanglement between the two cavity modes. In the cryogenic environment temperatures, when the angular momentums of the two cavity modes are identical, the enhancement of the entanglement between the two cavity modes by the OPA is the most significant.

TI Properties of Noncommutative Renyi and Augustin Information
SO COMMUNICATIONS IN MATHEMATICAL PHYSICS
AB Renyi and Augustin information are generalizations of mutual information defined via the Renyi divergence, playing a significant role in evaluating the performance of information processing tasks by virtue of its connection to the error exponent analysis. In quantum information theory, there are three generalizations of the classical Renyi divergence-the Petz's, sandwiched, and log-Euclidean versions, that possess meaningful operational interpretation. However, the associated quantum Renyi and Augustin information are much less explored compared with their classical counterpart, and lacking crucial properties hinders applications of these quantities to error exponent analysis in the quantum regime. The goal of this paper is to analyze fundamental properties of the Renyi and Augustin information from a noncommutative measure-theoretic perspective. Firstly, we prove the uniform equicontinuity for all three quantum versions of Renyi and Augustin information, and it hence yields the joint continuity of these quantities in order and prior input distributions. Secondly, we establish the concavity of the scaled Renyi and Augustin information in the region of s is an element of (-1, 0) for both Petz's and the sandwiched versions. This completes the open questions raised by Holevo (IEEE Trans Inf Theory 46(6):2256-2261, 2000), and Mosonyi and Ogawa (Commun Math Phys 355(1):373-426, 2017). For the applications, we show that the strong converse exponent in classical-quantum channel coding satisfies a minimax identity, which means that the strong converse exponent can be attained by the best constant composition code. The established concavity is further employed to prove an entropic duality between classical data compression with quantum side information and classical-quantum channel coding, and a Fenchel duality in joint source-channel coding with quantum side information.

TI Limitations of probabilistic error cancellation for open dynamics beyond
   sampling overhead
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Quantum simulation of dynamics is an important goal in the noisy intermediate -scale quantum era, within which quantum error mitigation may be a viable path towards modifying or eliminating the effects of noise. Most studies on quantum error mitigation have focused on the resource cost due to its exponential scaling in the circuit depth. Methods such as probabilistic error cancellation rely on discretizing the evolution into finite time steps and applying the mitigation layer after each time step, modifying only the noise part without any Hamiltonian dependence. This may lead to Trotter -like errors in the simulation results even if the error mitigation is implemented ideally, which means that the number of samples is taken as infinite. Here we analyze the aforementioned errors which have been largely neglected before. We show that they are determined by the commutating relations between the superoperators of the unitary part, the device noise part, and the noise part of the open dynamics to be simulated. We include both digital quantum simulation and analog quantum simulation setups and consider defining the ideal error mitigation map both by exactly inverting the noise channel and by approximating it to first order in the time step. We use single-qubit toy models to numerically demonstrate our findings. Our results illustrate fundamental limitations of applying probabilistic error cancellation in a stepwise manner to continuous dynamics, thus motivating the investigations of truly time -continuous error cancellation methods.

TI An improvement of a key exchange protocol relying on polynomial maps
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICS FOR INDUSTRY
AB Akiyama et al. [A key exchange protocol relying on polynomial maps, Int. J. Math. Ind. 11 (2019) 195003] proposed a post-quantum key exchange protocol that is based on the hardness of solving a system of multivariate nonlinear polynomial equations but has a design strategy different from ordinary multivariate cryptography. Their protocol has two versions, an original one and a modified one, where the modified one has a trade-off that its security is strengthened while it has nonzero error probability in establishing a common key. In fact, the evaluation in their paper suggests that the probability of failing to establish a common key by the modified protocol with the proposed parameter set is impractically high. In this paper, we improve the success probability of Akiyama et al.'s modified key exchange protocol significantly while keeping the security, by restricting each component of the correct common key from the whole of the coefficient field to its small subset. We give theoretical and experimental evaluations showing that our proposed parameter set for our protocol is expected to achieve both failure probability 2(-120)and 128-bit security level.

TI Computing the Integrated Information of a Quantum Mechanism
SO ENTROPY
AB Originally conceived as a theory of consciousness, integrated information theory (IIT) provides a theoretical framework intended to characterize the compositional causal information that a system, in its current state, specifies about itself. However, it remains to be determined whether IIT as a theory of consciousness is compatible with quantum mechanics as a theory of microphysics. Here, we present an extension of IIT's latest formalism to evaluate the mechanism integrated information (f) of a system subset to discrete, finite-dimensional quantum systems (e.g., quantum logic gates). To that end, we translate a recently developed, unique measure of intrinsic information into a density matrix formulation and extend the notion of conditional independence to accommodate quantum entanglement. The compositional nature of the IIT analysis might shed some light on the internal structure of composite quantum states and operators that cannot be obtained using standard information-theoretical analysis. Finally, our results should inform theoretical arguments about the link between consciousness, causation, and physics from the classical to the quantum.

TI Cosmic decoherence: primordial power spectra and non-Gaussianities
SO JOURNAL OF COSMOLOGY AND ASTROPARTICLE PHYSICS
AB We study the effect of quantum decoherence on the inflationary cosmological perturbations. This process might imprint specific observational signatures revealing the quantum nature of the inflationary mechanism being related to the longstanding issue of the quantum-to-classical transition of inflationary fluctuations. Several works have investigated the effect of quantum decoherence on the statistical properties of primordial fluctuations. In particular, it has been shown that cosmic decoherence leads to corrections to the curvature power spectrum predicted by standard slow-roll inflation. Equally interesting, a non zero curvature trispectrum has been shown to be purely induced by cosmic decoherence but, surprisingly, decoherence seems not to generate any bispectrum. We further develop such an analysis by adopting a generalized form of the pointer observable, showing that decoherence does induce a non vanishing curvature bispectrum and providing a specific underlying concrete physical process. Present constraints on primordial bispectra allow to put an upper bound on the strength of the environment-system interaction. In full generality, the decoherence-induced bispectrum can be scale dependent provided one imposes the corresponding correction to the power spectrum to be scale independent. Such scale dependence on the largest cosmological scales might represent a distinctive imprint of the quantum decoherence process taking place during inflation. We also provide a criterion that allows to understand when cosmic decoherence induces scale independent corrections, independently of the type of environment considered. As a final result, we study the effect of cosmic decoherence on tensor perturbations and we derive the decoherence corrected tensor-to-scalar perturbation ratio. In specific cases, decoherence induces a blue tilted correction to the standard tensor power spectrum.

TI Spatial entanglement in two-dimensional artificial atoms
SO JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS
AB Semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) are one of the leading candidates for realizable qubits, as well as for many other advances in quantum computing and quantum communication. The spatial overlapping of wavefunctions describing each single electron in these nanoscale devices results in tunable spatial entanglement. In this article, we explore the case of two electrons in two-dimensional double quantum dot systems. We compute the two-particle wavefunction through a variational method combined with Hermite finite elements and study the spatial entanglement of electrons. We show that symmetry in the geometry of the double quantum dots plays a role in obtaining optimal entanglement, while a broken symmetry can lead to additional resonances in entanglement that are associated with the crossings of states. We also show that one can finely tune the level of spatial entanglement by altering the geometry of the quantum dots or by applying external fields, which corresponds to an "entanglement spectroscopy." Finally, we study how impurities in the potential profile of the QDs affect the level of entanglement.

TI Dissipative Landau-Zener tunneling in the crossover regime from weak to
   strong environment coupling
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Landau-Zener tunneling, which describes the transition in a two-level system during a sweep through an anti-crossing, is a model applicable to a wide range of physical phenomena. Realistic quantum systems are affected by dissipation due to coupling to their environments. An important aspect of understanding such open quantum systems is the relative energy scales of the system itself and the system-environment coupling, which distinguishes the weak- and strong-coupling regimes. Using a tunable superconducting flux qubit, we observe the crossover from weak to strong coupling to the environment in Landau-Zener tunneling. Our results confirm previous theoretical studies of dissipative Landau-Zener tunneling in the weak and strong coupling limits. We devise a spin bath model that effectively captures the crossover regime. This work is relevant for understanding the role of dissipation in quantum annealing, where the system is expected to go through a cascade of Landau-Zener transitions before reaching the target state.

TI Hilbert-Schmidt speed as an efficient figure of merit for quantum
   estimation of phase encoded into the initial state of open
   n-qubit systems
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Hilbert-Schmidt speed (HSS) is a special type of quantum statistical speed which is easily computable, since it does not require diagonalization of the system state. We find that, when both HSS and quantum Fisher information (QFI) are calculated with respect to the phase parameter encoded into the initial state of an n-qubit register, the zeros of the HSS dynamics are actually equal to those of the QFI dynamics. Moreover, the signs of the time-derivatives of both HSS and QFI exactly coincide. These findings, obtained via a thorough investigation of several paradigmatic open quantum systems, show that HSS and QFI exhibit the same qualitative time evolution. Therefore, HSS reveals itself as a powerful figure of merit for enhancing quantum phase estimation in an open quantum system made of n qubits. Our results also provide strong evidence for both contractivity of the HSS under memoryless dynamics and its sensitivity to system-environment information backflows to detect the non-Markovianity in high-dimensional systems, as suggested in previous studies.

TI Direct and Indirect Coupling Entanglements in an Optomechanical Cavity
   Coupled to a Rydberg Superatom
SO PHOTONICS
AB We investigate steady-state entanglement in a hybrid optomechanical cavity coupled to a Rydberg atomic ensemble confined within a single blockade region. The ensemble behaves as one superatom due to the rigid dipole blockade effect. Through optomechanical coupling, three types of bipartite entanglement emerge among the cavity, the Rydberg superatom, and the movable mirror. As the principal quantum number of the Rydberg atoms increases (leading to reduced atomic decay rates), the direct cavity-mirror coupling entanglement is redistributed into direct cavity-superatom coupling entanglement and indirect superatom-mirror coupling entanglement. Counterintuitively, this redistribution culminates in the complete suppression of two direct coupling entanglements, leaving only the indirect coupling entanglement persistent under resonant Stokes sideband conditions. Systematic parameter tuning reveals entanglement transfer pathways and establishes the preference of the superatom-mirror entanglement for specific principal quantum numbers. Furthermore, we demonstrate the thermal robustness of the surviving entanglement up to experimentally accessible temperatures. These findings advance the understanding of quantum entanglement in hybrid quantum systems and suggest applications in quantum information processing.

TI Transfer of hexagonal boron nitride quantum emitters onto arbitrary
   substrates with zero thermal budget
SO APL MATERIALS
AB The van der Waals material hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) has emerged as a promising candidate for hosting room temperature single-photon emitters (SPEs) for next-generation quantum technologies. However, the requirement of a high temperature anneal (850 degrees C or higher) to activate the SPEs in hBN makes it difficult to integrate into hybrid structures that cannot tolerate such temperatures, including all silicon-based circuits. In this work, we present a method to deterministically activate quantum emitters in multilayered hBN on a process substrate, followed by a zero thermal budget transfer to a target substrate. This technique does not lead to any degradation or loss of photon purity in the hBN emitters and provides a procedure for combining high-purity emitters with other exciting photonic, magnetic, or electrical properties to explore new physical phenomena. The ability to transfer hBN emitters onto arbitrary substrates creates new technological possibilities to incorporate these quantum photonic properties into photonic integrated circuits and plasmonic devices.

TI Ising meson spectroscopy on a noisy digital quantum simulator
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Quantum simulation has the potential to be an indispensable technique for the investigation of non-perturbative phenomena in strongly-interacting quantum field theories (QFTs). In the modern quantum era, with Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ) simulators widely available and larger-scale quantum machines on the horizon, it is natural to ask: what non-perturbative QFT problems can be solved with the existing quantum hardware? We show that existing noisy quantum machines can be used to analyze the energy spectrum of several strongly-interacting 1+1D QFTs, which exhibit non-perturbative effects like 'quark confinement' and 'false vacuum decay'. We perform quench experiments on IBM's quantum simulators to compute the energy spectrum of 1+1D quantum Ising model with a longitudinal field. Our results demonstrate that digital quantum simulation in the NISQ era has the potential to be a viable alternative to numerical techniques such as density matrix renormalization group or the truncated conformal space methods for analyzing QFTs.
   Recent work has shown that digital quantum simulations may be well suited for simulating non-perturbative quantum field theories. Here the authors use a superconducting quantum computer to obtain the energy spectrum of a strongly interacting quantum field theory mapped onto a quantum spin chain model.

TI Geometric genuine multipartite entanglement for four-qubit systems
SO PHYSICS OPEN
AB Xie and Eberly introduced a genuine multipartite entanglement (GME) measure 'concurrence fill' (Xie and Eberly, 2021) for three-party systems. It is defined as the area of a triangle whose side lengths represent squared concurrence in each bi-partition. However, it has been recently shown that concurrence fill is not monotonic under LOCC, hence not a faithful measure of entanglement. Though it is not a faithful entanglement measure, it encapsulates an elegant geometric interpretation of bipartite squared concurrences. There have been a few attempts to generalize GME quantifier to four-party settings and beyond. However, some of them are not faithful, and others simply lack an elegant geometric interpretation. The recent proposal from Xie et al.. constructs a concurrence tetrahedron, whose volume gives the amount of GME for four-party systems; with generalization to more than four parties being the hypervolume of the simplex structure in that dimension. Here, we show by construction that to capture all aspects of multipartite entanglement, one does not need a more complex structure, and the four-party entanglement can be demonstrated using 2D geometry only. . The subadditivity together with the Araki-Lieb inequality of linear entropy is used to construct a direct extension of the geometric GME quantifier to four-party systems resulting in quadrilateral geometry. Our quantifier can be geometrically interpreted as a combination of three quadrilaterals whose sides result from the concurrence in one-to-three bi-partition, and diagonal as concurrence in two-to-two bipartition.

TI Short-Block Polar-Coded Reverse and Direct Reconciliation in CV-QKD
SO IEEE OPEN JOURNAL OF VEHICULAR TECHNOLOGY
AB Continuous-variable quantum key distribution (CV-QKD) is a promising technique of supporting quantum-safe wireless networks in the emerging 6 G era, mapping quantum information onto the amplitude or phase of electromagnetic waves. However, conventional CV-QKD reconciliation methods often assume ideal classical side-information channels, which is an unrealistic scenario in practical deployments. To address this critical challenge, we propose a novel protection scheme integrating Polar and low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes. Specifically, Polar codes safeguard quantum transmissions due to their superior performance for short block lengths, while LDPC codes robustly protect the classical side information exchanged over auxiliary classical channels. We further enhance the CV-QKD performance by harnessing a soft-decision Polar decoding method combined with protocols specifically tailored for reverse reconciliation (RR) and direct reconciliation (DR). In the RR scheme, conceived decoding complexity is strategically distributed: Polar decoding is performed by Alice, and LDPC decoding by Bob, hence significantly reducing the computational demands compared to traditional schemes where both decoding processes are invoked at a single node. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of our approach, demonstrating that Polar codes consistently outperform LDPC codes in quantum transmission scenarios having short block lengths under 512 bits. These findings emphasize the strong potential of Polar coding-assisted CV-QKD in achieving secure and efficient quantum-safe control information transmissions, paving the way for practical implementation in next-generation wireless networks.

TI Brain-Inspired Agents for Quantum Reinforcement Learning
SO MATHEMATICS
AB In recent years, advancements in brain science and neuroscience have significantly influenced the field of computer science, particularly in the domain of reinforcement learning (RL). Drawing insights from neurobiology and neuropsychology, researchers have leveraged these findings to develop novel mechanisms for understanding intelligent decision-making processes in the brain. Concurrently, the emergence of quantum computing has opened new frontiers in artificial intelligence, leading to the development of quantum machine learning (QML). This study introduces a novel model that integrates quantum spiking neural networks (QSNN) and quantum long short-term memory (QLSTM) architectures, inspired by the complex workings of the human brain. Specifically designed for reinforcement learning tasks in energy-efficient environments, our approach progresses through two distinct stages mirroring sensory and memory systems. In the initial stage, analogous to the brain's hypothalamus, low-level information is extracted to emulate sensory data processing patterns. Subsequently, resembling the hippocampus, this information is processed at a higher level, capturing and memorizing correlated patterns. We conducted a comparative analysis of our model against existing quantum models, including quantum neural networks (QNNs), QLSTM, QSNN and their classical counterparts, elucidating its unique contributions. Through empirical results, we demonstrated the effectiveness of utilizing quantum models inspired by the brain, which outperform the classical approaches and other quantum models in optimizing energy use case. Specifically, in terms of average, best and worst total reward, test reward, robustness, and learning curve.

TI Performance of quantum kernel on initial learning process
SO EPJ QUANTUM TECHNOLOGY
AB For many manufacturing companies, the production line is very important. In recent years, the number of small-quantity, high-mix products have been increasing, and the identification of good and defective products must be carried out efficiently. At that time, machine learning is a very important issue on shipping inspection using small amounts of data. Quantum machine learning is one of most exciting prospective applications of quantum technologies. SVM using kernel estimation is one of most popular methods for classifiers. Our purpose is to search quantum advantage on classifier to enable us to classifier in inspection test for small size datasets. In this study, we made clear the difference between classical and quantum kernel learning in initial state and propose analysis of learning process by plotting ROC space. To meet the purpose, we investigated the effect of each feature map compared to classical one, using evaluation index. The simulation results show that the learning model construction process between quantum and classical kernel learning is different in initial state. Moreover, the result indicates that the learning model of quantum kernel is the method to decrease the false positive rate (FPR) from high FPR, keeping high true positive rates on several datasets. We demonstrate that learning process on quantum kernel is different from classical one in initial state and plotting to ROC space graph is effective when we analyse the learning model process.

TI Fortis-amyna-smart contract model for cross border financial
   transactions
SO ICT EXPRESS
AB A Futuristic Operating transactions Reaching beyond Territorial borders In blockchain Smart contract model (Fortis-amyna) for cross border transactions in a quantum setting is proposed. A simple hybrid classical-quantum model has been described whose main ingredients are a classical blockchain capable of handling stateful smart contracts with quantum defence. This hybrid payment model uses quantum states as bank transactions and a classical blockchain to settle disputes and keep track of the valid reference numbers. The proposed model fortis amyna has several desirable properties like de-centralized, requiring no trust in any single entity; Quick payments as quantum communication, regardless of the total number of users to speed up the transactions. In addition, fortis amyna handles the situation in lighting speed in quantum bank-transaction if failed or has error due to connectivity, helping the initiator to track back the transaction from origin. This fortis amyna model has tremendous advantages regarding speed, security, and authentication, guarding against quantum breaches. Ensuring more authenticity to customers and creating by linking a Distinct (De-Centralized) Identifier with blockchain's current transaction state eventually leads to the updated digital ledger.

TI Quantum random number generation based on a perovskite light emitting
   diode
SO COMMUNICATIONS PHYSICS
AB True random number generation is not thought to be possible using a classical approach but by instead exploiting quantum mechanics genuine randomness can be achieved. Here, the authors demonstrate a certified quantum random number generation using a metal-halide perovskite light emitting diode as a source of weak coherent polarisation states randomly producing an output of either 0 or 1.
   The recent development of perovskite light emitting diodes (PeLEDs) has the potential to revolutionize the fields of optical communication and lighting devices, due to their simplicity of fabrication and outstanding optical properties. Here we demonstrate that PeLEDs can also be used in the field of quantum technologies by implementing a highly-secure quantum random number generator (QRNG). Modern QRNGs that certify their privacy are posed to replace classical random number generators in applications such as encryption and gambling, and therefore need to be cheap, fast and with integration capabilities. Using a compact metal-halide PeLED source, we generate random numbers, which are certified to be secure against an eavesdropper, following the quantum measurement-device-independent scenario. The obtained generation rate of more than 10 Mbit s(-1), which is already comparable to commercial devices, shows that PeLEDs can work as high-quality light sources for quantum information tasks, thus opening up future applications in quantum technologies.

TI Dynamic, symmetry-preserving, and hardware-adaptable circuits for
   quantum computing many-body states and correlators of the Anderson
   impurity model
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB We present a hardware-reconfigurable ansatz on N-q-qubits for the variational preparation of many-body states of the Anderson impurity model (AIM) with N-imp+N-bath=N-q/2 sites, which conserves total charge and spin z component within each variational search subspace. The many-body ground state of the AIM is determined as the minimum over all minima of O (N-q(2)) distinct charge-spin sectors. Hamiltonian expectation values are shown to require omega(N-q)<N-meas.<= O(N-imp N-bath) symmetry-preserving, parallelizable measurement circuits, each amenable to postselection. To obtain the one-particle impurity Green's function we show how initial Krylov vectors can be computed via midcircuit measurement and how Lanczos iterations can be computed using the symmetry-preserving ansatz. For a single-impurity Anderson model with a number of bath sites increasing from one to seven, we show using numerical emulation that the ease of variational ground-state preparation is suggestive of linear scaling in circuit depth and subquartic scaling in optimizer complexity. We therefore expect that, combined with time-dependent methods for Green's function computation, our ansatz provides a useful tool to account for electronic correlations on early fault-tolerant processors. Finally, with a view towards computing real materials properties of interest like magnetic susceptibilities and electron-hole propagators, we provide a straightforward method to compute many-body, time-dependent correlation functions using a combination of time evolution, midcircuit measurement-conditioned operations, and the Hadamard test.

TI Quantum Hybrid Plasmonic Nanocircuits for Versatile Polarized Photon
   Generation
SO ADVANCED OPTICAL MATERIALS
AB Hybrid plasmonic nanocircuits developed insofar enable efficient coupling and routing of single photons generated by embedded quantum emitters (QEs), providing at the same time little or no control over the polarization of out-coupled single photons. Here, with numerical simulations a QE-driven hybrid plasmonic nanocircuit for versatile polarized photon generation by using ultracompact polarization out-couplers in multi-branched dielectric-loaded plasmonic waveguides is proposed and demonstrated. Upon excitation of a QE, which is embedded at the center of a star-shaped six-branched hybrid plasmonic waveguide and characterized with a normal to the surface radiative transition dipole, plasmonic waveguide modes are efficiently (approximate to 85%) excited and routed by the six-branched waveguide toward propitiously designed out-couplers. By exploiting two types of subwavelength polarization out-couplers producing linearly and circularly polarized free-space radiation, spatially separated single-photon generation channels characterized by four different linear and two circular polarizations are created. The demonstrated hybrid plasmonic nanocircuit addresses specifically the scenario where different quantum chips communicate via polarization-compatible channels, thereby opening new design possibilities for energy-efficient and ultracompact quantum photonic nanocircuits in nanophotonic quantum technologies.

TI Electrical manipulation of telecom color centers in silicon
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Silicon color centers have recently emerged as promising candidates for commercial quantum technology, yet their interaction with electric fields has yet to be investigated. In this paper, we demonstrate electrical manipulation of telecom silicon color centers by implementing novel lateral electrical diodes with an integrated G center ensemble in a commercial silicon on insulator wafer. The ensemble optical response is characterized under application of a reverse-biased DC electric field, observing both 100% modulation of fluorescence signal, and wavelength redshift of approximately 1.24 +/- 0.08 GHz/V above a threshold voltage. Finally, we use G center fluorescence to directly image the electric field distribution within the devices, obtaining insight into the spatial and voltage-dependent variation of the junction depletion region and the associated mediating effects on the ensemble. Strong correlation between emitter-field coupling and generated photocurrent is observed. Our demonstration enables electrical control and stabilization of semiconductor quantum emitters.
   Si color centers offer promising quantum technology applications, but their interaction with electric fields has not been explored. Here the authors report electrical manipulation of telecom emitters in Si by fabricating lateral diodes with an integrated ensemble of G centers in commercial Si on insulator wafer.

AB Molecular dyes are finding more and more applications in photonics and quantum technologies, such as polaritonic optical microcavities, organic quantum batteries and single-photon emitters for quantum sensing and metrology. For all these applications, it is of crucial importance to characterize the dephasing mechanisms. In this work we use two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy (2DES) to study the temperature dependent dephasing processes in the prototypical organic dye Lumogen-F orange. We model the 2DES maps using the Bloch equations for a two-level system and obtain a dephasing time T-2 = 53 fs at room temperature, which increases to T-2 = 94 fs at 86 K. Furthermore, spectral diffusion processes are observed and modeled by a combination of underdamped and overdamped Brownian oscillators. Our results provide useful design parameters for advanced optoelectronic and photonic devices incorporating dye molecules.

TI Photoluminescence of Germanium-Vacancy Centers in Nanocrystalline
   Diamond Films: Implications for Quantum Sensing Applications
SO ACS APPLIED NANO MATERIALS
AB Point defects in diamond, promising candidates for nanoscale pressure- and temperature-sensing applications, are potentially scalable in polycrystalline diamond fabricated using the microwave plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (MW PE CVD) technique. However, this approach introduces residual stress in the diamond films, leading to variations in the characteristic zero phonon line (ZPL) of the point defect in diamond. Here, we report the effect of residual stress on germanium-vacancy (GeV) centers in MW PE CVD nanocrystalline diamond (NCD) films fabricated using single crystal Ge as the substrate and solid dopant source. GeV ensemble formation indicated by the zero phonon line (ZPL) at similar to 602 nm is confirmed by room temperature (RT) photoluminescence (PL) measurements. PL mapping results show spatial nonuniformity in GeV formation along with other defects, including silicon-vacancy centers in the diamond films. The residual stress in NCD results in shifts in the PL peak positions. By estimating a stress shift coefficient of (2.9 +/- 0.9) nm/GPa, the GeV PL peak position in the NCD film is determined to be between 598.7 and 603.2 nm. A larger ground state splitting due to the strain on a GeV-incorporated NCD pillar at a low temperature (10 K) is also reported. We also report the observation of intense ZPLs at RT that in some cases could be related to low Ge concentration and the surrounding crystalline environment. In addition, we also observe thicker microcrystalline diamond (MCD) films delaminate from the Ge substrate due to film residual stress and graphitic phase at the diamond/Ge substrate interface (confirmed by electron energy loss spectroscopy). Using this approach, a free-standing color center incorporated MCD film with dimensions up to 1 x 1 cm(2) is fabricated. Qualitative analysis using time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectroscopy reveals the presence of impurities, including Ge and silicon, in the MCD film. Our experimental results will provide insights into the scalability of GeV fabrication using the MW PE CVD technique and effectively implement NCD-based nanoscale-sensing applications.

In this study, the authors experimentally investigate the electron-nuclear coupling approaching the clock transition and develop a simple theoretical model which gives a good qualitative understanding of the observed dynamics.
   The ability to design quantum systems that decouple from environmental noise sources is highly desirable for development of quantum technologies with optimal coherence. The chemical tunability of electronic states in magnetic molecules combined with advanced electron spin resonance techniques provides excellent opportunities to address this problem. Indeed, so-called clock transitions have been shown to protect molecular spin qubits from magnetic noise, giving rise to significantly enhanced coherence. Here we conduct a spectroscopic and computational investigation of this physics, focusing on the role of the nuclear bath. Away from the clock transition, linear coupling to the nuclear degrees of freedom causes a modulation and decay of electronic coherence, as quantified via electron spin echo signals generated experimentally and in silico. Meanwhile, the effective hyperfine interaction vanishes at the clock transition, resulting in electron-nuclear decoupling and an absence of quantum information leakage to the nuclear bath, providing opportunities to characterize other decoherence sources.

TI Multimodal electromechanics with niobium vacuum gap capacitor membranes
SO SENSORS AND ACTUATORS A-PHYSICAL
AB Electromechanics with micromachined vacuum gap capacitors have brought optomechanical techniques to the palm of our hand. Cooling these devices down to the millikelvin regime forms the basis for developing quantum memories and allows us to delve into basic science experiments. To date, only aluminium has been used as device material, and the design has not evolved significantly since it was introduced. Even more, the potential provided by the integration of sensing capabilities was not in the focus of any application driven developments so far. Here, we present several improvements comprising of niobium as base material, a double electrical cavity design and integrated piezoelectric actuators, creating a platform for sensing. We achieve a vacuum optomechanical coupling rate of g0/2 pi = 160 Hz, which can be employed for back-action evading techniques and mechanical noise squeezing of the first mechanical mode. We show coupling between the two electrical cavities and the first four mechanical eigenmodes. Furthermore, using the piezoelectric actuator for phononic pumping, we investigate coupling between the mechanical modes among each other. Based on these achievements, it is strongly believed that more research activities will be stimulated in the field of quantum sensing for up to now unexplored and unprecedented application scenarios.

AB In this proceeding we present the design and characterization of a relatively simple, compact, and cost-effective laser system for quantum technologies. It operates at 780 nm to work with Rubidium (Rb) atoms, and apart from the frequency locking setup it is entirely based on fiber components. This improves reliability and makes it less complex and more versatile with respect to a free-space system. We also describe our experimental setup, aimed at demonstrating the possibility of confining atoms in hollow-core photonic-crystal fibers (HCPCF), while still being able to keep atoms cold and performing quantum sensing measurements. We finally present our characterization of the system. The measured features (rms relative amplitude noise of 3.10(-4) at 1 s; linewidths well below 1 MHz; pressure in the vacuum chamber lower <10(-9) mbar) indeed make our system a suitable candidate for applications in quantum sensors and atom interferometers, which are briefly discussed.

AB Computer-aided Molecular and Process Design (CAMPD) is an equation-oriented multi-scale decision making framework for designing both materials (molecules) and processes for separation, reaction, and reactive separation whenever material choice significantly impacts process performance. The inherent nonlinearity and nonconvexity in CAMPD optimization models, introduced through the property and process models, pose challenges to state-of-the-art solvers. Recently, quantum computing (QC) has shown promise for solving complex optimization problems, especially those involving discrete decisions. This motivates us to explore the potential usage of quantum optimization techniques for solving CAMPD problems. We have developed a technique for directly solving a class of mixed integer nonlinear programs using QC. Our approach represents both continuous and integer design decisions by a set of binary variables through encoding schemes. This transformation allows to reformulate certain types of CAMPD problems into Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) models that can be directly solved using quantum annealing techniques. We illustrate this technique for the selection of optimal ionic liquids (IL) and the configuration of a reactor-separator process network. We also discuss several challenges that are associated with quantum optimization when solving large scale CAMPD problems.

TI Temperature Dependent Variations of Low-Frequency Noise Sources in
   Cryogenic Short-Channel Bulk MOSFETs
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB This study investigated changes in low-frequency noise sources associated with short-channel bulk metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistors (MOSFETs) by analyzing random telegraph noise (RTN) from 300 K down to 3 K. The power spectral density (PSD) of the drain current, which exhibited RTN characteristics in the frequency domain, changed with temperature. In addition, the effect of temperature on the PSD was not monotonic such that peaks were generated at specific temperatures. A comparison between p-type and n-type MOSFETs established that the former exhibited PSD values nearly an order of magnitude smaller than those of the latter. The PSD peaks observed in the temperature domain were analyzed using a theory based on the Shockley-Read-Hall model and the energy levels of the charge traps responsible for RTN were determined. Assessing the temperatures and corresponding energy levels associated with these PSD peaks showed a trend in which energy levels approached band edges as the temperature was decreased. This study assists in the development of strategies to reduce low-frequency noises generated by cryogenic qubit controllers by elucidating the impact of band-tail states on noises at 4 K.

TI Intrinsic decoherence effects on nonclassical correlations in a
   symmetric spin-orbit model
SO RESULTS IN PHYSICS
AB Nonclassical correlations dynamics of local quantum Fisher information, trace-norm measurement-induced nonlocality, and log-negativity are investigated in a symmetric spin-orbit model. This model is described by a Heisenberg XYZ two-spin system exposed to the magnetic field and Kaplan-Shekhtman-Entin-Wohlman- Aharony (KSEA) interaction under the intrinsic decoherence effects. To evaluate the resourcefulness of this model for the generation and preservation of quantum correlations, we consider two qubits that are initially prepared in two different states, namely uncorrelated and maximally correlated states. The magnetic field is discovered to be effective at generating and preserving nonclassical correlations. Besides, we find that the KSEA interaction can alter the generation, preservation, and revival features of nonclassical correlations in the two-qubit system. However, the bipartite nonclassical correlations become extremely fragile when intrinsic decoherence effects appear.

TI Deterministic quantum one-time pad via Fibonacci anyons
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Anyonic states, which are topologically robust because of their peculiar structure of Hilbert space, have important applications in quantum computing and quantum communication. Here we investigate the capacity of the deterministic quantum one-time pad (DQOTP) that uses Fibonacci anyons as an information carrier. We find that the Fibonacci particle-antiparticle pair produced from vacuum can be used to asymptotically send 2 log(2) d(tau) bits of classical information (d(tau) is the quantum dimension of a Fibonacci anyon tau), which equals anyonic mutual information of the pair. Furthermore, by studying the DQOTP via a parameterized state of six Fibonacci anyons with trivial total charge, we give the analytical results of the maximum number of messages that can be sent for different parameters, which is a step function with every step corresponding to a regular simplex from the viewpoint of geometry. The results for the maximum number of messages sent by the DQOTP can be explained by anyonic accessible information.

TI Semi-device-independent certification of entanglement in superdense

SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Superdense coding is a paradigmatic protocol in quantum information science, employing a quantum communication channel to send classical information more efficiently. As we show here, it can be understood as a particular case of a prepare and measure experiment, a scenario that has attracted growing attention for its fundamental and practical applications. Formulating superdense coding as a prepare and measure scenario allows us to provide a semi-device-independent witness of entanglement that significantly improves over previous tests. Furthermore, we also show how to adapt our results into self-testing of maximally entangled states and also provide a semidefinite program formulation allowing one to efficiently optimize, for any shared quantum state, the probability of success in the superdense coding protocol.

TI A single hole spin with enhanced coherence in natural silicon
SO NATURE NANOTECHNOLOGY
AB Operation sweet spots decouple hole spin qubits in silicon from charge noise while conserving full electrical control and allowing for spin coherence times of up to 88 mu s.
   Semiconductor spin qubits based on spin-orbit states are responsive to electric field excitations, allowing for practical, fast and potentially scalable qubit control. Spin electric susceptibility, however, renders these qubits generally vulnerable to electrical noise, which limits their coherence time. Here we report on a spin-orbit qubit consisting of a single hole electrostatically confined in a natural silicon metal-oxide-semiconductor device. By varying the magnetic field orientation, we reveal the existence of operation sweet spots where the impact of charge noise is minimized while preserving an efficient electric-dipole spin control. We correspondingly observe an extension of the Hahn-echo coherence time up to 88 mu s, exceeding by an order of magnitude existing values reported for hole spin qubits, and approaching the state-of-the-art for electron spin qubits with synthetic spin-orbit coupling in isotopically purified silicon. Our finding enhances the prospects of silicon-based hole spin qubits for scalable quantum information processing.

TI Acceleration-driven dynamics of Josephson vortices in coplanar
   superfluid rings
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Precise control of topologically protected excitations, such as quantum vortices in atomtronic circuits, opens new possibilities for future quantum technologies. We theoretically investigate the dynamics of Josephson vortices (rotational fluxons) induced by coupled persistent currents in a system of coplanar double-ring atomic Bose-Einstein condensates. We study the Josephson effect in an atomic Josephson junction formed by coaxial ring-shaped condensates. Tunneling superflows, initiated by an imbalance in atomic populations between the rings, are significantly influenced by the persistent currents in the inner and outer rings. This results in pronounced Josephson oscillations in the population imbalance for both corotating and nonrotating states. If a linear acceleration is applied to the system, our analysis reveals peculiar azimuthal tunneling patterns and dynamics of Josephson vortices which leads to nonzero net tunneling current and shows sensitivity to the acceleration magnitude. When multiple Josephson vortices are present, asymmetric vortex displacements that correlate with both the magnitude and direction of acceleration can be measured, offering the potential for quantum sensing applications.

AB Color centers in silicon carbide are relevant for applications in quantum technologies as they can produce single photon sources or can be used as spin qubits and in quantum sensing applications. Here, we have applied femtosecond laser writing in silicon carbide and gallium nitride to generate vacancy-related color centers, giving rise to photoluminescence from the visible to the infrared. Using a 515 nm wavelength 230 fs pulsed laser, we produce large arrays of silicon vacancy defects in silicon carbide with a high localization within the confocal diffraction limit of 500 nm and with minimal material damage. The number of color centers formed exhibited power-law scaling with the laser fabrication energy indicating that the color centers are created by photoinduced ionization. This work highlights the simplicity and flexibility of laser fabrication of color center arrays in relevant materials for quantum applications.

TI Finite-Time Dynamics of an Entanglement Engine: Current, Fluctuations
   and Kinetic Uncertainty Relations
SO ENTROPY
AB Entanglement engines are autonomous quantum thermal machines designed to generate entanglement from the presence of a particle current flowing through the device. In this work, we investigate the functioning of a two-qubit entanglement engine beyond the steady-state regime. Within a master equation approach, we derive the time-dependent state, the particle current, as well as the associated current correlation functions. Our findings establish a direct connection between coherence and internal current, elucidating the existence of a critical current that serves as an indicator for entanglement in the steady state. We then apply our results to investigate kinetic uncertainty relations (KURs) at finite times. We demonstrate that there is more than one possible definition for KURs at finite times. Although the two definitions agree in the steady-state regime, they lead to different parameter ranges for violating KUR at finite times.

TI Quark pair angular correlations in the proton: Entropy versus
   entanglement negativity
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
AB Two-particle correlations in the proton on the light front are described by a mixed density matrix obtained by tracing over all other, unobserved, degrees of freedom. We quantify genuinely quantum quark azimuthal correlations in terms of the entanglement negativity measure of quantum information theory. While the two-quark state in color space is one of high-entropy and weak-quantum correlation, we find that a standard three-quark model wave function from the literature predicts an azimuthally correlated state of low-entropy and high-entanglement negativity. Low entropy is consistent with expectations for many colors (at fixed 't Hooft coupling g(2)N(c)) but high negativity indicates substantial two-particle quantum correlations at N-c = 3. We show that suppressing quantum correlations associated with entanglement negativity strongly modifies quark-pair azimuthal moments <sigma(n)>, sigma = exp(i(phi(1) - phi(2)))intrinsic to the proton state. We also describe how to account for the leading O(g(2)) correction to the density matrix from light cone perturbation theory which is due to the presence (or exchange) of a gluon in the proton. This correction increases the entropy and reduces the negativity of the density matrix for quark-pair azimuthal correlations. Hence, the entanglement negativity measure may provide novel insight into the structure of the proton state of QCD.

TI Preparation for quantum simulation of the (1+1)-dimensional O(3)
   nonlinear σ model using cold atoms
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB The (1+1)-dimensional (1+1D) O(3) nonlinear sigma-model is a model system for future quantum lattice simulations of other asymptotically free theories, such as non-Abelian gauge theories. We find that utilizing dimensional reduction can make efficient use of two-dimensional layouts presently available on cold-atom quantum simulators. A different definition of the renormalized coupling is introduced, which is applicable to systems with open boundary conditions and can be measured using analog quantum simulators. Monte Carlo and tensor network calculations are performed to determine the quantum resources required to reproduce perturbative short-distance observables. In particular, we show that a rectangular array of 48 Rydberg atoms with existing quantum hardware capabilities should be able to adiabatically prepare low-energy states of the perturbatively matched theory. These states can then be used to simulate nonperturbative observables in the continuum limit that lie beyond the reach of classical computers.

TI Coherent Coupling of a Diamond Tin-Vacancy Center to a Tunable Open
   Microcavity
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW X
AB Efficient coupling of optically active qubits to optical cavities is a key challenge for solid-state-based quantum optics experiments and future quantum technologies. Here we present a quantum photonic interface based on a single tin-vacancy center in a micrometer-thin diamond membrane coupled to a tunable open microcavity. We use the full tunability of the microcavity to selectively address individual tin-vacancy centers within the cavity mode volume. Purcell enhancement of the tin-vacancy center optical transition is evidenced both by optical excited state lifetime reduction and by optical linewidth broadening. As the emitter selectively reflects the single-photon component of the incident light, the coupled emitter-cavity system exhibits strong quantum nonlinear behavior. On resonance, we observe a transmission dip of 50% for low incident photon number per Purcell-reduced excited state lifetime, while the dip disappears as the emitter is saturated with higher photon number. Moreover, we demonstrate that the emitter strongly modifies the photon statistics of the transmitted light by observing photon bunching. This work establishes a versatile and tunable platform for advanced quantum optics experiments and proof-of-principle demonstrations on quantum networking with solid-state qubits.

TI Significance of fidelity deviation in continuous-variable teleportation
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Performance of quantum teleportation is typically measured by the average fidelity, an overlap between the input and output states. Along with the first moment, we introduce the second moment of fidelity in continuous -variable (CV) teleportation, i.e., the fidelity deviation as the figure of merit to assess the protocol's efficiency. We show that CV states, both Gaussian and non-Gaussian, can be better characterized by considering both average fidelity and fidelity deviation, which is not possible with only average fidelity. Moreover, we shed light on the performance of the teleportation protocol in two different input scenarios: One is when input states are sampled from constrained uniform distribution while the other one is Gaussian suppression of the input states which again leads to a different classification of CV states according to their performance. The entire analysis is carried out in noiseless and noisy scenarios with noise being incorporated in the measurement and the shared channels. We also report that one type of noise can make the protocol robust against the other one, which leads to a "constructive effect," and identify the noise models which are responsible for decreasing average fidelity and the increment in fidelity deviation.

TI Probing Charge Dynamics in Diamond with an Individual Color Center
SO NANO LETTERS
AB Control over the charge states of color centers in solids is necessary to fully utilize them in quantum technologies. However, the microscopic charge dynamics of deep defects in wide-band-gap semiconductors are complex, and much remains unknown. We utilize a single-shot charge-state readout of an individual nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center to probe the charge dynamics of the surrounding defects in diamond. We show that the NV center charge state can be converted through the capture of holes produced by optical illumination of defects many micrometers away. With this method, we study the optical charge conversion of silicon-vacancy (SiV) centers and provide evidence that the dark state of the SiV center under optical illumination is SiV2-. These measurements illustrate that charge carrier generation, transport, and capture are important considerations in the design and implementation of quantum devices with color centers and provide a novel way to probe and control charge dynamics in diamond.

TI Realistic scheme for quantum simulation of Z2 lattice gauge
   theories with dynamical matter in (2+1)D
SO COMMUNICATIONS PHYSICS
AB Gauge fields coupled to dynamical matter are ubiquitous in many disciplines of physics, ranging from particle to condensed matter physics, but their implementation in large-scale quantum simulators remains challenging. Here we propose a realistic scheme for Rydberg atom array experiments in which a Z2 gauge structure with dynamical charges emerges on experimentally relevant timescales from only local two-body interactions and one-body terms in two spatial dimensions. The scheme enables the experimental study of a variety of models, including (2+ 1)D Z2 lattice gauge theories coupled to different types of dynamical matter and quantum dimer models on the honeycomb lattice, for which we derive effective Hamiltonians. We discuss ground-state phase diagrams of the experimentally most relevant effective Z2 lattice gauge theories with dynamical matter featuring various confined and deconfined, quantum spin liquid phases. Further, we present selected probes with immediate experimental relevance, including signatures of disorder-free localization and a thermal deconfinement transition of two charges.

TI Comprehensive analysis of short-channel effects & switching speed in
   CNTFETs: A 2D quantum simulation approach
SO RESULTS IN ENGINEERING
AB Through the development of a two-dimensional (2D) full quantum simulation, the properties of carbon nanotube field-effect transistors (CNTFETs) at varying tube diameters and dielectric constants of CNT have been exhaustively investigated. Simulations were conducted using the self-consistent solution of 2D Poisson-Schro<spacing diaeresis>dinger equations within the nonequilibrium Green's function (NEGF) formalism. This paper investigates the short- channel effects on CNTFET performance using the NEGF function. The numerical model facilitates a greater understanding of the physical mechanisms at play and guides the design of CNTFETs to enhance transistor performance. This research aims to improve the efficacy of CNTFETs by enhancing device parameters and gaining a deeper understanding of CNT characteristics. The short-channel effect is a significant concern in CNTFETs as the channel length decreases. Using CNTFET mathematical modeling, we analyzed the switching speed (ION/IOFF) ratio and the short channel effect (SCE). We have analyzed the effects of drain-induced barrier lowering (DIBL), subthreshold swing (SS), and carrier injection velocity (Vinj) for finding the short channel effect of CNTFETs with varying tube diameters and dielectric constants. This paper also illustrates the influence of gate capacitance(CG), output conductance (gd), voltage gain(AV) & transconductance (gm) on the different parameters of the CNTFET. This comparative analysis demonstrates that a reduced transconductance corresponds to a larger bandgap, indicating a firmer control of the gate over the channel. If the channel or tube diameter is reduced, the bandgap energy will exhibit an increasing pattern, resulting in a thickening of the tunneling barrier, a reduction in the drain transconductance, and an increase in the threshold voltage, all of which will result in an increase in SS. The findings provide important insights into the short-channel behavior of CNTFETs and offer recommendations for optimizing their performance in future nanoelectronics applications. This study shows that Ion current increase 57.642 % for varying tube diameter 1.0179 nm to 1.95575 nm for dielectric constant 3.9. And the Ion current increase 100 % for changing dielectric constant 3.9 to 80 using 1.4877 nm of tube diameter. At smaller tube diameters, the ION/IOFF ratio is nearly three times greater for materials with a higher dielectric constant. Also, the findings demonstrate that for lower tube diameter 1.0179 nm output conductance will increase by 50.30 % & using higher tube diameter 1.95575 nm the output conductance will increase by 32.88 % by varying dielectric material permittivity from 3.9 (SiO2) to 80 (Ti2O3).

TI Concentration for Random Product Formulas
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Quantum simulation has wide applications in quantum chemistry and physics. Recently, scientists have begun exploring the use of randomized methods for accelerating quantum simulation. Among them, a simple and powerful technique, called QDRIFT, is known to generate random product formulas for which the average quantum channel approximates the ideal evolution. QDRIFT achieves a gate count that does not explicitly depend on the number of terms in the Hamiltonian, which contrasts with Suzuki formulas. This work aims to understand the origin of this speedup by comprehensively analyzing a single realization of the random product formula produced by QDRIFT. The main results prove that a typical realization of the randomized product formula approximates the ideal unitary evolution up to a small diamond-norm error. The gate complexity is already independent of the number of terms in the Hamiltonian, but it depends on the system size and the sum of the interaction strengths in the Hamiltonian. Remarkably, the same random evolution starting from an arbitrary, but fixed, input state yields a much shorter circuit suitable for that input state. In contrast, in deterministic settings, such an improvement usually requires initial state knowledge. The proofs depend on concentration inequalities for vector and matrix martingales, and the framework is applicable to other randomized product formulas. Our bounds are saturated by certain commuting Hamiltonians.

TI Commutativity, Comeasurability, and Contextuality in the Kochen-Specker
   Arguments
SO PHILOSOPHY OF SCIENCE
AB I will argue that Kochen-Specker arguments do not provide an algebraic proof for quantum contextuality since, for the argument to be effective, (1) operators must be uniquely associated with measurements and (2) commuting operators must represent simultaneous measurements. However, in all Kochen-Specker arguments discussed in the literature either 1 or 2 is not met. Arguments meeting 1 contain commuting operators that do not represent simultaneous measurements and hence fail to physically justify the functional composition principle. Arguments meeting 2 associate some operators with more than one measurement and hence need to invoke an extra assumption different from noncontextuality.

TI Eu3+ as a Powerful Structural and Spectroscopic Tool for
   Glass Photonics
SO MATERIALS
AB The unique properties of the Eu3+ ion make it a powerful spectroscopic tool to investigate structure or follow processes and mechanisms in several high-tech application areas such as biology and health, structural engineering, environment monitoring systems and quantum technology, mainly concerning photonics. The traditional method is to exploit the unique photoluminescent properties of Eu3+ ions to understand complex dynamical processes and obtain information useful to develop materials with specific characteristics. The objective of this review is to focus on the use of Eu3+ optical spectroscopy in some condensed matter issues. After a short presentation of the more significant properties of the Eu3+ ion, some examples regarding its use as a probe of the local structure in sol-gel systems are presented. Another section is devoted to dynamical processes such as the important technological role of nanocrystals as rare-earth sensitizers. The appealing effect of the site-selection memory, observed when exciting different sites into the D-5(1) state, which the D-5(0) -> F-7(0) emission band reflects following the sites' distribution, is also mentioned. Finally, a section is devoted to the use of Eu3+ in the development of a rare-earth-based platform for quantum technologies.

This paper investigates the optimal discrimination of three symmetric quantum states with equal prior probabilities. To obtain completely accessible information about the input pure states, this strategy makes improvements to the two standard strategies of quantum state discrimination, namely the minimum error discrimination and unambiguous discrimination. The new discrimination strategy proposed in this paper can be applied to both linearly independent and dependent quantum states. (c) 2025 Author(s).

TI Solving the Kemeny ranking aggregation problem with quantum optimization
   algorithms
SO MATHEMATICAL METHODS IN THE APPLIED SCIENCES
AB The aim of a ranking aggregation problem is to combine several rankings into a single one that best represents them. A common method for solving this problem is due to Kemeny and selects as the aggregated ranking the one that minimizes the sum of the Kendall distances to the rankings to be aggregated. Unfortunately, the identification of the said ranking-called the Kemeny ranking-is known to be a computationally expensive task. In this paper, we study different ways of computing the Kemeny ranking with quantum optimization algorithms, and in particular, we provide some alternative formulations for the search for the Kemeny ranking as an optimization problem. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that this problem is addressed with quantum techniques. We propose four different ways of formulating the problem, one novel to this work. Two different quantum optimization algorithms-Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm and Quantum Adiabatic Computing-are used to evaluate each of the different formulations. The experimental results show that the choice of the formulation plays a big role on the performance of the quantum optimization algorithms.

TI Impact of Size Scaling in Cryogenic InGaAs/InP HEMTs for Low-Noise and
   High-Frequency Performance
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ELECTRON DEVICES
AB This work investigates the impact of size scaling on the performance of cryogenic InxGa1-xAs/InP high electron mobility transistors (HEMTs) for low-noise and high-frequency applications. Two quantum-well heterostructures, with 75% and 80% indium content, are examined from 300 to 4 K, including devices with gate lengths down to 40 nm and gate widths down to 380nm. At cryogenic temperatures, the 80% indium channel achieves a record combination of high-frequency metrics f(T) =622 GHz, f(MAX) =733 GHz, and low-noise indication factor (I-D)(1/2) g(m) = 0.17(V center dot mm/S)(1/2) on the same device. This performance is enabled by heterostructure engineering, resulting in ultralow R-ON = Omega center dot mu m. The 75% indium heterostructure instead demonstrates superior low-noise operation, with a minimum subthreshold swing SS = 8.5 mV/decade and a noise indication factor as low as (I-D)(1/2) g(m) = 0.15(V center dot mm/S)(1/2) at optimal device dimensions. These results highlight the potential of InGaAs/InP HEMTs in cryogenic low-noise amplifiers (LNAs), for qubit readout in future high-density quantum computing architectures.

TI Generation of Genuine Multipartite Entangled States via
   Indistinguishability of Identical Particles
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Indistinguishability of identical particles is a resource for quantum information processing and has been utilized to generate entanglement from independent particles that spatially overlap only at the detection stage. Here, we introduce a controllable scheme capable of generating via three steps, i.e., initialization, deformation, and postselection, different classes of multipartite entangled states starting from a product state of N spatially distinguishable identical qubits. While our scheme is generalizable to any class of entangled bosonic and fermionic systems, we provide an explicit recipe for the generation of W, Dicke, GHZ, and cluster states, which are resource states for quantum information processing. Using graphbased representations within the framework of spatially localized operations and classical communication (sLOCC), we mathematically demonstrate a direct translation of the generation schemes of specific entangled states into colored, complex, and weighted digraphs, each corresponding to a given experimental setup. We also show that this graph-theoretical approach allows for the optimization of the generation efficiency of specific multipartite entangled states by exploring a variety of generation schemes. The presented theoretical approach, while already implementable with current linear optics architectures, has the potential to bring clear advantages over existing technologies, such as in quantum computing search algorithms and in the design of new experiments in quantum optics or other platforms.

TI Emergence of highly coherent two-level systems in a noisy and dense
   quantum network
SO NATURE PHYSICS
AB Quantum sensors and qubits are usually two-level systems (TLS), the quantum analogues of classical bits assuming binary values 0 or 1. They are useful to the extent to which superpositions of 0 and 1 persist despite a noisy environment. The standard prescription to avoid decoherence of solid-state qubits is their isolation by means of extreme dilution in ultrapure materials. We demonstrate a different strategy using the rare-earth insulator LiY1-xTbxF4 (x = 0.001) which realizes a dense random network of TLS. Some TLS belong to strongly interacting Tb3+ pairs whose quantum states, thanks to localization effects, form highly coherent qubits with 100-fold longer coherence times than single ions. Our understanding of the underlying decoherence mechanisms-and of their suppression-suggests that coherence in networks of dipolar coupled TLS can be enhanced rather than reduced by the interactions.
   Quantum coherence is hard to maintain in solid-state systems, as interactions usually lead to fast dephasing. Exploiting disorder effects and interactions, highly coherent two-level systems have now been realized in a rare-earth insulator compound.

TI Quantum information probes of charge fractionalization in large-N
   gauge theories
SO JOURNAL OF HIGH ENERGY PHYSICS
AB We study in detail various information theoretic quantities with the intent of distinguishing between different charged sectors in fractionalized states of large-N gauge theories. For concreteness, we focus on a simple holographic (2 + 1)-dimensional strongly coupled electron fluid whose charged states organize themselves into fractionalized and coherent patterns at sufficiently low temperatures. However, we expect that our results are quite generic and applicable to a wide range of systems, including non-holographic. The probes we consider include the entanglement entropy, mutual information, entanglement of purification and the butterfly velocity. The latter turns out to be particularly useful, given the universal connection between momentum and charge diffusion in the vicinity of a black hole horizon. The RT surfaces used to compute the above quantities, though, are largely insensitive to the electric flux in the bulk. To address this deficiency, we propose a generalized entanglement functional that is motivated through the Iyer-Wald formalism, applied to a gravity theory coupled to a U(1) gauge field. We argue that this functional gives rise to a coarse grained measure of entanglement in the boundary theory which is obtained by tracing over (part) of the fractionalized and cohesive charge degrees of freedom. Based on the above, we construct a candidate for an entropic c-function that accounts for the existence of bulk charges. We explore some of its general properties and their significance, and discuss how it can be used to efficiently account for charged degrees of freedom across different energy scales.

TI Quantum information and CP measurement in H → τ plus τ-at future lepton
   colliders
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
AB We introduce a methodology and investigate the feasibility of measuring quantum properties of tau lepton pairs in the H -> tau+tau- decay at future lepton colliders. In particular, observation of entanglement, steerability, and violation of Bell inequalities are examined for the International Linear Collider (ILC) and Future Circular e+e- Collider (FCC-ee). We find that detecting quantum correlation crucially relies on precise reconstruction of the tau lepton rest frame, and a simple kinematics reconstruction does not suffice due to the finite energy resolution of the colliding beams and detectors. To correct for energy mismeasurements, a log-likelihood method is developed that incorporates the information of impact parameters of tau lepton decays. We demonstrate that an accurate measurement of quantum properties is possible with this method. As a by-product, we show that a novel model-independent test of CP violation can be performed and the CP phase of H tau tau interaction can be constrained with an accuracy comparable to dedicated analyses, i.e., up to 7.9 degrees and 5.4 degrees at ILC and FCC-ee, respectively.

TI Demonstration of robust and efficient quantum property learning with
   shallow shadows
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Extracting information efficiently from quantum systems is crucial for quantum information processing. Classical shadows enable predicting many properties of arbitrary quantum states using few measurements. While random single-qubit measurements are experimentally friendly and suitable for learning low-weight Pauli observables, they perform poorly for nonlocal observables. Introducing a shallow random quantum circuit before measurements improves sample efficiency for high-weight Pauli observables and low-rank properties. However, in practice, these circuits can be noisy and bias the measurement results. Here, we propose the robust shallow shadows, which employs Bayesian inference to learn and mitigate noise in postprocessing. We analyze noise effects on sample complexity and the optimal circuit depth. We provide theoretical guarantees for the success of error mitigation under a wide class of noise processes. Experimental validation on a superconducting quantum processor confirms the advantage of our method, even in the presence of realistic noise, over single-qubit measurements for predicting diverse state properties, such as fidelity and entanglement entropy. Our protocol thus offers a scalable, robust, and sample-efficient method for quantum state characterization on near-term quantum devices.

TI Roadmap on atomically-engineered quantum platforms
SO NANO FUTURES
AB Matter at the atomic-scale is inherently governed by the laws of quantum mechanics. This makes charges and spins confined to individual atoms-and interactions among them-an invaluable resource for fundamental research and quantum technologies alike. However, harnessing the inherent 'quantumness' of atomic-scale objects requires that they can be precisely engineered and addressed at the individual atomic level. Since its invention in the 1980s, scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM) has repeatedly demonstrated the unrivalled ability to not only resolve but manipulate matter at atomic length scales. Over the past decades, this has enabled the design and investigation of bottom-up tailored nanostructures as reliable and reproducible platforms to study designer quantum physics and chemistry, band topology, and collective phenomena. The vast range of STM-based techniques and modes of operation, as well as their combination with electromagnetic fields from the infrared to microwave spectral range, has even allowed for the precise control of individual charge and spin degrees of freedom. This roadmap reviews the most recent developments in the field of atomically-engineered quantum platforms and explores their potential in future fundamental research and quantum technologies.

TI Continuous-variable quantum optics and resource theory for ultrafast
   semiconductor spectroscopy [Invited]
SO OPTICAL MATERIALS EXPRESS
AB This review examines the use of continuous-variable spectroscopy techniques for investigating quantum coherence and light-matter interactions in semiconductor systems with ultrafast dynamics. Special emphasis is placed on multichannel homodyne detection as a powerful tool to measure the quantum coherence and the full density matrix of a polariton system. Observations, such as coherence times that exceed the nanosecond scale obtained by monitoring the temporal decay of quantum coherence in a polariton condensate, are discussed. Proof-of-concept experiments and numerical simulations that demonstrate the enhanced resourcefulness of the produced system states for modern quantum protocols are assessed. The combination of tailored resource quantifiers and ultrafast spectroscopy techniques that have recently been demonstrated paves the way for future applications of quantum information technologies.

TI Pointer States and Quantum Darwinism with Two-Body Interactions
SO ENTROPY
AB Quantum Darwinism explains the emergence of classical objectivity within a quantum universe. However, to date, most research on quantum Darwinism has focused on specific models and their stationary properties. To further our understanding of the quantum-to-classical transition, it appears desirable to identify the general criteria a Hamiltonian has to fulfill to support classical reality. To this end, we categorize all N-qubit models with two-body interactions, and show that only those with separable interaction of the system and environment can support a pointer basis. We further demonstrate that "perfect" quantum Darwinism can only emerge if there are no intra-environmental interactions. Our analysis is complemented by solving the ensuing dynamics. We find that in systems exhibiting information scrambling, the dynamical emergence of classical objectivity directly competes with the non-local spread of quantum correlations. Our rigorous findings are illustrated through the numerical analysis of four representative models.

TI QuanTest: Entanglement-Guided Testing of Quantum Neural Network Systems
SO ACM TRANSACTIONS ON SOFTWARE ENGINEERING AND METHODOLOGY
AB Quantum Neural Network (QNN) combines the deep learning (DL) principle with the fundamental theory of quantum mechanics to achieve machine learning tasks with quantum acceleration. Recently, QNN systems have been found to manifest robustness issues similar to classical DL systems. There is an urgent need for ways to test their correctness and security. However, QNN systems differ significantly from traditional quantum software and classical DL systems, posing critical challenges for QNN testing. These challenges include the inapplicability of traditional quantum software testing methods to QNN systems due to differences in programming paradigms and decision logic representations, the dependence of quantum test sample generation on perturbation operators, and the absence of effective information in quantum neurons. In this article, we propose QuanTest, a quantum entanglement-guided adversarial testing framework to uncover potential erroneous behaviors in QNN systems. We design a quantum entanglement adequacy criterion to quantify the entanglement acquired by the input quantum states from the QNN system, along with two similarity metrics to measure the proximity of generated quantum adversarial examples to the original inputs. Subsequently, QuanTest formulates the problem of generating test inputs that maximize the quantum entanglement adequacy and capture incorrect behaviors of the QNN system as a joint optimization problem and solves it in a gradient- based manner to generate quantum adversarial examples. Experimental results demonstrate that QuanTest possesses the capability to capture erroneous behaviors in QNN systems (generating 67.48-96.05% more high- quality test samples than the random noise under the same perturbation size constraints). The entanglement- guided approach proves effective in adversarial testing, generating more adversarial examples (maximum increase reached 21.32%).

TI Quantum Information Entropy for Another Class of New Proposed Hyperbolic
   Potentials
SO ENTROPY
AB In this work, we investigate the Shannon entropy of four recently proposed hyperbolic potentials through studying position and momentum entropies. Our analysis reveals that the wave functions of the single-well potentials U0,3 exhibit greater localization compared to the double-well potentials U1,2. This difference in localization arises from the depths of the single- and double-well potentials. Specifically, we observe that the position entropy density shows higher localization for the single-well potentials, while their momentum probability density becomes more delocalized. Conversely, the double-well potentials demonstrate the opposite behavior, with position entropy density being less localized and momentum probability density showing increased localization. Notably, our study also involves examining the Bialynicki-Birula and Mycielski (BBM) inequality, where we find that the Shannon entropies still satisfy this inequality for varying depths u over bar . An intriguing observation is that the sum of position and momentum entropies increases with the variable u over bar for potentials U1,2,3, while for U0, the sum decreases with u over bar . Additionally, the sum of the cases U0 and U3 almost remains constant within the relative value 0.01 as u over bar increases. Our study provides valuable insights into the Shannon entropy behavior for these hyperbolic potentials, shedding light on their localization characteristics and their relation to the potential depths. Finally, we extend our analysis to the Fisher entropy F over bar x and find that it increases with the depth u over bar of the potential wells but F over bar p decreases with the depth.

TI Experimental benchmarking of quantum state overlap estimation strategies
   with photonic systems
SO LIGHT-SCIENCE & APPLICATIONS
AB Accurately estimating the overlap between quantum states is a fundamental task in quantum information processing. While various strategies using distinct quantum measurements have been proposed for overlap estimation, the lack of experimental benchmarks on estimation precision limits strategy selection in different situations. Here we compare the performance of four practical strategies for overlap estimation, including tomography-tomography, tomography-projection, Schur collective measurement and optical swap test using photonic quantum systems. We encode the quantum states on the polarization and path degrees of freedom of single photons. The corresponding measurements are performed by photon detection on certain modes following single-photon mode transformation or two-photon interference. We further propose an adaptive strategy with optimized precision in full-range overlap estimation. Our results shed new light on extracting the parameter of interest from quantum systems, prompting the design of efficient quantum protocols.

TI Interaction-free imaging of multipixel objects
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Quantum imaging, one of the pillars of quantum technologies, is well suited to study sensitive samples which require low-light conditions, like biological tissues. In this context, interaction-free measurements (IFM) allow us to infer the presence of an opaque object without the photon interacting with the sample. Current IFM schemes are designed for single-pixel objects, while real-life samples are structured, multipixel objects. Here we extend the IFM imaging schemes to multipixel, semitransparent objects, by encoding the information about the pixels into an internal degree of freedom, namely orbital angular momentum. This allows us to image the pixels in parallel. Our solution exhibits a better theoretical efficiency than the single-pixel case. Our scheme can be extended to other degrees of freedom, like the photon radial quantum number, in order to image one-dimensional (1D) and 2D objects.

TI Tensor-network discriminator architecture for classification of quantum
   data on quantum computers
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We demonstrate the use of matrix product state (MPS) models for discriminating quantum data on quantum computers using holographic algorithms, focusing on the problem of classifying a translationally invariant quantum state based on L qubits of quantum data extracted from it. We detail a process in which data from single-shot experimental measurements are used to optimize an isometric tensor network, the isometric tensors are compiled into unitary quantum operations using greedy compilation heuristics, parameter optimization on the resulting quantum circuit model removes the postselection requirements of the isometric tensor model, and the resulting quantum model is inferenced on either product state (single-shot measurement) or entangled quantum data. We demonstrate our training and inference architecture on a synthetic dataset of six-site single-shot measurements from the bulk of a one-dimensional transverse field Ising model (TFIM) deep in its antiferromagnetic and paramagnetic phases. We find that increasing the bond dimension of the tensor-network model, amounting to adding more ancilla qubits to the circuit representation, improves both the average number of correct classifications across the dataset and the single-shot probability of correct classification. We experimentally evaluate models on Quantinuum's H1-2 trapped ion quantum computer using entangled input data modeled as translationally invariant, bond dimension 4 MPSs across the known quantum phase transition of the TFIM. Using linear regression on the experimental data near the transition point, we find predictions for the critical transverse field of h = 0.962 and 0.994 for tensor-network discriminators of bond dimension chi = 2 and chi = 4, respectively. These predictions compare favorably with the known transition location of h = 1 despite training on data far from the transition point. Our techniques identify families of short-depth variational quantum circuits in a data-driven and hardware-aware fashion and robust classical techniques to precondition the model parameters, and can be adapted beyond machine learning to myriad applications of tensor networks on quantum computers, such as quantum simulation and error correction.

TI Toward Cosmological Simulations of Dark Matter on Quantum Computers
SO ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL
AB State-of-the-art cosmological simulations on classical computers are limited by time, energy, and memory usage. Quantum computers can perform some calculations exponentially faster than classical computers, using exponentially less energy and memory, and may enable extremely large simulations that accurately capture the whole dynamic range of structure in the universe within statistically representative cosmic volumes. However, not all computational tasks exhibit a "quantum advantage." Quantum circuits act linearly on quantum states, so nonlinearities (e.g., self-gravity in cosmological simulations) pose a significant challenge. Here we outline one potential approach to overcome this challenge and solve the (nonlinear) Schrodinger-Poisson equations for the evolution of self-gravitating dark matter, based on a hybrid quantum-classical variational algorithm framework (Lubasch et al.). We demonstrate the method with a proof-of-concept mock quantum simulation, envisioning a future where quantum computers will one day lead simulations of dark matter.

TI Atomistic Compositional Details and Their Importance for Spin Qubits in
   Isotope-Purified Silicon Quantum Wells
SO ADVANCED SCIENCE
AB Understanding crystal characteristics down to the atomistic level increasingly emerges as a crucial insight for creating solid state platforms for qubits with reproducible and homogeneous properties. Here, isotope concentration depth profiles in a SiGe/Si-28/SiGe heterostructure are analyzed with atom probe tomography (APT) and time-of-flight secondary-ion mass spectrometry down to their respective limits of isotope concentrations and depth resolution. Spin-echo dephasing times T-2(echo) = 128 mu s and valley energy splittings E-VS around 200 mu eV have been observed for single spin qubits in this quantum well (QW) heterostructure, pointing toward the suppression of qubit decoherence through hyperfine interaction with crystal host nuclear spins or via scattering between valley states. The concentration of nuclear spin-carrying Si-29 is 50 +/- 20ppm in the Si-28 QW. The resolution limits of APT allow to uncover that both the SiGe/Si-28 and the Si-28/SiGe interfaces of the QW are shaped by epitaxial growth front segregation signatures on a few monolayer scale. A subsequent thermal treatment, representative of the thermal budget experienced by the heterostructure during qubit device processing, broadens the top SiGe/Si-28 QW interface by about two monolayers, while the width of the bottom Si-28/SiGe interface remains unchanged. Using a tight-binding model including SiGe alloy disorder, these experimental results suggest that the combination of the slightly thermally broadened top interface and of a minimal Ge concentration of 0.3% in the QW, resulting from segregation, is instrumental for the observed large EVS = 200 mu eV. Minimal Ge additions <1%, which get more likely in thin QWs, will hence support high E-VS without compromising coherence times. At the same time, taking thermal treatments during device processing as well as the occurrence of crystal growth characteristics into account seems important for the design of reproducible qubit properties.

TI Narrow Inhomogeneous Distribution and Charge State Stabilization of
   Lead-Vacancy Centers in Diamond
SO ADVANCED FUNCTIONAL MATERIALS
AB Lead-vacancy (PbV) centers in diamond with a large ground state splitting are expected to be a building block of quantum network nodes. Due to the heaviness of the Pb atom, it is challenging to fabricate high-quality PbV centers with a narrow inhomogeneous distribution and stable charge state. In this study, for the formation of the PbV centers, high-temperature anneal up to 2300 degrees C is performed after Pb ion implantation. At a lower temperature of 1800 degrees C, the PbV centers show a large inhomogeneous distribution and spectral diffusion, while higher temperatures of 2200-2300 degrees C leads to narrow inhomogeneous distributions with standard deviations of approximate to 5 GHz. The charge state transition of the PbV centers formed at 2200 degrees C occurs by capturing photo-carriers generated from surrounding defects under 532 nm laser irradiation. Finally, multiple stable PbV centers with nearly identical photon frequencies are obtained, which is essential for applications in quantum information processing.

TI Markovianization with approximate unitary designs
SO COMMUNICATIONS PHYSICS
AB Memoryless processes are ubiquitous in nature, in contrast with the mathematics of open systems theory, which states that non-Markovian processes should be the norm. This discrepancy is usually addressed by subjectively making the environment forgetful. Here we prove that there are physical non-Markovian processes that with high probability look highly Markovian for all orders of correlations; we call this phenomenon Markovianization. Formally, we show that when a quantum process has dynamics given by an approximate unitary design, a large deviation bound on the size of non-Markovian memory is implied. We exemplify our result employing an efficient construction of an approximate unitary circuit design using two-qubit interactions only, showing how seemingly simple systems can speedily become forgetful. Conversely, since the process is closed, it should be possible to detect the underlying non-Markovian effects. However, for these processes, observing non-Markovian signatures would require highly entangling resources and hence be a difficult task.

TI How Solvation Alters the Thermodynamics of Asymmetric Bond-Breaking:
   Quantum Simulation of NaK+ in Liquid Tetrahydrofuran
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY LETTERS
AB Gas-phase potential energy surfaces (PESs) are often used to provide an intuitive understanding of molecular chemical reactivity. Most chemical reactions, however, take place in solution, and it is unclear whether gas-phase PESs accurately represent chemical processes in solvent environments. In this work we use quantum simulations to investigate the dissociation energetics of NaK+ in liquid tetrahydrofuran (THF) to understand the degree to which solvent interactions alter the gas-phase picture. Using umbrella sampling and thermodynamic integration techniques, we construct condensed-phase free energy surfaces of NaK(+ )on THF in both the ground and electronic excited states. We find that solvation by THF completely alters the nature of the NaK+ bond by reordering the thermodynamic dissociation products. Reaching the thermodynamic dissociation limit in THF also requires a long-range charge transfer process that has no counterpart in the gas phase. Gas-phase PESs, even with perturbations, cannot adequately describe the reactivity of simple asymmetric molecules in solution.

TI Exponentially faster implementations of Select (H) fermionic
   Hamiltonians
SO QUANTUM
AB We present a simple but general framework for constructing quantum circuits that im- plement the multiply-controlled unitary SELECT(H) := Sigma(l) vertical bar l > < l vertical bar circle times H-l, where H = Sigma H-l(l) is the Jordan-Wigner transform of an arbitrary second-quantised fermionic Hamiltonian. SELEcT(H) is one of the main subroutines of several quantum algorithms, including stateof-the-art techniques for Hamiltonian simulation. If each term in the second-quantised Hamiltonian involves at most k spin-orbitals and k is a constant independent of the total number of spin-orbitals n (as is the case for the majority of quantum chemistry and condensed matter models considered in the literature, for which k is typically 2 or 4), our implementation of SELECT(H) requires no ancilla qubits and uses O(n) Clifford-FT gates, with the Clifford gates applied in O(log(2) n) layers and the T gates in O(log n) layers. This achieves an exponential improvement in both Clifford- and T-depth over previous work, while maintaining linear gate count and reducing the number of ancillae to zero.

TI Contra Bellum: Bell's Theorem as a Confusion of Languages
SO ACTA PHYSICA POLONICA A
AB Bell's theorem is a conflict of mathematical predictions formulated within an infinite hierarchy of mathematical models. Inequalities formulated at level k is an element of Z are violated by probabilities at level k + 1. We are inclined to think that k = 0 corresponds to the classical world, while k = 1 - to the quantum one. However, as the k = 0 inequalities are violated by k = 1 probabilities, the same relation holds between k = 1 inequalities violated by k = 2 probabilities, k = -1 inequalities violated by k = 0 probabilities, and so forth. By accepting the logic of the Bell theorem, can we prove by induction that nothing exists?

TI A 2D quantum dot array in planar 28Si/SiGe
SO APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS
AB Semiconductor spin qubits have gained increasing attention as a possible platform to host a fault-tolerant quantum computer. First demonstrations of spin qubit arrays have been shown in a wide variety of semiconductor materials. The highest performance for spin qubit logic has been realized in silicon, but scaling silicon quantum dot arrays in two dimensions has proven to be challenging. By taking advantage of high-quality heterostructures and carefully designed gate patterns, we are able to form a tunnel coupled 2 x 2 quantum dot array in a Si-28/SiGe heterostructure. We are able to load a single electron in all four quantum dots, thus reaching the (1,1,1,1) charge state. Furthermore, we characterize and control the tunnel coupling between all pairs of dots by measuring polarization lines over a wide range of barrier gate voltages. Tunnel couplings can be tuned from about 30 mu eV up to approximately 400 mu eV. These experiments provide insightful information on how to design 2D quantum dot arrays and constitute a first step toward the operation of spin qubits in Si-28/SiGe quantum dots in two dimensions.

TI A Highly Efficient, Low-Cost Microwave Resonator for Exciting a Diamond
   Sample from a Miniaturized Quantum Magnetometer
SO METROLOGY
AB Optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) of nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamonds, in addition to optical excitation with green light, requires microwave excitation and thus a microwave structure. While many different microwave structures including microwave resonators have been presented in the past, none of them fulfilled the need to fit inside the miniaturized quantum magnetometer with limited space used in this work. This is why a novel microwave resonator design using commercially available printed circuit board technology is proposed. It is demonstrated that this design is of small form factor, highly power efficient and low-cost, with very good reproducibility, and in addition, it can be fabricated as a flexible printed circuit board to be bent and thus fit into the miniaturized sensor used in this work. The design choices made for the resonator and the way in which it was trimmed and optimized geometrically are presented and ODMR spectra made with a miniaturized quantum sensor in combination with such a resonator, which was fed by a microwave generator set to different microwave powers, are shown. These measurements revealed that a microwave power of -4 dBm is sufficient to excite the ms = +/- 1 states of the nitrogen-vacancy centers, while exceeding -1 dBm already introduces sidebands in the ODMR spectrum. This underlines the efficiency of the resonator in exciting the nitrogen-vacancies of the diamond in the sensor platform used and can lead to development of low-power quantum sensors in the future.

TI A Blockchain-Enabled Privacy-Preserving IoT Framework With
   Domain-Adaptive Anomaly Detection in Zero-Trust Environments
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Although the fast growth of Internet of Things (IoT) across multiple industries has significantly enhanced operational efficiency, it also brings major security and privacy management obstacles-particularly in zero-trust environments. Centralized security systems demonstrate built-in scalability constraints and susceptibility to attacks, whereas blockchain solutions provide decentralized audit capabilities but face challenges with latency and storage capacity limitations. Our work advances IoT security and privacy protection through a blockchain-based framework that combines a permissioned blockchain system with sophisticated cryptographic protocols (including post-quantum cryptography) and implements off-chain storage with IPFS alongside an adversarial domain adaptation method for real-time anomaly detection. Our approach addresses common criticisms found in the literature by publishing detailed simulation parameters and comparing our system with leading frameworks-such as vanilla PoW, Hyperledger Fabric, and DAG-based chains (e.g., IOTA)-while assessing performance through NS-3 network simulations. We include extensive threat model analyses that examine collusion and Sybil attacks on off-chain storage nodes as well as quantum computing risks, and we confirm anomaly detection performance with standardized datasets (e.g., N-BaIoT, UNSW-Sensor) using robust statistical measures. Our experiments demonstrate up to a 35 % reduction in end-to-end latency (compared to baseline PoW systems), a 40% increase in throughput (compared to baseline PoW systems), and a 70% reduction in on-chain storage overhead (compared to direct on-chain storage without IPFS and coding) while maintaining anomaly detection accuracy above 90 % under domain shifts. These performance improvements highlight the potential of our approach to enable secure, real-time monitoring in resource-constrained deployments such as remote patient health tracking, industrial automation lines, and large-scale smart city sensor networks. Comprehensive testing on platforms like Raspberry Pi 4 and ESP32 demonstrates that the framework delivers strong performance and reliability even under strict zero-trust security requirements.

TI Mapping electronic decoherence pathways in molecules
SO PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF
   AMERICA
AB Establishing the fundamental chemical principles that govern molecular electronic quantum decoherence has remained an outstanding challenge. Fundamental questions such as how solvent and intramolecular vibrations or chemical functionalization contribute to the decoherence remain unanswered and are beyond the reach of state -of-the-art theoretical and experimental approaches. Here we address this challenge by developing a strategy to isolate electronic decoherence pathways for molecular chromophores immersed in condensed phase environments that enables elucidating how electronic quantum coherence is lost. For this, we first identify resonance Raman spectroscopy as a general experimental method to reconstruct molecular spectral densities with full chemical complexity at room temperature, in solvent, and for fluorescent and non-fluorescent molecules. We then show how to quantitatively capture the decoherence dynamics from the spectral density and identify decoherence pathways by decomposing the overall coherence loss into contributions due to individual molecular vibrations and solvent modes. We illustrate the utility of the strategy by analyzing the electronic decoherence pathways of the DNA base thymine in water. Its electronic coherences decay in similar to 30 fs. The early-time decoherence is determined by intramolecular vibrations while the overall decay by solvent. Chemical substitution of thymine modulates the decoherence with hydrogen-bond interactions of the thymine ring with water leading to the fastest decoherence. Increasing temperature leads to faster decoherence as it enhances the importance of solvent contributions but leaves the early-time decoherence dynamics intact. The developed strategy opens key opportunities to establish the connection between molecular structure and quantum decoherence as needed to develop chemical strategies to rationally modulate it.

TI Characterizing the magnetic noise power spectrum of dark spins in
   diamond
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB Coherence times of spin qubits in solid-state platforms are often limited by the presence of a spin bath. While some properties of these typically dark bath spins can be indirectly characterized via the central qubit, it is important to characterize their properties by direct measurement. Here we use pulsed electron paramagnetic resonance (pEPR) based Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill (CPMG) dynamical decoupling to measure the magnetic noise power spectra for ensembles of P1 (substitutional nitrogen) centers in diamond that typically form the bath for NV (nitrogen-vacancy) centers. The experiments on the P1 centers were performed on a low [N] CVD (chemical vapor deposition) sample and a high [N] HPHT (high-temperature, high-pressure) sample at 89 mT. We characterize the NV centers of the latter sample using the same 2.5 GHz pEPR spectrometer. All power spectra show two distinct features, a broad component that is observed to scale as approximately 1/omega(0.7-1.0), and a prominent peak at the C-13 Larmor frequency. The behavior of the broad component is consistent with an inhomogeneous distribution of Lorentzian spectra due to clustering of P1 centers, which has recently been shown to be prevalent in HPHT diamond. It is unknown if such clustering occurs in CVD diamond. We develop techniques utilizing harmonics of the CPMG filter function to improve characterization of high-frequency signals, which we demonstrate on the C-13 nuclear Larmor frequency. At 190 mT this is 2.04 MHz, 5.7 times higher than the CPMG modulation frequency (<357 kHz, hardware-limited). We assess the robustness of our methods in the presence of finite pulse widths and flip angle errors. Understanding the interactions of dark spins will inform methods of diamond fabrication for quantum technology. These techniques are applicable to ac magnetometry for nanoscale nuclear magnetic resonance and chemical sensing.

TI Bargmann-invariant framework for local unitary equivalence and
   entanglement
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Research on quantum states often focuses on the correlation between nonlocal effects and local unitary invariants, among which local unitary equivalence plays a significant role in quantum state classification and resource theories. This paper focuses on the local unitary equivalence of multipartite quantum states in quantum information theory, aiming to determine a complete set of invariants that identify their local unitary orbits; these invariants are crucial for deriving polynomial invariants and describing the physical properties preserved under local unitary transformations. The study deeply explores the characterization of local unitary equivalence and the method of detecting entanglement using local unitary Bargmann invariants. Taking two-qubit systems as an example, it verifies the measurability of invariants that determine equivalence and establishes a connection between Makhlin fundamental invariants (a complete set of 18 local unitary invariants for two-qubit states) and local unitary Bargmann invariants. These Bargmann invariants, related to the traces of products of density operators and marginal states, can be measured through cycle tests (an extended form of SWAP tests).

TI Axiomatic Approach to Measures of Total Correlations
SO ENTROPY
AB Correlations play a pivotal role in various fields of science, particularly in quantum mechanics, yet their proper quantification remains a subject of debate. In this work, we aimed to discuss the challenge of defining a reliable measure of total correlations. We first outlined the essential properties that an effective correlation measure should satisfy and reviewed existing measures, including quantum mutual information, the p-norm of the correlation matrix, and the recently defined quantum Pearson correlation coefficient. Additionally, we introduced new measures based on R & eacute;nyi and Tsallis relative entropies, as well as the Kullback-Leibler divergence. Our analysis revealed that while quantum mutual information, the p-norm, and the Pearson measure exhibit equivalence for two-qubit systems, they all suffer from an ordering problem. Despite criticisms regarding its reliability, we argued that QMI remains a valid measure of total correlations.

TI Experimental verification of trade-off relation for coherence and
   disturbance
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB When a quantum system is sent through a noisy channel, it is usually disturbed. At the same time, the system undergoes decoherence and tends to lose some delicate quantum features. For a particular basis, the coherence of the state changes. Otherwise, if the system is not disturbed, its state might retain all of coherence. As quantum noisy channels lead to both disturbance and decoherence, it is natural to ask about the relation between disturbance and decoherence. Recently, a trade-off relation for coherence and disturbance has been presented by Sharma and Pati (2018 Phys. Rev. A 97 062308). In this paper, with entangled photon pairs and linear optics, we experimentally verify this trade-off relation for a single-qubit system undergoing various noisy channels. Our experimental results agree with the theoretical predictions and provide a quantitative understanding of the relation between quantum channels and resources.

AB Quantum circuit synthesis translates a classical Boolean function into an equivalent quantum circuit. The synthesis is solvable by playing the reversible pebble game on the logic network of the function. However, optimal solutions are impractical for large networks, affecting the number of qubits and gates of the final quantum circuit. In this work, we improve the solution of the reversible pebble game by leveraging dominance relations on the directed acyclic graph of the classical function, reducing qubits needed for syntheses. The proposed algorithm exposes a tunable tradeoff between the available number of qubits and the circuit size expressed as T-count and T-depth. We experimentally validate our methodology on cryptographic and arithmetic benchmarks, reporting reductions between 37% and 83% in qubit number with respect to Bennet syntheses algorithms and complete the majority of our syntheses in less than a second, improving on the current running times of state of the art approaches.

TI Efficient Discrete Feature Encoding for Variational Quantum Classifier
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM ENGINEERING
AB Recent days have witnessed significant interests in applying quantum-enhanced techniques for solving a variety of machine learning tasks. Variational methods that use quantum resources of imperfect quantum devices with the help of classical computing techniques are popular for supervised learning. Variational quantum classification (VQC) is one of such methods with possible quantum advantage in using quantum-enhanced features that are hard to compute by classical methods. Its performance depends on the mapping of classical features into a quantum-enhanced feature space. Although there have been many quantum-mapping functions proposed so far, there is little discussion on efficient mapping of discrete features, such as age group, zip code, and others, which are often significant for classifying datasets of interest. We first introduce the use of quantum random-access coding (QRAC) to map such discrete features efficiently into limited number of qubits for VQC. In numerical simulations, we present a range of encoding strategies and demonstrate their limitations and capabilities. We experimentally show that QRAC can help speeding up the training of VQC by reducing its parameters via saving on the number of qubits for the mapping. We confirm the effectiveness of the QRAC in VQC by experimenting on classification of real-world datasets with both simulators and real quantum devices.

TI Operational Markovianization in randomized benchmarking
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB A crucial task to obtain optimal and reliable quantum devices is to quantify their overall performance. The average fidelity of quantum gates is a particular figure of merit that can be estimated efficiently by randomized benchmarking (RB). However, the concept of gate-fidelity itself relies on the crucial assumption that noise behaves in a predictable, time-local, or so-called Markovian manner, whose breakdown can naturally become the leading source of errors as quantum devices scale in size and depth. We analytically show that error suppression techniques such as dynamical decoupling (DD) and Pauli-twirling can operationally Markovianize RB: (i) fast DD reduces non-Markovian RB to an exponential decay plus longer-time corrections, while on the other hand, (ii) Pauli-twirling generally does not affect the average, but (iii) it always suppresses the variance of such RB outputs. We demonstrate these effects numerically with a qubit noise model. Our results show that simple and efficient error suppression methods can simultaneously tame non-Markovian noise and allow for standard and reliable gate quality estimation, a fundamentally important task in the path toward fully functional quantum devices.

TI Imaginary-time propagation on a quantum chip
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Evolution in imaginary time is a prominent technique for finding the ground state of quantum many-body systems, and the heart of a number of numerical methods that have been used with great success in quantum chemistry, condensed matter, and nuclear physics. We propose an algorithm to implement imaginary time propagation on a quantum computer. Our algorithm is devised in the context of an efficient encoding into an optimized gate, drawing on the underlying characteristics of the quantum device of a unitary operation in an extended Hilbert space. However, we prove that for simple problems it can also be successfully applied to standard digital quantum machines. This work paves the way for porting quantum many-body methods based on imaginary-time propagation to near-term quantum devices, enabling the future quantum simulation of the ground states of a broad class of microscopic systems.

TI Quantum Fisher information and skew information correlations in dipolar
   spin system
SO PHYSICA SCRIPTA
AB Quantum Fisher information (QFI) and skew information (SI) plays a key role in the quantum resource theory. Understanding these measures in the physical system has practical significance in the state parameter estimation and quantum metrology. In this article, we consider a pair of spin-1/2 particles coupled with dipolar and Dzyaloshinsky-Moriya (DM) interactions, serving as the physical carrier of quantum information. We examine the bipartite nonlocal correlations of pair of spin-1/2 particle system for the thermal equilibrium states, characterized by local quantum uncertainty (LQU) and local quantum Fisher information (lQFI). The effects of dipolar coupling constants on quantum correlation quantifiers are studied. The DM interaction greatly enhances the quantum correlation in the system whereas the temperature tends to annihilate the amount of quantum correlations.

TI Floquet-Mode Traveling-Wave Parametric Amplifiers
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Simultaneous ideal quantum measurements of multiple single-photon-level signals would advance applications in quantum information processing, metrology, and astronomy but require the first amplifier to be simultaneously broadband, quantum limited, and directional. However, conventional traveling-wave parametric amplifiers support broadband amplification at the cost of increased added noise and are not genuinely directional due to non-negligible nonlinear backward-wave generation. In this work, we introduce a new class of amplifiers that encode the information in the Floquet modes of the system. Such Floquet-mode amplifiers prevent information leakage and overcome the trade-off between quantum efficiency (QE) and bandwidth. Crucially, Floquet-mode amplifiers strongly suppress the nonlinear forward-backward wave coupling and are therefore genuinely directional and readily integrable with qubits, clearing another major obstacle toward broadband ideal quantum measurements. Furthermore, Floquet-mode amplifiers are insensitive to out-of-band impedance mismatch, which otherwise may lead to gain ripples, parametric oscillations, and instability in conventional traveling-wave parametric amplifiers. Finally, we show that a Floquet-mode Josephson traveling-wave parametric amplifier implementation can simultaneously achieve > 20 dB gain and a QE of eta/eta(id)(eal) > 99.9% of the quantum limit over more than an octave of bandwidth. The proposed Floquet scheme is also widely applicable to other platforms, such as kinetic inductance traveling-wave amplifiers and optical parametric amplifiers.

TI Solving quantum master equations with deep quantum neural networks
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Deep quantum neural networks may provide a promising way to achieve a quantum learning advantage with noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices. Here, we use deep quantum feed-forward neural networks capable of universal quantum computation to represent the mixed states for open quantum many-body systems and introduce a variational method with quantum derivatives to solve the master equation for dynamics and stationary states. Owning to the special structure of the quantum networks, this approach enjoys a number of notable features, including an efficient quantum analog of the back-propagation algorithm, resource-saving reuse of hidden qubits, general applicability independent of dimensionality and entanglement properties, as well as the convenient implementation of symmetries. As proof-of-principle demonstrations, we apply this approach to both one-dimensional transverse field Ising and two-dimensional J(1) -J(2) models with dissipation, and show that it can efficiently capture their dynamics and stationary states with a desired accuracy.

TI Towards generation of hybrid entangled photon pairs by spectrally
   overlapping intermodal-vectorial four-wave mixing bands in optical
   fibers
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Optical fiber-based sources of photon pairs with hybrid entanglement across multiple degrees of freedom are essential for a wide range of quantum technologies, while remaining compatible with existing communication networks. In this paper, we use a birefringent few-mode fiber to demonstrate an intermodal-vectorial four-wave mixing process that generates two pairs of spectrally overlapping signal-idler bands. Using phase-matching conditions, we show that the pairs of bands become spectrally indistinguishable when the group refractive indices of the signal and idler modes intersect at the pump wavelength. Our theoretical predictions are confirmed through experimental observations and corroborated by numerical simulations. Furthermore, we introduce the two-photon state associated with the overlapping bands, which simultaneously exhibits entanglement in a single degree of freedom and hybrid entanglement across multiple degrees of freedom. We also explain how the type and degree of entanglement can be controlled by tailoring the spectral overlap between the signal-idler bands. This study presents a promising scheme for a fiber-based source of photon pairs with entanglement spanning the spatial, polarization, and frequency degrees of freedom.

TI Quantum data centres: a simulation-based comparative noise analysis
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Quantum data centres (QDCs) could overcome the scalability challenges of modern quantum computers. Single-processor monolithic quantum computers are affected by increased cross talk and difficulty of implementing gates when the number of qubits is increased. In a QDC, multiple quantum processing units (QPUs) are linked together over short distances, allowing the total number of computational qubits to be increased without increasing the number of qubits on any one processor. In doing so, the error incurred by operations at each QPU can be kept small, however additional noise will be added to the system due to the latency cost and errors incurred during inter-QPU entanglement distribution. We investigate the relative impact of these different types of noise using a classically simulated QDC with two QPUs and compare the robustness to noise of the two main ways of implementing remote gates, cat-comm and TP-comm. We find that considering the quantity of gates or inter-QPU entangled links is often inadequate to predict the output fidelity from a quantum circuit and infer that an improved understanding of error propagation during distributed quantum circuits may represent a significant optimisation opportunity for compilation.

TI Partitioning Quantum Chemistry Simulations with Clifford Circuits
SO JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL THEORY AND COMPUTATION
AB Current quantum computing hardware is restricted by theavailabilityof only few, noisy qubits which limits the investigation of larger,more complex molecules in quantum chemistry calculations on quantumcomputers in the near term. In this work, we investigate the limitsof their classical and near-classical treatment while staying withinthe framework of quantum circuits and the variational quantum eigensolver.To this end, we consider naive and physically motivated, classicallyefficient product ansatz for the parametrized wavefunction adaptingthe separable-pair ansatz form. We combine it with post-treatmentto account for interactions between subsystems originating from thisansatz. The classical treatment is given by another quantum circuitthat has support between the enforced subsystems and is folded intothe Hamiltonian. To avoid an exponential increase in the number ofHamiltonian terms, the entangling operations are constructed frompurely Clifford or near-Clifford circuits. While Clifford circuitscan be simulated efficiently classically, they are not universal.In order to account for missing expressibility, near-Clifford circuitswith only few, selected non-Clifford gates are employed. The exactcircuit structure to achieve this objective is molecule-dependentand is constructed using simulated annealing and genetic algorithms.We demonstrate our approach on a set of molecules of interest andinvestigate the extent of our methodology's reach.

TI Thermal Weight Determination and Interstate Coupling in State-Averaged
   ADAPT-VQE
SO JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL THEORY AND COMPUTATION
AB Characterizing electronic thermal states at low temperatures is an important but challenging task in quantum chemistry and condensed matter physics, making it a prime candidate for a useful application in quantum computing. One of the most successful methods for state preparation on quantum computers is the Adaptive, Problem-Tailored (ADAPT) Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE), which has recently been generalized to treat excited states within a state-averaged framework as well as Gibbs states. In this work, we introduce Helmholtz-Optimized Thermal (HOT) ADAPT-VQE, an ancilla-free strategy for preparing Gibbs states that directly minimizes the Helmholtz free energy by targeting the dominant eigenstates of the thermal ensemble. We demonstrate the usefulness of HOT-ADAPT-VQE by predicting the free energy of two model systems with strongly correlated ground states: (1) the Fe2+ cation in a magnetic field and (2) a [Cu2O7]10- fragment of the Mott insulator La2CuO4. Our results demonstrate that HOT-ADAPT-VQE significantly improves upon Gibbs-state estimates from multistate variants of ADAPT-VQE, often with substantially shallower quantum circuits, making it a promising candidate for thermal-state calculations.

TI An inductive bias from quantum mechanics: learning order effects with
   non-commuting measurements
SO QUANTUM MACHINE INTELLIGENCE
AB There are two major approaches to building good machine learning algorithms: feeding lots of data into large models or picking a model class with an "inductive bias" that suits the structure of the data. When taking the second approach as a starting point to design quantum algorithms for machine learning, it is important to understand how mathematical structures in quantum mechanics can lead to useful inductive biases in quantum models. In this work, we bring a collection of theoretical evidence from the quantum cognition literature to the field of quantum machine learning to investigate how non-commutativity of quantum observables can help to learn data with "order effects," such as the changes in human answering patterns when swapping the order of questions in a survey. We design a multi-task learning setting in which a generative quantum model consisting of sequential learnable measurements can be adapted to a given task - or question order - by changing the order of observables, and we provide artificial datasets inspired by human psychology to carry out our investigation. Our first experimental simulations show that in some cases the quantum model learns more non-commutativity as the amount of order effect present in the data is increased and that the quantum model can learn to generate better samples for unseen question orders when trained on others - both signs that the model architecture suits the task.

TI Analyzing variational quantum landscapes with information content
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB The parameters of the quantum circuit in a variational quantum algorithm induce a landscape that contains the relevant information regarding its optimization hardness. In this work, we investigate such landscapes through the lens of information content, a measure of the variability between points in parameter space. Our major contribution connects the information content to the average norm of the gradient, for which we provide robust analytical bounds on its estimators. This result holds for any (classical or quantum) variational landscape. We validate the analytical understating by numerically studying the scaling of the gradient in an instance of the barren plateau problem. In such instance, we are able to estimate the scaling pre-factors in the gradient. Our work provides a way to analyze variational quantum algorithms in a data-driven fashion well-suited for near-term quantum computers.

AB We present a systematic and complementary study of quantum correlations near a black hole by considering measurement-induced nonlocality (MIN). The quantum measure of interest is discussed for the fermionic, bosonic and mixed fermion-boson modes on equal footing with respect to the Hawking radiation. The obtained results show that in the infinite Hawking temperature limit, the physically accessible correlations do not vanish only in the fermionic case. However, the higher frequency modes can sustain correlations for the finite Hawking temperature, with mixed systems being more sensitive towards the increase in the fermionic frequencies than the bosonic ones. Since the MIN for the latter modes quickly diminishes, the increased frequency may be a way to maintain nonlocal correlations for the scenarios at the finite Hawking temperature.

AB The objective of Quantum State Verification (QSV) is to evaluate whether an unknown quantum state is sufficiently similar to a predetermined target state at a certain confidence level. The required number of identical and independent copies, N, of an unknown state for such a task is inversely proportional to the spectral gap of a verification operator. Stabilizer states form a foundational class of quantum states, extensively utilized in quantum computing. Defined through a group of stabilizer operators constructed from Pauli matrices in qubit systems, their structural properties not only simplify the mathematical representation and simulation of quantum states but also make them particularly suitable for verification protocols that rely on local measurements. Restricting the verification operator to be those that can be achieved by local measurements, previous researches had determined an upper bound for the spectral gap to be 2/3 in the cases of qubit stabilizer states. In this research, we show a similar upper bound of d/(d+1) in the cases of graph states of d-level systems by a technique from [1] but adapted to d-level graph states. In particular, we show that d-level graph states are maximally entangled across any bipartition of the graph, which allows us to reduce the problem to the case of a bipartite maximally entangled d-level systems for which the maximal spectral gap is known.

TI Character of motional modes for entanglement and sympathetic cooling of
   mixed-species trapped-ion chains
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Modular mixed-species ion-trap networks are a promising framework for scalable quantum information processing, where one species acts as a memory qubit and another as a communication qubit. This architecture requires high-fidelity mixed-species entangling gates to transfer information from communication to memory qubits through their collective motion. We investigate the character of the motional modes of mixed-species ion chains of various lengths and in various trap potentials for entangling operations and sympathetic cooling. We find that the laser power required for high-fidelity entangling gates based on transverse modes is at least an order of magnitude higher than that for gates based on axial modes for ion species with a large mass ratio. We also find that for even moderate mass differences, the transverse modes are much harder to cool than the axial modes regardless of the ion chain configuration. Therefore, transverse modes conventionally used for operations in single-species ion chains may not be well suited for mixed-species chains with widely different masses.

TI Shallow-Depth Quantum Circuit for Unstructured Database Search
SO QUANTUM REPORTS
AB Grover's search algorithm (GSA) offers quadratic speedup in searching unstructured databases but suffers from exponential circuit depth complexity. Here, we present two quantum circuits called HX and Ry layers for the searching problem. Remarkably, both circuits maintain a fixed circuit depth of two and one, respectively, irrespective of the number of qubits used. When the target element's position index is known, we prove that either circuit, combined with a single multi-controlled X gate, effectively amplifies the target element's probability to over 0.99 for any qubit number greater than seven. To search unknown databases, we use the depth-1 Ry layer as the ansatz in the Variational Quantum Search (VQS), whose efficacy is validated through numerical experiments on databases with up to 26 qubits. The VQS with the Ry layer exhibits an exponential advantage, in circuit depth, over the GSA for databases of up to 26 qubits.

TI Preparations for quantum simulations of quantum chromodynamics in 1+1
   dimensions. I. Axial gauge
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
AB Tools necessary for quantum simulations of 1 + 1 dimensional quantum chromodynamics are developed. When formulated in axial gauge and with two flavors of quarks, this system requires 12 qubits per spatial site with the gauge fields included via nonlocal interactions. Classical computations and D-wave's quantum annealer Advantage are used to determine the hadronic spectrum, enabling a decomposition of the masses and a study of quark entanglement. Color "edge" states confined within a screening length of the end of the lattice are found. IBM's seven-qubit quantum computers, ibmq_jakarta and ibm_perth, are used to compute dynamics from the trivial vacuum in one -flavor QCD with one spatial site. More generally, the Hamiltonian and quantum circuits for time evolution of 1 + 1 dimensional SU(Nc) gauge theory with Nf flavors of quarks are developed, and the resource requirements for large-scale quantum simulations are estimated.

TI Information-Theoretic Bounds on Quantum Advantage in Machine Learning
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB We study the performance of classical and quantum machine learning (ML) models in predicting outcomes of physical experiments. The experiments depend on an input parameter x and involve execution of a (possibly unknown) quantum process epsilon. Our figure of merit is the number of runs of epsilon required to achieve a desired prediction performance. We consider classical ML models that perform a measurement and record the classical outcome after each run of epsilon, and quantum ML models that can access epsilon coherently to acquire quantum data; the classical or quantum data are then used to predict the outcomes of future experiments. We prove that for any input distribution D(x), a classical ML model can provide accurate predictions on average by accessing epsilon a number of times comparable to the optimal quantum ML model. In contrast, for achieving an accurate prediction on all inputs, we prove that the exponential quantum advantage is possible. For example, to predict the expectations of all Pauli observables in an n-qubit system rho, classical ML models require 2(Omega)((n)) copies of rho, but we present a quantum ML model using only O(n) copies. Our results clarify where the quantum advantage is possible and highlight the potential for classical ML models to address challenging quantum problems in physics and chemistry.

TI Noise-Tailored Constructions for Spin Wigner Function Kernels
SO ADVANCED PHYSICS RESEARCH
AB The effective use of noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices requires error mitigation to improve the accuracy of sampled measurement distributions. The more accurately the effects of noise on these distributions can be modeled, the more closely error mitigation will be able to approach theoretical bounds. The characterization of noisy quantum channels and the inference of their effects on general observables are challenging problems, but in many cases a change in representation can greatly simplify the analysis. Here, spin Wigner functions for multiqudit systems are investigated. This study generalizes previous kernel constructions, capturing the effects of several probabilistic unitary noise models in few parameters.
   This work explores the parameterization of spin Wigner functions to efficiently represent the effects of probabilistic unitary noise on a quantum state. Block diagonalization of the noise operator algebra is used to reduce the required number of parameters while maintaining the Stratonovich-Weyl conditions for the representation. Explicit kernel constructions are described for several local or slightly entangling noise processes. image

TI Proposal for noise-free visible-telecom quantum frequency conversion
   through third-order sum and difference frequency generation
SO OPTICS LETTERS
AB Quantum frequency conversion (QFC) between the visible and telecom is a key to connect quantum memories in fiber-based quantum networks. Current methods for linking such widely separated frequencies, such as sum/difference frequency generation and four-wave mixing Bragg scattering, are prone to broadband noise generated by the pump laser(s). To address this issue, we propose to use third-order sum/difference frequency generation (TSFG/TDFG) for an upconversion/downconversion QFC interface. In this process, two long wavelength pump photons combine their energy and momentum to mediate frequency conversion across the large spectral gap between the visible and telecom bands, which is particularly beneficial from the noise perspective. We show that waveguide-coupled silicon nitride microring resonators can be designed for efficient QFC between 606 and 1550 nm via a 1990 nm pump through TSFG/TDFG. We simulate the device dispersion and coupling, and from the simulated parameters, estimate that the frequency conversion can be efficient (>80%) at 50 mW pump power. Our results suggest that microresonator TSFG/TDFG is promising for compact, scalable, and low-power QFC across large spectral gaps. (C) 2021 Optical Society of America

TI Optimal Control-Based Grover's Algorithm for a Six-Jointed Articulated
   Robotic Arm
SO ELECTRONICS
AB This paper introduces a novel theoretical framework that reformulates optimal control as a quantum search problem using Grover's algorithm, leveraging its quadratic speedup. Specifically, the method encodes all possible control inputs into a quantum superposition state and uses a reference value interpreted as a candidate minimum to evaluate which inputs yield a lower control cost. To guide the search, we integrate a quantum comparator circuit to identify the inputs below this reference, and quantum counting to estimate their number. The reference is iteratively updated using a sigmoid-based rule until only one input satisfies the condition, thereby ensuring convergence to the global minimum within the discretized control space. Although full quantum implementation is currently infeasible due to oracle complexity and hardware limitations, we simulate the process using a classical controller as a pseudo-oracle to illustrate the algorithmic structure. This work does not aim to demonstrate performance gains but rather to establish a foundational method for embedding control synthesis within Grover-based quantum circuits. The framework paves the way for scalable quantum control systems once hardware resources permit full realization.

AB Quantum computers have the potential to outperform classical computers for some complex computational problems. However, current quantum computers (e.g., from IBM and Google) have inherent noise that results in errors in the outputs of quantum software executing on the quantum computers, affecting the reliability of quantum software development. The industry is increasingly interested in machine learning (ML)-based error mitigation techniques, given their scalability and practicality. However, existing ML-based techniques have limitations, such as only targeting specific noise types or specific quantum circuits. This paper proposes a practical ML-based approach, called Q-LEAR, with a novel feature set, to mitigate noise errors in quantum software outputs. We evaluated Q-LEAR on eight quantum computers and their corresponding noisy simulators, all from IBM, and compared Q-LEAR with a state-of-the-art ML-based approach taken as baseline. Results show that, compared to the baseline, Q-LEAR achieved a 25% average improvement in error mitigation on both real quantum computers and simulators. We also discuss the implications and practicality of Q-LEAR, which, we believe, is valuable for practitioners.

TI Correlations and projective measurements in maximally entangled
   multipartite states
SO ANNALS OF PHYSICS
AB Multipartite quantum states constitute the key resource for quantum computation. The understanding of their internal structure is thus of great importance in the field of quantum information. This paper aims at examining the structure of multipartite maximally entangled pure states, using tools with a simple and intuitive physical meaning, namely, projective measurements and correlations. We first show how, in such states, a very simple relation arises between post-measurement expectation values and pre-measurement correlations. We then infer the consequences of this relation on the structure of the recently introduced entanglement metric, allowing us to provide an upper bound for the persistency of entanglement. The dependence of these features on the chosen measurement axis is underlined, and two simple optimization procedures are proposed, to find those maximizing the correlations. Finally, we apply our procedures onto some prototypical examples.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI Measurement-induced purification in large-N hybrid Brownian
   circuits
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB Competition between unitary dynamics that scrambles quantum information nonlocally and local measurements that probe and collapse the quantum state can result in a measurement-induced entanglement phase transition. Here we study this phenomenon in an analytically tractable all-to-all Brownian hybrid circuit model composed of qubits. The system is initially entangled with an equal sized reference, and the subsequent hybrid system dynamics either partially preserves or totally destroys this entanglement depending on the measurement rate. Our approach can access a variety of entropic observables which are distinguished by the averaging procedure, and for concreteness we focus on a particular purity quantity for which the averaging is particularly simple. We represent the purity as a path integral coupling four replicas with twisted boundary conditions. Saddle-point analysis reveals a second-order phase transition corresponding to replica permutation symmetry breaking below a critical measurement rate. The transition is mean-field-like and we characterize the critical properties near the transition in terms of a simple Ising field theory in 0 + 1 dimensions. In addition to studying the purity of the entire system, we study subsystem purities and relate these results to manifestations of quantum error correction in the model. We also comment on the experimental feasibility for simulating this averaged purity, and corroborate our results with exact diagonalization for modest system sizes.

TI Time-Dependent Hamiltonian Simulation Using Discrete-Clock Constructions
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Compared with time-independent Hamiltonians, the dynamics of generic quantum Hamiltonians H(t) are complicated by the presence of time ordering in the evolution operator. In the context of digital quantum simulation, this difficulty prevents a direct adaptation of many time-independent simulation algorithms for time-dependent simulation. However, there exists a framework within the theory of dynamical systems that eliminates time ordering by adding a "clock" degree of freedom. In this work, we provide a computational framework, based on this reduction, for encoding time-dependent dynamics as time- independent systems. As a result, we make two advances in digital Hamiltonian simulation. First, we create a time-dependent simulation algorithm based on performing qubitization on the augmented clock system and, in doing so, provide the first qubitization-based approach to time-dependent Hamiltonians that goes beyond Trotterization of the ordered exponential. Second, we define a natural generalization of multiproduct formulas for time-ordered exponentials and then propose and analyze an algorithm based on these formulas. Unlike other algorithms of similar accuracy, the multiproduct approach achieves commutator scaling, meaning that this method outperforms existing methods for physically local time-dependent Hamiltonians with sufficient smoothness. Our work reduces the disparity between time-dependent and time-independent simulation and indicates a step toward optimal quantum simulation of time-dependent Hamiltonians.

TI Mixed-state entanglement and information recovery in thermalized states
   and evaporating black holes
SO JOURNAL OF HIGH ENERGY PHYSICS
AB We study the universal behavior of quantum information-theoretic quantities in thermalized isolated quantum many-body systems and evaporating black holes. In particular, we study a genuine mixed-state entanglement measure called the logarithmic negativity, other correlation measures including the Renyi negativities and the mutual information, and a signature of multipartite entanglement called the reflected entropy. We also probe the feasibility of recovering quantum information from subsystems of a thermalized quantum many-body system or from the radiation of an evaporating black hole, using quantities such as relative entropy and Petz map fidelity. A recently developed technique called the equilibrium approximation allows us to probe these quantities at finite temperature. We find striking qualitative differences from the infinite temperature case, which has been the topic of previous studies using Haar-random states. In particular, we find regimes where the logarithmic negativity is extensive but the mutual information is sub-extensive, indicating a large amount of undistillable, bound entanglement in thermalized states. For evaporating black holes at finite temperature, both the logarithmic negativity and the Petz map fidelity reveal an important new time scale t(b), which is earlier than the Page time t(p) by a finite fraction of the total evaporation time. We find that t(b), as opposed to t(p), is the time scale at which quantum entanglement between different parts of the radiation becomes extensive, and the fidelity of information recovery for a large diary thrown into the black hole starts to grow.

AB Parameter identification of quantum systems is a fundamental task in developing practical quantum technology. In this article, we study the identification of time-varying decoherence rates for open quantum systems. Given the measurement data of local observables, this can be formulated as an optimization problem. We expand the unknown decoherence rates into Fourier series and take the expansion coefficients as optimization variables. We then convert it into a minimax problem and apply a sequential linear programming technique to solve it. Numerical study on a two-qubit quantum system with a time-varying decoherence rate demonstrates the effectiveness of our algorithm.

TI Synthesis Strategy of Reversible Circuits on DNA Computers
SO SYMMETRY-BASEL
AB DNA computers and quantum computers are gaining attention as alternatives to classical digital computers. DNA is a biological material that can be reprogrammed to perform computing functions. Quantum computing performs reversible computations by nature based on the laws of quantum mechanics. In this paper, DNA computing and reversible computing are combined to propose novel theoretical methods to implement reversible gates and circuits in DNA computers based on strand displacement reactions, since the advantages of reversible logic gates can be exploited to improve the capabilities and functionalities of DNA computers. This paper also proposes a novel universal reversible gate library (URGL) for synthesizing n-bit reversible circuits using DNA to reduce the average length and cost of the constructed circuits when compared with previous methods. Each n-bit URGL contains building blocks to generate all possible permutations of a symmetric group of degree n. Our proposed group (URGL) in the paper is a permutation group. The proposed implementation methods will improve the efficiency of DNA computer computations as the results of DNA implementations are better in terms of quantum cost, DNA cost, and circuit length.

AB This paper investigates photonic continuous-variable Born machines (CVBMs), which utilize photonic quantum states as resources for continuous probability distributions. Implementing exact gradient descent in the CVBM training process is often infeasible, bringing forward the need to approximate the gradients using an estimator obtained from a smaller number of samples, obtaining a quantum stochastic gradient descent (SGD) method. In this work, the ability to train CVBMs is analyzed using stochastic gradients obtained using relatively few samples from the probability distribution corresponding to homodyne measurement. The main obstacle to this analysis is that classically simulating CVBMs and obtaining samples is a demanding task, while a large number of iterations are needed to achieve convergence. The present research is enabled by a novel strategy to simulate homodyne detections of generic multimode photonic states using a classical computer. With this approach, a more comprehensive study of CVBMs is made possible, and the training of multimode CVBMs is demonstrated with parametric quantum circuits considerably larger than in previous articles. More specifically, we use the proposed algorithm to demonstrate learning of multimode quantum distributions using CVBMs. Moreover, successful CVBM trainings were demonstrated with the use of stochastic gradients.

TI Implementation of a simultaneous message-passing protocol using optical
   vortices
SO OPTICS AND LASER TECHNOLOGY
AB The implementation of optical quantum gates comes at the cost of incorporating a source of nonclassical light, which suffers from a low flux of photons, and thus, long acquisition times. Quantum-mimetic optical gates combine the benefits of quantum systems with the convenience of using intense light beams. Here, we are concerned with the classical implementation of a controlled-SWAP (c-SWAP) gate using the tools of structured light. A c-SWAP gate is a three-qubit gate, where one of the input qubits controls the exchange of information between the other two qubits. We use Laguerre-Gauss beams to realize the c-SWAP gate and demonstrate one of its primary applications: the comparison of two signals without revealing their content, i.e., a simultaneous message-passing protocol. We achieve signal-comparison measurements with modulation speeds of kHz using a digital micro mirror device as a spatial light modulator. Our system is capable of performing dynamic error analysis and a normalization procedure, which overcomes the necessity of data postprocessing and largely reduces comparison times.

TI Local tensor-network codes
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB Tensor-network codes enable the construction of large stabilizer codes out of tensors describing smaller stabilizer codes. An application of tensor-network codes was an efficient and exact decoder for holographic codes. Here, we show how to write some topological codes, including the surface code and colour code, as simple tensor-network codes. We also show how to calculate distances of stabilizer codes by contracting a tensor network. The algorithm actually gives more information, including a histogram of all logical coset weights. We prove that this method is efficient in the case of stabilizer codes encoded via local log-depth circuits in one dimension and holographic codes. Using our tensor-network distance calculator, we find a modification of the rotated surface code that has the same distance but fewer minimum-weight logical operators by 'doping' the tensor network, i.e., we break the homogeneity of the tensor network by locally replacing tensors. For this example, this corresponds to an improvement in successful error correction of almost 2% against depolarizing noise (in the perfect-measurement setting), but comes at the cost of introducing three higher-weight stabilizers. Our general construction lets us pick a network geometry (e.g., a Euclidean lattice in the case of the surface code), and, using only a small set of seed codes (constituent tensors), build extensive codes with the potential for optimisation.

TI Entanglement Generation of Polar Molecules via Deep Reinforcement
   Learning
SO JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL THEORY AND COMPUTATION
AB Polar molecules are a promising platform for achieving scalable quantum information processing because of their long-range electric dipole-dipole interactions. Here, we take the coupled ultracold CaF molecules in an external electric field with gradient as qubits and concentrate on the creation of intermolecular entanglement with the method of deep reinforcement learning (RL). After sufficient training episodes, the educated RL agents can discover optimal time-dependent control fields that steer the molecular systems from separate states to two-qubit and three-qubit entangled states with high fidelities. We analyze the fidelities and the negativities (characterizing entanglement) of the generated states as a function of training episodes. Moreover, we present the population dynamics of the molecular systems under the influence of control fields discovered by the agents. Compared with the schemes for creating molecular entangled states based on optimal control theory, some conditions (e.g., molecular spacing and electric field gradient) adopted in this work are more feasible in the experiment. Our results demonstrate the potential of machine learning to effectively solve quantum control problems in polar molecular systems.

TI Quantum Speedup for Multiuser Detection With Optimized Parameters in
   Grover Adaptive Search
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Maximum-likelihood multiuser detection incurs a large computational complexity, and its low-complexity detection scheme suffers from a performance loss, where this tradeoff is inevitable and inherent in a classical computer. In this paper, we use the Grover adaptive search (GAS) to break the tradeoff, which is a quantum exhaustive search algorithm guaranteed to obtain the optimal solution, achieving a quadratic speedup. Specifically, we design two specific parameters of GAS to achieve the optimal performance with a reduced complexity: the initial threshold and the number of Grover rotations. The initial threshold of GAS can be optimized using a solution of semi-definite programming, and it is possible to calculate the distribution of the number of solutions smaller than the initial threshold in advance, which depends on instantaneous channel coefficients. In addition, we analyze the number of quantum gates required for GAS and show that the gate count can be reduced by bypassing the higher-order terms in the objective function, leading to a reduced circuit runtime. Our analysis and simulation results demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves the same performance as the optimal maximum-likelihood detection while reducing the query complexity of GAS, implying that the large constant overhead of quadratic speedup can be further reduced.

TI Active and Quantum Integrated Photonic Elements by Ion Exchange in Glass
SO APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
AB Ion exchange in glass has a long history as a simple and effective technology to produce gradient-index structures and has been largely exploited in industry and in research laboratories. In particular, ion-exchanged waveguide technology has served as an excellent platform for theoretical and experimental studies on integrated optical circuits, with successful applications in optical communications, optical processing and optical sensing. It should not be forgotten that the ion-exchange process can be exploited in crystalline materials, too, and several crucial devices, such as optical modulators and frequency doublers, have been fabricated by ion exchange in lithium niobate. Here, however, we are concerned only with glass material, and a brief review is presented of the main aspects of optical waveguides and passive and active integrated optical elements, as directional couplers, waveguide gratings, integrated optical amplifiers and lasers, all fabricated by ion exchange in glass. Then, some promising research activities on ion-exchanged glass integrated photonic devices, and in particular quantum devices (quantum circuits), are analyzed. An emerging type of passive and/or reconfigurable devices for quantum cryptography or even for specific quantum processing tasks are presently gaining an increasing interest in integrated photonics; accordingly, we propose their implementation by using ion-exchanged glass waveguides, also foreseeing their integration with ion-exchanged glass lasers.

It explores ideas around lived experience, quantum mechanics, affect and emotional residues, sympathetic magic, critical criminology and transformative criminology.

TI A Comprehensively Adaptive Architectural Optimization-Ingrained Quantum
   Neural Network Model for Cloud Workloads Prediction
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NEURAL NETWORKS AND LEARNING SYSTEMS
AB Accurate workload prediction and advanced resource reservation are indispensably crucial for managing dynamic cloud services. Traditional neural networks and deep learning models frequently encounter challenges with diverse, high-dimensional workloads, especially during sudden resource demand changes, leading to inefficiencies. This issue arises from their limited optimization during training, relying only on parametric (interconnection weights) adjustments using conventional algorithms. To address this issue, this work proposes a novel comprehensively adaptive architectural optimization-based variable quantum neural network (CA-QNN), which combines the efficiency of quantum computing with complete structural and qubit vector parametric learning. The model converts workload data into qubits, processed through qubit neurons with controlled not-gated activation functions for intuitive pattern recognition. In addition, a comprehensive architecture optimization algorithm for networks is introduced to facilitate the learning and propagation of the structure and parametric values in variable-sized quantum neural networks (VQNNs). This algorithm incorporates quantum adaptive modulation (QAM) and size-adaptive recombination during the training process. The performance of the CA-QNN model is thoroughly investigated against seven state-of-the-art methods across four benchmark datasets of heterogeneous cloud workloads. The proposed model demonstrates superior prediction accuracy, reducing prediction errors by up to 93.40% and 91.27% compared to existing deep learning and QNN-based approaches.

TI On the optimality of quantum circuit initial mapping using reinforcement
   learning
SO EPJ QUANTUM TECHNOLOGY
AB Quantum circuit optimization is an inevitable task with the current noisy quantum backends. This task is considered non-trivial due to the varying circuits' complexities in addition to hardware-specific noise, topology, and limited connectivity. The currently available methods either rely on heuristics for circuit optimization tasks or reinforcement learning with complex unscalable neural networks such as transformers. In this paper, we are concerned with optimizing the initial logical-to-physical mapping selection. Specifically, we investigate whether a reinforcement learning agent with simple scalable neural network is capable of finding a near-optimal logical-to-physical mapping, that would decrease as much as possible additional CNOT gates, only from a fixed-length feature vector. To answer this question, we train a Maskable Proximal Policy Optimization agent to progressively take steps towards a near-optimal logical-to-physical mapping on a 20-qubit hardware architecture. Our results show that our agent coupled with a simple routing evaluation is capable of outperforming other available reinforcement learning and heuristics approaches on 12 out of 19 test benchmarks, achieving geometric mean improvements of 2.2% and 15% over the best available related work and two heuristics approaches, respectively. Additionally, our neural network model scales linearly as the number of qubits increases.

TI Reversible Optical Isolators and Quasi-Circulators Using a
   Magneto-Optical Fabry-Pérot Cavity
SO CHINESE PHYSICS LETTERS
AB Nonreciprocal optical devices are essential for laser protection, modern optical communication and quantum information processing by enforcing one-way light propagation. The conventional Faraday magneto-optical nonreciprocal devices rely on a strong magnetic field, which is provided by a permanent magnet. As a result, the isolation direction of such devices is fixed and severely restricts their applications in quantum networks. In this work, we experimentally demonstrate the simultaneous one-way transmission and unidirectional reflection by using a magneto-optical Fabry-Perot cavity and a magnetic field strength of 50 mT. An optical isolator and a three-port quasi-circulator are realized based on this nonreciprocal cavity system. The isolator achieves an isolation ratio of up to 22 dB and an averaged insertion loss down to 0.97 dB. The quasi-circulator is realized with a fidelity exceeding 99% and an overall survival probability of 89.9%, corresponding to an insertion loss of similar to 0.46 dB. The magnetic field is provided by an electromagnetic coil, thereby allowing for reversing the light circulating path. The reversible quasi-circulator paves the way for building reconfigurable quantum networks.

TI 6G Networks for Next Generation of Digital TV Beyond 2030
SO WIRELESS PERSONAL COMMUNICATIONS
AB This paper prosed a novel 6G QoS over the future 6G wireless architecture to offer excellent Quality of Service (QoS) for the next generation of digital TV beyond 2030. During the last 20 years, the way society used to watch and consume TV and Cinema has changed radically. The creation of the Over The Top content platforms based on Cloud Services followed by its commercial video consumption model, offering flexibility for subscribers such as n Video on Demand. Besides the new business model created, the network infrastructure and wireless technologies also permitted the streaming of high-quality TV and film formats such as High Definition, followed by the latest widespread TV standardization Ultra-High- Definition TV. Mobile Broadband services onset the possibility for consumers to watch TV or Video content anywhere at any time. However, the network infrastructure needs continuous improvement, primarily when crises, like the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and the worldwide pandemic, creates immense network traffic congestions. The outcome of that congestion was the decrease of QoS for such multimedia services, impacting the user's experience. More power-hungry video applications are commencing to test the networks' resilience and future roadmap of 5G and Beyond 5G (B5G). For this, 6G architecture planning must be focused on offering the ultimate QoS for prosumers beyond 2030.

TI Spin Dynamics of a Solid-State Qubit in Proximity to a Superconductor
SO NANO LETTERS
AB A broad effort is underway to understand and harness the interaction between superconductors and spin-active color centers with an eye on hybrid quantum devices and novel imaging modalities of superconducting materials. Most work, however, overlooks the interplay between either system and the environment created by the color center host. Here we use a diamond scanning probe to investigate the spin dynamics of a single nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center proximal to a superconducting film. We find that the presence of the superconductor increases the NV spin coherence lifetime, a phenomenon we tentatively rationalize as a change in the electric noise due to a superconductor-induced redistribution of charge carriers near induced redistribution of charge carriers near the NV. We then build on these findings to demonstrate transverse-relaxation-time-weighted imaging of the superconductor film. These results shed light on the dynamics governing the spin coherence of shallow NVs, and promise opportunities for new forms of noise spectroscopy and imaging of superconductors.

SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Although molecular vibronic spectra generation is pivotal for chemical analysis, tackling such exponentially complex tasks on classical computers remains inefficient. Quantum simulation, though theoretically promising, faces technological challenges in experimentally extracting vibronic spectra for molecules with multiple modes. Here, we propose a nontrivial algorithm to generate the vibronic spectra using states with zero displacements (squeezed vacuum states) coupled to a linear optical network, offering ease of experimental implementation. We also fabricate an integrated quantum photonic microprocessor chip as a versatile simulation platform containing 16 modes of single-mode squeezed vacuum states and a fully programmable interferometer network. Molecular vibronic spectra of formic acid and thymine under the Condon approximation are simulated using the quantum microprocessor chip with high reconstructed fidelity ( > 92%). Furthermore, vibronic spectra of naphthalene, phenanthrene, and benzene under the non-Condon approximation are also experimentally simulated. Such demonstrations could pave the way for solving complicated quantum chemistry problems involving vibronic spectra and computational tasks beyond the reach of classical computers.

TI Sensitivity to Mass Changes of Lakes, Subsurface Hydrology and Glaciers
   of the Quantum Technology Gravity Gradients and Time Observations of
   Satellite MOCAST
SO REMOTE SENSING
AB The quantum technology absolute gravimeters, gradiometers, and clocks are at the forefront of the instrumentation to be exploited in a future gravity mission (the QSG mission concept). Apart from the quantum payload, the mission design defines the choice of the number of satellites and the satellite orbit constellation, with the goal of optimizing the observation of the earth's gravity field and reducing aliasing phenomena. Our goal is to define the realistic gravity field changes generated by glaciers and lakes and define the sensitivity of the quantum gravity mission for the detection of hydrologic and cryospheric mass changes. The analysis focuses on mass changes in the high mountains of Asia and the South American continent. The mass changes are based on terrestrial and satellite observations and are of a climatic origin. We show that compared to the existing GRACE-FO mission, a quantum gravity mission significantly improves the detection of the climatic mass gain of lakes and mass loss of glaciers, allowing for smaller mass features to be distinguished, and smaller mass losses to be detected. The greater signal is the seasonal signal with a yearly period, which would be detected at the 10 Gt level for areas > 8000 km(2). The yearly mass loss of the Patagonian glaciers can be detected at the 5 Gt/yr level, an improvement from the 10 Gt/yr detectable by GRACE-FO. Spatial resolution would also be improved, with an increase of about 50% in spatial frequency for the detection of the mass change rate of lakes and glaciers in Tibet. The improved spatial resolution enables an improved localization of the lakes and glaciers affected by climatic mass change. The results will contribute to defining the user requirements of the future QSG missions.

TI Quantum advantage for noisy channel discrimination
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Many quantum mechanical experiments can be viewed as multiround interactive protocols between known quantum circuits and an unknown quantum process. Fully quantum "coherent" access to the unknown process is known to provide an advantage in many discrimination tasks compared to when only incoherent access is permitted, but it is unclear if this advantage persists when the process is noisy. Here, we show that a quantum advantage can be maintained when distinguishing between two noisy single-qubit rotation channels. Numerical and analytical calculations reveal a distinct transition between the performance of fully coherent and fully incoherent protocols as a function of noise strength. Moreover, the size of the region of coherent quantum advantage shrinks inverse polynomially in the number of channel uses, and in an intermediate regime an improved strategy is a hybrid of fully coherent and fully incoherent subroutines. The fully coherent protocol is based on quantum signal processing, suggesting a generalizable algorithmic framework for the study of quantum advantage in the presence of realistic noise.

TI How to Solve Combinatorial Optimization Problems Using Real Quantum
   Machines: A Recent Survey
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB A combinatorial optimization problem (COP) is the problem of finding the optimal solution in a finite set. When the size of the feasible solution set is large, the complexity of the problem increases, and it is not easy to solve in a reasonable time with the current classical computer technology. Quantum annealing (QA) is a method that replaces classical simulated annealing (SA) methods that do not solve these cases. Therefore, several attempts have been made to solve this problem using a special-purpose quantum annealer to which the QA method is applied. In this survey, we analyze recent studies that solve real-scale COPs using quantum annealers. Through this, we discuss how to reduce the size of the COP to be input to overcome the hardware limitations of the existing quantum annealer. Additionally, we demonstrated the applicability of quantum annealer to COP on a practical scale by comparing and analyzing the results of the classical simulated annealing (SA) and quantum annealing (QA) method from each study.

TI Monotonicity of a quantum 2-Wasserstein distance
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS A-MATHEMATICAL AND THEORETICAL
AB We study a quantum analogue of the 2-Wasserstein distance as a measure of proximity on the set ?(N) of density matrices of dimension N. We show that such (semi-)distances do not induce Riemannian metrics on the tangent bundle of ?(N) and are typically not unitarily invariant. Nevertheless, we prove that for N = 2 dimensional Hilbert space the quantum 2-Wasserstein distance (unique up to rescaling) is monotonous with respect to any single-qubit quantum operation and the solution of the quantum transport problem is essentially unique. Furthermore, for any N ? 3 and the quantum cost matrix proportional to a projector we demonstrate the monotonicity under arbitrary mixed unitary channels. Finally, we provide numerical evidence which allows us to conjecture that the unitary invariant quantum 2-Wasserstein semi-distance is monotonous with respect to all CPTP maps for dimension N = 3 and 4.

TI Continuously tunable CW single-frequency Nd:YAP/LBO laser with

SO CHINESE OPTICS LETTERS
AB We present a continuously tunable high-power continuous wave (CW) single-frequency (SF) Nd : YAlO3/lithium triborate (Nd:YAP/LBO) laser with dual-wavelength output, which is implemented by combining an optimized and locked etalon with an intracavity nonlinear loss. The obtained output powers of the stable SF 1080 and 540 nm lasers are 2.39 and 4.18 W, respectively. After the etalon is locked to an oscilating mode of the laser, the wideband continuous frequency tuning and long-term stable single-longitudinal-mode operation of the laser are successfully realized, which can be well used for the applications of quantum information and quantum computation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first realization of the continuously tunable high-power CW SF 1080/540 nm dual-wavelength laser.

TI Raman Sideband Cooling of Molecules in an Optical Tweezer Array to the
   3D Motional Ground State
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW X
AB Ultracold polar molecules are promising for quantum information processing and searches for physics beyond the standard model. Laser cooling to ultracold temperatures is an established technique for trapped diatomic and triatomic molecules. Further cooling of the molecules to near the motional ground state is crucial for reducing various dephasings in quantum and precision applications. In this work, we demonstrate Raman sideband cooling (RSC) of CaF molecules in optical tweezers to near their motional ground state, with average motional occupation quantum numbers of n<overline>x = 0.16(12), n<overline>y = 0.17(17) (radial directions), and n<overline>z = 0.22(16) (axial direction), and a 3-D motional-ground-state probability of 54 +/- 18% of the molecules that survive the RSC. This process paves the way to increase molecular coherence times in optical tweezers for robust quantum computation and simulation applications.

TI Diabetic Retinopathy Detection Using Classical-Quantum Transfer Learning
   Approach and Probability Model
SO CMC-COMPUTERS MATERIALS & CONTINUA
AB Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) is a common complication of diabetes mellitus that causes lesions on the retina that affect vision. Late detection of DR can lead to irreversible blindness. The manual diagnosis process of DR retina fundus images by ophthalmologists is time consuming and costly. While, Classical Transfer learning models are extensively used for computer aided detection of DR; however, their maintenance costs limits detection performance rate. Therefore, Quantum Transfer learning is a better option to address this problem in an optimized manner. The significance of Hybrid quantum transfer learning approach includes that it performs heuristically. Thus, our proposed methodology aims to detect DR using a hybrid quantum transfer learning approach. To build our model we extract the APTOS 2019 Blindness Detection dataset from Kaggle and used inception-V3 pre-trained classical neural network for feature extraction and Variational Quantum classifier for stratification and trained our model on Penny Lane default device, IBM Qiskit BasicAer device and Google Cirq Simulator device. Both models are built based on PyTorch machine learning library. We bring about a contrast performance rate between classical and quantum models. Our proposed model achieves an accuracy of 93%-96% on the quantum hybrid model and 85% accuracy rate on the classical model. So, quantum computing can harness quantum machine learning to do work with power and efficiency that is not possible for classical computers.

TI Manipulating phonons of a trapped-ion system using optical tweezers
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We propose an experimental architecture where an array of optical tweezers affords site-dependent control over the confining potential of a conventional radio-frequency ion trap. The site-dependent control enables programmable manipulation of phonon modes of ions, with many potential applications in quantum information processing (QIP) and thermodynamics. We describe protocols for programming the array of optical tweezers to attain a set of target phonon modes with high accuracy. We propose applications of such controls in simulating quantum thermodynamics of a particle of programmable effective mass via Jarzynski's equality and improving the efficiency of sympathetic cooling and quantum logic gates in a multispecies ion system of disparate masses. We discuss the required optical parameters in a realistic ion trap system and potential adverse effects of optical tweezers in QIP. Our scheme extends the utility of trapped ions as a platform for quantum computation and simulation.

TI Intracellular Quantum Sensing of Free-Radical Generation Induced by
   Acetaminophen (APAP) in the Cytosol, in Mitochondria and the Nucleus of
   Macrophages
SO ACS SENSORS
AB Acetaminophen overdoses cause cell injury in the liver. It is widely accepted that liver toxicity is initiated by the reactive N-acetyl-para-aminophenol (APAP) metabolite N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine (NAPQI), which first depletes glutathione and then irreversibly binds to mitochondrial proteins and nuclear DNA. As a consequence, mitochondrial respiration is inhibited, and DNA strands break. NAPQI also promotes the oxidative stress since glutathione is one of the main free-radical scavengers in the cell. However, so far it is unknown where exactly free radicals are generated. In this study, we used relaxometry, a novel technique that allows nanoscale magnetic resonance imaging detection of free radicals. The method is based on fluorescent nanodiamonds, which change their optical properties based on their magnetic surrounding. To achieve subcellular resolution, these nanodiamonds were targeted to cellular locations, that is, the cytoplasm, mitochondria, and the nucleus. Since relaxometry is sensitive to spin noise from radicals, we were able to measure the radical load in these different organelles. For the first time, we measured APAP-induced free-radical production in an organelle-specific manner, which helps predict and better understand cellular toxicity.

AB The ability to generate quantum emitters with reproducible properties in solid-state matrices is crucial for quantum technologies. Here, we show that a high density of close-to-identical single-photon emitters can be created in commercial hexagonal boron nitride using annealing under oxygen atmosphere. This simple procedure yields a uniform in-plane distribution of color centers consistently emitting around 539.4 nm, with a wavelength spread smaller than 1 nm. We present an extensive characterization of their photophysical properties, showing that the emitters are bright and stable, and exhibit narrow lines at low temperatures with minimal spectral diffusion. These characteristics make this family of quantum emitters highly appealing for applications to quantum information science.

TI Microwave-dependent quantum transport characteristics in near

AB Defects in semiconductors, traditionally seen as detrimental to electronic device performance, have emerged as potential assets in quantum technologies due to their unique quantum properties. This paper investigates the microwave-induced current and the interaction between defects and quantum electron transport in GaN/AlGaN field-effect transistors near the pinch-off state and discusses the observed Fano resonances at low temperatures. We observe the resonance spectra and their dependence on gate voltage and magnetic fields. To explain the observed behavior, we construct the possible scenario as a Fano interferometer with finite width. Our findings reveal the potential of semiconductor defects to contribute to the development of quantum information processing, providing their role to key components in next-generation quantum devices.

TI Noise-aware entanglement generation protocols for superconducting qubits
   with impedance-matched FBAR transducers
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Connecting superconducting quantum processors to telecommunications-wavelength quantum networks is critically necessary to enable distributed quantum computing, secure communications, and other applications. Optically-mediated entanglement heralding protocols offer a near-term solution that can succeed with imperfect components, including sub-unity efficiency microwave-optical quantum transducers. The viability and performance of these protocols relies heavily on the properties of the transducers used: the conversion efficiency, resonator lifetimes, and added noise in the transducer directly influence the achievable entanglement generation rate and fidelity of an entanglement generation protocol. Here, we use an extended Butterworth-van Dyke (BVD) model to optimize the conversion efficiency and added noise of a Thin film bulk acoustic resonator (FBAR) piezo-optomechanical transducer. We use the outputs from this model to calculate the fidelity of one-photon and two-photon entanglement heralding protocols in a variety of operating regimes. For transducers with matching circuits designed to either minimize the added noise or maximize conversion efficiency, we theoretically estimate that entanglement generation rates of greater than 160kHz can be achieved at moderate pump powers with fidelities of >90%. This is the first time a BVD equivalent circuit model is used to both optimize the performance of an FBAR transducer and to directly inform the design and implementation of an entanglement generation protocol. These results can be applied in the near term to realize quantum networks of superconducting qubits with realistic experimental parameters.

TI Quantum 1/ fη noise induced relaxation in the spin-boson model
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB We extend the spin-boson model of open quantum systems to the regime of quantum 1/f eta noise characterized by negative exponents of its spectral distribution. Using the numerically exact time-evolving matrix product operator, we find the dynamic regime diagram, including pseudocoherent dynamics controlled by quantum 1/f eta noise. We determine the dephasing rate and find for it an empirical formula valid at zero temperature. The bath reorganization energy depends on the infrared bath cutoff frequency, revealing an increased sensitivity of the dephasing on the measurement time of an experiment. Our results apply to a qubit as an elementary building block of a quantum computer and pave the way toward a quantum treatment of low-frequency noise in more complex architectures.

TI Quantum distance to uncontrollability and quantum speed limits
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Distance to uncontrollability is a crucial concept in classical control theory. Here, we introduce quantum distance to uncontrollability as a measure of how close a universal quantum system is to a nonuniversal one. This allows us to provide a quantitative version of the quantum speed limit, decomposing the bound into geometric and dynamical components. We consider several physical examples including globally controlled solid state qubits, scrambling of quantum information, and a cross-Kerr system, showing that the quantum distance to uncontrollability provides a precise meaning to spectral crowding, weak interactions, and other bottlenecks to universality. We suggest that this measure should be taken into consideration in the design of quantum technology.

SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB We investigate the magnetic field dependent photophysics of individual nitrogen-vacancy (NV) color centers in diamond under cryogenic conditions. At distinct magnetic fields, we observe significant reductions in the NV photoluminescence rate, which indicate a marked decrease in the optical readout efficiency of the NV???s ground state spin. We assign these dips to excited state level anticrossings, which occur at magnetic fields that strongly depend on the effective, local strain environment of the NV center. Our results offer new insights into the structure of the NVs??? excited states and a new tool for their effective characterization. Using this tool, we observe strong indications for strain-dependent variations of the NV???s orbital g factor, obtain new insights into NV charge state dynamics, and draw important conclusions regarding the applicability of NV centers for low-temperature quantum sensing.

Given an arbitrary function of quantum measurements, how to obtain its optimal value is often considered as a basic yet important problem in various applications. Typical examples include but are not limited to optimizing the likelihood functions in quantum measurement tomography, searching the Bell parameters in Bell-test experiments, and calculating the capacities of quantum channels. In this work, we propose reliable algorithms for optimizing arbitrary functions over the space of quantum measurements by combining the so-called Gilbert's algorithm for convex optimization with certain gradient algorithms. With extensive applications, we demonstrate the efficacy of our algorithms with both convex and nonconvex functions.

Here we show that adaptive methods based on classical machine learning algorithms can be used to enhance the precision of quantum phase estimation when noisy non-entangled qubits are used as sensors. We employ the Differential Evolution (DE) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithms to this task and we identify the optimal feedback policies which minimize the Holevo variance. We benchmark these schemes with respect to scenarios that include Gaussian and Random Telegraph fluctuations as well as reduced Ramsey-fringe visibility due to decoherence. We discuss their robustness against noise in connection with real experimental setups such as Mach-Zehnder interferometry with optical photons and Ramsey interferometry in trapped ions, superconducting qubits and nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond.

TI A Graphical #SAT Algorithm for Formulae with Small Clause Density
SO ELECTRONIC PROCEEDINGS IN THEORETICAL COMPUTER SCIENCE
CT 21st International Conference on Quantum Physics and Logic (QPL)
CY JUL 15-19, 2024
CL Buenos Aires, ARGENTINA
AB We study the counting version of the Boolean satisfiability problem #SAT using the ZH-calculus, a graphical language originally introduced to reason about quantum circuits. Using this, we generalize #SAT to a weighted variant we call #SAT +/-, which is complete for the class GapP. We show there is an efficient linear-time reduction from #SAT to #2SAT +/-, unlike previous reductions from #SAT to #2SAT which blow up the size of the formula by a polynomial factor. Our main conceptual contribution is that introducing weights to #SAT allows for more efficient translations, and we use this to remove the dependence on clause width k in this case. We observe that DPLL-style algorithms for #2SAT can be adapted to #2SAT +/- directly and hence the best-known upper bounds for #2SAT apply. Applying an upper bound for #2SAT in terms of variables gives us upper bounds for #SAT in terms of clauses and variables that are better than O* (2(n) ) for small clause densities of m/n < 2 . 25, and improve on previous average-case and worst-case bounds fork k >= 6 and k >= 4, respectively. Applying a similar bound in terms of clauses produces a bound of O* ( 1 . 1740 (L) ) in terms of the length of the formula. These are, to our knowledge, the first non-trivial upper bounds for #SAT that is independent of clause size, and in terms of formula length, respectively. Based on a result of Kutzkov, we find an improved bound on #3SAT for 1.2577 < m/n <= 7/3 . Finally, we use this technique to find an upper bound on the complexity of calculating amplitudes of quantum circuits in terms of the total number of gates. Our results demonstrate that graphical reasoning can lead to new algorithmic insights, even outside the domain of quantum computing that the calculus was intended for.

TI Multiobjective variational quantum optimization for constrained
   problems: an application to cash handling
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Combinatorial optimization problems are ubiquitous in industry. In addition to finding a solution with minimum cost, problems of high relevance involve a number of constraints that the solution must satisfy. Variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) have emerged as promising candidates for solving these problems in the noisy intermediate-scale quantum stage. However, the constraints are often complex enough to make their efficient mapping to quantum hardware difficult or even infeasible. An alternative standard approach is to transform the optimization problem to include these constraints as penalty terms, but this method involves additional hyperparameters and does not ensure that the constraints are satisfied due to the existence of local minima. In this paper, we introduce a new method for solving combinatorial optimization problems with challenging constraints using VQAs. We propose the multi-objective variational constrained optimizer (MOVCO) to classically update the variational parameters by a multiobjective optimization performed by a genetic algorithm. This optimization allows the algorithm to progressively sample only states within the in-constraints space, while optimizing the energy of these states. We test our proposal on a real-world problem with great relevance in finance: the cash handling problem. We introduce a novel mathematical formulation for this problem, and compare the performance of MOVCO versus a penalty based optimization. Our empirical results show a significant improvement in terms of the cost of the achieved solutions, but especially in the avoidance of local minima that do not satisfy any of the mandatory constraints.

TI Connectivity for quantum graphs
SO LINEAR ALGEBRA AND ITS APPLICATIONS
AB In Quantum Information Theory there is a construction for quantum channels, appropriately called a quantum graph, that generalizes the confusability graph construction for classical channels in classical information theory. In this paper a definition of connectedness for quantum graphs is provided, which generalizes the classical definition. It is shown that several examples of well-known quantum graphs (quantum Hamming cubes and quantum expanders) are connected. A quantum version of a particular case of the classical tree-packing theorem from Graph Theory is also proved. Generalizations for the related notions of k-connectedness and of orthogonal representation are also proposed for quantum graphs, and it is shown that orthogonal representations have the same implications for connectedness as they do in the classical case.

TI Opportunities for the direct manipulation of a phase-driven Andreev spin
   qubit
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB In a Josephson junction, the transfer of Cooper pairs from one superconductor to the other one can be associated with the formation of Andreev bound states. In a Josephson junction made with a semiconducting nanowire, the spin degeneracy of these Andreev states can be broken thanks to the presence of spin-orbit coupling and a finite phase difference between the two superconducting electrodes. The lifting of the spin degeneracy opened the way to the realization of Andreev spin qubits that do not require the application of a large magnetic field. So far the operation of these qubits relied on a Raman process involving two microwave tones and a third Andreev state [M. Hays et al., Science 373, 430 (2021)]. Still, time-reversal preserving impurities in the nanowire allow for spin-flip scattering processes. Here, using the formalism of scattering matrices, we show that these processes generically couple Andreev states with opposite spins. In particular, the nonvanishing current matrix element between them allows for the direct manipulation of phase-driven Andreev spin qubits, thereby circumventing the use of the above-mentioned Raman process.

TI Surface Code Compilation via Edge-Disjoint Paths
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB We provide an efficient algorithm to compile quantum circuits for fault-tolerant execution. We target surface codes, which form a two-dimensional grid of logical qubits with nearest-neighbor logical operations. Embedding an input circuit's qubits in surface codes can result in long-range two-qubit operations across the grid. We show how to prepare many long-range Bell pairs on qubits connected by edge-disjoint paths of ancillae in constant depth that can be used to perform these long-range operations. This forms one core part of our edge-disjoint path compilation (EDPC) algorithm, by easily performing many parallel long-range Clifford operations in constant depth. It also allows us to establish a connection between surface code compilation and several well-studied edge-disjoint path problems. Similar techniques allow us to perform non-Clifford single-qubit rotations far from magic state distillation factories. In this case, we can easily find the maximum set of paths by a max-flow reduction, which forms the other major part of EDPC. EDPC has the best asymptotic worst-case performance guarantees on the circuit depth for compiling parallel operations when compared to related compilation methods based on SWAP gates and network coding. EDPC also shows a quadratic depth improvement over sequential Pauli-based compilation for parallel rotations requiring magic resources. We implement EDPC and find significantly improved performance for circuits built from parallel controlled-NOT (CNOT) gates, and for circuits that implement the multicontrolled X gate (CNOT)-N-k.

TI Targeted Clifford Logical Gates for Hypergraph Product Codes
SO QUANTUM
AB Starting with an explicit framework for designing logical Clifford circuits for CSS codes, we construct logical gates for Hypergraph Product Codes. We first derive symplectic matrices for CNOT, CZ, Phase, and Hadamard operators, which together generate the Clifford group. This enables us to design explicit transformations that result in targeted logical gates for arbitrary codes in this family. As a concrete example, we give logical circuits for the [[18, 2, 3]] toric code.

TI Single-photon detection enabled by negative differential conductivity in
   moiré superlattices
SO SCIENCE
AB Detecting individual light quanta is essential for quantum information, space exploration, advanced machine vision, and fundamental science. In this work, we introduce a single-photon detection mechanism using highly photosensitive nonequilibrium electron phases in moir & eacute; materials. Using tunable bands in bilayer graphene/hexagonal boron nitride superlattices, we engineer negative differential conductance and a sensitive bistable state capable of detecting single photons. Operating in this regime, we demonstrate single-photon counting at mid-infrared (11.3 micrometers) and visible wavelengths (675 nanometers) and temperatures up to 25 kelvin. This detector offers prospects for broadband, high-temperature quantum technologies with complementary metal-oxide semiconductor compatibility and seamless integration into photonic-integrated circuits. Our analysis suggests that the underlying mechanism originates from superlattice-induced negative differential velocity.

TI Optimal bright multimode quantum squeezing via multi-seeding
   energy-level cascaded four-wave mixing
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Quantum Squeezing is one of the most important quantum resources in quantum optics and quantum information. In particular, multimode quantum squeezing, with ultra-low quantum fluctuations and quantum correlations amongst many optical modes, is essential for realizing multipartite entanglement and quantum precision measurements. In this paper, we propose an all-optically controlled scheme to generate three-mode bright quantum correlated beams from energy-level cascaded four-wave mixing (ELC-FWM). By using a linear modes transform approach, the input-output relation and the covariance matrix of the produced states are obtained. Moreover, single-, double- and triple-seeding conditions are investigated to measure the quantum squeezing properties. We find that various permutations of two- and three-mode quadrature squeezing can be generated and optimized to reach the corresponding limit, via only modulating the ratio of the multiple seeds, without need of any post-operating linear optics, e.g., beam splitters. Such weak seeding light controlled scheme suggests the modulation and the optimization of multimode quantum states might be operated at photons-level, providing a reconfigurable and integrated strategy tbr complex quantum information processing and quantum metrology.

TI Generation of entanglement between a highly wave-packet-tunable photon
   and a spin-wave memory in cold atoms
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Controls of waveforms (pulse durations) of single photons are important tasks for effectively interconnecting disparate atomic memories in hybrid quantum networks. So far, the waveform control of a single photon that is entangled with an atomic memory remains unexplored. Here, we demonstrated control of waveform length of the photon that is entangled with an atomic spin-wave memory by varying light-atom interaction time in cold atoms. The Bell parameter S as a function of the duration of photon pulse is measured, which shows that violations of Bell inequality can be achieved for the photon pulse in the duration range from 40 ns to 50 mu s, where, S = 2.64 +/- 0.02 and S = 2.26 +/- 0.05 for the 40-ns and 50-mu s durations, respectively. The measured results show that S parameter decreases with the increase in the pulse duration. We confirm that the increase in photon noise probability per pulse with the pulse-duration is responsible for the S decrease.

TI Control of Correlation Using Confinement in Case of Quantum System
SO ANNALEN DER PHYSIK
AB This article investigates the behavior of a Moshinsky atom in a 1D harmonic trap. Focus is given on the theoretical foundations of confinement and its impact on the correlation between particles in the Moshinsky atom. The investigation begins by illustrating the (de)localization of the probability density function using Shannon entropy. The basics of correlation and interpretation of correlation using tools such as mutual information and statistical correlation coefficients and how these can be quantified are discussed. Then the concept of confinement is explored. The impact of interaction strength and confinement on Shannon entropy, statistical correlation coefficients, and mutual information is investigated. How interaction strength and confinement can be used to induce correlations between previously uncorrelated particles, as well as how they can be used to suppress correlations between previously correlated particles is discussed. Their implications for quantum information processing and quantum simulation are discussed. In conclusion, confinement is a powerful tool for controlling correlations in quantum systems, and its impact on correlation can be understood through theoretical models. The importance of experimental studies in this field, which provide insights into the behavior of quantum systems under confinement and pave the way for future applications in quantum technology is also emphasized.
   The effect of spatial confinement on correlation, Shannon entropy, and mutual information on two interacting particles is studied in detail. Upon imposing confinement on the system, these measures for all states demonstrate a dependence on both inter-particle interaction strength & lambda; and confining length L. In the case of strong spatial confinement, & lambda; hardly plays any role.image

TI Numerical security proof for the decoy-state BB84 protocol and
   measurement-device-independent quantum key distribution resistant
   against large basis misalignment
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB In this work, we incorporate decoy-state analysis into a well-established numerical framework for key rate calculation, and we apply the numerical framework to decoy-state BB84 and measurement-device-independent (MDI) QKD protocols as examples. Additionally, we combine with these decoy-state protocols what is called "fine-grained statistics," which is a variation of existing QKD protocols that makes use of originally discarded data to get a better key rate. We show that such variations can grant protocols resilience against any unknown and slowly changing rotation along one axis, similar to reference-frame-independent QKD, but without the need for encoding physically in an additional rotation-invariant basis. Such an analysis can easily be applied to existing systems, or even data already recorded in previous experiments, to gain a significantly higher key rate when considerable misalignment is present, extending the maximum distance for BB84 and MDI-QKD and reducing the need for manual alignment in an experiment.

TI Microwave signal processing using an analog quantum reservoir computer
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Quantum reservoir computing (QRC) has been proposed as a paradigm for performing machine learning with quantum processors where the training takes place in the classical domain, avoiding the issue of barren plateaus in parameterized-circuit quantum neural networks. It is natural to consider using a quantum processor based on microwave superconducting circuits to classify microwave signals that are analog-continuous in time. However, while there have been theoretical proposals of analog QRC, to date QRC has been implemented using the circuit model-imposing a discretization of the incoming signal in time. In this paper we show how a quantum superconducting circuit comprising an oscillator coupled to a qubit can be used as an analog quantum reservoir for a variety of classification tasks, achieving high accuracy on all of them. Our work demonstrates processing of ultra-low-power microwave signals within our superconducting circuit, a step towards achieving a quantum sensing-computational advantage on impinging microwave signals.

TI Universal quantum operations and ancilla-based read-out for tweezer
   clocks
SO NATURE
AB Enhancing the precision of measurements by harnessing entanglement is a long-sought goal in quantum metrology1,2. Yet attaining the best sensitivity allowed by quantum theory in the presence of noise is an outstanding challenge, requiring optimal probe-state generation and read-out strategies3-7. Neutral-atom optical clocks8, which are the leading systems for measuring time, have shown recent progress in terms of entanglement generation9-11 but at present lack the control capabilities for realizing such schemes. Here we show universal quantum operations and ancilla-based read-out for ultranarrow optical transitions of neutral atoms. Our demonstration in a tweezer clock platform9,12-16 enables a circuit-based approach to quantum metrology with neutral-atom optical clocks. To this end, we demonstrate two-qubit entangling gates with 99.62(3)% fidelity-averaged over symmetric input states-through Rydberg interactions15,17,18 and dynamical connectivity19 for optical clock qubits, which we combine with local addressing16 to implement universally programmable quantum circuits. Using this approach, we generate a near-optimal entangled probe state1,4, a cascade of Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger states of different sizes, and perform a dual-quadrature5 Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger read-out. We also show repeated fast phase detection with non-destructive conditional reset of clock qubits and minimal dead time between repetitions by implementing ancilla-based quantum logic spectroscopy20 for neutral atoms. Finally, we extend this to multi-qubit parity checks and measurement-based, heralded, Bell-state preparation21-24. Our work lays the foundation for hybrid processor-clock devices with neutral atoms and more generally points to a future of practical applications for quantum processors linked with quantum sensors25.
   We demonstrate high-fidelity entangling gates, universal quantum operations, and ancilla-based read-out for ultranarrow optical transitions of neutral atoms in a tweezer clock platform.

TI Natural gradient and parameter estimation for quantum Boltzmann machines
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Thermal states play a fundamental role in various areas of physics, and they are becoming increasingly important in quantum information science, with applications related to semidefinite programming, quantum Boltzmann machine learning, Hamiltonian learning, and the related task of estimating the parameters of a Hamiltonian. Here we establish formulas underlying the basic geometry of parameterized thermal states, and we delineate quantum algorithms for estimating the values of these formulas. More specifically, we establish formulas for the Fisher-Bures and Kubo-Mori information matrices of parameterized thermal states, and our quantum algorithms for estimating their matrix elements involve a combination of classical sampling, Hamiltonian simulation, and the Hadamard test. These results have applications in developing a natural gradient descent algorithm for quantum Boltzmann machine learning, which takes into account the geometry of thermal states, and in establishing fundamental limitations on the ability to estimate the parameters of a Hamiltonian, when given access to thermal-state samples. For the latter task, and for the special case of estimating a single parameter, we sketch an algorithm that realizes a measurement that is asymptotically optimal for the estimation task. We finally stress that the natural gradient descent algorithm developed here can be used for any machine learning problem that employs the quantum Boltzmann machine ansatz.

TI Nanoscale manipulation of polarization singularities enabled by photonic
   spin Hall effects in asymmetric focused fields
SO CHINESE OPTICS LETTERS
AB Polarization singularities, defined as spatial points with indeterminate polarization states, exhibit rich configurations and parameter tunability in vectoral light fields, making them promising candidates for innovative optical technologies. However, precise control of polarization singularities in tightly focused fields remains a significant challenge. Here, we investigated the nanoscale manipulation of polarization singularities through off-axis focusing of cylindrical vector beams. By demonstrating how symmetry breaking generates the photonic spin Hall effect and enables precise control of the singularities, we establish a new paradigm for optical singularity manipulation. The approach is analogous to the lever principle: nanoscale positioning precision of polarization singularities is achieved through macroscopic objective lens displacements (millimeter-scale), demonstrating leverage factors exceeding four orders of magnitude (104). The underlying mechanism for this macroscopic-to-nanoscale coupling is the photonic spin Hall effect. This paradigm effectively connects macroscopic actuation with nanoscale control, potentially enabling advances in quantum memory, nano-metrology, and singular optics.

TI Feasibility study on ground-state cooling and single-phonon readout of
   trapped electrons using hybrid quantum systems
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Qubits of long coherence time and fast quantum operations are long-sought objectives toward the realization of high-fidelity quantum operations and their applications to quantum technologies. An electron levitated in a vacuum by a Paul trap is expected to be a good candidate, for its light mass and hence the high secular frequency which allows for faster gate operations than those in trapped ions. Controlling the motional state of the trapped electron is a crucial issue, for it mediates an interaction between electron spins, intrinsic qubits embedded in electrons, and its decoherence results in degraded fidelity of two-qubit gates. In addition, an efficient readout of the motional state is important, regarding the possibility of detecting spin state by using it. Despite such importance, how to achieve the motional ground state and how to efficiently detect it are not reported so far. Here we propose methods addressing these issues by utilizing hybrid quantum systems involving an electron-superconducting circuit and electron-ion coupled systems and analyze the feasibility of our schemes. In both systems, we show that ground-state cooling and single-phonon readout of the motional state of the trapped electron are possible. Our work sheds light on a way to precisely control the motional states of the trapped electrons, that provides an interesting playground for the development of quantum technologies.

TI Stability and molecular pathways to the formation of spin defects in
   silicon carbide
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Spin defects in wide-bandgap semiconductors provide a promising platform to create qubits for quantum technologies. Their synthesis, however, presents considerable challenges, and the mechanisms responsible for their generation or annihilation are poorly understood. Here, we elucidate spin defect formation processes in a binary crystal for a key qubit candidate-the divacancy complex (VV) in silicon carbide (SiC). Using atomistic models, enhanced sampling simulations, and density functional theory calculations, we find that VV formation is a thermally activated process that competes with the conversion of silicon (V-Si) to carbon monovacancies (V-C), and that VV reorientation can occur without dissociation. We also find that increasing the concentration of V-Si relative to V-C favors the formation of divacancies. Moreover, we identify pathways to create spin defects consisting of antisite-double vacancy complexes and determine their electronic properties. The detailed view of the mechanisms that underpin the formation and dynamics of spin defects presented here may facilitate the realization of qubits in an industrially relevant material.
   Understanding the mechanism of formation of solid-state spin defects underpins their future applications in quantum technologies. Here, the authors use a combination of ab initio molecular dynamics, enhanced sampling, and density functional theory to clarify the formation process of spin defects in silicon carbide.

TI Hybrid quantum neural network structures for image multi-classification
SO PHYSICA SCRIPTA
AB Image classification is a fundamental problem in computer vision, and neural networks provide an effective solution. With the advancement of quantum technology, quantum neural networks have attracted a lot of attention. However, they are only suitable for low-dimensional data and require dimensionality reduction and quantum encoding. Two image classification methods have recently emerged: one employs PCA for dimensionality reduction and angular encoding, and the other integrates QNN into a CNN to improve performance. Despite numerous algorithms, the differences between them remain unclear. This study explores these algorithms' performance in multi-class image classification and proposes an optimized hybrid quantum neural network suitable for the current environment. As the number of classes increases, research on PCA-based quantum algorithms reveals the barren plateau problem of QNN, which is not suitable for multiple classes in a hybrid setting. Our proposed model combining traditional CNN with QNN addresses QNN's multi-class training difficulties to some extent and achieves satisfactory classification results. Nevertheless, its accuracy remains below that of the top-performing CNN models. Furthermore, we investigate transfer learning in hybrid quantum neural network models and assess the performance of our models on the quantum hardware from IBM. In conclusion, quantum neural networks show promise but require further research and optimization, facing challenges ahead.

TI One-Shot Manipulation of Dynamical Quantum Resources
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB We develop a unified framework to characterize one-shot transformations of dynamical quantum resources in terms of resource quantifiers, establishing universal conditions for exact and approximate transformations in general resource theories. Our framework encompasses all dynamical resources represented as quantum channels, including those with a specific structure-such as boxes, assemblages, and measurements-thus immediately applying in a vast range of physical settings. For the particularly important manipulation tasks of distillation and dilution, we show that our conditions become necessary and sufficient for broad classes of important theories, enabling an exact characterization of these tasks and establishing a precise connection between operational problems and resource monotones based on entropic divergences. We exemplify our results by considering explicit applications to quantum communication, where we obtain exact expressions for one-shot quantum capacity and simulation cost assisted by no-signaling, separability-preserving, and positive partial transpose-preserving codes; as well as to non-locality, contextuality, and measurement incompatibility, where we present operational applications of a number of relevant resource measures.

TI Symmetric distinguishability as a quantum resource
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB We develop a resource theory of symmetric distinguishability, the fundamental objects of which are elementary quantum information sources, i.e. sources that emit one of two possible quantum states with given prior probabilities. Such a source can be represented by a classical-quantum state of a composite system XA, corresponding to an ensemble of two quantum states, with X being classical and A being quantum. We study the resource theory for two different classes of free operations: (i) CPTP A , which consists of quantum channels acting only on A, and (ii) conditional doubly stochastic maps acting on XA. We introduce the notion of symmetric distinguishability of an elementary source and prove that it is a monotone under both these classes of free operations. We study the tasks of distillation and dilution of symmetric distinguishability, both in the one-shot and asymptotic regimes. We prove that in the asymptotic regime, the optimal rate of converting one elementary source to another is equal to the ratio of their quantum Chernoff divergences, under both these classes of free operations. This imparts a new operational interpretation to the quantum Chernoff divergence. We also obtain interesting operational interpretations of the Thompson metric, in the context of the dilution of symmetric distinguishability.

TI Real-space entanglement of quantum fields
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
AB We introduce a new method permitting the analytical determination of entanglement entropy (and related quantities) between configurations of a quantum field, which is either free or in interaction with a classical source, at two distinct spatial locations. We show how such a setup can be described by a bipartite, continuous Gaussian system. This allows us to derive explicit and exact formulas for the entanglement entropy, the mutual information and the quantum discord, solely in terms of the Fourier-space power spectra of the field. This contrasts with previous studies, which mostly rely on numerical considerations. As an illustration, we apply our formalism to massless fields in flat space, where exact expressions are derived that only involve the ratio between the size of the regions over which the field is coarse-grained, and the distance between these regions. In particular, we recover the well-known fact that mutual information decays as the fourth power of this ratio at large distances, as previously observed in numerical works. Our method leads to the first analytical derivation of this result, and to an exact formula that also applies to arbitrary distances. Finally, we determine the quantum discord and find that it identically vanishes (unless coarse-graining is performed over smeared spheres, in which case it obeys the same suppression at large distance as mutual information).

AB Open-shell molecular radicaloids could constitute the key to molecular quantum information and quantum sensing technologies. The effect of their morphology on the quantum properties is anyway unknown, hampering the development of synthetic strategies. Herein, we establish the links between morphology and quantum properties, using three related radicaloids based on meta-quinodimethane. We unravel the roles of the pi-conjugated backbone and those of the side groups on the spin-flip and quantum coherence times. The temperature regions are identified where different structural parts of the molecule or solvent become the dominant decoherence channel. The record quantum coherence values obtained at room temperature are still well below the intrinsic limits of radicaloids, and we discuss the directions to optimize the quantum performance.

TI Implementing Magnetic Resonance Imaging Brain Disorder Classification
   via AlexNet-Quantum Learning
SO MATHEMATICS
AB The classical neural network has provided remarkable results to diagnose neurological disorders against neuroimaging data. However, in terms of efficient and accurate classification, some standpoints need to be improved by utilizing high-speed computing tools. By integrating quantum computing phenomena with deep neural network approaches, this study proposes an AlexNet-quantum transfer learning method to diagnose neurodegenerative diseases using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) dataset. The hybrid model is constructed by extracting an informative feature vector from high-dimensional data using a classical pre-trained AlexNet model and further feeding this network to a quantum variational circuit (QVC). Quantum circuit leverages quantum computing phenomena, quantum bits, and different quantum gates such as Hadamard and CNOT gate for transformation. The classical pre-trained model extracts the 4096 features from the MRI dataset by using AlexNet architecture and gives this vector as input to the quantum circuit. QVC generates a 4-dimensional vector and to transform this vector into a 2-dimensional vector, a fully connected layer is connected at the end to perform the binary classification task for a brain disorder. Furthermore, the classical-quantum model employs the quantum depth of six layers on pennyLane quantum simulators, presenting the classification accuracy of 97% for Parkinson's disease (PD) and 96% for Alzheimer's disease (AD) for 25 epochs. Besides this, pre-trained classical neural models are implemented for the classification of disorder and then, we compare the performance of the classical transfer learning model and hybrid classical-quantum transfer learning model. This comparison shows that the AlexNet-quantum learning model achieves beneficial results for classifying PD and AD. So, this work leverages the high-speed computational power using deep network learning and quantum circuit learning to offer insight into the practical application of quantum computers that speed up the performance of the model on real-world data in the healthcare domain.

TI Probing hole spin transport of disorder quantum dots via Pauli
   spin-blockade in standard silicon transistors
SO NANOTECHNOLOGY
AB Single hole transport and spin detection is achievable in standard p-type silicon transistors owing to the strong orbital quantization of disorder based quantum dots. Through the use of the well acting as a pseudo-gate, we discover the formation of a double-quantum dot system exhibiting Pauli spin-blockade and investigate the magnetic field dependence of the leakage current. This enables attributes that are key to hole spin state control to be determined, where we calculate a tunnel coupling t(c) of 57 mu eV and a short spin-orbit length l(SO) of 250 nm. The demonstrated strong spin-orbit interaction at the interface when using disorder based quantum dots supports electric-field mediated control. These results provide further motivation that a readily scalable platform such as industry standard silicon technology can be used to investigate interactions which are useful for quantum information processing.

TI A Multiparty Quantum Private Equality Comparison Scheme Relying on
   |GHZ3⟩ States
SO FUTURE INTERNET
AB In this work, we present a new protocol that accomplishes multiparty quantum private comparison leveraging maximally entangled |GHZ(3)> triplets. Our intention was to develop a protocol that can be readily executed by contemporary quantum computers. This is possible because the protocol uses only |GHZ(3)> triplets, irrespective of the number n of millionaires. Although it is feasible to prepare multiparticle entangled states of high complexity, this is overly demanding on a contemporary quantum apparatus, especially in situations involving multiple entities. By relying exclusively on |GHZ(3)> states, we avoid these drawbacks and take a decisive step toward the practical implementation of the protocol. An important quantitative characteristic of the protocol is that the required quantum resources are linear both in the number of millionaires and the amount of information to be compared. Additionally, our protocol is suitable for both parallel and sequential execution. Ideally, its execution is envisioned to take place in parallel. Nonetheless, it is also possible to be implemented sequentially if the quantum resources are insufficient. Notably, our protocol involves two third parties, as opposed to a single third party in the majority of similar protocols. Trent, commonly featured in previous multiparty protocols, is now accompanied by Sophia. This dual setup allows for the simultaneous processing of all n millionaires' fortunes. The new protocol does not rely on a quantum signature scheme or pre-shared keys, reducing complexity and cost. Implementation wise, uniformity is ensured as all millionaires use similar private circuits composed of Hadamard and CNOT gates. Lastly, the protocol is information-theoretically secure, preventing outside parties from learning about fortunes or inside players from knowing each other's secret numbers.

TI Low-Loss 795 nm Electro-Optic Modulators
SO PHOTONICS
AB Electro-optic modulators in the near-infrared spectrum are finding applications in atomic clocks, quantum sensing, quantum information processing, and high-precision measurement. We developed thin-film lithium niobate electro-optic modulators operating at 795 nm for modulation around the D-1 line of Rb-87 with satisfactory overall performance. Specifically, we made a systematic improvement to reduce the insertion loss, including widening the modulation waveguides, thickening the overcladding, polishing and coating the facets. The fabricated device possesses a low insertion loss of 7.6 dB, an extinction ratio exceeding 30 dB, a 3 dB modulation bandwidth of similar to 22 GHz, a half-wave voltage-length product of similar to 1.8 Vcm, and strong adaptability for packaging.

TI Distribution of entanglement with variable range interactions
SO PHYSICS LETTERS A
AB Distribution of quantum entanglement is investigated for an anisotropic quantum XY model with variable range interactions and in the presence of a uniform transverse magnetic field. We report the possibility of qualitative growth in entanglement between distant sites with an increase in the range of interactions that vary either exponentially or polynomially as the distance between the sites increases. Interestingly, we find that such entanglement enhancement is not ubiquitous and is dependent on the factorization points, a specific set of system parameters where the zero-temperature state of the system is fully separable. In particular, we observe that at zero-temperature, when the system parameters are chosen beyond the pair of factorization points, the increments in entanglement length due to variable range interactions are more pronounced compared to the situation when the parameters lie in between the factorization points. By employing the sum of all the bipartite entanglements with respect to a single site, we also show that the shareability of the bipartite entanglements is constrained, thereby establishing their monogamous nature. Furthermore, we note that the factorization points get reallocated depending on the laws of interaction fall-offs and provide an ansatz for the same. We reveal that the temperature at which the canonical equilibrium state becomes entangled from an unentangled one increases with the increase in the range of interactions, thereby demonstrating enhanced robustness in entanglement against temperature in the presence of long-range interactions and only when the system parameters are chosen between the pair of factorization points. We apply an energy-based entanglement witness to provide a justification to the observed robustness with temperature. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Approximating exponentials of commutators by optimized product formulas
SO QUANTUM INFORMATION PROCESSING
AB Trotter product formulas constitute a cornerstone quantum Hamiltonian simulation technique. However, the efficient implementation of Hamiltonian evolution of nested commutators remains an under explored area. In this work, we construct optimized product formulas of orders 3-6 approximating the exponential of a commutator of two arbitrary operators in terms of the exponentials of the operators involved. The new schemes require a reduced number of exponentials and thus provide more efficient approximations than other previously published alternatives. They can also be used as basic methods in recursive procedures to increase the order of approximation. We expect this research will improve the efficiency of quantum control protocols, as well as quantum algorithms such as the Zassenhaus-based product formula, Magnus operator-based time-dependent simulation, and product formula schemes with modified potentials.

TI Quantum fluctuations drive nonmonotonic correlations in a qubit lattice
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Fluctuations may induce the degradation of order by overcoming ordering interactions, consequently leading to an increase of entropy. This is particularly evident in magnetic systems characterized by nontrivial, constrained disorder, where thermal or quantum fluctuations can yield counterintuitive forms of ordering. Using the proven efficiency of quantum annealers as programmable spin system simulators, we present a study based on entropy postulates and experiments on a platform of programmable superconducting qubits to show that a low level of uncertainty can promote ordering in a system impacted by both thermal and quantum fluctuations. A set of experiments is proposed on a lattice of interacting qubits arranged in a triangular geometry with precisely controlled disorder, effective temperature, and quantum fluctuations. Our results demonstrate the creation of ordered ferrimagnetic and layered anisotropic disordered phases, displaying characteristics akin to the elegant order-by-disorder phenomenon. Extensive experimental evidence is provided for the role of quantum fluctuations in lowering the total energy of the system by increasing entropy and defect clustering. Our thorough and comprehensive application of an intentionally introduced noise on a quantum platform provides insight into the dynamics of defects and fluctuations in quantum devices, which may help to reduce the cost associated with quantum processing.
   Thermal fluctuations can induce ordering in frustrated magnetic systems, yet the impact of quantum fluctuations is less explored. Here, in the controlled environment of a quantum annealer composed of superconducting qubits, the authors study a frustrated magnetic system finding that quantum fluctuations enhance magnetic correlations.

TI Properties of transient spectrum and field purity for a qubit system in
   squeezed states
SO RESULTS IN PHYSICS
AB The present study investigates the transient spectrum (TS) of a two-level system that interacts with a generalized squeezed state without using the rotating wave approximation (RWA). We consider the purity of the optical field, which is developed in a generalized squeezed state, utilizing the linear entropy. The analytic expressions of the TS and field purity (FP) of the bipartite system are evaluated. Moreover, the study exhibits the influence of the squeezed parameter and some photons transition on the TS and FP. We obtain that the control of the FP may be generated based on an adequate choice of the photons transition and squeezed parameter. Such results can be utilized in the understanding and development of various tasks of quantum physics and optics.

TI Experimental Bayesian Calibration of Trapped-Ion Entangling Operations
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB The performance of quantum gate operations is experimentally determined by how correctly operational parameters can be determined and set, and how stable these parameters can be maintained. In addition, gates acting on different sets of qubits require unique sets of control parameters. Thus, an efficient multidimensional parameter estimation procedure is crucial to calibrate even medium-sized quantum processors. Here, we develop and characterize an efficient calibration protocol to automatically estimate and adjust experimental parameters of the widely used two-qubit Molmer-Sorensen entangling gate operation in a trapped-ion quantum information processor. The protocol exploits Bayesian parameter estimation methods that include a stopping criterion based on a desired gate infidelity. We experimentally demonstrate a tune-up procedure that leads to a residual median gate infidelity due to miscalibration of 1.3(1) x 10(-3), requiring 1200 +/- 500 experimental cycles, while completing the entire gate calibration procedure in less than one minute, which provides a significant speedup over commonly used manual tune-up routines. This approach is applicable to other quantum information processor architectures with known or sufficiently characterized theoretical models.

TI Toward Programmable Quantum Processors Based on Spin Qubits with
   Mechanically Mediated Interactions and Transport
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Solid-state spin qubits are promising candidates for quantum information processing, but controlled interactions and entanglement in large, multiqubit systems are currently difficult to achieve. We describe a method for programmable control of multiqubit spin systems, in which individual nitrogen -vacancy (NV) centers in diamond nanopillars are coupled to magnetically functionalized silicon nitride mechanical resonators in a scanning probe configuration. Qubits can be entangled via interactions with nanomechanical resonators while programmable connectivity is realized via mechanical transport of qubits in nanopillars. To demonstrate the feasibility of this approach, we characterize both the mechanical properties and the magnetic field gradients around the micromagnet placed on the nanobeam resonator. We demonstrate coherent manipulation of a spin qubit in the proximity of a transported micromagnet by utilizing nuclear spin memory and use the NV center to detect the time -varying magnetic field from the oscillating micromagnet, extracting a spin -mechanical coupling of 7.7(9) Hz. With realistic improvements, the high-cooperativity regime can be reached, offering a new avenue toward scalable quantum information processing with spin qubits.

TI Hardness of measuring magic resource
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Quantum computers promise to solve computational problems significantly faster than classical computers. These "speedups" are achieved by utilizing a resource known as magic resource. Measuring the amount of magic resource used by a device allows us to quantify its potential computational power. Without this property, quantum computers are no faster than classical computers. Whether magic resource can be accurately measured on large-scale quantum computers has remained an open problem. To address this question, we introduce Pauli instability as a measure of magic resource and experimentally measure it on the IBM Eagle quantum processor. We show that sufficiently small quantities of magic resource can be measured efficiently. We also prove that measuring large (i.e., extensive) quantities of magic resource with our measure is intractable. Our results lead us to surmise that magic resource may be difficult to measure when a quantum computer provides a speedup. We find that one of the most sought-after properties in quantum computation is only partially accessible to experiments. We support our conclusions with both theoretical and experimental evidence. Our work illustrates the capabilities and limitations encountered when studying the power of quantum computers.

TI Domain-Separated Quantum Neural Network for Truss Structural Analysis
   with Mechanics-Informed Constraints
SO BIOMIMETICS
AB This study proposes an index-based quantum neural network (QNN) model, built upon a variational quantum circuit (VQC), as a surrogate framework for the static analysis of truss structures. Unlike coordinate-based models, the proposed QNN uses discrete member and node indices as inputs, and it adopts a separate-domain strategy that partitions the structure for parallel training. This architecture reflects the way nature organizes and optimizes complex systems, thereby enhancing both flexibility and scalability. Independent quantum circuits are assigned to each separate domain, and a mechanics-informed loss function based on the force method is formulated within a Lagrangian dual framework to embed physical constraints directly into the training process. As a result, the model achieves high prediction accuracy and fast convergence, even under complex structural conditions with relatively few parameters. Numerical experiments on 2D and 3D truss structures show that the QNN reduces the number of parameters by up to 64% compared to conventional neural networks, while achieving higher accuracy. Even within the same QNN architecture, the separate-domain approach outperforms the single-domain model with a 6.25% reduction in parameters. The proposed index-based QNN model has demonstrated practical applicability for structural analysis and shows strong potential as a quantum-based numerical analysis tool for future applications in building structure optimization and broader engineering domains.

TI Quantum routing of information using chiral quantum walks
SO AVS QUANTUM SCIENCE
AB We address routing of classical and quantum information over quantum network and show how to exploit chirality (directionality) to achieve nearly optimal and robust transport. In particular, we prove how continuous-time chiral quantum walks over a minimal graph are able to model directional transfer of information over a network. At first, we show how classical information, encoded onto an excitation localized at one vertex of a simple graph, may be sent to any other chosen location with nearly unit fidelity by tuning a single phase. Then, we prove that high-fidelity transport is also possible for coherent superpositions of states, i.e., for routing of quantum information. Furthermore, we show that by tuning the phase parameter, one obtains universal quantum routing, i.e., independent on the input state. In our scheme, chirality is governed by a single phase, and the routing probability is robust against fluctuations of this parameter. Finally, we address characterization of quantum routers and show how to exploit the self-energies of the graph to achieve high precision in estimating the phase parameter.

TI Stark tuning and charge state control in individual telecom C-band
   quantum dots
SO APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS
AB Telecom wavelength quantum dots (QDs) are emerging as a promising solution for generating deterministic single-photons compatible with existing fiber-optic infrastructure. Emission in the low-loss C-band minimizes transmission losses, making them ideal for long-distance quantum communication. In this work, we present a demonstration of both Stark tuning and charge state control of individual InAs/InP QDs operating within the telecom C-band. These QDs are grown by droplet epitaxy and embedded in an InP-based n(++)-i- n(+) heterostructure, fabricated using MOVPE. The gated architecture enables the tuning of emission energy via the quantum-confined Stark effect, with a tuning range exceeding 2.4 nm. It also allows for control over the QD charge occupancy, enabling access to multiple discrete excitonic states. Electrical tuning of the fine-structure splitting is further demonstrated, opening a route to entangled-photon-pair generation at telecom wavelengths. The single-photon character is confirmed via second-order correlation measurements. These advances enable QDs to be tuned into resonance with other systems, such as cavity modes and emitters, marking a critical step toward scalable, fiber-compatible quantum photonic devices.

TI Gravitational waves from burdened primordial black holes dark matter
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
AB Primordial black holes (PBHs) are the natural candidate of dark matter (DM) as they only interact gravitationally and can evade any experiments on earth. In the standard semiclassical calculation of Hawking radiation, PBHs with mass below 1015 g evaporated by now and therefore cannot be DM. However, the recently discovered quantum memory burden effect can significantly suppress the evaporation of PBHs after the half-decay time. This quantum effect could open up a new mass window below 1010 g where PBHs can still exist today and be DM. In this paper, we compute the gravitational wave (GW) signals associated with the formation of PBHs in this new mass window. We consider two formation scenarios: PBHs formed from inflationary perturbation and PBHs formed from collapse of Fermi-balls in a first-order phase transition (FOPT). GWs produced from these two scenarios have distinct features and, while the GW from inflation peaks at high frequency, the GW from FOPT peaks at lower frequency that can be within the reach of future experiments.

TI Spatial coherent manipulation of Bessel-like vector vortex beam in
   atomic vapor
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB The interaction between vector beams and atoms under a weak magnetic field could induce spatially dependent electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT). Based on such a coherence effect, we propose a method for manipulating vector beams carrying spiral varying phases in hot rubidium atoms. When a transverse magnetic field (TMF) is applied, the transparent regions of the transmitted beam are strongly depend on the beam's polarization distribution. In addition to the intensity modulation, the alignment of the TMF is reflected in the rotation of the central symmetric transmission patterns. In theory, we discuss the physical mechanism of the spiral EIT region generated by the phase profile, and analyze the influence of system parameters on this coherent process. Our work confirms that introducing additional radial phases can also lead to spatially dependent EIT, which extends another degree of freedom to manipulate atomic polarization. This will provide potential applications in light field manipulation and multi-dimensional quantum storage.

TI Azimuthal phase-dependent electromagnetically induced transparency and
   the generation of spatial light in a microwave-assisted four-level
   Y-type system
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS B-ATOMIC MOLECULAR AND OPTICAL PHYSICS
AB We present an azimuthal phase-dependent scheme to study the spatially dependent electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) and the generation of spatial light in a closed-loop four-level Y-type system. A structured control beam and a microwave (MW) field are adopted in the closed-loop structure. Interestingly, the weak non-vortex probe beam responses explicitly depend on the orbital angular momentum (OAM) of the control beam along with the MW-assisted quantum interference. The regions of spatially dependent EIT are demonstrated at different azimuthal angles. It is found that the intensity of the structured control beam and the relative phase arising out of the beams participating in the closed-loop can be used as the controlling knobs to tailor the shape and the angular location of the spatially dependent EIT.

TI General Conditions for Universality of Quantum Hamiltonians
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Recent work has demonstrated the existence of universal Hamiltonians-simple spin-lattice models that can simulate any other quantum many-body system to any desired level of accuracy. Until now, proofs of universality have relied on explicit constructions, tailored to each specific family of universal Hamiltonians. In this work, we go beyond this approach and completely classify the simulation ability of quantum Hamiltonians by their complexity classes. We do this by deriving necessary and sufficient complexity-theoretic conditions characterizing universal quantum Hamiltonians. Although the result concerns the theory of analog Hamiltonian simulation-a promising application of near-term quantum technology-the proof relies on abstract complexity-theoretic concepts and the theory of quantum computation. As well as providing simplified proofs of previous Hamiltonian universality results and offering a route to new universal constructions, the results in this paper give insight into the origins of universality; for example, finally explaining the previously noted coincidences between families of universal Hamiltonian and classes of Hamiltonians appearing in complexity theory.

TI A 360° Continuous Tuning Voltage-Controlled Phase Shifter for Laser
   Frequency Locking Systems in Optical Frequency Standards
SO PHOTONICS
AB This paper presents a voltage-controlled phase shifter (VCPS) capable of 360 degrees continuous adjustment, applied in laser frequency-locking systems to obtain maximum amplitude error signals with minimal dispersion. The phase-shifting unit is realized through CMOS integrated circuit design, utilizing comparators, logic gate control modules, and filters. Simulations verify the VCPS, composed of three cascaded units, achieves 360 degrees continuous phase adjustment. A printed circuit board (PCB) was fabricated with the integration of electronic components. The test results demonstrate that the VCPS exhibits a continuous 360 degrees phase shift in one direction with increasing control voltage. It operates from kHz to 50 MHz and maintains a peak-to-peak output amplitude of 5 V or 10 V. The proposed VCPS has been successfully applied in cold-atom interferometry, quantum memory experiments, and optical frequency standards.

TI Self-Correction from Higher-Form Symmetry Protection on a Boundary
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Recent work has shown that a self-correcting quantum memory can exist in three spatial dimensions, provided that it is protected by a 1-form symmetry. Requiring that the dynamics of a system obey this type of symmetry is equivalent to enforcing a macroscopic number of symmetry terms throughout the bulk. In this paper, we show how to replace the explicit 1-form symmetry with an emergent 1-form symmetry in the bulk and an explicit 1-form symmetry on the boundary. To do so, we use the extended excitations of a three-dimensional (3D) toric code to confine anyons in a two-dimensional (2D) toric code on the boundary. The boundary anyons are bound to the bulk excitations by the explicit 1-form symmetry. Although the symmetry still has to be explicitly enforced on the boundary, this could conceivably be a more attainable constraint due to the accessibility of the boundary qubits. Furthermore, this only requires O(L2) terms for a system of linear size L, instead of O(L3) terms.

TI Direct-Write Printing of Josephson Junctions in a Scanning Electron
   Microscope
SO ACS NANO
AB Josephson junctions are the building blocks of superconducting electronics, with well-established applications in precision metrology and quantum computing. Fabricating a Josephson junction has been a resource-intensive and multistep procedure, involving lithography and wet-processing, which are not compatible with many applications. Here, we introduce a fully additive direct-write approach, where a scanning electron microscope can print substrate-conformal Josephson devices in a matter of minutes, requiring no additional processing. The junctions are made entirely by electron-beam-induced deposition (EBID) of tungsten carbide. We utilize EBID-tunable material properties to write, in one go, full proximity junctions with superconducting electrodes and metallic weak links and tailor their Josephson coupling. The Josephson behavior of these junctions is established and characterized by their microwave-induced Shapiro response and field-dependent transport. Our efforts provide a versatile and nondestructive alternative to conventional nanofabrication and can be expanded to print three-dimensional superconducting sensor arrays and quantum networks.

TI Quantifying necessary quantum resources for nonlocality
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Nonlocality is one of the most important resources for quantum information protocols. The observation of nonlocal correlations in a Bell experiment is the result of appropriately chosen measurements and quantum states. We quantify the minimal purity to achieve a certain Bell value for any Bell operator. Since purity is the most fundamental resource of a quantum state, this enables us also to quantify the necessary coherence, discord, and entanglement for a given violation of two-qubit correlation inequalities. Our results shine a light on the Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt inequality by showing that for a fixed Bell violation an increase in the measurement resources does not always lead to a decrease of the minimal state resources.

TI Persistent currents in ultracold gases
SO PHYSICS REPORTS-REVIEW SECTION OF PHYSICS LETTERS
AB Persistent currents flowing in spatially closed tracks define one of the most iconic concepts in mesoscopic physics. They have been studied in solid-state platforms such as superfluids, superconductors and metals. Cold atoms trapped in magneto-optical toroidal circuits and driven by suitable artificial gauge fields allow us to study persistent currents with unprecedented control and flexibility of the system's physical conditions. Here, we review persistent currents of ultracold matter. Capitalizing on the remarkable progress in driving different atomic species to quantum degeneracy, persistent currents of single or multicomponent bosons/fermions, and their mixtures can be addressed within the present experimental know-how. This way, fundamental concepts of quantum science and many-body physics, like macroscopic quantum coherence, solitons, vortex dynamics, fermionic pairing and BEC-BCS crossover can be studied from a novel perspective. Finally, we discuss how persistent currents can form the basis of new technological applications like matter-wave gyroscopes and interferometers.<br /> (c) 2025 The Authors.

TI Creating and controlling global Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger entanglement
   on quantum processors
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) states, also known as two-component Schr & ouml;dinger cats, play vital roles in the foundation of quantum physics and the potential quantum applications. Enlargement in size and coherent control of GHZ states are both crucial for harnessing entanglement in advanced computational tasks with practical advantages, which unfortunately pose tremendous challenges as GHZ states are vulnerable to noise. Here we propose a general strategy for creating, preserving, and manipulating large-scale GHZ entanglement, and demonstrate a series of experiments underlined by high-fidelity digital quantum circuits. For initialization, we employ a scalable protocol to create genuinely entangled GHZ states with up to 60 qubits, almost doubling the previous size record. For protection, we take a different perspective on discrete time crystals (DTCs), originally for exploring exotic nonequilibrium quantum matters, and embed a GHZ state into the eigenstates of a tailor-made cat scar DTC to extend its lifetime. For manipulation, we switch the DTC eigenstates with in-situ quantum gates to modify the effectiveness of the GHZ protection. Our findings establish a viable path towards coherent operations on large-scale entanglement, and further highlight superconducting processors as a promising platform to explore nonequilibrium quantum matters and emerging applications.
   The Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger states are multipartite entangled quantum states with strong non-local entanglement. Here the authors generate large-scale states of this type with up to 60 qubits and show that discrete time crystals can effectively protect such fragile states.

TI FPLA: A Flexible Physical Layer Authentication Mechanism for
   Distributing Quantum Keys Securely via Wireless 5G Channels
SO APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
AB Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) is popular for establishing a native secure quantum communication network. However, existing QKD networks are built via classical wired fiber channels; it is difficult to distribute quantum keys directly into mobile phones, and no effective candidate solution is available yet. This paper presents a novel Flexible Physical Layer Authentication (FPLA) mechanism that exploits the unique characteristic of wireless signals from mobile phones to securely distribute quantum keys via wireless 5G channels. In particular, a 5G Up-Link Sounding Reference Signal (SRS)-based transmission model is developed to capture and extract the unique characteristic, which is then used to distribute quantum keys. Moreover, the model could lose accuracy due to SRS variations introduced by 5G Multiuser Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MU-MIMO), so a dimensional transformation residual network is designed to classify legitimate and malicious user equipment (UE). An average authentication accuracy of 96.8% is proved by FPLA in multiple experiments in a 3 dB Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) test environment with a training dataset of 300 samples per malicious UE. Simulation results show that FPLA is able to adapt to antenna diversity in 5G MU-MIMO systems.

TI Soft syndrome iterative decoding of quantum LDPC codes and hardware
   architectures
SO EPJ QUANTUM TECHNOLOGY
AB In practical quantum error correction implementations, the measurement of syndrome information is an unreliable step-typically modeled as a binary measurement outcome flipped with some probability. However, the measured syndrome is in fact a discretized value of the continuous voltage or current values obtained in the physical implementation of the syndrome extraction. In this paper, we use this "soft" or analog information to benefit iterative decoders for decoding quantum low-density parity-check (QLDPC) codes. Syndrome-based iterative belief propagation decoders are modified to utilize the soft syndrome to correct both data and syndrome errors simultaneously. We demonstrate the advantages of the proposed scheme not only in terms of comparison of thresholds and logical error rates for quasi-cyclic lifted-product QLDPC code families but also with faster convergence of iterative decoders. Additionally, we derive hardware (FPGA) architectures of these soft syndrome decoders and obtain similar performance in terms of error correction to the ideal models even with reduced precision in the soft information. The total latency of the hardware architectures is about 600 ns (for the QLDPC codes considered) in a 20 nm CMOS process FPGA device, and the area overhead is almost constant-less than 50% compared to min-sum decoders with noisy syndromes.

TI Telecom-Band Quantum Dots Compatible with Silicon Photonics for Photonic
   Quantum Applications
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB Silicon photonics is promising for quantum photonics applications owing to its large-scale and high-performance circuitry enabled by complementary-metal-oxide-semiconductor fabrication processes. However, there is a lack of bright single-photon sources (SPSs) capable of deterministic operation on Si platforms, which largely limits their applications. To this end, on-Si integration of high-performance solid-state quantum emitters, such as semiconductor quantum dots (QDs), is greatly desired. In particular, it is preferable to integrate SPSs emitting at telecom wavelengths for fully leveraging the power of silicon photonics, including efficient chip-to-fiber coupling. In this review, recent progress and challenges in the integration of telecom QD SPSs onto silicon photonic platforms are discussed.

TI Universal Approach for Quantum Interfaces with Atomic Arrays
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB We develop a general framework for the analysis of two-sided quantum interfaces, composed of collections of atoms interacting with paraxial light. Accounting for photon-mediated dipole-dipole interactions, our approach is based on the mapping of collective atom-photon interfaces onto a generic one-dimensional model of light scattering, characterized by a reflectivity parameter r0. This entails two key practical advantages: (i) the efficiency of the quantum interface in performing various quantum tasks, such as quantum memory or entanglement generation, is universally given by r0 and is hence reduced to a measurement or classical calculation of a reflectivity; (ii) the efficiency can be greatly enhanced by a properly designed photon mode that spatially matches a collective-dipole eigenmode of the atoms. We demonstrate our approach for realistic cases of finite-size atomic arrays, partially filled arrays, and circular arrays. This provides a unified approach for treating collective light-matter coupling in various platforms, such as optical lattices and optical tweezers.

TI CAN'T TOUCH THIS: UNCONDITIONAL TAMPER EVIDENCE FROM SHORT KEYS
SO QUANTUM INFORMATION & COMPUTATION
AB Storing data on an external server with information-theoretic security, while using a key shorter than the data itself, is impossible. As an alternative, we propose a scheme that achieves information-theoretically secure tamper evidence: The server is able to obtain information about the stored data, but not while staying undetected. Moreover, the client only needs to remember a key whose length is much shorter than the data.
   We provide a security proof for our scheme, based on an entropic uncertainty relation, similar to QKD proofs. Our scheme works if Alice is able to (reversibly) randomise the message to almost-uniformity with only a short key. By constructing an explicit attack we show that short-key unconditional tamper evidence cannot be achieved without this randomisability.

AB The current widely used public-key cryptosystems are vulnerable to quantum attacks. To prepare for cybersecurity in the quantum era, some projects have been launched to call for post-quantum alternatives. Due to solid security and desirable performance, lattice-based cryptosystems are viewed as promising candidates in the upcoming standardisation of post-quantum cryptography. This study surveys the lattice-based cryptosystems in the post-quantum standardisation processes including the NIST Post-Quantum Cryptography Standardisation and the Chinese Cryptographic Algorithm Design Competition, from both design and security aspects. We present generic design paradigms of lattice-based schemes and describe several representative proposals and recent progress. We also recap some main cryptanalytic results and methods for estimating the concrete security of lattice-based schemes.

TI Discrete frequency-bin entanglement generation via cascaded second-order
   nonlinear processes in Sagnac interferometer
SO OPTICS LETTERS
AB Discrete frequency-bin entanglement is an essential resource for applications in quantum information processing. In this Letter, we propose and demonstrate a scheme to generate discrete frequency-bin entanglement with a single piece of periodically poled lithium niobate waveguide in a modi-fied Sagnac interferometer. Correlated two-photon states in both directions of the Sagnac interferometer are generated through cascaded second-order optical nonlinear processes. A relative phase difference between the two states is intro-duced by changing the polarization state of pump light, thus manipulating the two-photon state at the output of the Sagnac interferometer. The generated two-photon state is sent into a fiber polarization splitter, and then a pure discrete frequency-bin entangled two-photon state is obtained by set-ting the pump light. The frequency entanglement property is measured by a spatial quantum beating with a visibility of 96.0 +/- 6.1%. The density matrix is further obtained with a fidelity of 98.0 +/- 3.0% to the ideal state. Our demonstra-tion provides a promising method for the generation of pure discrete frequency-bin entanglement at the telecom band, which is desired in quantum photonics.

TI Optical Implementation of 2 x 2 Universal Unitary Matrix Transformations
SO LASER & PHOTONICS REVIEWS
AB Unitary operations are a specific class of linear transformations that have become an essential ingredient for the realization of classical and quantum information processing. The ability of implementing any n-dimensional unitary signal transformation by using a reconfigurable optical hardware has recently led to the pioneering concept of programmable linear optical processor, whose basic building block (BB) must be correctly designed to guarantee that the whole system is able to perform nxn universal (i.e., arbitrary) unitary matrix transformations. Here, it is demonstrated that the present architectures of the BB do not fulfil the universal unitary property (at least) in 2x2 optical processors, limiting the number of unitary matrix transformations that may be generated. Aiming to solve this fundamental constraint, the theoretical tools required to analyze and design 2x2 universal unitary optical circuits and their corresponding BBs are presented. The consequences of this mathematical framework are explored, obtaining a simple route to implement different BB architectures, all of them guaranteeing a true universal unitary functionality in the resulting 2x2 optical processors. These findings may pave the way to revisit the design of high-dimensional unitary optical processors, unleashing the potential of programmable integrated photonics technology.

This is the case of asynchronous diffraction between spatial modes with different modal orders, which experience variations in their transverse structure upon free-space propagation. Here we address this issue by proposing an encoding method based on the use of Laguerre-Gaussian modes of the same modal order N to define a N + 1 dimensional space. Noteworthy, such modes endowed with orbital angular momentum (OAM) experience the same propagation aberrations featuring an identical Gouy phase and wavefront curvature. We demonstrate our proposal experimentally by using time-correlated-single-photon imaging combined with a digital propagation technique. Importantly, our technique allows to eliminate, without the use of imaging systems, all issues related to asynchronous diffraction, providing an accessible way to generate propagation-invariant OAM qudits for quantum optical protocols.

TI Exploiting fermion number in factorized decompositions of the electronic
   structure Hamiltonian
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Achieving an accurate description of fermionic systems typically requires considerably many more orbitals than fermions. Previous resource analyses of quantum chemistry simulation often failed to exploit this low fermionic number information in the implementation of Trotter-based approaches and overestimated the quantum-computer runtime as a result. They also depended on numerical procedures that are computationally too expensive to scale up to large systems of practical interest. Here we propose techniques that solve both problems by using various factorized decompositions of the electronic structure Hamiltonian. We showcase our techniques for the uniform electron gas, finding substantial (over 100 x ) improvements in Trotter error for low-filling fraction and pushing to much higher numbers of orbitals than is possible with existing methods. Finally, we calculate the T-count to perform phase estimation on Jellium. In the low-filling regime, we observe improvements in gate complexity of over 10x compared to the best Trotter-based approach reported to date. We also report gate counts competitive with qubitization-based approaches for Wigner-Seitz values of physical interest.

TI The Variational Quantum Eigensolver: A review of methods and best
   practices
SO PHYSICS REPORTS-REVIEW SECTION OF PHYSICS LETTERS
AB The variational quantum eigensolver (or VQE), first developed by Peruzzo et al. (2014), has received significant attention from the research community in recent years. It uses the variational principle to compute the ground state energy of a Hamiltonian, a problem that is central to quantum chemistry and condensed matter physics. Conventional computing methods are constrained in their accuracy due to the computational limits facing exact modeling of the exponentially growing electronic wavefunction for these many-electron systems. The VQE may be used to model these complex wavefunctions in polynomial time, making it one of the most promising near-term applications for quantum computing. One important advantage is that variational algorithms have been shown to present some degree of resilience to the noise in the quantum hardware. Finding a path to navigate the relevant literature has rapidly become an overwhelming task, with many methods promising to improve different parts of the algorithm, but without clear descriptions of how the diverse parts fit together. The potential practical advantages of the algorithm are also widely discussed in the literature, but with varying conclusions. Despite strong theoretical underpinnings suggesting excellent scaling of individual VQE components, studies have pointed out that their various pre-factors could be too large to reach a quantum computing advantage over conventional methods. This review aims at disentangling the relevant literature to provide a comprehensive overview of the progress that has been made on the different parts of the algorithm, and to discuss future areas of research that are fundamental for the VQE to deliver on its promises. All the different components of the algorithm are reviewed in detail. These include the representation of Hamiltonians and wavefunctions on a quantum computer, the optimization process to find ground state energies, the post processing mitigation of quantum errors, and suggested best practices. We identify four main areas of future research: (1) optimal measurement schemes for reduction of circuit repetitions required; (2) large scale parallelization across many quantum computers; (3) ways to overcome the potential appearance of vanishing gradients in the optimization process for large systems, and how the number of iterations required for the optimization scales with system size; (4) the extent to which VQE suffers for quantum noise, and whether this noise can be mitigated in a tractable manner. The answers to these open research questions will determine the routes for the VQE to achieve quantum advantage as the quantum computing hardware scales up and as the noise levels are reduced.

TI Broadband electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy of 167Er:7LiYF4
   at millikelvin temperatures
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB Rare-earth spin ensembles are a promising platform for microwave quantum memory applications due to their hyperfine transitions, which can exhibit exceptionally long coherence times when using an operation point with zero first-order Zeeman (ZEFOZ) shift. In this work, we use broadband electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy on 167Er:7LiYF4 single crystals at subkelvin temperatures. By fitting the spin Hamiltonian to the zero-field spectrum, we obtain refined parameters of the magnetic field-independent interactions, such as the hyperfine and quadrupole interaction. We also study the influence of the quadrupole interaction on the hyperfine splitting in the zero and low magnetic field range by analyzing EPR spectra between 0 mT and 50 mT. Our findings highlight the broadband EPR spectroscopy approach as a powerful tool for the precise determination of the spin Hamiltonian parameters and for the characterization of hyperfine transitions in terms of their selection rules and linewidth.

TI Excitation of exchange spin waves in a magnetic insulator thin film at
   cryogenic temperatures
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS D-APPLIED PHYSICS
AB Spin waves and their quanta, magnons, are promising candidates for next-generation electronic devices, due to their low-power consumption and compatibility with radio-frequency-based electronic devices. For achieving magnon-based hybrid quantum systems for quantum memory and computation, the investigation of spin-wave propagation at cryogenic temperatures is highly required. In this article, we report the excitation and detection of exchange spin waves with wavelengths of tens of nanometers in an yttrium iron garnet (YIG) thin film at cryogenic temperatures. We find that the exchange spin waves are unidirectional in all temperature ranges, owing to the chiral dynamical dipolar coupling between the spin-wave mode in the YIG and the ferromagnetic resonance mode in the cobalt nanowire. Notably, a high exchange spin-wave group velocity of 2 km s-1 at 10 K is observed. Our results are promising for the development of high-speed and energy-efficient quantum magnonic devices operating at cryogenic temperatures.

TI Measurement-based preparation of multimode mechanical states
SO SCIENCE ADVANCES
AB Nanomechanical resonators are a key tool for future quantum technologies, such as quantum force sensors and interfaces, and for studies of macroscopic quantum physics. The ability to prepare room temperature nonclassical states is a major outstanding challenge. It has been suggested that this could be achieved using a fast continuous measurement to break the usual symmetry between position and momentum. Here, we demonstrate this symmetry breaking and use it to prepare a thermally squeezed mechanical state. Our experiments take advantage of collective measurements on multiple mechanical modes, which we show can increase the measurement speed and improve state preparation. Theoretically, we show that this result extends to the quantum regime, relaxing the requirements to generate nonclassical states. We predict that multimode conditioning can enable room temperature quantum squeezing with existing technology. Our work paves the way toward room temperature quantum nanomechanical devices and toward their application in quantum technology and fundamental science.

TI Influence of Co Layer Thickness on the Superconducting Properties of
   Nanolayered Nb/Pt/Co Heterostructures: Implications for Ultrafast
   Sensors, Spin Valves, and Quantum Circuits
SO ACS APPLIED NANO MATERIALS
AB The ability to control and manipulate the vortex state in type-II superconductors (SC) is important for applications of superconducting devices. Planar SC/ferromagnetic (FM) bilayers are alternative systems where this manipulation can be done. In this work, we studied the influence of thin FM Co layers on the SC Nb state in sputtered Nb(20 nm)/Pt(4 nm)/Co(t(Co) = 0-20 nm)/Pt(4 nm) nanohybrids. Oscillations in critical superconducting temperature T-C and critical current density J(C) with changing of t(Co) values were observed, and their occurrences were confirmed by replicated samples. The T-C oscillations do not decay in amplitude with the increase of FM thickness, differently to what has been observed in Nb/FM nanohybrids and Nb/Pt systems. These findings suggest that the Nb superconducting properties (T-C and J(C)) are strongly dependent on two main contributions: the proximity effect and the morphology of the FM Co layer that goes from small out-of-plane isolated magnetic domains nucleated in granular-like Co layer (t(Co) approximate to 1 nm) to a continuous Co layer regime in thicker Co layers. Using our results and some data from the literature on magnetism of Pt/Co, a high density (low density) of smaller (larger) magnetic domains formed for 2 nm <= t(Co) <= 8 nm (t(Co) > 8 nm) is assumed to be responsible for the vortex pinning centers at the Nb films; i.e., the size and density of Co magnetic domain structures determine the pinning centers that influence the SC properties of Nb(20 nm)/Pt(4 nm)/Co nanohybrids.

TI Self-referenced hologram of a single photon beam
SO QUANTUM
AB Quantitative characterization of the spatial structure of single photons is essential for free-space quantum communication and quantum imaging. We introduce an interferometric technique that enables the complete characterization of a two-dimensional probability amplitude of a single photon. Importantly, in contrast to methods that use a reference photon for the phase measurement, our technique relies on a single photon interfering with itself. Our setup comprises of a heralded single-photon source with an unknown spatial phase and a modified MachZehnder interferometer with a spatial filter in one of its arms. The spatial filter removes the unknown spatial phase and the filtered beam interferes with the unaltered beam passing through the other arm of the interferometer. We experimentally confirm the feasibility of our technique by reconstructing the spatial phase of heralded single photons using the lowest order interference fringes. This technique can be applied to the characterization of arbitrary pure spatial states of single photons.

TI Spacetime as a quantum circuit
SO JOURNAL OF HIGH ENERGY PHYSICS
AB We propose that finite cutoff regions of holographic spacetimes represent quantum circuits that map between boundary states at different times and Wilsonian cutoffs, and that the complexity of those quantum circuits is given by the gravitational action. The optimal circuit minimizes the gravitational action. This is a generalization of both the "complexity equals volume" conjecture to unoptimized circuits, and path integral optimization to finite cutoffs. Using tools from holographic T (T) over bar, we find that surfaces of constant scalar curvature play a special role in optimizing quantum circuits. We also find an interesting connection of our proposal to kinematic space, and discuss possible circuit representations and gate counting interpretations of the gravitational action.

TI Probing electron transport mechanisms in single-molecule transistors
SO DEVICE
AB Single-molecule transistors (SMTs) are quantum-confined systems where electron transport is dictated by discrete molecular orbitals, coulomb blockade, and many-body quantum correlations. Unlike conventional electronics, SMTs operate under a synergy of quantum interactions, enabling electrostatic tuning of molecular energy levels relative to electrode Fermi surfaces. This tunning can be used to control phenomena such as Kondo resonance, spin-selective tunneling, and orbital symmetry-driven quantum interference. Charging energy and confinement interplay generate gate-modulated coulomb diamonds, inelastic co-tunneling thresholds, and non-equilibrium quantum phase transitions, bridging molecular physics to correlated matter phenomena like non-Fermi liquids and quantum criticality. SMTs probe spin-charge decoupling, vibronic dynamics, and hybrid superconducting states, serving as platforms for quantum impurity models. Despite structural variability and de-coherence challenges, advances in break-junction techniques and graphene architectures enable scalable integration. By decoding quantum transport via ultrafast spectroscopy and multiscale modeling, SMTs redefine nanoelectronics, paving the way for ultra-low-power logic, quantum sensing, and topological computing.

TI Two-photon interference from silicon-vacancy centers in remote
   nanodiamonds
SO NANOPHOTONICS
AB The generation of indistinguishable photons is a key requirement for solid-state quantum emitters as a viable source for applications in quantum technologies. Restricting the dimensions of the solid-state host to a size well below the wavelength of light emitted by a defect-center enables efficient external optical coupling, for example, for hybrid integration into photonic devices. However, stringent restrictions on the host dimensions result in severe limitations on the spectral properties reducing the indistinguishability of emitted photons. Here, we demonstrate two-photon interference from two negatively charged silicon-vacancy centers located in remote nanodiamonds. The Hong-Ou-Mandel interference efficiency reaches 61 % with a coalescence time window of 0.35 ns. We furthermore show a high yield of pairs of silicon-vacancy centers with indistinguishable optical transitions. Therefore, our work opens new paths in hybrid quantum technology based on indistinguishable single-photon emitters in nanodiamonds.

TI Optimal binary gratings for multi-wavelength magneto-optical traps
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Grating magneto-optical traps are an enabling quantum technology for portable metrological devices with ultracold atoms. However, beam diffraction efficiency and angle are affected by wavelength, creating a single-optic design challenge for laser cooling in two stages at two distinct wavelengths - as commonly used for loading, e.g., Sr or Yb atoms into optical lattice or tweezer clocks. Here, we optically characterize a wide variety of binary gratings at different wavelengths to find a simple empirical fit to experimental grating diffraction efficiency data in terms of dimensionless etch depth and period for various duty cycles. The model avoids complex 3D light-grating surface calculations, yet still yields results accurate to a few percent across a broad range of parameters. Gratings optimized for two (or more) wavelengths can now be designed in an informed manner suitable for a wide class of atomic species enabling advanced quantum technologies.

TI Verifying single-mode nonclassicality beyond negativity in phase space
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB While negativity in phase space is a well-known signature of nonclassicality, a wide variety of nonclassical states require their characterization beyond negativity. We establish a framework of nonclassicality in phase space that addresses nonclassical states comprehensively with a direct experimental evidence. This includes the negativity of phase-space distribution as a special case and further analyzes quantum states with positive distributions effectively. We prove that it detects all nonclassical Gaussian states and all non-Gaussian states of arbitrary dimension remarkably by examining three phase-space points only. Our formalism also provides an experimentally accessible lower bound for a nonclassicality measure based on trace distance. Importantly, this foundational approach can be further adapted to constitute practical tests in two directions looking into particle and wave nature of bosonic systems, via an array of nonideal on-off detectors and coarse-grained homodyne measurement, respectively. All these tests are practically powerful in characterizing nonclasssical states reliably against noise, making a versatile tool for a broad range of quantum systems in quantum technologies.

TI Intense optics parametric amplification in dispersion-engineered
   nanophotonic lithium niobate waveguides
SO OPTICA
AB Strong amplification in integrated photonics is one of the most desired optical functionalities for computing, communications, sensing, and quantum information processing. Semiconductor gain and cubic nonlinearities, such as four-wave mixing and stimulated Raman and Brillouin scattering, have been among the most studied amplification mechanisms on chip. Alternatively, material platforms with strong quadratic nonlinearities promise numerous advantages with respect to gain and bandwidth, among which nanophotonic lithium niobate is one of the most promising candidates. Here, we combine quasi-phase matching with dispersion engineering in nanophotonic lithium niobate waveguides and achieve intense optical parametric amplification. We measure a broadband phase-sensitive on-chip amplification larger than 50 dB/cm in a 6-mm-long waveguide. We further confirm high gain operation in the degenerate and nondegenerate regimes by amplifying vacuum fluctuations to macroscopic levels, with on-chip gains exceeding 100 dB/cm over 600 nm of bandwidth around 2 mu m. Our results unlock new possibilities for on-chip few-cycle nonlinear optics, mid-infrared photonics, and quantum photonics.

TI Fast and robust detection of single Rydberg excitations in mesoscopic
   ensembles
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We propose a novel nondestructive method for the detection of single Rydberg excitations in a mesoscopic ensemble. The protocol achieves high fidelities on a microsecond timescale and is robust against changes in the probe laser frequency. The technique relies on optical pumping in Autler Townes configuration, whose efficiency is controlled by the presence or absence of a Rydberg excitation. Taking rubidium atoms as an example, we give realistic estimates for the achievable fidelities and parameters. However, our protocol can be transferred to any other atomic species that features multiple stable states. Our protocol is applicable in quantum simulation and quantum information processing with mesoscopic ensembles requiring fast and high-fidelity Rydberg state detection.

TI Efficient factored gradient descent algorithm for quantum state
   tomography
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Reconstructing the state of quantum many-body systems is of fundamental importance in quantum information tasks, but extremely challenging due to the curse of dimensionality. In this work, we present an efficient quantum tomography protocol that combines the state-factored with eigenvalue mapping to address the rank-deficient issue and incorporates a momentum-accelerated gradient descent algorithm to speed up the optimization process. We implement extensive numerical experiments to demonstrate that our factored gradient descent algorithm efficiently mitigates the rank-deficient problem and admits orders of magnitude better tomography accuracy and faster convergence. We also find that our method can accomplish the full-state tomography of random 11-qubit mixed states within one minute.

In this study, we investigated the required conditions to attain the single-electron regime in an Ultra-Thin Body and Buried oxide (UTBB) Fully Depleted Silicon-On-Insulator (FDSOI) quantum dot device fabricated using the standard manufacturing process of STMicroelectronics. The cryogenic temperature operation of the quantum dot device is simulated and analyzed using the 3D Quantum Technology Computer Aided Design (QTCAD) software developed by Nanoacademic Technologies, achieving convergence down to 1.4 K.

TI Deep Neural Network Assisted Quantum Chemistry Calculations on Quantum
   Computers
SO ACS OMEGA
AB The variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) is a widely employed method to solve electronic structure problems in the current noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices. However, due to inherent noise in the NISQ devices, VQE results on NISQ devices often deviate significantly from the results obtained on noiseless statevector simulators or traditional classical computers. The iterative nature of VQE further amplifies the errors in each loop. Recent works have explored ways to integrate deep neural networks (DNN) with VQE to mitigate iterative errors, albeit primarily limited to the noiseless statevector simulators. In this work, we trained DNN models across various quantum circuits and examined the potential of two DNN-VQE approaches, DNN1 and DNNF, for predicting the ground state energies of small molecules in the presence of device noise. We carefully examined the accuracy of the DNN1, DNNF, and VQE methods on both noisy simulators and real quantum devices by considering different ansatzes of varying qubit counts and circuit depths. Our results illustrate the advantages and limitations of both VQE and DNN-VQE approaches. Notably, both DNN1 and DNNF methods consistently outperform the standard VQE method in providing more accurate ground state energies in noisy environments. However, despite being more accurate than VQE, the energies predicted using these methods on real quantum hardware remain meaningful only at reasonable circuit depths (depth = 15, gates = 21). At higher depths (depth = 83, gates = 112), they deviate significantly from the exact results. Additionally, we find that DNNF does not offer any notable advantage over VQE in terms of speed. Consequently, our study recommends DNN1 as the preferred method for obtaining quick and accurate ground state energies of molecules on current quantum hardware, particularly for quantum circuits with lower depth and fewer qubits.

TI Losses in magnetic field resilient coplanar stripline resonators
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS D-APPLIED PHYSICS
AB Coplanar waveguide (CPW) resonators have shown considerable success in circuit quantum electrodynamics research. However, their susceptibility to an external magnetic field limits their general functionality. In addition, electrical voltage gating for devices coupled to a CPW resonator necessitates alterations to the ground plane, changing the resonator characteristics. To avoid these problems, we fabricated and measured quarter wavelength differentially driven coplanar stripline (CPS) resonators made of NbTiN. We measured multiple devices with varying geometrical parameters in these novel resonators and analyse changes in their internal quality factor and two-level system losses. Furthermore, we establish the resilience of the resonators to an applied magnetic field by tracking the resonance frequency shift, without optimisation of the resonator geometry. Due to their flexible design and high magnetic field resilience, CPS resonators are particularly well-suited to study superconductor-semiconductor heterophysics where voltage gating or a magnetic field are necessary.

TI Quantum transfer through small networks coupled to phonons: Effects of
   topology versus phonons
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW E
AB Particle or energy transfer through quantum networks is determined by network topology and couplings to environments. This study examines the combined effect of topology and external couplings on the efficiency of directional quantum transfer through quantum networks. We consider a microscopic model of qubit networks coupled to external vibrations by Holstein and Peierls couplings. By treating the positions of the network sites and the site-dependent phonon frequencies as independent variables, we determine the Hamiltonian parameters corresponding to minimum transfer time by Bayesian optimization. The results show that Holstein couplings may accelerate transfer through suboptimal network configurations but cannot accelerate quantum dynamics beyond the limit of the transfer time in an optimal phonon-free configuration. By contrast, Peierls couplings distort the optimal networks to accelerate quantum transfer through configurations with less than six sites. However, the speed-up offered by Peierls couplings decreases with the network size and disappears for networks with more than seven sites. For networks with seven sites or more, Peierls couplings distort the optimal network configurations and change the mechanism of quantum transfer but do not affect the lower limit of the transfer time. The machine-learning approach demonstrated here can be applied to determine quantum speed limits in other applications.

SO FRONTIERS IN NANOTECHNOLOGY
AB The defect centers in solid-state materials especially the nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond have shown a tremendous potential for their utilization in quantum technology applications. However, they exhibit certain drawbacks such as the feeble zero phonon line with huge phonon contribution and the higher lifetime values. Here, we present a novel approach to control the spontaneous emission from NV centers in nanodiamond using engineered self-assembled photonic crystals. Using two complimentary emission measuring geometries at room temperature, we show a 63% suppression and 17% enhancement of NV center emission intensity using photonic stopgap, supported with simulations. The emission rates are modified in a broad spectral range of NV center emission and are consistent with the Barnett-Loudon sum rule. The results are crucial for emerging quantum technologies using NV centers in diamond.

TI Susceptibility of trapped-ion qubits to low-dose radiation sources

We expose an ion-trap apparatus to a variety of alpha, beta, and gamma sources and measure the resulting changes in trapped-ion qubit lifetimes, coherence times, gate fidelities, and motional heating rates. We found no quantifiable degradation of ion trap performance in the presence of low-dose radiation sources for any of the measurements performed. This finding is encouraging for the long-term prospects of using ion-based quantum information systems in extreme environments, indicating that much larger doses may be required to induce errors in trapped-ion quantum processors.

TI Generalized quantum PageRank algorithm with arbitrary phase rotations
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB The quantization of the PageRank algorithm is a promising tool for a future quantum internet. Here we present a modification of the quantum PageRank, introducing arbitrary phase rotations (APR) in the underlying Szegedy's quantum walk. We define three different APR schemes with only one phase as a degree of freedom. We have analyzed the behavior of these algorithms in a small generic graph, observing that a decrease of the phase reduces the standard deviation of the instantaneous PageRank, so the nodes of the network can be distinguished better. However, the algorithm takes more time to converge, so the phase cannot be decreased arbitrarily. With these results we choose a concrete value for the phase to later apply the algorithm to complex scale-free graphs. In these networks, the original quantum PageRank is able to break the degeneracy of the residual nodes and detect secondary hubs that the classical algorithm suppresses. Nevertheless, not all of the detected secondary hubs are real according to the PageRank's definition. Some APR schemes can overcome this problem, restoring the degeneration of the residual nodes and highlighting the truly secondary hubs of the networks. Finally, we have studied the stability of the new algorithms. The original quantum algorithm was known to be more stable than the classical. We have found that one of our algorithms, whose PageRank distribution resembles the classical one, has a stability similar to the original quantum algorithm.

TI Quantum modulation of a coherent state with a single electron spin
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB The interaction of quantum objects lies at the heart of fundamental quantum physics and is key to a wide range of quantum information technologies. Photon-quantum-emitter interactions are among the most widely studied. Two-qubit interactions are generally simplified into two quantum objects in static well-defined states. In this work we explore a fundamentally new dynamic type of spin-photon interaction. We demonstrate the modulation of a coherent narrowband laser by a coherently evolving spin in the ground state of a quantum dot. What results is a quantum modulation of the output phase (either 0 or n but no values in between), and a new quantum state of light that cannot be described classically.

TI Enhanced magnon blockade in a magnomechanical system
SO PHYSICA SCRIPTA
AB Magnon blockade is one of the effective methods for realizing single magnon sources which have great potential application in quantum information processing and quantum computing. To enhance single-magnon blockade effect, we introduce a two-magnon driving to the magnomechanical system, which is used to form the multipath destructive interference. Our result shows that both the conventional magnon blockade (CMB) and unconventional magnon blockade (UMB) can be achieved due to nonlinear term of the magnon-mechanical oscillator and magnetic parametric amplification term(MPA) induced by two-magnon driving. By setting certain parameters of MPA, we combine the effect of CMB and UMB. As a result, the single-magnon blockade effect is enhanced, and the disadvantage of rapid oscillations of the time-delay second-order correlation function g (2)(tau) with UMB is overcome, which makes high time resolution not necessary in the detection of second-order correlation function.

TI Transport-Enabled Entangling Gate for Trapped Ions
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB We implement a 2-qubit entangling Molmer-Sorensen interaction by transporting two cotrapped Ca-40(+) ions through a stationary, bichromatic optical beam within a surface-electrode Paul trap. We describe a procedure for achieving a constant Doppler shift during the transport, which uses fine temporal adjustment of the moving confinement potential. The fixed interaction duration of the ions transported through the laser beam as well as the dynamically changing ac Stark shift require alterations to the calibration procedures used for a stationary gate. We use the interaction to produce Bell states with fidelities commensurate to those of stationary gates performed in the same system. This result establishes the feasibility of actively incorporating ion transport into quantum information entangling operations.

AB The characterization of the Hamiltonian parameters defining a quantum walk is of paramount importance when performing a variety of tasks, from quantum communication to computation. When dealing with physical implementations of quantum walks, the parameters themselves may not be directly accessible, and, thus, it is necessary to find alternative estimation strategies exploiting other observables. Here, we perform the multiparameter estimation of the Hamiltonian parameters characterizing a continuous-time quantum walk over a line graph with n-neighbor interactions using a deep neural network model fed with experimental probabilities at a given evolution time. We compare our results with the bounds derived from estimation theory and find that the neural network acts as a nearly optimal estimator both when the estimation of two or three parameters is performed.

AB The circuit class QAC(0) was introduced by Moore (1999) as a model for constant depth quantum circuits where the gate set includes many-qubit Toffoli gates. Proving lower bounds against such circuits is a longstanding challenge in quantum circuit complexity; in particular, showing that polynomial-size QAC(0) cannot compute the parity function has remained an open question for over 20 years.
   In this work, we identify a notion of the Pauli spectrum of QAC(0) circuits, which can be viewed as the quantum analogue of the Fourier spectrum of classical AC(0) circuits. We conjecture that the Pauli spectrum of QAC(0) circuits satisfies low-degree concentration, in analogy to the famous Linial, Mansour, Nisan (LMN) theorem on the low-degree Fourier concentration of AC(0) circuits. If true, this conjecture immediately implies that polynomial-size QAC(0) circuits cannot compute parity.
   We prove this conjecture for the class of depth-d, polynomial-size QAC(0) circuits with at most n(O(1/d)) auxiliary qubits. We obtain new circuit lower bounds and learning results as applications: this class of circuits cannot correctly compute
   the n-bit parity function on more than (1/2 + 2-(Omega(n1/d)))-fraction of inputs, and
   the n-bit majority function on more than (1/2 + O(n(-1/4)))-fraction of inputs.
   Additionally we show that this class of QAC(0) circuits with limited auxiliary qubits can be learned with quasipolynomial sample complexity, giving the first learning result for QAC(0) circuits.
   More broadly, our results add evidence that Pauli-analytic techniques can be a powerful tool in studying quantum circuits.

AB Quantum sensing has the potential to improve the sensitivity of chemical sensing by exploiting the characteristics of qubits, which are sensitive to the external environment. Modulation of quantum coherence by target analytes can be a useful tool for quantum sensing. Using molecular qubits is expected to provide excellent sensitivity due to the proximity of the sensor to the target analyte. However, many molecular qubits are used at cryogenic temperatures, and how to make molecular qubits respond to specific analytes remains unclear. Here, we propose a material design in which the coherence time changes in response to a variety of analytes at room temperature. We used the photoexcited triplet, which can be initialized at room temperature, as qubits and introduce them to a metal-organic framework that can flexibly change its pore structure in response to guest adsorption. By changing the local molecular density around the triplet qubits by adsorption of a specific analyte, the mobility of the triplet qubit can be changed, and the coherence time can be made responsive.
   Molecular qubits have great potential as quantum sensors due to their ability to be in close proximity to target analytes, but design guidelines on how to make them respond to specific analytes remain unclear. Here authors show that hybrids of triplet qubits and flexible MOFs can change the coherence time of electron spins of photo-excited triplet state upon adsorption of guest.

TI Can quantum computers do nothing?
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Quantum computing platforms are subject to contradictory engineering requirements: qubits must be protected from mutual interactions when idling ('doing nothing'), and strongly interacting when in operation. If idling qubits are not sufficiently protected, information 'leaks' into neighbouring qubits, becoming ultimately inaccessible. Candidate solutions to this dilemma include many-body localization, dynamical decoupling, and active error correction. However, no protocol exists to quantify this effect in a similar way to e.g. SPAM errors. We develop a scalable, device non-specific, protocol for quantifying idle information loss by exploiting tools from quantum information theory. We implement this protocol in over 3500 experiments carried out across 4 months (Dec 2023-Mar 2024) on IBM's entire Falcon 5.11 processor series. After accounting for other error sources, we detect information loss to high degrees of statistical significance. This work thus provides a firm quantitative foundation from which the protection-operation dilemma can be investigated and ultimately resolved.

TI Quantum circuit design search
SO QUANTUM MACHINE INTELLIGENCE
AB This article explores search strategies for the design of parameterized quantum circuits. We propose several optimization approaches including random search plus survival of the fittest, reinforcement learning both with classical and hybrid quantum classical controllers, and Bayesian optimization as decision makers to design a quantum circuit in an automated way for a specific task such as multi-labeled classification over a dataset. We introduce nontrivial circuit architectures that are arduous to be hand-designed and efficient in terms of trainability. In addition, we introduce reuploading of initial data into quantum circuits as an option to find more general designs. We numerically show that some of the suggested architectures for the Iris dataset accomplish better results compared to the established parameterized quantum circuit designs in the literature. In addition, we investigate the trainability of these structures on the unseen dataset Glass. We report meaningful advantages over the benchmarks for the classification of the Glass dataset which supports the fact that the suggested designs are inherently more trainable.

TI Enhancement of Non-Gaussianity and Nonclassicality of Photon-Added
   Displaced Fock State: A Quantitative Approach
SO ANNALEN DER PHYSIK
AB Non-Gaussian and nonclassical states and processes are already found to be important resources for performing various tasks related to quantum gravity and quantum information processing. Considering these facts, a quantitative analysis of the nonclassical and non-Gaussian features is performed here for photon added displaced Fock state, as a test case, using a set of measures, namely entanglement potential, Wigner-Yanese skew information, Wigner logarithmic negativity, and relative entropy of non-Gaussianity. It is observed that Fock parameter always increases the amount of nonclassicality and non-Gaussianity, while photon addition is effective only for small values of the displacement parameter. Further, the nonclassical and non-Gaussian effects decrease initially with an increase in the displacement parameter before increasing for the large displacement to saturate to the corresponding Fock state (equivalently displaced Fock state) value. Finally, dynamics of the Wigner function under the effect of photon loss channel is used to show that only highly efficient detectors are able to detect Wigner negativity.

TI Device-independent oblivious transfer from the
   bounded-quantum-storage-model and computational assumptions
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB We present a device-independent protocol for oblivious transfer (DIOT) and analyse its security under the assumption that the receiver's quantum storage is bounded during protocol execution and that the device behaves independently and identically in each round. We additionally require that, for each device component, the input corresponding to the choice of measurement basis, and the resulting output, is communicated only with the party holding that component. Our protocol is everlastingly secure and, compared to previous DIOT protocols, it is less strict about the non-communication assumptions that are typical from protocols that use Bell inequality violations; instead, the device-independence comes from a protocol for self-testing of a single (quantum) device which makes use of a post-quantum computational assumption.

AB Maximum Independent Set (MIS) is an NP-hard optimization problem with wide-ranging applications in science and technology. Recently, a super-linear speedup over classical simulated annealing in solving MIS was experimentally observed using a Rydberg atom array (RAA) quantum computer. The extent of the observed speedup depended on the graph instance and the circuit depth of the quantum algorithm. Due to the limited availability of RAA, it is beneficial to be able to efficiently predict the quantum optimization performance on a given graph and circuit depth prior to running it. In this work, we present a graph neural network (GNN)-based performance predictor of the RAA-based MIS optimizer. Our experimental results achieve accuracy with an average root mean squared error (RMSE) of 0.03 out of the range [0, 1]. We open source the experimental data collected for this study at https://github.com/UCLA-VAST/RAAMIS.

TI Comparing quantumness criteria
SO EPL
AB Measuring the quantumness of a system can be done with a variety of methods. In this article we compare different criteria, namely quantum discord, Bell inequality violation and non-separability, for systems placed in a Gaussian state. When the state is pure, these criteria are equivalent, while we find that they do not necessarily coincide when decoherence takes place. Finally, we prove that these criteria are essentially controlled by the semi-minor axis of the ellipse representing the state's Wigner function in phase space. Copyright (C) 2023 EPLA

TI Research and Application of Encryption System Based on Quantum Circuit
   for Mobile Internet Security
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COGNITIVE INFORMATICS AND NATURAL INTELLIGENCE
AB Information technology is developing rapidly, which not only brings opportunities to the society, but also causes various problems of mobile internet information security. Quantum circuits have many characteristics, such as high-complexity and no feedback. This paper applies quantum circuits to the field of encryption technology. A quantum circuit encryption system is designed based on AES. The system uses quantum circuits to construct the encryption algorithm and realizes the mathematical operations and transformation in quantum logic which can be realized through quantum logic gates. Encryption system of quantum circuits can improve the encryption complexity. Its anti-attack ability is (2(boolean AND)n-1)! times of the traditional method, thus it can effectively protect the information security of the IoT. In order to increase the practicability of the system, an interface module is also designed to facilitate the interaction of the system with the outside world. Finally, the encryption rate, resource utilization, and encryption effect of the quantum circuit encryption system are tested, which shows the advantages of it.

TI Strongly correlated multielectron bunches from interaction with quantum
   light
SO SCIENCE ADVANCES
AB Strongly correlated electron systems are a cornerstone of modern physics, being responsible for groundbreaking phenomena from superconducting magnets to quantum computing. In most cases, correlations in electrons arise exclusively because of Coulomb interactions. In this work, we reveal that free electrons interacting simultaneously with a light field can become highly correlated via mechanisms beyond Coulomb interactions. In the case of two electrons, the resulting Pearson correlation coefficient for the joint probability distribution of the output electron energies is enhanced by more than 13 orders of magnitude compared to that of electrons interacting with the light field in succession (one after another). These highly correlated electrons are the result of momentum and energy exchange between the participating electrons via the external quantum light field. Our findings pave the way to the creation and control of highly correlated free electrons for applications including quantum information and ultrafast imaging.
