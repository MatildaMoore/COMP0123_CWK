TI Error-Heralded and Deterministic Interconversion Between W State and
   Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger State with Faithful Quantum Gates in
   Decoherence-Free-Subspace
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB The interconversion of a variety of entangled states can facilitate the information transmission and decline the risk of error rates. Here two faithful protocols to achieve deterministic interconversion between three-logic-qubit W state and three-logic-qubit Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger state in decoherence-free subspace (DFS), resorting to the state-selective property of the quantum dot (QD)-cavity systems and robust-fidelity quantum control gates are presented. Moreover, the single-photon detectors introduced can effectively herald and mitigate potential failures from imperfect interaction between the QD-cavity system and photons, significantly enhancing experimental feasibility. Through comprehensive analysis and evaluation, the protocols demonstrate exceptional conversion efficiencies and deliver near-perfect fidelities. Additionally, the DFS makes system coherence over extended periods to overcome the decoherence effect caused by specific environmental noise, paving the way for quantum information processing.

TI A Blockchain-Assisted Fair Exchange Signature Protocol Using Quantum Key
   Distribution for Metaverse Environment
SO IEEE OPEN JOURNAL OF THE COMMUNICATIONS SOCIETY
AB The metaverse has profoundly altered the conventional online landscape and has attracted significant interest from researchers and industry professionals. As the metaverse changes quickly, it needs strong and safe cryptographic solutions to make sure that transactions are fair and safe in its highly connected world. This paper presents a novel blockchain-assisted fair exchange signature protocol leveraging quantum key distribution (QKD) to ensure security against both classical and quantum adversaries. The suggested protocol combines blockchain technology with quantum key distribution to create an exchange framework that can't be changed, is clear, and can't be tampered with. It also uses quantum mechanics to create keys that are always safe. By incorporating a fair exchange mechanism, the protocol guarantees that either both parties fulfill their obligations or neither party benefits, addressing trust issues in decentralized metaverse transactions. Furthermore, we provide a detailed analysis of the protocol's security, efficiency, and scalability, highlighting its resistance to quantum attacks and its suitability for real-time applications in the metaverse. Simulation results demonstrate that the protocol significantly enhances exchange fairness, minimizes latency, and ensures robust authentication, making it a promising candidate for securing transactions in next-generation digital ecosystems. Web 3.0 technologies provide a resolution by facilitating a decentralized metaverse ecology. The suggested protocol utilizes quantum fundamentals to facilitate safe communication, while the incorporation of quantum cryptography with Web 3.0 improves the efficiency, security, and authenticity of metaverse environments. We test the proposed quantum signature scheme both theoretically and practically using QuantumSim simulations, demonstrating strong signature performance in comparison to other schemes. The results indicate a computational cost of $0.815 ms$ , and communication costs of 1312 bits, demonstrating the protocol's resilience and performance by conducting a thorough safety and efficiency analysis and demonstrating compliance with essential security features, including unforgeability, undeniability, verifiability, and traceability.

TI Experimental demonstration of a high-fidelity virtual two-qubit gate
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB We experimentally demonstrate a virtual two-qubit gate and characterize it using quantum process tomography (QPT). The virtual two-qubit gate decomposes an actual two-qubit gate into single-qubit unitary gates and projection gates in quantum circuits for expectation-value estimation. We implement projection gates via midcircuit measurements. The deterministic sampling scheme reduces the number of experimental circuit evaluations required for decomposing a virtual two-qubit gate. We also apply quantum error mitigation to suppress the effect of measurement errors and improve the average gate fidelity of a virtual controlled-Z (CZ) gate to fav = 0.9938 +/- 0.0002. Our results highlight a practical approach to implement virtual two-qubit gates with high fidelities, which are useful for simulating quantum circuits using fewer qubits and implementing two-qubit gates on a distant pair of qubits.

TI Experimental Demonstration of a Versatile and Scalable Scheme for
   Iterative Generation of Non-Gaussian States of Light
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Non-Gaussian states of light, such as Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill states, are essential resources for optical continuous-variable quantum computing. The ability to efficiently produce these states would open up tremendous prospects for quantum technologies in general and fault-tolerant quantum computing in particular. This letter demonstrates a versatile method using a quantum-memory cavity to mitigate the consequences of the probabilistic nature of the breeding protocols and generate non-Gaussian states at high rates with scalability perspectives. The performances of our experimental setup are illustrated with the generation of squeezed cat states of amplitude alpha 1 / 4 1.63 with a fidelity of more than 60% at a generation rate in the kHz range, which is higher than the state of the art for such states.

TI Resource-Optimized Fermionic Local-Hamiltonian Simulation on a Quantum
   Computer for Quantum Chemistry
SO QUANTUM
AB The ability to simulate a fermionic system on a quantum computer is expected to revolutionize chemical engineering, materials design, nuclear physics, to name a few. Thus, optimizing the simulation circuits is of significance in harnessing the power of quantum computers. Here, we address this problem in two aspects. In the fault-tolerant regime, we optimize the R-z and T gate counts along with the ancilla qubit counts required, assuming the use of a product-formula algorithm for implementation. We obtain a savings ratio of two in the gate counts and a savings ratio of eleven in the number of ancilla qubits required over the state of the art. In the pre-fault tolerant regime, we optimize the two-qubit gate counts, assuming the use of the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) approach. Specific to the latter, we present a framework that enables bootstrapping the VQE progression towards the convergence of the ground-state energy of the fermionic system. This framework, based on perturbation theory, is capable of improving the energy estimate at each cycle of the VQE progression, by about a factor of three closer to the known ground-state energy compared to the standard VQE approach in the test-bed, classically-accessible system of the water molecule. The improved energy estimate in turn results in a commensurate level of savings of quantum resources, such as the number of qubits and quantum gates, required to be within a pre-specified tolerance from the known ground-state energy. We also explore a suite of generalized transformations of fermion to qubit operators and show that resource-requirement savings of up to more than 20%, in small instances, is possible.

TI Adiabatic quantum Zeno dynamics of bosonic atom pairs with large
   inelastic losses
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We report on experiments exploring the non-Hermitian dynamics of pairs of two-level atoms tightly confined in an optical lattice and driven by a near-resonant laser. Although spontaneous emission is negligible for the long-lived excited state, two-body dissipation arises from strong inelastic collisions between two atoms in the excited state. We demonstrate quasi-adiabatic control of the internal state of the pairs in the quantum Zeno regime where inelastic losses dominate. Preparing each atom pair in the longest-lived eigenstate of the non-Hermitian Hamiltonian describing the dissipative dynamics, we measure a lifetime enhanced by more than two orders of magnitude in comparison to the bare two-body lifetime. The measured enhancement factor is in quantitative agreement with the expected lifetime of the prepared "non-Hermitian dressed state."

TI Moving beyond "dual use": quantum technologies and the need for new
   research security paradigms
SO EPJ QUANTUM TECHNOLOGY
AB The development of quantum technologies has been labelled the next revolution in human scientific and industrial endeavour. Because quantum technologies have potential military, defence, intelligence and law enforcement applications, there has been a great deal written about quantum as a dual-use technology; however, most of the research on quantum technologies is performed in higher education environments that lack robust security cultures. This theoretical paper generates a basic overview of the impact that quantum technologies are having, and could have, on how technologies are secured in university and higher education settings ("research security"). This paper then analyses the implications of quantum technology from the perspective of research security, arguing that a new paradigm is needed that moves beyond the dual-use binary. Specific applications of quantum technology are used as examples of challenges to the definitions and explanations of dual-use, and several alternatives are proposed and summarised.

TI Power of uninitialized qubits in shallow quantum circuits
SO THEORETICAL COMPUTER SCIENCE
AB We study uninitialized qubits, whose initial state is arbitrary and unknown, in relation to the computational power of shallow quantum circuits. To do this, we consider uniform families of shallow quantum circuits with n input qubits, O (log n) initialized ancillary qubits, and n(O(1)) uninitialized ancillary qubits, where the input qubits only act as control qubits. We show that such a circuit with depth O((log n)(2)) can compute any symmetric Boolean function on n bits that is computable by a uniform family of polynomial-size classical circuits. Since it is unlikely that this can be done with only O(log n) initialized ancillary qubits, our result provides evidence that the presence of uninitialized ancillary qubits increases the computational power of shallow quantum circuits with only O (log n) initialized ancillary qubits. On the other hand, to understand the limitations of uninitialized qubits, we focus on sub-logarithmic-depth quantum circuits and show the impossibility of computing the parity function on n bits.

TI Asymmetric Bidirectional Quantum Communication with Device
   Authentication in IoT
SO SYMMETRY-BASEL
AB Quantum communication holds great potential for enhancing the security and efficiency of the Internet of Things (IoT). However, existing schemes often overlook device identity authentication, leaving systems vulnerable to unauthorized access, and rely on third-party controllers, which increase complexity and undermine trust. This paper proposes a novel asymmetric bidirectional quantum communication scheme tailored for IoT, integrating device identity authentication and information transmission without requiring third-party controllers. We provide a detailed description of the scheme's application scenarios in IoT, conduct a security analysis of the identity authentication module, and experimentally validate the feasibility of the information transmission module. Additionally, we analyze the impact of quantum noise on the proposed scheme and compare it with existing approaches, highlighting its advantages in terms of resource consumption and efficiency.

Europe and Germany are in the process of successfully establishing research and funding programs with the objective to advance the technology's ecosystem and industrialization, thereby ensuring digital sovereignty, security, and competitiveness. Such an ecosystem comprises hardware/software solution providers, system integrators, and users from research institutions, start-ups, and industry. The vision of the Quantum Technology and Application Consortium (QUTAC) is to establish and advance the quantum computing ecosystem, supporting the ambitious goals of the German government and various research programs. QUTAC is comprised of ten members representing different industries, in particular automotive manufacturing, chemical and pharmaceutical production, insurance, and technology. In this paper, we survey the current state of quantum computing in these sectors as well as the aerospace industry and identify the contributions of QUTAC to the ecosystem. We propose an application-centric approach for the industrialization of the technology based on proven business impact. This paper identifies 24 different use cases. By formalizing high-value use cases into well-described reference problems and benchmarks, we will guide technological progress and eventually commercialization. Our results will be beneficial to all ecosystem participants, including suppliers, system integrators, software developers, users, policymakers, funding program managers, and investors.

TI Digital quantum simulation of molecular dynamics and control
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Optimally-shaped electromagnetic fields have the capacity to coherently control the dynamics of quantum systems and thus offer a promising means for controlling molecular transformations relevant to chemical, biological, and materials applications. Currently, advances in this area are hindered by the prohibitive cost of the quantum dynamics simulations needed to explore the principles and possibilities of molecular control. However, the emergence of nascent quantum-computing devices suggests that efficient simulations of quantum dynamics may be on the horizon. In this article, we study how quantum computers could be employed to design optimally-shaped fields to control molecular systems. We introduce a hybrid algorithm that utilizes a quantum computer for simulating the field-induced quantum dynamics of a molecular system in polynomial time, in combination with a classical optimization approach for updating the field. Qubit encoding methods relevant for molecular control problems are described, and procedures for simulating the quantum dynamics and obtaining the simulation results are discussed. Numerical illustrations are then presented that explicitly treat paradigmatic vibrational and rotational control problems, and also consider how optimally-shaped fields could be used to elucidate the mechanisms of energy transfer in light-harvesting complexes. Resource estimates, as well as a numerical assessment of the impact of hardware noise and the prospects of near-term hardware implementations, are provided for the latter task.

TI Scaling Advantage in Approximate Optimization with Quantum Annealing
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Quantum annealing is a heuristic optimization algorithm that exploits quantum evolution to find low-energy states. Quantum annealers have scaled up in recent years to tackle increasingly larger and more highly connected discrete optimization and quantum simulation problems. Nevertheless, a computational quantum advantage in exact optimization using quantum annealing hardware has so far remained elusive. Here, we present evidence for a quantum annealing scaling advantage in approximate optimization. The advantage is relative to the top classical heuristic algorithm: parallel tempering with isoenergetic cluster moves (PT-ICM). The setting is a family of 2D spin-glass problems with high-precision spin-spin interactions. To achieve this advantage, we implement quantum annealing correction (QAC): an embedding of a bit-flip error-correcting code with energy penalties that leverages the properties of the D-Wave Advantage quantum annealer to yield over 1,300 error-suppressed logical qubits on a degree-5 interaction graph. We generate random spin-glass instances on this graph and benchmark their time-to-epsilon, a generalization of the time-to-solution metric for low-energy states. We demonstrate that, with QAC, quantum annealing exhibits a scaling advantage over PT-ICM at sampling low-energy states with an optimality gap of at least 1.0%. This amounts to the first demonstration of an algorithmic quantum speedup in approximate optimization.

TI A Grover Search-Based Quantum Key Agreement Protocol for Secure Internet
   of Medical Things Communication
SO FUTURE INTERNET
AB The rapid integration of the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) into healthcare systems raises urgent demands for secure communication mechanisms capable of protecting sensitive patient data. Quantum key agreement (QKA), a collaborative approach to key generation based on quantum principles, provides an attractive alternative to traditional quantum key distribution (QKD), as it eliminates dependence on a trusted authority and ensures equal participation from all users. QKA demonstrates particular suitability for IoMT's decentralized medical networks by eliminating trusted authority dependence while ensuring equitable participation among all participants. This addresses fundamental challenges where centralized trust models introduce vulnerabilities and asymmetric access patterns that compromise egalitarian principles essential for medical data sharing. However, practical QKA applications in IoMT remain limited, particularly for schemes that avoid complex entanglement operations and authenticated classical channels. Among the few QKA protocols employing Grover's search algorithm (GSA), existing proposals potentially suffer from limitations in fairness and security. In this paper, the author proposes an improved GSA-based QKA protocol that ensures fairness, security, and correctness without requiring an authenticated classical communication channel. The proposed scheme guarantees that each participant's input equally contributes to the final key, preventing manipulation by any user subgroup. The scheme combines Grover's algorithm with the decoy photon technique to ensure secure quantum transmission. Security analysis confirms resistance to external attacks, including intercept-resend, entanglement probes, and device-level exploits, as well as insider threats such as parameter manipulation. Fairness is achieved through a symmetric protocol design rooted in quantum mechanical principles. Efficiency evaluation shows a theoretical efficiency of approximately 25%, while eliminating the need for quantum memory. These results position the proposed protocol as a practical and scalable solution for future secure quantum communication systems, particularly within distributed IoMT environments.

TI Two-party quantum private comparison based on eight-qubit entangled
   state
SO MODERN PHYSICS LETTERS A
AB The purpose of quantum private comparison (QPC) is to solve "Tierce problem" using quantum mechanics laws, where the "Tierce problem" is to judge whether the secret data of two participants are equal under the condition of protecting data privacy. Here we consider for the first time the usefulness of eight-qubit entangled states for QPC by proposing a new protocol. The proposed protocol only adopts necessary quantum technologies such as preparing quantum states and quantum measurements without using any other quantum technologies (e.g. unitary operations and entanglement swapping), thus the protocol has advantages in quantum device consumption. The measurements adopted only include single-particle measurements, which is easier to implement than entangled-state measurements under the existing technical conditions. The proposed protocol takes advantage of the entanglement characteristics of the eight-qubit entangled state, and uses joint computation, decoy photon technology, the keys generated by a quantum key distribution protocol to ensure data privacy. We show that when all single-particle measurements in the proposed protocol are replaced by Bell measurements, the purpose of the protocol can also be achieved. We also show that the proposed protocol can be changed into a semi-quantum protocol with a few small changes.

For example, entanglement can provide a way for quantum error-correcting codes to achieve higher rates than the one obtained by means of the traditional stabilizer formalism. Such codes are called entanglement-assisted quantum error-correcting (EAQEC) codes. In this paper, we utilize algebraic geometry codes to construct several families of EAQEC codes derived from the Euclidean and the Hermitian construction. Three families constructed here consist of codes whose quantum Singleton defect is equal to zero, one, or two. We also construct families of EAQEC codes with an encoding rate exceeding the quantum Gilbert-Varshamov bound. Additionally, asymptotically good towers of linear complementary dual codes are used to obtain asymptotically good families of EAQEC codes consuming maximal entanglement. Furthermore, a simple comparison with the quantum Gilbert-Varshamov bound demonstrates that, by utilizing the proposed construction, it is possible to generate an asymptotically family of EAQEC codes that exceeds this bound.

AB We investigate an unsuspected connection between logical connectives with non-harmoni-ous deduction rules, such as Prior's tonk, and quantum computing. We argue that these connectives model the information-erasure, the non-reversibility, and the non-determinism that occur, among other places, in quantum measurement. We introduce an intuitionistic propositional logic with a non-harmonious logical connective sup and two interstitial rules, and show that the proof language of this logic forms the core of a quantum programming language.(c) 2023 Elsevier B.V.

As a result of this transition, a new discipline known as quantum software engineering has emerged, which is needed to describe unique methodologies for developing large-scale quantum applications. In the pursue of building this new body of knowledge, we undertake a mining study to elicit the purposes quantum programming is being used for, and steer further research.

TI OpenQASM3: A Broader and Deeper Quantum Assembly Language
SO ACM TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM COMPUTING
AB Quantum assembly languages are machine-independent languages that traditionally describe quantum computation in the circuit model. Open quantum assembly language (OpenQASM 2) was proposed as an imperative programming language for quantum circuits based on earlier QASM dialects. In principle, any quantum computation could be described using OpenQASM 2, but there is a need to describe a broader set of circuits beyond the language of qubits and gates. By examining interactive use cases, we recognize two different timescales of quantum-classical interactions: real-time classical computations that must be performed within the coherence times of the qubits, and near-time computations with less stringent timing. Since the near-time domain is adequately described by existing programming frameworks, we choose in OpenQASM 3 to focus on the real-time domain, which must be more tightly coupled to the execution of quantum operations. We add support for arbitrary control flow as well as calling external classical functions. In addition, we recognize the need to describe circuits at multiple levels of specificity, and therefore we extend the language to include timing, pulse control, and gate modifiers. These new language features create a multi-level intermediate representation for circuit development and optimization, as well as control sequence implementation for calibration, characterization, and error mitigation.

AB Conventional computers have evolved to device components that demonstrate failure rates of 10(-17) or less, while current quantum computing devices typically exhibit error rates of 10(-2 )or greater. This raises concerns about the reliability and reproducibility of the results obtained from quantum computers. The problem is highlighted by experimental observation that today's NISQ devices are inherently unstable. Remote quantum cloud servers typically do not provide users with an ability to calibrate the device themselves. Using inaccurate characterization data for error mitigation can have devastating impact on reproducibility. In this study, we investigate if one can infer the critical channel parameters dynamically from the noisy binary output of the executed quantum circuit and use it to improve program stability. An open question however is how well does this methodology scale. We discuss the efficacy and efficiency of our adaptive algorithm using canonical quantum circuits such as the uniform superposition circuit. Our metric of performance is the Hellinger distance between the post-stabilization observations and the reference (ideal) distribution.

TI Observation of cross phase modulation in cold atom gradient echo memory
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB Strong nonlinear interactions between single photons have important applications in optical quantum information processing. Demonstrations of these interactions in cold atomic ensembles have largely been limited to exploiting slow light generated using electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT). However, these EIT implementations have limited achievable phase shifts due to spontaneous emission. Here, we demonstrate and characterize a scheme free from these limitations using gradient echo memory with inferred single photon phase shifts of 0.07 +/- 0.02 mu rad. Excellent agreement with theoretical modelling was observed. Degradation of memory efficiency was observed for large phase shifts but strategies to overcome that are presented.

TI Autonomous Dissipative Maxwell's Demon in a Diamond Spin Qutrit
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Engineered dynamical maps combining coherent and dissipative transformations of quantum states with quantum measurements have demonstrated a number of technological applications, and promise to be a crucial tool in quantum thermodynamic processes. Here we exploit the control on the effective open spin qutrit dynamics of a nitrogen-vacancy center to experimentally realize an autonomous feedback process (Maxwell's demon) with tunable dissipative strength. The feedback is enabled by random measurement events that condition the subsequent dissipative evolution of the qutrit. The efficacy of the autonomous Maxwell's demon is quantified by means of a generalized Sagawa-Ueda-Tasaki relation for dissipative dynamics. To achieve this, we experimentally characterize the fluctuations of the energy exchanged between the system and its the environment. This opens the way to the implementation of a new class of Maxwell's demons, which could be useful for quantum sensing and quantum thermodynamic devices.

AB EasyCrypt is a formal verification tool used extensively for formalizing concrete security proofs of cryptographic constructions. However, the EasyCrypt formal logics consider only classical attackers, which means that post-quantum security proofs cannot be formalized and machine-checked with this tool. In this paper we prove that a natural extension of the EasyCrypt core logics permits capturing a wide class of post-quantum cryptography proofs, settling a question raised by (Unruh, POPL 2019). Leveraging our positive result, we implement EasyPQC, an extension of EasyCrypt for post-quantum security proofs, and use EasyPQC to verify post-quantum security of three classic constructions: PRF-based MAC, Full Domain Hash and GPV08 identity-based encryption.

TI A randomized benchmarking suite for mid-circuit measurements
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB Mid-circuit measurements are a key component in many quantum information computing protocols, including quantum error correction, fault-tolerant logical operations, and measurement based quantum computing. As such, techniques to quickly and efficiently characterize or benchmark their performance are of great interest. Beyond the measured qubit, it is also relevant to determine what, if any, impact mid-circuit measurement has on adjacent, unmeasured, spectator qubits. Here, we present a mid-circuit measurement benchmarking suite developed from the ubiquitous paradigm of randomized benchmarking. We show how our benchmarking suite can be used to both detect as well as quantify errors on both measured and spectator qubits, including measurement-induced errors on spectator qubits and entangling errors between measured and spectator qubits. We demonstrate the scalability of our suite by simultaneously characterizing mid-circuit measurement on multiple qubits from an IBM Quantum Falcon device, and support our experimental results with numerical simulations. Further, using a mid-circuit measurement tomography protocol we establish the nature of the errors identified by our benchmarking suite.

TI Improved Electron-Nuclear Quantum Gates for Spin Sensing and Control
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB The ability to sense and control nuclear spins near solid-state defects might enable a range of quantum technologies. Dynamically decoupled radio-frequency (DDrf) control offers a high degree of design flexibility and long electron-spin coherence times. However, previous studies have considered simplified models and little is known about optimal gate design and fundamental limits. Here, we develop a generalized DDrf framework that has important implications for spin sensing and control. Our analytical model, which we corroborate by experiments on a single NV center in diamond, reveals the mechanisms that govern the selectivity of gates and their effective Rabi frequencies, and enables flexible detuned gate designs. We apply these insights to numerically show a 60x sensitivity enhancement for detecting weakly coupled spins and study the optimization of quantum gates in multiqubit registers. These results advance the understanding for a broad class of gates and provide a toolbox for application-specific design, enabling improved quantum control and sensing.

TI Quantum algorithm for the classification of supersymmetric top quark
   events
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
AB The search for supersymmetric particles is one of the major goals of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). Supersymmetric top (stop) searches play a very important role in this respect, but the unprecedented collision rate to be attained at the next high luminosity phase of the LHC poses new challenges for the separation between any new signal and the standard model background. The massive parallelism provided by quantum computing techniques may yield an efficient solution for this problem. In this paper we show a novel application of the zoomed quantum annealing machine learning approach to classify the stop signal versus the background, and implement it in a quantum annealer machine. We show that this approach together with the preprocessing of the data with principal component analysis may yield better results than conventional multivariate approaches.

AB Verification of quantum circuits is essential for guaranteeing correctness of quantum algorithms and/or quantum descriptions across various levels of abstraction. In this work, we show that there are promising ways to check the correctness of quantum circuits using simulative verification and random stimuli. To this end, we investigate how to properly generate stimuli for efficiently checking the correctness of a quantum circuit. More precisely, we introduce, illustrate, and analyze three schemes for quantum stimuli generation-offering a trade-off between the error detection rate (as well as the required number of stimuli) and efficiency. In contrast to the verification in the classical realm, we show (both, theoretically and empirically) that even if only a few randomly-chosen stimuli (generated from the proposed schemes) are considered, high error detection rates can be achieved for quantum circuits. The results of these conceptual and theoretical considerations have also been empirically confirmed-with a grand total of approximately 10(6) simulations conducted across 50 000 benchmark instances.

TI Bugs in Quantum Computing Platforms: An Empirical Study
SO PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACM ON PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES-PACMPL
AB The interest in quantum computing is growing, and with it, the importance of software platforms to develop quantum programs. Ensuring the correctness of such platforms is important, and it requires a thorough understanding of the bugs they typically suffer from. To address this need, this paper presents the first in-depth study of bugs in quantum computing platforms. We gather and inspect a set of 223 real-world bugs from 18 open-source quantum computing platforms. Our study shows that a significant fraction of these bugs (39.9%) are quantum-specific, calling for dedicated approaches to prevent and find them. The bugs are spread across various components, but quantum-specific bugs occur particularly often in components that represent, compile, and optimize quantum programming abstractions. Many quantum-specific bugs manifest through unexpected outputs, rather than more obvious signs of misbehavior, such as crashes. Finally, we present a hierarchy of recurrent bug patterns, including ten novel, quantum-specific patterns. Our findings not only show the importance and prevalence bugs in quantum computing platforms, but they help developers to avoid common mistakes and tool builders to tackle the challenge of preventing, finding, and fixing these bugs.

TI Programming physical quantum systems with pulse-level control
SO FRONTIERS IN PHYSICS
AB Quantum information processing holds great potential for pushing beyond the current frontiers in computing. Specifically, quantum computation promises to accelerate the solving of certain problems, and there are many opportunities for innovation based on proposed applications in chemistry, engineering, finance, and more. To harness the full power of quantum computing, however, we must not only place emphasis on manufacturing better qubits, advancing our algorithms, and developing quantum software. We must also refine device-level quantum control to scale to the fault tolerant quantum regime. On May 17-18, 2021, the Chicago Quantum Exchange (CQE) partnered with IBM Quantum and Super.tech to host the Pulse-level Quantum Control Workshop. At the workshop, representatives from academia, national labs, and industry addressed the importance of fine-tuning quantum processing at the physical layer. This work summarizes the key topics of the Pulse-level Quantum Control Workshop for the quantum community at large.

TI Cracking the Curious Case of the Cascade Protocol
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB With the nature-powered quantum revolution gaining momentum, Quantum Computation and Quantum Information are all set to transform the landscape of all areas of science and technology. Quantum Cryptography is one such field which has witnessed tremendous progress in theory as well as in its practical implementation. Quantum Key Distribution is one of its integral parts and it necessarily requires the usage of an information reconciliation protocol to correct the errors present in the key bits transmitted via the physical system involved. Cascade is one such protocol which enjoys popularity among such system developers due to its simplicity and high error-correction efficiency. In this work, we identify, improve, interpret, and implement key optimizations from a practical viewpoint and give an algorithmic implementation of the Cascade protocol which would serve to increase its overall efficiency without changing its foundational structure. We also dig deep into the math and physical interpretation behind the values and expressions of key parameters and quantities of Cascade, which effectively make use of the cascade of errors unearthed by it so as to not only ensure an exponentially decreasing probability of any errors in the key bits with the passes of Cascade but also ensure that only the minimum possible information is leaked to a potential eavesdropper. Finally, we also give a visual walk-through of Cascade in action and support it with explanations at every step. By doing so, we aim to equip researchers and developers with an insight driven error correction tool which is sure to be useful in practice.

TI Efficient Characterization of Qudit Logical Gates with Gate Set
   Tomography Using an Error-Free Virtual Z Gate Model
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Gate set tomography (GST) characterizes the process matrix of quantum logic gates, along with measurement and state preparation errors in quantum processors. GST typically requires extensive data collection and significant computational resources for model estimation. We propose a more efficient GST approach for qudits, utilizing the qudit Hadamard and virtual Z gates to construct fiducials while assuming virtual Z gates are error-free. Our method reduces the computational costs of estimating characterization results, making GST more practical at scale. We experimentally demonstrate the applicability of this approach on a superconducting transmon qutrit.

TI Perturbative Quantum Simulation
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Approximation based on perturbation theory is the foundation for most of the quantitative predictions of quantum mechanics, whether in quantum many-body physics, chemistry, quantum field theory, or other domains. Quantum computing provides an alternative to the perturbation paradigm, yet state-of-the-art quantum processors with tens of noisy qubits are of limited practical utility. Here, we introduce perturbative quantum simulation, which combines the complementary strengths of the two approaches, enabling the solution of large practical quantum problems using limited noisy intermediate-scale quantum hardware. The use of a quantum processor eliminates the need to identify a solvable unperturbed Hamiltonian, while the introduction of perturbative coupling permits the quantum processor to simulate systems larger than the available number of physical qubits. We present an explicit perturbative expansion that mimics the Dyson series expansion and involves only local unitary operations, and show its optimality over other expansions under certain conditions. We numerically benchmark the method for interacting bosons, fermions, and quantum spins in different topologies, and study different physical phenomena, such as information propagation, charge-spin separation, and magnetism, on systems of up to 48 qubits only using an 8 + 1 qubit quantum hardware. We demonstrate our scheme on the IBM quantum cloud, verifying its noise robustness and illustrating its potential for benchmarking large quantum processors with smaller ones.

TI A linear response framework for quantum simulation of bosonic and
   fermionic correlation functions
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Response functions are a fundamental aspect of physics; they represent the link between experimental observations and the underlying quantum many-body state. However, this link is often under-appreciated, as the Lehmann formalism for obtaining response functions in linear response has no direct link to experiment. Within the context of quantum computing, and via a linear response framework, we restore this link by making the experiment an inextricable part of the quantum simulation. This method can be frequency- and momentum-selective, avoids limitations on operators that can be directly measured, and can be more efficient than competing methods. As prototypical examples of response functions, we demonstrate that both bosonic and fermionic Green's functions can be obtained, and apply these ideas to the study of a charge-density-wave material on the ibm_auckland superconducting quantum computer. The linear response method provides a robust framework for using quantum computers to study systems in physics and chemistry.
   As quantum simulations advance, the ability to measure response functions of simulated systems becomes increasingly important. Here the authors present a linear response framework for computing fermionic and bosonic response functions on a quantum computer, demonstrating advantages over existing methods.

TI Variational dynamics as a ground-state problem on a quantum computer
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB We propose a variational quantum algorithm to study the real-time dynamics of quantum systems as a ground -state problem. The method is based on the original proposal of Feynman and Kitaev to encode time into a register of auxiliary qubits. We prepare the Feynman-Kitaev Hamiltonian acting on the composed system as a qubit operator and find an approximate ground state using the variational quantum eigensolver. We apply the algorithm to the study of the dynamics of a transverse-field Ising chain with an increasing number of spins and time steps, proving a favorable scaling in terms of the number of two-qubit gates. Through numerical experiments, we investigate its robustness against noise, showing that the method can be used to evaluate dynamical properties of quantum systems and detect the presence of dynamical quantum phase transitions by measuring Loschmidt echoes.

AB The capacity of noisy quantum channels characterizes the highest rate at which information can be reliably transmitted and it is therefore of practical as well as fundamental importance. Capacities of classical channels are computed using alternating optimization schemes, called Blahut-Arimoto algorithms. In this work, we generalize classical Blahut-Arimoto algorithms to the quantum setting. In particular, we give efficient iterative schemes to compute the capacity of channels with classical input and quantum output, the quantum capacity of less noisy channels, the thermodynamic capacity of quantum channels, as well as the entanglement-assisted capacity of quantum channels. We give rigorous a priori and a posteriori bounds on the estimation error by employing quantum entropy inequalities and demonstrate fast convergence of our algorithms in numerical experiments.

TI Protocols for Packet Quantum Network Intercommunication
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM ENGINEERING
AB A quantum network, which involves multiple parties pinging each other with quantum messages, could revolutionize communication, computing, and basic sciences. The future internet will be a global system of various packet switching quantum and classical networks, and we call it quantum internet. To build a quantum Internet, unified protocols that support the distribution of quantum messages within it are necessary. Intuitively, one would extend classical internet protocols to handle quantum messages. However, classical network mechanisms, especially those related to error control and reliable connection, implicitly assume that information can be duplicated, which is not true in the quantum world due to the no-cloning theorem and monogamy of entanglement. In this article, we investigate and propose protocols for packet quantum network intercommunication. To handle the packet loss problem in transport, we propose a quantum retransmission protocol based on the recursive use of a quantum secret sharing scheme. Other Internet protocols are also discussed. In particular, the creation of logical process-to-process connections is accomplished by a quantum version of the three-way handshake protocol.

SO PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACM ON PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES-PACMPL
CT ACM SIGPLAN Conference on Programming Languages Design and
   Implementation (PLDI)
CY JUN 24-28, 2024
CL Copenhagen, DENMARK
AB We define QSE, a symbolic execution framework for quantum programs by integrating symbolic variables into quantum states and the outcomes of quantum measurements. The soundness of QSE is established through a theorem that ensures the correctness of symbolic execution within operational semantics. We further introduce symbolic stabilizer states, which symbolize the phases of stabilizer generators, for the efficient analysis of quantum error correction (QEC) programs. Within the QSE framework, we can use symbolic expressions to characterize the possible discrete Pauli errors in QEC, providing a significant improvement over existing methods that rely on sampling with simulators. We implement QSE with the support of symbolic stabilizer states in a prototype tool named QuantumSE.jl. Our experiments on representative QEC codes, including quantum repetition codes, Kitaev's toric codes, and quantum Tanner codes, demonstrate the efficiency of QuantumSE.jl for debugging QEC programs with over 1000 qubits. In addition, by substituting concrete values in symbolic expressions of measurement results, QuantumSE.jl is also equipped with a sampling feature for stabilizer circuits. Despite a longer initialization time than the state-of-the-art stabilizer simulator, Google's Stim, QuantumSE.jl offers a quicker sampling rate in the experiments.

TI Towards Quantum Advantage via Topological Data Analysis
SO QUANTUM
AB Even after decades of quantum computing development, examples of generally useful quantum algorithms with exponential speedups over classical counterparts are scarce. Recent progress in quantum algorithms for linear-algebra positioned quantum machine learning (QML) as a potential source of such useful exponential improvements. Yet, in an unexpected development, a recent series of "dequantization" results has equally rapidly removed the promise of exponential speedups for several QML algorithms. This raises the critical question whether exponential speedups of other linear-algebraic QML algorithms persist. In this paper, we study the quantum-algorithmic methods behind the algorithm for topological data analysis of Lloyd, Garnerone and Zanardi through this lens. We provide evidence that the problem solved by this algorithm is classically intractable by showing that its natural generalization is as hard as simulating the one clean qubit model - which is widely believed to require superpolynomial time on a classical computer - and is thus very likely immune to dequantizations. Based on this result, we provide a number of new quantum algorithms for problems such as rank estimation and complex network analysis, along with complexity-theoretic evidence for their classical intractability. Furthermore, we analyze the suitability of the proposed quantum algorithms for near-term implementations. Our results provide a number of useful applications for full-blown, and restricted quantum computers with a guaranteed exponential speedup over classical methods, recovering some of the potential for linear-algebraic QML to become one of quantum computing's killer applications.

TI Quantum computing architecture with trapped ion crystals and fast
   Rydberg gates
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Fast entangling gate operations are a fundamental prerequisite for quantum simulation and computation. We propose an entangling scheme for arbitrary pairs of ions in a linear crystal, harnessing the high electric polarizability of highly excited Rydberg states. An all-to-all quantum gate connectivity is based on an initialization of a pair of ions to a superposition of ground and Rydberg states by laser excitation, followed by the entangling gate operation, which relies on a state-dependent frequency shift of collective vibrational modes of the crystal. This gate operation requires applying an electric waveform to trap electrodes. Employing transverse collective modes of oscillation, we reveal operation times on the order of microseconds within any of the qubit pairs in a small crystal. In our calculation, we take into account realistic experimental conditions and feasible electric field ramps. The proposed gate operation is ready to be combined with a scalable processor architecture to reconfigure the qubit register, either by shuttling ions or by dynamically controlling optical tweezer potentials.

The non-Abelian discrete gauge group D-N-the dihedral group-serves as an approximation to U(1) x Z(2) lattice gauge theory. In order to carry out such a lattice simulation, we detail the construction of efficient quantum circuits to realize basic primitives including the non-Abelian Fourier transform over D-N, the trace operation, and the group multiplication and inversion operations. For each case the required quantum resources scale linearly or as low-degree polynomials in n = log N. We experimentally benchmark our gates on the Rigetti Aspen-9 quantum processor for the case of D-4. The estimated fidelity of all D-4 gates was found to exceed 80%.

TI Proposal for a Nanomechanical Qubit
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW X
AB Mechanical oscillators have been demonstrated with very high quality factors over a wide range of frequencies. They also couple to a wide variety of fields and forces, making them ideal as sensors. The realization of a mechanically based quantum bit could therefore provide an important new platform for quantum computation and sensing. Here, we show that by coupling one of the flexural modes of a suspended carbon nanotube to the charge states of a double quantum dot defined in the nanotube, it is possible to induce sufficient anharmonicity in the mechanical oscillator so that the coupled system can be used as a mechanical quantum bit. However, these results can only be achieved when the device enters the ultrastrong coupling regime. We discuss the conditions for the anharmonicity to appear, and we show that the Hamiltonian can be mapped onto an anharmonic oscillator, allowing us to work out the energy level structure and find how decoherence from the quantum dot and the mechanical oscillator is inherited by the qubit. Remarkably, the dephasing due to the quantum dot is expected to be reduced by several orders of magnitude in the coupled system. We outline qubit control, readout protocols, the realization of a CNOT gate by coupling two qubits to a microwave cavity, and finally how the qubit can be used as a static-force quantum sensor.

TI What is the future role of quantum computation in drug discovery?
SO EMERGING TOPICS IN LIFE SCIENCES
AB Quantum computing promises to revolutionise a range of scientific fields by providing solutions to previously intractable problems. The link between the technology and applications in chemistry has made drug discovery a natural place to look for 'low-hanging fruit'. However, until recently, the lack of accessible, scalable hardware has led to comparisons with nuclear fusion. In this article, we describe how developments in both hardware and algorithms are bringing the time closer when quantum computing, as well a the innovations it inspires, adds real value to computational chemistry in real-world applications.

TI Experimental Space-Division Multiplexed Polarization-Entanglement
   Distribution through 12 Paths of a Multicore Fiber
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB The development and wide application of quantum technologies highly depend on the capacity of the communication channels distributing entanglement. Space-division multiplexing (SDM) enhances data channel transmission capacity in classical telecommunication and bears the potential to transfer the idea to quantum communication using current infrastructure. Here, we demonstrate a SDM of polarization-entangled photons over a 411 m long 19-core multicore fiber distributing polarization-entangled photon pairs through up to 12 channels simultaneously. The quality of the multiplexed transfer is evidenced by high polarization visibility and Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (CHSH) Bell inequality violation for each pair of opposite cores. Our distribution scheme shows high stability over 24 h without any active polariza-tion stabilization and can be effortlessly adapted to a higher number of channels. This technique increases the quantum-channel capacity and allows the reliable implementation of quantum networks of multiple users based on a single entangled photon pair source.

TI Quantum State Complexity in Computationally Tractable Quantum Circuits
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Characterizing the quantum complexity of local random quantum circuits is a very deep problem with implications to the seemingly disparate fields of quantum information theory, quantum many-body physics, and high-energy physics. While our theoretical understanding of these systems has progressed in recent years, numerical approaches for studying these models remains severely limited. In this paper, we discuss a special class of numerically tractable quantum circuits, known as quantum automaton circuits, which may be particularly well suited for this task. These are circuits that preserve the computational basis, yet can produce highly entangled output wave functions. Using ideas from quantum complexity theory, especially those concerning unitary designs, we argue that automaton wave functions have high quantum state complexity. We look at a wide variety of metrics, including measurements of the output bit-string distribution and characterization of the generalized entanglement properties of the quantum state, and find that automaton wave functions closely approximate the behavior of fully Haar random states. In addition to this, we identify the generalized out-of-time ordered 2k-point correlation functions as a particularly useful probe of complexity in automaton circuits. Using these correlators, we are able to numerically study the growth of complexity well beyond the scrambling time for very large systems. As a result, we are able to present evidence of a linear growth of design complexity in local quantum circuits, consistent with conjectures from quantum information theory.

AB Hybrid-integrated photonic circuits play a crucial role in recent quantum technologies. However, deterministic and alignment-tolerant methods are still lacking, and their development is crucial for accelerating the scalable fabrication of quantum systems. In this study, we demonstrate alignment-tolerant coupling between diamond and silicon nitride waveguides using the deterministic transfer-printing method. To validate this approach, we also demonstrate the capability of on-chip quantum sensing using nitrogen vacancy centers in diamond waveguides.

TI Repeater-like asynchronous measurement-device-independent quantum
   conference key agreement
SO REPORTS ON PROGRESS IN PHYSICS
AB Quantum conference key agreement (QCKA) enables secure communication among multiple parties by leveraging multipartite entanglement, which is expected to play a crucial role in future quantum networks. However, its practical implementation has been severely limited by the experimental complexity and low efficiency associated with the requirement for synchronous detection of multipartite entangled states. In this work, we propose a measurement-device-independent QCKA protocol that employs asynchronous Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger state measurement. Our protocol enables a linear scaling of the conference key rate among multiple parties, demonstrating performance comparable to that of the single-repeater scheme in quantum networks. Additionally, we achieve intercity transmission distances with composable security under finite-key conditions. By adopting the generalized asynchronous pairing strategy, our approach eliminates the need for complex global phase locking techniques. Furthermore, by integrating asynchronous pairing with ring-interference network structure, our method provides insights for various quantum tasks beyond quantum communication, including multiparty computing and quantum repeaters.

TI A reference architecture for quantum computing as a service
SO JOURNAL OF KING SAUD UNIVERSITY-COMPUTER AND INFORMATION SCIENCES
AB Quantum computers (QCs) aim to disrupt the status -quo of computing - replacing traditional systems and platforms that are driven by digital circuits and modular software - with hardware and software that operate on the principle of quantum mechanics. QCs that rely on quantum mechanics can exploit quantum circuits (i.e., quantum bits for manipulating quantum gates) to achieve 'quantum computational supremacy' over traditional, i.e., digital computing systems. Currently, the issues that impede mass -scale adoption of quantum systems are rooted in the fact that building, maintaining, and/or programming QCs is a complex and radically distinct engineering paradigm when compared to the challenges of classical computing and software engineering. Quantum service orientation is seen as a solution that synergises the research on service computing and quantum software engineering (QSE) to allow developers and users to build and utilise quantum software services based on pay -per -shot utility computing model. The pay -per -shot model represents a single execution of instruction on quantum processing unit and it allows vendors (e.g., Amazon Braket) to offer their QC platforms, simulators, and software services to end -users. This research contributes by (i) developing a reference architecture for enabling Quantum Computing as a Service (QCaaS), (ii) implementing microservices with the quantum -classic split pattern as an architectural use -case, and (iii) evaluating the architecture based on practitioners' feedback. The proposed reference architecture follows a layered software pattern to support the three phases of service lifecycle namely development , deployment , and split of quantum software services. In the QSE context, the research focuses on unifying architectural methods and service -orientation patterns to promote reuse knowledge and best practices to tackle emerging and futuristic challenges of architecting QCaaS.

TI Discrimination of Ohmic thermal baths by quantum dephasing probes
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We address the discrimination of structured baths at different temperatures by dephasing quantum probes. We derive the exact reduced dynamics and evaluate the minimum error probability achievable by three different kinds of quantum probes, namely, a qubit, a qutrit, and a quantum register made of two qubits. Our results indicate that dephasing quantum probes are useful in discriminating low values of temperature and that lower probabilities of error are achieved for intermediate values of the interaction time, where the minimum probability of error scales as 1/2N, with N the number of energy levels of the probe. A qutrit probe outperforms a qubit one in the discrimination task, whereas entangled probes show smaller optimal times.

TI Application-Motivated, Holistic Benchmarking of a Full Quantum Computing
   Stack
SO QUANTUM
AB Quantum computing systems need to be benchmarked in terms of practical tasks they would be expected to do. Here, we propose 3 "application- motivated" circuit classes for benchmarking: deep (relevant for state preparation in the variational quantum eigensolver algorithm), shallow (inspired by IQP-type circuits that might be useful for near-term quantum machine learning), and square (inspired by the quantum volume benchmark). We quantify the performance of a quantum computing system in running circuits from these classes using several figures of merit, all of which require exponential classical computing resources and a polynomial number of classical samples (bitstrings) from the system. We study how performance varies with the compilation strategy used and the device on which the circuit is run. Using systems made available by IBM Quantum, we examine their performance, showing that noise-aware compilation strategies may be beneficial, and that device connectivity and noise levels play a crucial role in the performance of the system according to our benchmarks.

TI Verifying Random Quantum Circuits with Arbitrary Geometry Using Tensor
   Network States Algorithm
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB The ability to efficiently simulate random quantum circuits using a classical computer is increasingly important for developing noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices. Here, we present a tensor network states based algorithm specifically designed to compute amplitudes for random quantum circuits with arbitrary geometry. Singular value decomposition based compression together with a two-sided circuit evolution algorithm are used to further compress the resulting tensor network. To further accelerate the simulation, we also propose a heuristic algorithm to compute the optimal tensor contraction path. We demonstrate that our algorithm is up to 2 orders of magnitudes faster than the Schrodinger-Feynman algorithm for verifying random quantum circuits on the 53-qubit Sycamore processor, with circuit depths below 12. We also simulate larger random quantum circuits with up to 104 qubits, showing that this algorithm is an ideal tool to verify relatively shallow quantum circuits on near-term quantum computers.

TI Quantum Technologies: a Hermeneutic Technology Assessment Approach

AB This paper develops a hermeneutic technology assessment of quantum technologies. It offers a "vision assessment" of quantum technologies that can eventually lead to socio-ethical analysis. Section 2 describes this methodological approach and in particular the concept of the hermeneutic circle applied to technology. Section 3 gives a generic overview of quantum technologies and their impacts. Sections 4 and 5 apply the hermeneutic technology assessment approach to the study of quantum technologies. Section 5 proposes distinguishing three levels in the analysis of the creation and communication of social meanings to quantum technologies: (a) fictions, (b) popularization, and (c) scientific journalism. Section 6 analyzes the results and defines some lines of action to increase social acceptance and trust in quantum technologies. The aim of this paper is to contribute to the debate on quantum technologies by enhancing the reflection on them and their potential, as well as illustrating the complexity of technological innovation and the need to shape it.

TI Effects of XX catalysts on quantum annealing spectra with perturbative
   crossings
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB In adiabatic quantum computation the required run-time to reach a given ground-state fidelity is dictated by the size of the minimum gap that appears between the ground and first-excited state in the annealing spectrum. In general the presence of avoided level crossings demands an exponential increase in the annealing time with the system size which has consequences both for the efficiency of the algorithm and the required qubit coherence times. One promising avenue being explored to produce more favorable gap scaling is the introduction of nonstoquastic XX couplings in the form of a catalyst-of particular interest are catalysts which utilize accessible information about the optimization problem in their construction. Here we show extreme sensitivity of the effect of an XX catalyst to subtle changes in the encoding of the optimization problem. In particular, we observe that a targeted catalyst containing a single coupling can significantly reduce the gap closing with system size at an avoided level crossing. For slightly different encodings of the same problems however, these same catalysts result in closing gaps in the annealing spectrum. To understand the origin of these closing gaps, we study how the evolution of the ground-state vector is altered by the presence of the catalyst and find that the negative components of the ground-state vector are key to understanding the response of the gap spectrum. We also consider how and when these closing gaps could be utilized in diabatic quantum annealing protocols-a promising alternative to adiabatic quantum annealing in which transitions to higher energy levels are exploited to reduce the run time of the algorithm.

TI Quantum Key Distribution Based on Orthogonal State Encoding
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF THEORETICAL PHYSICS
AB Quantum key distribution(QKD) is one of the most significant areas in quantum information theory. For nearly four decades, substantial QKD schemes are developed. In early years, the security of QKD protocols is depend on switching different bases, namely based on non-orthogonal state encoding. The most famous example is the BB84 protocol. Later, other techniques were developed for orthogonal state encoding. Examples of such protocols include the GV protocol and order-rearrangement protocols. In this paper, we present two QKD protocols based on orthogonal state encoding. One of them does not need to employ order-rearrangement techniques while the other needs to. We provide analyses for them, demonstrating that they are highly efficient when considering consumptions of both qubits and classical bits. Furthermore, the employment of maximally entangled states could be less than previous ones and so the measurement efficiency could be increased. We also modify the protocols for implementing in noisy channels by applying the testing state method.

TI Feedback control and quantum error correction assisted quantum
   multi-parameter estimation
SO CHINESE PHYSICS B
AB Quantum metrology provides a fundamental limit on the precision of multi-parameter estimation, called the Heisenberg limit, which has been achieved in noiseless quantum systems. However, for systems subject to noises, it is hard to achieve this limit since noises are inclined to destroy quantum coherence and entanglement. In this paper, a combined control scheme with feedback and quantum error correction (QEC) is proposed to achieve the Heisenberg limit in the presence of spontaneous emission, where the feedback control is used to protect a stabilizer code space containing an optimal probe state and an additional control is applied to eliminate the measurement incompatibility among three parameters. Although an ancilla system is necessary for the preparation of the optimal probe state, our scheme does not require the ancilla system to be noiseless. In addition, the control scheme in this paper has a low-dimensional code space. For the three components of a magnetic field, it can achieve the highest estimation precision with only a 2-dimensional code space, while at least a 4-dimensional code space is required in the common optimal error correction protocols.

TI Exponential suppression of bit or phase errors with cyclic error
   correction
SO NATURE
AB Realizing the potential of quantum computing requires sufficiently low logical error rates(1). Many applications call for error rates as low as 10(-15) (refs. (2-9)), but state-of-the-art quantum platforms typically have physical error rates near 10(-3) (refs. (10-14)). Quantum error correction(15-17) promises to bridge this divide by distributing quantum logical information across many physical qubits in such a way that errors can be detected and corrected. Errors on the encoded logical qubit state can be exponentially suppressed as the number of physical qubits grows, provided that the physical error rates are below a certain threshold and stable over the course of a computation. Here we implement one-dimensional repetition codes embedded in a two-dimensional grid of superconducting qubits that demonstrate exponential suppression of bit-flip or phase-flip errors, reducing logical error per round more than 100-fold when increasing the number of qubits from 5 to 21. Crucially, this error suppression is stable over 50 rounds of error correction. We also introduce a method for analysing error correlations with high precision, allowing us to characterize error locality while performing quantum error correction. Finally, we perform error detection with a small logical qubit using the 2D surface code on the same device(18,19) and show that the results from both one- and two-dimensional codes agree with numerical simulations that use a simple depolarizing error model. These experimental demonstrations provide a foundation for building a scalable fault-tolerant quantum computer with superconducting qubits.
   Repetition codes running many cycles of quantum error correction achieve exponential suppression of errors with increasing numbers of qubits.

TI Accurate harmonic vibrational frequencies for diatomic molecules via
   quantum computing
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB During the noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) era, quantum computational approaches refined to overcome the challenge of limited quantum resources are highly valuable. A comprehensive benchmark for a quantum computational approach in this spirit could provide insights toward further improvements. On the other hand, the accuracy of the molecular properties predicted by most of the quantum computations nowadays is still far off (not within chemical accuracy) compared to their corresponding experimental data. In this work, we propose a promising qubit-efficient quantum computational approach and present a comprehensive investigation by benchmarking quantum computation of the harmonic vibrational frequencies of a large set of neutral closed-shell diatomic molecules with results in great agreement with their experimental data. To this end, we construct the accurate Hamiltonian using molecular orbitals, derived from density functional theory to account for the electron correlation and expanded in the Daubechies wavelet basis set to allow an accurate representation in real space grid points, where an optimized compact active space is further selected so that only a reduced small number of qubits is sufficient to yield an accurate result. Typically, calculations achieved with 2 to 12 qubits using our approach would need 20 to 60 qubits using a traditional cc-pVDZ basis set with frozen core approximation to achieve similar accuracy. To justify the approach, we benchmark the performance of the Hamiltonians spanned by the selected molecular orbitals by first transforming the molecular Hamiltonians into qubit Hamiltonians and then using the exact diagonalization method to calculate the results, regarded as the best results achievable by quantum computation to compare to the experimental data. Furthermore, using the variational quantum eigensolver algorithm with the constructed qubit Hamiltonians, we show that the variational quantum circuit with the chemistry-inspired UCCSD ansatz can achieve the same accuracy as the exact diagonalization method except for systems whose Mayer bond order indices are larger than 2. For those systems, we then demonstrate that the heuristic hardware-efficient RealAmplitudes ansatz, even with a substantially shorter circuit depth, can provide a significant improvement over the UCCSD ansatz, verifying that the harmonic vibrational frequencies could be calculated accurately by quantum computation in the NISQ era.

TI Benchmark Performance of Digital QKD Platform Using Quantum Permutation
   Pad
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Quantum permutation pad or QPP is a set of quantum permutation gates. QPP has been demonstrated for quantum secure encryption in both classical and quantum computing systems recently, even at a noisy 5-qubit IBMQ systems. In a classical computing system, QPP encryption is implemented as a permutation gate matrix multiplication with information state vectors. In a quantum computing system, QPP is compiled into a quantum encryption circuit in a native quantum computer and encryption is performed through QPP circuit. Leveraging its quantum mechanical characteristics, we report a digital QKD or D-QKD platform using QPP as a quantum mechanical algorithm implemented in classical systems to distribute quantum entropy, generated from physical quantum random number generators or QRNG, and quantum key over the internet. D-QKD interfaces have been developed to support the photonic QKD standard ETSI-014. This makes any systems with ETSI QKD standards compatible with D-QKD. D-QKD offers point-to-point quantum entropy and quantum key distributions as well as point-to-multi-points quantum key synchronizations with speeds 1000x faster than photonic QKD. This paper reports benchmark performance tests and randomness quality tests for pure quantum entropy generated by a QRNG and expanded entropy using the QPP protocol. The work has been funded by the PlanQK1 project and deployed within the OpenQKD2 testbed Berlin, operated by Deutsche Telekom.

TI Polymer Physics by Quantum Computing
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Sampling equilibrium ensembles of dense polymer mixtures is a paradigmatically hard problem in computational physics, even in lattice-based models. Here, we develop a formalism based on interacting binary tensors that allows for tackling this problem using quantum annealing machines. Our approach is general in that properties such as self-avoidance, branching, and looping can all be specified in terms of quadratic interactions of the tensors. Microstates' realizations of different lattice polymer ensembles are then seamlessly generated by solving suitable discrete energy-minimization problems. This approach enables us to capitalize on the strengths of quantum annealing machines, as we demonstrate by sampling polymer mixtures from low to high densities, using the D-Wave quantum annealer. Our systematic approach offers a promising avenue to harness the rapid development of quantum machines for sampling discrete models of filamentous soft-matter systems.

TI Efficient fault-tolerant code switching via one-way transversal CNOT
   gates
SO QUANTUM
AB Code switching is an established technique that facilitates a universal set of fault-tolerant (FT) quantum gate operations by combining two quantum error correcting (QEC) codes with complementary sets of gates, which each by themselves are easy to implement fault-tolerantly. In this work, we present a code switching scheme that respects the constraints of FT circuit design by only making use of transversal gates. These gates are intrinsically FT without additional qubit overhead. We analyze application of the scheme to low-distance color codes, which are suitable for operation in existing quantum processors, for instance based on trapped ions or neutral atoms. We also briefly discuss connectivity constraints that arise for architectures based on superconducting qubits. Numerical simulations of circuit-level noise indicate that a logical Tgate, facilitated by our scheme, could outperform both flag-FT magic state injection protocols and a physical T-gate at low physical error rates. Transversal code switching naturally scales to code pairs of arbitrary code distance. We observe improved performance of a distance-5 protocol compared to both the distance-3 implementation and the physical gate for realistic error rates. We discuss how the scheme can be implemented with a large degree of parallelization, provided that logical auxiliary qubits can be prepared reliably enough. Our logical T-gate circumvents the need for potentially costly magic state factories. The requirements to perform QEC and to achieve an FT universal gate set are then essentially the same: Prepare logical auxiliary qubits offline, execute transversal gates (ideally in parallel) and perform fast-enough measurements. Transversal code switching thus serves to enable more practical hardware realizations of FT universal quantum computation. The scheme alleviates resource requirements for experimental demonstrations of quantum algorithms run on logical qubits.

TI Feature permutation for quantum machine learning
SO QUANTUM MACHINE INTELLIGENCE
AB Feature permutations, the deliberate orders of features in feature vectors, have not been considered a factor impacting the performance of conventional Quantum Machine Learning (QML) models. While many studies have managed to train QML models on benchmarking problems without thinking about feature permutations, the effect of how this phenomenon could have affected these results remains unexplored. In this article, we show theoretically how the order in which the features are uploaded to typical QML routines could be considered to affect the structure of the model itself and then show empirically that these effects are also visible on benchmarking problems. In addition, we design an adversarial permutation dataset, which can be used to find permutations that have a substantial impact on the performance of QML models. This dataset can be used to show how, in the worst-case scenario, the performance of a QML model can be ruined completely by just picking the wrong permutation for the problems at hand.

TI Emerging Technologies for Quantum Computing
SO IEEE MICRO
AB Despite promising proof of concept demonstrations, currently available quantum hardware suffers from fundamental scalability limitations. The field is relatively new and it is imperative to consider emerging technologies in the space and evaluate their unique tradeoff spaces to determine how to best close the gap between current devices and target applications. Here, we explore three recent developments on this front. First, we consider extensions to currently available hardware, which allow the use of higher level states, beyond the usual binary, which when used temporarily can confer circuit-level advantage. Second, we consider the use of superconducting resonant cavities to reduce hardware requirements to implement quantum error correction protocols. Finally, we consider the use of neutral atoms, which offer unique strengths and weaknesses. It is valuable to evaluate new technology early and often to determine the best path toward scalability.

TI Hybrid no-signaling-quantum correlations
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB Fundamental investigations in non-locality have shown that while the no-signaling principle alone is not sufficient to single out the set of quantum non-local correlations, local quantum mechanics and no-signaling together exactly reproduce the set of quantum correlations in the two-party Bell scenario. Here, we introduce and study an intermediate hybrid no-signaling quantum set of non-local correlations that we term HNSQ in the multi-party Bell scenario where some subsystems are locally quantum while the remaining subsystems are only constrained by the no-signaling principle. Specifically, the set HNSQ is a super-quantum set of correlations derived from no-signaling assemblages by performing quantum measurements on the trusted subsystems. We show that in contrast to the set NS of no-signaling behaviors, there exist extreme points of HNSQ in the tripartite Bell scenario that admit quantum realization. As a tool for optimization over the set HNSQ, we introduce an outer hierarchy of semi-definite programming approximations to the set following an approach put forward by Doherty-Parrilo-Spedalieri. We perform an extensive numerical analysis of the maximal violation of the facet Bell inequalities in the three-party binary input-output scenario and study the corresponding self-testing properties. In contrast to the usual no-signaling correlations, the new set allows for simple security proofs of (one-sided)-device-independent applications against super-quantum adversaries.

TI Direct pulse-level compilation of arbitrary quantum logic gates on
   superconducting qutrits
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB Advanced simulations and calculations on quantum computers require high-fidelity implementations of quantum operations. The universal gateset approach builds complex unitaries from a small set of primitive gates, often resulting in a long gate sequence, which is typically a leading factor in the total accumulated error. Compiling a complex unitary for processors with higher-dimensional logical elements, such as qutrits, exacerbates the accumulated error per unitary, since an even longer gate sequence is required. Optimal control methods promise time- and resource-efficient compact gate sequences and, therefore, higher fidelity. These methods generate pulses that can directly implement any complex unitary on a quantum device. In this work, we demonstrate that any arbitrary qubit and qutrit gate can be realized with high fidelity, which can significantly reduce the length of a gate sequence. We generate and test pulses for a large set of randomly selected arbitrary unitaries on several quantum processing units (QPUs): the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory Quantum Device and Integration Testbed's (QuDIT's) standard QPU and three of Rigetti's QPUs: Ankaa-2, Ankaa-9Q-1, and Aspen-M-3. On the QuDIT platform's standard QPU, the average fidelity of random qutrit gates is 97.9 f 0.5% measured with conventional QPT and 98.8 f 0.6% from QPT with gate folding. Rigetti's Ankaa-2 achieves random qubit gates with an average fidelity of 98.4 f 0.5% (conventional QPT) and 99.7 f 0.1% (QPT with gate folding). On Ankaa-9Q-1 and Aspen-M-3, the average fidelities with conventional qubit QPT measurements were higher than 99% (see Appendix). We show that optimal control gates are robust to drift for at least 3 h and that the same calibration parameters can be used for all implemented gates. Our work promises that the calibration overheads for optimal control gates can be made small enough to enable efficient quantum circuits based on this technique.

TI Quantum computing for atomic and molecular resonances
SO JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS
AB The complex-scaling method can be used to calculate molecular resonances within the Born-Oppenheimer approximation, assuming that the electronic coordinates are dilated independently of the nuclear coordinates. With this method, one will calculate the complex energy of a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian, whose real part is associated with the resonance position and imaginary part is the inverse of the lifetime. In this study, we propose techniques to simulate resonances on a quantum computer. First, we transformed the scaled molecular Hamiltonian to second quantization and then used the Jordan-Wigner transformation to transform the scaled Hamiltonian to the qubit space. To obtain the complex eigenvalues, we introduce the direct measurement method, which is applied to obtain the resonances of a simple one-dimensional model potential that exhibits pre-dissociating resonances analogous to those found in diatomic molecules. Finally, we applied the method to simulate the resonances of the H2- molecule. The numerical results from the IBM Qiskit simulators and IBM quantum computers verify our techniques.

AB We present an educational path for teacher professional development whose primary purpose is to enhance physics teachers' knowledge and awareness of topics related to quantum computation and quantum information, and of their relevance for technological advancement. Besides their objective importance, also stressed by several authors and projects, the choice of topics not traditionally covered in the final year physics curricula also arises from the concrete possibility of developing a multidisciplinary path, able to represent under a unified perspective several subjects treated in secondary school physics and mathematics. The project is realized in the context of the Italian PLS (Plan for Science Degrees) and the education section of the Quantum Flagship. Due to the limitations related to the COVID-19 pandemic it was entirely delivered in the form of synchronous distance learning and was attended by around 30 teachers. Asynchronous discussion was performed using both generally available tools (Google drive, forms etc.) and a dedicated online forum set up on the servers of the University of Pavia. We discuss the structure of the educational path and the results of the first part of the course whose purpose was describing the transition from classical to quantum computation. In general, from both the written pre-questionnaire and the mid-course interviews, strong appreciation and fascination emerge for the cultural significance of the introduced topics and connections.

TI Enhancing Dispersive Readout of Superconducting Qubits through Dynamic
   Control of the Dispersive Shift: Experiment and Theory
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB The performance of a wide range of quantum computing algorithms and protocols depends critically on the fidelity and speed of the employed qubit readout. Examples include gate sequences benefiting from midcircuit real-time measurement-based feedback, such as qubit initialization, entanglement generation, teleportation, and, perhaps most importantly, quantum error correction. A prominent and widely used readout approach is based on the dispersive interaction of a superconducting qubit strongly coupled to a large-bandwidth readout resonator, frequently combined with a dedicated or shared Purcell filter protecting qubits from decay. By dynamically reducing the qubit-resonator detuning and thus increasing the dispersive shift, we demonstrate a beyond-state-of-the-art two-state-readout error of only 0.25% in 100-ns integration time. Maintaining low-readout-drive strength, we nearly quadruple the signal-to-noise ratio of the readout by doubling the readout-mode line width, which we quantify by considering the hybridization of the readout resonator and its dedicated Purcell filter. We find excellent agreement between our experimental data and our theoretical model. The presented results are expected to further boost the performance of new and existing algorithms and protocols critically depending on high-fidelity fast midcircuit measurements.

TI Quadratic and higher-order unconstrained binary optimization of railway
   rescheduling for quantum computing
SO QUANTUM INFORMATION PROCESSING
AB As consequences of disruptions in railway traffic affect passenger experience and satisfaction, appropriate rerouting and/or rescheduling is necessary. These problems are known to be NP-hard, given the numerous restrictions of traffic nature. With the recent advances in quantum technologies, quantum annealing has become an alternative method to solve such optimization problems. To use quantum annealing, the problem needs to be encoded in quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) or higher-order binary optimization (HOBO) formulation that can be recast as a QUBO. This paper introduces QUBO and HOBO representations for rescheduling problems of railway traffic management; the latter is a new approach up to our knowledge. This new approach takes into account not only the single-track lines but also the double- and multi-track lines, as well as stations composed of tracks and switches. We consider the conditions of minimal headway between trains, minimal stay on stations, track occupation, and rolling stock circulation. Furthermore, a hybrid quantum-classical procedure is presented that includes rerouting. We demonstrate the proof of concept implementation on the D-Wave Quantum Processing Unit and D-Wave hybrid solver.

TI High-rate intercity quantum key distribution with a semiconductor
   single-photon source
SO LIGHT-SCIENCE & APPLICATIONS
AB Quantum key distribution (QKD) enables the transmission of information that is secure against general attacks by eavesdroppers. The use of on-demand quantum light sources in QKD protocols is expected to help improve security and maximum tolerable loss. Semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) are a promising building block for quantum communication applications because of the deterministic emission of single photons with high brightness and low multiphoton contribution. Here we report on the first intercity QKD experiment using a bright deterministic single photon source. A BB84 protocol based on polarisation encoding is realised using the high-rate single photons in the telecommunication C-band emitted from a semiconductor QD embedded in a circular Bragg grating structure. Utilising the 79 km long link with 25.49 dB loss (equivalent to 130 km for the direct-connected optical fibre) between the German cities of Hannover and Braunschweig, a record-high secret key bits per pulse of 4.8 x 10(-5) with an average quantum bit error ratio of similar to 0.65% are demonstrated. An asymptotic maximum tolerable loss of 28.11 dB is found, corresponding to a length of 144 km of standard telecommunication fibre. Deterministic semiconductor sources therefore challenge state-of-the-art QKD protocols and have the potential to excel in measurement device independent protocols and quantum repeater applications.

This technology is well suited for a broad range of applications, including quantum computing, quantum sensing, and quantum communications. Cryogenic DC measurements and physical parameters extraction were carried out on this commercial FinFET technology, operating at room temperature, i.e., 300 K, and down to 2.95 K for different device types and geometries. This represents the main step towards cryogenic compact modeling and optimization of three-dimensional CMOS structures for quantum computations.

TI Toward heralded distribution of polarization entanglement
SO OPTICA QUANTUM
AB Distributing entangled states over potentially long distances provides a key resource for many protocols in quantum communication and quantum cryptography. Ideally, this should be implemented in a heralded manner. Starting with four single-photon states, we cascade two single-photon path-entangled states, coded in orthogonal polarizations, to distribute and herald polarization entanglement in a single quantum repeater link architecture. By tuning the input states to minimize (local) losses, the theoretically achievable fidelity to the target state without postselection approaches 1, while sacrificing heralding rates. We achieve a fidelity to the target state of over 95% after postselection, providing a benchmark for the experimental control and allowing a first demonstration of a device-independent quantum key distribution architecture capable of operation over relevant distances. We show that the fidelity of the heralded state without postselection scales predictably and also identify various practical challenges and error sources specific to this architecture, and model their effects on the generated state. While our experiment uses probabilistic photon-pair sources based on spontaneous parametric downconversion, many of these problems are also relevant for variants employing deterministic photon sources.

TI Realizing a Continuous Set of Two-Qubit Gates Parameterized by an Idle
   Time
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Continuous gate sets are a key ingredient for near-term quantum algorithms. Here, we demonstrate a hardware-efficient, continuous set of controlled arbitrary-phase (CZ9) gates acting on flux-tunable transmon qubits. This implementation is robust to control pulse distortions on time scales longer than the duration of the gate, making it suitable for deep quantum circuits. Our calibration procedure makes it possible to parameterize the continuous gate set with a single control parameter, the idle time between the two rectangular halves of the net-zero control pulse. For calibration and characterization, we develop a leakage measurement based on coherent amplification, and a new cycle design for cross-entropy benchmarking. We demonstrate gate errors of 0.7% and leakage of 4 x 10-4 across the entire gate set. This native gate set has the potential to reduce the depth and improve the performance of near-term quantum algorithms compared to decompositions into CZ pi gates and single-qubit gates. Moreover, we expect the calibration and benchmarking methods to find further possible applications.

TI Error filtration for quantum sensing via interferometry
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Dephasing is a main noise mechanism that afflicts quantum information, it reduces visibility, and destroys coherence and entanglement. Therefore, it must be reduced, mitigated, and, if possible, corrected to allow for demonstration of quantum advantage in any application of quantum technology, from computing to sensing and communications. Here we discuss a hardware scheme of error filtration to mitigate the effects of dephasing in optical quantum metrology. The scheme uses only passive linear optics and ancillary vacuum modes, without need of single-photon sources or entanglement. It exploits constructive and destructive interference to partially cancel the detrimental effects of statistically independent sources of dephasing. We apply this scheme to preserve coherent states and to phase stabilize stellar interferometry, showing that a significant improvement can be obtained by using only a few ancillary modes.

TI Materials challenges and opportunities for quantum computing hardware
SO SCIENCE
AB Quantum computing hardware technologies have advanced during the past two decades, with the goal of building systems that can solve problems that are intractable on classical computers. The ability to realize large-scale systems depends on major advances in materials science, materials engineering, and new fabrication techniques. We identify key materials challenges that currently limit progress in five quantum computing hardware platforms, propose how to tackle these problems, and discuss some new areas for exploration. Addressing these materials challenges will require scientists and engineers to work together to create new, interdisciplinary approaches beyond the current boundaries of the quantum computing field.

AB Distributed quantum computing supports combining the computational power of multiple quantum devices to overcome the limitations of individual devices. Circuit cutting techniques enable the distribution of quantum computations via classical communication. These techniques involve partitioning a quantum circuit into smaller subcircuits, each containing fewer qubits. The original circuit's outcome can be replicated by executing these subcircuits on separate devices and combining their results. However, the number of circuit executions required to achieve a fixed result accuracy with circuit cutting grows exponentially with the number of cuts, posing significant costs. In contrast, quantum teleportation allows the distribution of quantum computations without an exponential increase in circuit executions. Nevertheless, each teleportation requires a pre-shared pair of maximally entangled qubits for transmitting a quantum state, and non-maximally entangled qubits cannot be used for this purpose. Addressing this, our work explores utilizing non maximally entangled qubit pairs in wire cutting, a specific form of circuit cutting, to mitigate the associated costs. The cost of this cutting procedure reduces with the increasing degree of entanglement in the pre-shared qubit pairs. We derive the optimal sampling overhead in this context and present a wire cutting technique employing pure non-maximally entangled slates that achieves this optimal sampling overhead. Hence, this offers a continuum between existing wire cutting and quantum teleportation.

TI Synchronous detection of cosmic rays and correlated errors in
   superconducting qubit arrays
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Quantum information processing at scale will require sufficiently stable and long-lived qubits, likely enabled by error-correction codes. Several recent superconducting-qubit experiments, however, reported observing intermittent spatiotemporally correlated errors that would be problematic for conventional codes, with ionizing radiation being a likely cause. Here, we directly measured the cosmic-ray contribution to spatiotemporally correlated qubit errors. We accomplished this by synchronously monitoring cosmic-ray detectors and qubit energy-relaxation dynamics of 10 transmon qubits distributed across a 5 x 5 x 0.35 mm3 silicon chip. Cosmic rays caused correlated errors at a rate of 1/592+48-41s\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$1/\left(592\begin{array}{c}+48\\ -41\end{array}\,{\rm{s}}\right)$$\end{document}, accounting for 17.1 +/- 1.3% of all such events. Our qubits responded to essentially all of the cosmic rays and their secondary particles incident on the chip, consistent with the independently measured arrival flux. Moreover, we observed that the landscape of the superconducting gap in proximity to the Josephson junctions dramatically impacts the qubit response to cosmic rays. Given the practical difficulties associated with shielding cosmic rays, our results indicate the importance of radiation hardening-for example, superconducting gap engineering-to the realization of robust quantum error correction.

TI Exploring ground states of Fermi-Hubbard model on honeycomb lattices
   with counterdiabaticity
SO NPJ QUANTUM MATERIALS
AB Exploring the ground state properties of many-body quantum systems conventionally involves adiabatic processes, alongside exact diagonalization, in the context of quantum annealing or adiabatic quantum computation. Shortcuts to adiabaticity by counter-diabatic driving serve to accelerate these processes by suppressing energy excitations. Motivated by this, we develop variational quantum algorithms incorporating the auxiliary counter-diabatic interactions, comparing them with digitized adiabatic algorithms. These algorithms are then implemented on gate-based quantum circuits to explore the ground states of the Fermi-Hubbard model on honeycomb lattices, utilizing systems with up to 26 qubits. The comparison reveals that the counter-diabatic inspired ansatz is superior to traditional Hamiltonian variational ansatz. Furthermore, the number and duration of Trotter steps are analyzed to understand and mitigate errors. Given the model's relevance to materials in condensed matter, our study paves the way for using variational quantum algorithms with counterdiabaticity to explore quantum materials in the noisy intermediate-scale quantum era.

TI Tracing quantum correlations back to collective interferences
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB In this paper, we investigate the possibility of explaining nonclassical correlations between two quantum systems in terms of quantum interferences between collective states of the two systems. We achieve this by mapping the relations between different measurement contexts in the product Hilbert space of a pair of two-level systems onto an analogous sequence of interferences between paths in a single-particle interferometer. The relations between different measurement outcomes are then traced to the distribution of probability currents in the interferometer, where paradoxical relations between the outcomes are identified with currents connecting two states that are orthogonal and should therefore exclude each other. We show that the relation between probability currents and correlations can be represented by continuous conditional (quasi)probability currents through the interferometer, given by weak values; the violation of the noncontextual assumption is expressed by negative conditional currents in some of the paths. Since negative conditional currents correspond to the assignment of negative conditional probabilities to measurements results in different measurement contexts, the necessity of such negative probability currents represents a failure of noncontextual local realism. Our results help to explain the meaning of nonlocal correlations in quantum mechanics, and support Feynman's claim that interference is the origin of all quantum phenomena.

TI Shedding Light on the Future: Exploring Quantum Neural Networks through
   Optics
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB At the dynamic nexus of artificial intelligence and quantum technology, quantum neural networks (QNNs) play an important role as an emerging technology in the rapidly developing field of quantum machine learning. This development is set to revolutionize the applications of quantum computing. This article reviews the concept of QNNs and their physical realizations, particularly implementations based on quantum optics. The integration of quantum principles with classical neural network architectures is first examined to create QNNs. Some specific examples, such as the quantum perceptron, quantum convolutional neural networks, and quantum Boltzmann machines are discussed. Subsequently, the feasibility of implementing QNNs through photonics is analyzed. The key challenge here lies in achieving the required non-linear gates, and measurement-induced approaches, among others, seem promising. To unlock the computational potential of QNNs, addressing the challenge of scaling their complexity through quantum optics is crucial. Progress in controlling quantum states of light is continuously advancing the field. Additionally, it has been discovered that different QNN architectures can be unified through non-Gaussian operations. This insight will aid in better understanding and developing more complex QNN circuits.
   By integrating quantum computation with classical artificial neural networks, quantum neural networks (QNNs) offer promising advancements in fields such as pattern recognition, weather prediction and so on. Quantum optical systems, including free-space setups and integrated circuits, hold significant potential for the practical implementation of QNNs. As quantum technology continues to evolve, QNNs are set to play a crucial role in unlocking new computational capabilities and solving complex problems with unprecedented efficiency. This perspective explores the intersection of quantum optics and QNNs, providing a brief review of QNNs, discussing the realization of quantum optical neural networks, and analyzing their potential applications. image

TI Compact quantum algorithms for time-dependent differential equations
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Many claims of computational advantages have been made for quantum computing over classical but they have not been demonstrated for practical problems. Here, we present algorithms for solving time-dependent PDEs, with particular reference to fluid equations. We build on an idea based on a linear combination of unitaries to simulate nonunitary, non-Hermitian quantum systems, and generate hybrid quantum-classical algorithms that efficiently perform iterative matrix-vector multiplication and matrix inversion operations. These algorithms are end-to-end, with relatively low-depth quantum circuits that demonstrate quantum advantage, with the best-case asymptotic complexities, which we show are near optimal. We demonstrate the performance of the algorithms by conducting: (a) fully gate level, state-vector simulations using an in-house, high-performance, quantum simulator called QFLOWS; (b) experiments on a real quantum device; and (c) noisy simulations using QISKIT AER. We also provide device specifications such as error rates (noise) and state sampling (measurement) to accurately perform convergent flow simulations on noisy devices. The results offer evidence that the proposed algorithm is amenable for use on near-term quantum devices.

TI Quantum computing universal thermalization dynamics in a (2+1)D Lattice
   Gauge Theory
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Simulating non-equilibrium phenomena in strongly-interacting quantum many-body systems, including thermalization, is a promising application of near-term and future quantum computation. By performing experiments on a digital quantum computer consisting of fully-connected optically-controlled trapped ions, we study the role of entanglement in the thermalization dynamics of a Z2 lattice gauge theory in 2+1 spacetime dimensions. Using randomized-measurement protocols, we efficiently learn a classical approximation of non-equilibrium states that yields the gap-ratio distribution and the spectral form factor of the entanglement Hamiltonian. These observables exhibit universal early-time signals for quantum chaos, a prerequisite for thermalization. Our work, therefore, establishes quantum computers as robust tools for studying universal features of thermalization in complex many-body systems, including in gauge theories.

TI Training variational quantum algorithms with random gate activation
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) hold great potential for near-term applications and are promising to achieve quantum advantage in practical tasks. However, VQAs suffer from severe barren plateau problems and have a significant probability of being trapped in local minima. In this Research Letter, we propose a training algorithm with random quantum gate activation for VQAs to efficiently address these two issues. This algorithm processes effectively many fewer training parameters than the conventional plain optimization strategy, which efficiently mitigates barren plateaus with the same expressive capability. Additionally, by randomly adding two-qubit gates to the circuit ansatz, the optimization trajectories can escape from local minima and reach the global minimum more frequently due to more sources of randomness. In real quantum experiments, the training algorithm can also reduce the quantum computational resources required and be more quantum noise resilient. We apply our training algorithm to solve variational quantum simulation problems for ground states and present convincing results that showcase the advantages of our strategy, where better performance is achieved by the combination of mitigating barren plateaus, escaping from local minima, and reducing the effect of quantum noise.

TI Entanglement purification on quantum networks
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB We present an approach to entanglement purification on complex quantum network architectures, that is, how a quantum network built from repeaters with limited processing fidelity can purify and distribute entanglement between users. In particular, we explore how noisy gates, depolarizing channels, and finite memory storage time influence the performance of entanglement purification in a quantum network. Finally, we apply the purification techniques we developed in the context of entanglement routing for different quantum network topologies in an effort to inform future design choices for quantum network configurations.

TI Reasoning about Quantum Information: An Overview of Quantum Dynamic
   Logic
SO APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
AB This paper provides an overview of quantum dynamic logics, showing how they have been designed and illustrating how these logics can be applied to verify the correctness of quantum protocols. Similar to the advantages of using dynamic logics to reason about the flow of classical information, the quantum analogues of these logics are tailored to the task of reasoning about the flow of quantum information. We present our logical systems in a modular way, starting with the qualitative logic of quantum measurements and unitary evolutions in single quantum systems, which can already express non-classical effects, e.g., the state-changing interference induced by quantum tests, their non-commutativity, etc. We then move on to logics for compound quantum systems that can capture the non-local features of quantum information: separability, entanglement, correlated measurements, Bell states, etc. We then briefly summarize the logic of quantum probabilities and sketch some applications to quantum protocols.

AB Existing quantum compilers optimize quantum circuits by applying circuit transformations designed by experts. This approach requires significant manual effort to design and implement circuit transformations for different quantum devices, which use different gate sets, and can miss optimizations that are hard to find manually. We propose Quartz, a quantum circuit superoptimizer that automatically generates and verifies circuit transformations for arbitrary quantum gate sets. For a given gate set, Quartz generates candidate circuit transformations by systematically exploring small circuits and verifies the discovered transformations using an automated theorem prover. To optimize a quantum circuit, Quartz uses a cost-based backtracking search that applies the verified transformations to the circuit. Our evaluation on three popular gate sets shows that Quartz can effectively generate and verify transformations for different gate sets. The generated transformations cover manually designed transformations used by existing optimizers and also include new transformations. Quartz is therefore able to optimize a broad range of circuits for diverse gate sets, outperforming or matching the performance of hand-tuned circuit optimizers.

TI Quantum simulation of discrete linear dynamical systems and simple
   iterative methods in linear algebra
SO PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY A-MATHEMATICAL PHYSICAL AND ENGINEERING
   SCIENCES
AB Quantum simulation is capable of simulating certain dynamical systems in continuous time-Schr & ouml;dinger's equations being the most direct and well known-more efficiently than classical simulation. Any linear dynamical system can in fact be transformed into a system of Schr & ouml;dinger's equations via a method called Schr & ouml;dingerisation (Jin et al. 2022. Quantum simulation of partial differential equations via Schr & ouml;dingerisation. (https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.13969) and Jin et al. 2023. Phys. Rev. A 108, 032603. (doi:10.1103/PhysRevA.108.032603)). We show how Schr & ouml;dingerisation allows quantum simulation to be directly used for the simulation of continuous-time versions of general (explicit) iterative schemes or discrete linear dynamical systems. In particular, we use this new method to solve linear systems of equations and for estimating the maximum eigenvector and eigenvalue of a matrix, respectively. This method is applicable using either discrete-variable quantum systems or on hybrid continuous-variable and discrete-variable quantum systems. This framework provides an interesting alternative to solve linear algebra problems using quantum simulation.

TI Laser envelope control of strong field excited Rydberg states
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB Rydberg atoms are important building blocks for quantum technologies, and because of their unique tunable quantum properties, they possess new applications in quantum computing, quantum communication, and quantum sensing. Besides the widely-used few-photon resonant excitation for the specific Rydberg state, multiple Rydberg states can be populated coherently and efficiently through the frustrated tunneling ionization or the Coulomb potential recapture effect in a strong laser field. The excitation of Rydberg states in a strong field provides an opportunity for realizing the ultrafast quantum control on Rydberg atom and bridging the gap between strong field physics and quantum information technology. Using the classical trajectory Monte Carlo method and Qprop package to solve time-dependent Schr & ouml;dinger equation, we calculate the population of Rydberg states. Our results show that the population increases with the increase of parameter of the asymmetric laser envelope. Based on the quantitative rescattering theory, the calculated time-dependent recapture rate is negatively related to the laser envelope and the residual laser interaction time, which is termed the envelope effect. Combined with the carrier-wave effect, an analytic formula can be used to calculate the Rydberg state population: Y(t) oc W0 (t) t -T + c f (t) cos (wt + phi) . This result opens the way to enhancing the generation of Rydberg states by using the laser envelope control, which is beneficial to the future quantum technology based on the Rydberg states generated in the strong laser field.

TI Remote creation of quantum coherence via indefinite causal order
SO QUANTUM INFORMATION PROCESSING
AB Quantum coherence is a prime resource in quantum computing and quantum communication. Quantum coherence of an arbitrary qubit can be created at a remote location using maximally entangled state, local operation and classical communication. However, if there is a noisy channel acting on one side of the shared resource, then it is not possible to create perfect quantum coherence remotely. Here, we present a method for the creation of quantum coherence at a remote location via the use of entangled state and indefinite causal order. We show this specifically for the superposition of two completely depolarizing channels, two partially depolarizing channels and one completely depolarizing channel along with a unitary operator. We find that when the indefinite causal order of channels acts on one half of the entangled pair, then the shared state loses entanglement, but can retain nonzero quantum discord. This finding may have some interesting applications on its own where discord can be consumed as a resource. Our results suggest that the indefinite causal order along with a tiny amount of quantum discord can act as a resource in creating nonzero quantum coherence in the absence of entanglement.

TI Scalable 2-local architecture for quantum annealing of Ising models with

SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB Achieving densely connected hardware graphs is a challenge for most quantum computing platforms today, and a particularly crucial one for the case of quantum annealing applications. In this context, we present a scalable architecture for quantum annealers to realize effective Ising Hamiltonians of arbitrary connectivity. Our proposal consists of a resource-efficient configuration based on a hardware graph where physical qubits are connected to at most three others and containing exclusively 2-local interactions. We derive this configuration based on chains of qubits encoding logical variables by describing the problem graph in terms of triangles. We thus present a promising route to scale up devices dedicated to classical optimization tasks within the quantum annealing paradigm.

TI Generation of Pseudo-Random Quantum States on Actual Quantum Processors
SO ENTROPY
AB The generation of a large amount of entanglement is a necessary condition for a quantum computer to achieve quantum advantage. In this paper, we propose a method to efficiently generate pseudo-random quantum states, for which the degree of multipartite entanglement is nearly maximal. We argue that the method is optimal, and use it to benchmark actual superconducting (IBM's ibm_lagos) and ion trap (IonQ's Harmony) quantum processors. Despite the fact that ibm_lagos has lower single-qubit and two-qubit error rates, the overall performance of Harmony is better thanks to its low error rate in state preparation and measurement and to the all-to-all connectivity of qubits. Our result highlights the relevance of the qubits network architecture to generate highly entangled states.

TI A novel approach to reduce derivative costs in variational quantum
   algorithms
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS A-MATHEMATICAL AND THEORETICAL
AB We present a detailed numerical study of an alternative approach, named quantum non-demolition measurement (QNDM) (Solinas et al 2023 Eur. Phys. J. D 77 76), to efficiently estimate the gradients or the Hessians of a quantum observable. This is a key step and a resource-demanding task when we want to minimize the cost function associated with a quantum observable. In our detailed analysis, we account for all the resources needed to implement the QNDM approach with a fixed accuracy and compare them to the current state-of-the-art method (Mari et al 2021 Phys. Rev. A 103 012405; Schuld et al 2019 Phys. Rev. A 99 032331; Cerezo et al 2021 Nat. Rev. Phys. 3 625). We find that the QNDM approach is more efficient, i.e. it needs fewer resources, in evaluating the derivatives of a cost function. These advantages are already clear in small dimensional systems and are likely to increase for practical implementations and more realistic situations. A significant outcome of our study is the implementation of the QNDM method in Python, provided in the supplementary material (Caletti and Minuto 2024 https://github.com/ simonecaletti/qndm-gradient). Given that most variational quantum algorithms (VQA) can be formulated within this framework, our results can have significant implications in quantum optimization algorithms and make the QNDM approach a valuable alternative to implement VQA on near-term quantum computers.

TI Quantum steering as a witness of quantum scrambling
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Quantum information scrambling describes the delocalization of local information to global information in the form of entanglement throughout all possible degrees of freedom. A natural measure of scrambling is the tripartite mutual information, which quantifies the amount of delocalized information for a given quantum channel with its state representation, i.e., the Choi state. In this work, we show that quantum information scrambling can also be witnessed by temporal quantum steering for qubit systems. We can do so because there is a fundamental equivalence between the Choi state and the pseudodensity matrix formalism used in temporal quantum correlations. In particular, we propose a quantity as a scrambling witness, based on a measure of temporal steering called temporal steerable weight. We justify the scrambling witness for unitary qubit channels by proving that the quantity vanishes whenever the channel is nonscrambling.

TI Decohering tensor network quantum machine learning models
SO QUANTUM MACHINE INTELLIGENCE
AB Tensor network quantum machine learning (QML) models are promising applications on near-term quantum hardware. While decoherence of qubits is expected to decrease the performance of QML models, it is unclear to what extent the diminished performance can be compensated for by adding ancillas to the models and accordingly increasing the virtual bond dimension of the models. We investigate here the competition between decoherence and adding ancillas on the classification performance of two models, with an analysis of the decoherence effect from the perspective of regression. We present numerical evidence that the fully decohered unitary tree tensor network (TTN) with two ancillas performs at least as well as the non-decohered unitary TTN, suggesting that it is beneficial to add at least two ancillas to the unitary TTN regardless of the amount of decoherence may be consequently introduced.

TI Energy-time and time-bin entanglement: past, present and future
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Entanglement is a key resource in many quantum information tasks. From a fundamental perspective entanglement is at the forefront of major philosophical discussions advancing our understanding of nature. An experimental scheme was proposed in 1989 by Franson that exploited the unpredictability in the generation time of a photon pair in order to produce a then new form of quantum entanglement, known as energy-time entanglement. A later modification gave rise to the very popular time-bin entanglement, an important cornerstone in many real-world quantum communication applications. Both forms of entanglement have radically pushed forward our understanding of quantum mechanics throughout the 1990s and 2000s. A decade later modifications to the original proposals were proposed and demonstrated, which opens the path for the highly sought-after device-independence capability for entanglement certification, with a goal of ultra-secure quantum communication. In this review we cover the beginnings of energy-time and time-bin entanglement, many key experiments that expanded our understanding of what was achievable in quantum information experiments all the way down to modern demonstrations based on new technological advances. We will then point out to the future discussing the important place that energy-time and time-bin entanglement will have in upcoming quantum networks and novel protocols based on nonlocality.

Current probabilistic localization methods, such as the Adaptive Monte Carlo localization (AMCL) algorithm, are computationally intensive and may struggle with large maps or high resolution sensor data. This paper explores the application of quantum computing in robotics, focusing on the use of Grover's search algorithm to improve the efficiency of localization in mobile robots. We propose a novel approach to utilize Grover's algorithm in a 2D map, enabling faster and more efficient localization. Despite the limitations of current physical quantum computers, our experimental results demonstrate a significant speedup over classical methods, highlighting the potential of quantum computing to improve robotic localization. This work bridges the gap between quantum computing and robotics, providing a practical solution for robotic localization and paving the way for future research in quantum robotics.

TI Iterative quantum algorithm for combinatorial optimization based on
   quantum gradient descent
SO RESULTS IN PHYSICS
AB Combinatorial optimization has wide and high-value applications in many fields of science and industry, but solving general combinatorial optimization problems is non-deterministic polynomial time (NP) hard. Many such problems can be mapped onto the ground-state-search problems of the Ising model. Here, an iterative quantum algorithm based on quantum gradient descent to solve combinatorial optimization problems is introduced, where the initial state of a quantum register evolves over several iterations to a good approximation of the Ising-Hamiltonian ground state. We verified the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in solving the MaxCut problem for different types of undirected graphs by numerical simulations, and analyzed the robustness of the algorithm to errors by simulating random error and Gaussian error. We compared the performance of the algorithm with the quantum approximate optimization algorithm, and the results indicate that the proposed algorithm has comparable convergence performance. We also verified the feasibility of the algorithm by conducting experiments on a real quantum computer through the quantum cloud platform. Our work provides a potential method for solving combinatorial optimization problems on future quantum devices without the use of complex classical optimization loops.

TI Solving reaction dynamics with quantum computing algorithms
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW C
AB The description of quantum many-body dynamics is extremely challenging on classical computers, as it can involve many degrees of freedom. However, the time evolution of quantum states is a natural application for quantum computers that are designed to efficiently perform unitary transformations. In this paper, we study quantum algorithms for response functions, relevant for describing different reactions governed by linear response. We focus on nuclear-physics applications and consider a qubit-efficient mapping on the lattice, which can efficiently represent the large volumes required for realistic scattering simulations. For the case of a contact interaction, we develop an algorithm for time evolution based on the Trotter approximation that scales logarithmically with the lattice size and is combined with quantum phase estimation. We eventually focus on the nuclear two-body system and a typical response function relevant for electron scattering as an example. We also investigate ground-state preparation and examine the total circuit depth required for a realistic calculation and the hardware noise level required to interpret the signal.

TI Integrating quantum computing into building-to-grid control framework:
   Application of benders decomposition in mixed-integer nonlinear
   programming
SO BUILDING SIMULATION
AB Buildings use a large amount of energy in the United States. It is important to optimally manage and coordinate the resources across building and power distribution networks to improve overall efficiency. Optimizing the power grid with discrete variables was very challenging for traditional computers and algorithms, as it is an NP-hard problem. In this study, we developed a new optimization solution based on quantum computing for BTG integration. We first used MPC for building loads connected with a commercial distribution grid for cost reduction. Then we used discretization and Benders Decomposition methods to reformulate the problem and decompose the continuous and discrete variables, respectively. We used D-Wave quantum computer to solve dual problems and used conventional algorithm for primal problems. We applied the proposed method to an IEEE 9-bus network with 3 commercial buildings and over 300 residential buildings to evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness. Compared with traditional optimization methods, we obtained similar solutions with some fluctuations and improved computational speed from hours to seconds. The time of quantum computing was greatly reduced to less than 1% of traditional optimization algorithm and software such as MATLAB. Quantum computing has proved the potential to solve large-scale discrete optimization problems for urban energy systems.

TI A manufacturable platform for photonic quantum computing
SO NATURE
AB Although holding great promise for low noise, ease of operation and networking1, useful photonic quantum computing has been precluded by the need for beyond-state-of-the-art components, manufactured by the millions2, 3, 4, 5-6. Here we introduce a manufacturable platform7 for quantum computing with photons. We benchmark a set of monolithically integrated silicon-photonics-based modules to generate, manipulate, network and detect heralded photonic qubits, demonstrating dual-rail photonic qubits with 99.98% +/- 0.01% state preparation and measurement fidelity, Hong-Ou-Mandel (HOM) quantum interference between independent photon sources with 99.50% +/- 0.25% visibility, two-qubit fusion with 99.22% +/- 0.12% fidelity and a chip-to-chip qubit interconnect with 99.72% +/- 0.04% fidelity, conditional on photon detection and not accounting for loss. We preview a selection of next-generation technologies: low-loss silicon nitride (SiN) waveguides and components to address loss, as well as fabrication-tolerant photon sources, high-efficiency photon-number-resolving detectors (PNRDs), low-loss chip-to-fibre coupling and barium titanate (BTO) electro-optic phase shifters for high-performance fast switching.

TI Simple and Rigorous Proof Method for the Security of Practical Quantum
   Key Distribution in the Single-Qubit Regime Using Mismatched Basis
   Measurements
SO QUANTUM REPORTS
AB Quantum key distribution (QKD) protocols aim at allowing two parties to generate a secret shared key. While many QKD protocols have been proven unconditionally secure in theory, practical security analyses of experimental QKD implementations typically do not take into account all possible loopholes, and practical devices are still not fully characterized for obtaining tight and realistic key rates. We present a simple method of computing secure key rates for any practical implementation of discrete-variable QKD (which can also apply to measurement-device-independent QKD), initially in the single-qubit lossless regime, and we rigorously prove its unconditional security against any possible attack. We hope our method becomes one of the standard tools used for analysing, benchmarking, and standardizing all practical realizations of QKD.

TI Quantum key distribution using deterministic single-photon sources over
   a field-installed fibre link
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Quantum-dot-based single-photon sources are key assets for quantum information technology, supplying on-demand scalable quantum resources for computing and communication. However, long-lasting issues such as limited long-term stability and source brightness have traditionally impeded their adoption in real-world applications. Here, we realize a quantum key distribution field trial using true single photons across an 18-km-long dark fibre, located in the Copenhagen metropolitan area, using an optimized, state-of-the-art, quantum-dot single-photon source frequency-converted to the telecom wavelength. A secret key generation rate of > 2 kbits/s realized over a 9.6 dB channel loss is achieved with a polarization-encoded BB84 scheme, showing remarkable stability for more than 24 hours of continuous operation. Our results highlight the maturity of deterministic single-photon source technology while paving the way for advanced single-photon-based communication protocols, including fully device-independent quantum key distribution, towards the goal of a quantum internet.

TI Hyperfine Spectroscopy of Isotopically Engineered Group-IV Color Centers
   in Diamond
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB A quantum register coupled to a spin-photon interface is a key component in quantum communication ing candidates for this application, comprising an electronic spin with optical transitions coupled to a nuclear spin as the quantum register. However, the creation of a quantum register for these color centers with deterministic and strong coupling to the spin-photon interface remains challenging. Here, we make first-principles predictions of the hyperfine parameters of the group-IV color centers, which we verify experimentally with a comprehensive comparison between the spectra of spin active and spin neutral intrinsic dopant nuclei in single GeV- and SnV- emitters. In line with the theoretical predictions, detailed spectroscopy on large sample sizes reveals that hyperfine coupling causes a splitting of the optical transition of SnV- an order of magnitude larger than the optical line width and provides a magnetic field insensitive transition. This strong coupling provides access to a new regime for quantum registers in diamond color centers, opening avenues for novel spin-photon entanglement and quantum sensing schemes for these well-studied emitters.

TI Quantum Communication with Polarization-Encoded Qubits under
   Majorization Monotone Dynamics
SO MATHEMATICS
AB Quantum communication can be realized by transmitting photons that carry quantum information. Due to decoherence, the information encoded in the quantum state of a single photon can be distorted, which leads to communication errors. In particular, we consider the impact of majorization monotone dynamical maps on the efficiency of quantum communication. The mathematical formalism of majorization is revised with its implications for quantum systems. The discrimination probability for two arbitrary orthogonal states is used as a figure of merit to track the quality of quantum communication in the time domain.

TI Preparing Bethe Ansatz Eigenstates on a Quantum Computer
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Several quantum many-body models in one dimension possess exact solutions via the Bethe ansatz method, which has been highly successful for understanding their behavior. Nevertheless, there remain physical properties of such models for which analytic results are unavailable and which are also not well described by approximate numerical methods. Preparing Bethe ansatz eigenstates directly on a quantum computer would allow straightforward extraction of these quantities via measurement. We present a quantum algorithm for preparing Bethe ansatz eigenstates of the spin-1/2 XXZ spin chain that correspond to real-valued solutions of the Bethe equations. The algorithm is polynomial in the number of T gates and the circuit depth, with modest constant prefactors. Although the algorithm is probabilistic, with a success rate that decreases with increasing eigenstate energy, we employ amplitude amplification to boost the success probability. The resource requirements for our approach are lower than for other state-of-the-art quantum simulation algorithms for small error-corrected devices and thus may offer an alternative and computationally less demanding demonstration of quantum advantage for physically relevant problems.

TI The Effect of QBER Estimation on the fficecEfiiny and Security of
   Quantum Key Distribution
SO BAGHDAD SCIENCE JOURNAL
AB Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) is a prominent solution to achieve proven secure data transmission between legitimate users despite any assumptions about the eavesdropper's computational power (given that the laws of quantum mechanics are correct). This remains true even under attacks by quantum computers. In recent years, there has been a great research interest in developing enhanced security constructions based on QKD. This is mainly driven by the envisioned threats of quantum computers to the traditional information security infrastructure based on public key cryptography. This research lies under the wide umbrella of the so-called post-quantum cryptography. However, for any QKD protocol, an accurate estimation of the Quantum Bit Error Rate (QBER) before the information reconciliation phase is crucial for both the efficiency and security perspectives. In spite of the importance of the QBER estimation step, the state-of-the-art literature still lacks a detailed investigation of the practical aspects of this issue. Therefore, this work aims to fill this research gap. An extension of the EnQuad simulator has been used to study the effect of QBER estimation on the efficiency and security of the BB84 QKD protocol for depolarizing quantum channels and individual Intercept/Resend Eve attacks. Various parameters affecting the QBER estimation process have been carefully investigated. Our evaluation has shown the significant importance of the QBER estimation step. Indeed, an empirical formula has been derived for calculating the required size of the sifted key subset (the so-called sharing rate) needed for the QBER estimation. This is a major contribution of the presented work.

This algorithm can be seen as the extension of the time-dependent DMRG from the usual situation of Hermitian Hamiltonian matrices to quantum circuits defined by unitary matrices. For small circuit depths, the technique is exact and equivalent to other matrix product state-based techniques. For larger depths, it becomes approximate in exchange for an exponential speed up in computational time. Like an actual quantum computer, the quality of the DMRG results is characterized by a finite fidelity. However, unlike a quantum computer, the fidelity depends strongly on the quantum circuit considered. For the most difficult possible circuit for this technique, the so-called "quantum supremacy" benchmark of Google LLC [Arute et al., Nature 574, 505 (2019)], we find that the DMRG algorithm can generate bit strings of the same quality as the seminal Google experiment on a single computing core. For a more structured circuit used for combinatorial optimization (quantum approximate optimization algorithm), we find a drastic improvement of the DMRG results with error rates dropping by a factor of 100 compared with random quantum circuits. Our results suggest that the current bottleneck of quantum computers is their fidelities rather than the number of qubits.

TI Improved amplitude amplification strategies for the quantum simulation
   of classical transport problems
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB The quantum simulation of classical fluids often involves the use of probabilistic algorithms that encode the result of the dynamics in the form of the amplitude of the selected quantum state. In most cases, however, the amplitude probability is too low to allow an efficient use of these algorithms, thereby hindering the practical viability of the quantum simulation. The oblivious amplitude amplification (OAA) algorithm is often presented as a solution to this problem, but to no avail for most classical problems, since its applicability is limited to unitary dynamics. In this paper, we show analytically that OAA when applied to non-unitary dynamics leads to a distortion of the quantum state and to an accompanying error in the quantum update. We provide an analytical upper bound of such error as a function of the degree of non-unitarity of the dynamics and we test it against a quantum simulation of an advection-diffusion-reaction equation, a transport problem of major relevance in science and engineering. Finally, we also propose an amplification strategy that helps mitigate the distortion error, while still securing an enhanced success probability.

TI Extending quantum computing through subspace, embedding and classical
   molecular dynamics techniques
SO DIGITAL DISCOVERY
AB The advent of hybrid computing platforms consisting of quantum processing units integrated with conventional high-performance computing brings new opportunities for algorithm design. By strategically offloading select portions of the workload to classical hardware where tractable, we may broaden the applicability of quantum computation in the near term. In this perspective, we review techniques that facilitate the study of subdomains of chemical systems with quantum computers and present a proof-of-concept demonstration of quantum-selected configuration interaction deployed within a multiscale/multiphysics simulation workflow leveraging classical molecular dynamics, projection-based embedding and qubit subspace tools. This allows the technology to be utilised for simulating systems of real scientific and industrial interest, which not only brings true quantum utility closer to realisation but is also relevant as we look forward to the fault-tolerant regime.

TI Entanglement and quantum correlations in the XX spin-1/2 honeycomb
   lattice
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB The ground state phase diagram of the dimerized spin-1/2 XX honeycomb model in presence of a transverse magnetic field (TF) is known. With the absence of the magnetic field, two quantum phases, namely, the Neel and the dimerized phases have been identified. Moreover, canted Neel and the paramagnetic (PM) phases also emerge by applying the magnetic field. In this paper, using two powerful numerical exact techniques, Lanczos exact diagonalization, and Density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) methods, we study this model by focusing on the quantum correlations, the concurrence, and the quantum discord (QD) among nearest-neighbor spins. We show that the quantum correlations can capture the position of the quantum critical points in the whole range of the ground state phase diagram consistent with previous results. Although the concurrence and the QD are short-range, informative about long-ranged critical correlations. In addition, we address a "magnetic-entanglement" behavior that starts from an entangled field around the saturation field.

Incorrectly scheduled service provision processes will result in value losses for both customers and providers of PSS. We developed a quantum annealing (QA)-based service provision process scheduling approach and implemented it in a case study in the commercial vehicle industry. For small-size problems, the results show that our QA-based method delivers comparable results to the conventional computational method. For large-size problems, our QA-based method outperforms the conventional method in terms of computational efficiency and optimization accuracy. (c) 2023 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

TI Generalized figure of merit for qubit readout
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Many promising approaches to fault-tolerant quantum computation require repeated quantum nondemolition (QND) readout of binary observables such as quantum bits (qubits). A commonly used figure of merit for readout performance is the error rate for binary assignment in a single repetition. However, it is known that this figure of merit is insufficient. Indeed, real-world readout outcomes are typically analog instead of binary. Binary assignment therefore discards important information on the level of confidence in the analog outcomes. Here, a generalized figure of merit that fully captures the information contained in the analog readout outcomes is suggested. This figure of merit is the Chernoff information associated with the statistics of the analog readout outcomes in one repetition. Unlike the single-repetition error rate, the Chernoff information uniquely determines the asymptotic cumulative error rate for arbitrary readout noise. As a result, non-Gaussian readout noise common in experiments can be described by effective Gaussian noise with the same Chernoff information. Importantly, it is shown that such a universal description persists for the small number of repetitions and non-QND imperfections relevant to real experiments. Finally, the Chernoff information is used to rigorously quantify the amount of information discarded by analog-to-binary conversion. These results provide a unified framework for qubit readout and should facilitate optimization and engineering of near-term quantum devices across all platforms.

SO EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL PLUS
AB We study the entanglement between a certain qubit and the remaining system in rank-2 mixed states prepared on the quantum computer. The protocol, which we propose for this purpose, is based on the relation of geometric measure of entanglement with correlations between qubits. As a special case, we consider a two-qubit rank-2 mixed state and find the relation of concurrence with the geometric measure of entanglement. On the ibmq-melbourne quantum computer, we measure the geometric measure of entanglement in the cases of 2- and 4-qubit mixed quantum states which consist of Schrodinger cat states. We study the dependence of the value of entanglement on the parameter which defines the weight of pure states. Finally, we determine the concurrence of 2-qubit mixed state.

TI Efficient and robust estimation of many-qubit Hamiltonians
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Characterizing the interactions and dynamics of quantum mechanical systems is an essential task in developing quantum technologies. We propose an efficient protocol based on the estimation of the time-derivatives of few qubit observables using polynomial interpolation for characterizing the underlying Hamiltonian dynamics and Markovian noise of a multi-qubit device. For finite range dynamics, our protocol exponentially relaxes the necessary time-resolution of the measurements and quadratically reduces the overall sample complexity compared to previous approaches. Furthermore, we show that our protocol can characterize the dynamics of systems with algebraically decaying interactions. The implementation of the protocol requires only the preparation of product states and single-qubit measurements. Furthermore, we improve a shadow tomography method for quantum channels that is of independent interest and discuss the robustness of the protocol to various errors. This protocol can be used to parallelize the learning of the Hamiltonian, rendering it applicable for the characterization of both current and future quantum devices.
   Learning Hamiltonians or Lindbladians of quantum systems from experimental data is important for characterization of interactions and noise processes in quantum devices. Here the authors propose an efficient protocol based on estimating time derivatives using multiple temporal sampling points and robust polynomial interpolation.

TI Near-term quantum algorithms for linear systems of equations with
   regression loss functions
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB Solving linear systems of equations is essential for many problems in science and technology, including problems in machine learning. Existing quantum algorithms have demonstrated the potential for large speedups, but the required quantum resources are not immediately available on near-term quantum devices. In this work, we study near-term quantum algorithms for linear systems of equations, with a focus on the two-norm and Tikhonov regression settings. We investigate the use of variational algorithms and analyze their optimization landscapes. There exist types of linear systems for which variational algorithms designed to avoid barren plateaus, such as properly-initialized imaginary time evolution and adiabatic-inspired optimization, suffer from a different plateau problem. To circumvent this issue, we design near-term algorithms based on a core idea: the classical combination of variational quantum states (CQS). We exhibit several provable guarantees for these algorithms, supported by the representation of the linear system on a so-called ansatz tree. The CQS approach and the ansatz tree also admit the systematic application of heuristic approaches, including a gradient-based search. We have conducted numerical experiments solving linear systems as large as 2(300) x 2(300) by considering cases where we can simulate the quantum algorithm efficiently on a classical computer. Our methods may provide benefits for solving linear systems within the reach of near-term quantum devices.

TI Autocompensating measurement-device-independent quantum cryptography in

SO JOURNAL OF THE EUROPEAN OPTICAL SOCIETY-RAPID PUBLICATIONS
AB Single photon or biphoton states propagating in optical fibers or in free space are affected by random perturbations and imperfections that disturb the information encoded in such states and accordingly quantum key distribution is prevented. We propose three different systems for autocompensating such random perturbations and imperfections when a measurement-device-independent protocol is used. These systems correspond to different optical fibers intended for space division multiplexing and supporting collinear modes, polarization modes or codirectional modes such as few-mode optical fibers and multicore optical fibers. Accordingly, we propose different Bell-states measurement devices located at Charlie system and present simulations that confirm the importance of autocompensation. Moreover, these types of optical fibers allow the use of several transmission channels, which compensates the reduction of the bit rate due to losses.

TI Quantum algorithm for calculating risk contributions in a credit
   portfolio
SO EPJ QUANTUM TECHNOLOGY
AB Finance is one of the promising field for industrial application of quantum computing. In particular, quantum algorithms for calculation of risk measures such as the value at risk and the conditional value at risk of a credit portfolio have been proposed. In this paper, we focus on another problem in credit risk management, calculation of risk contributions, which quantify the concentration of the risk on subgroups in the portfolio. Based on the recent quantum algorithm for simultaneous estimation of multiple expected values, we propose the method for credit risk contribution calculation. We also evaluate the query complexity of the proposed method and see that it scales as (O) over tilde(root N-gr/epsilon) on the subgroup number N-gr and the accuracy epsilon, in contrast with the classical method with (O) over tilde (log(N-gr)/epsilon(2)) complexity. This means that, for calculation of risk contributions of finely divided subgroups, the advantage of the quantum method is reduced compared with risk measure calculation for the entire portfolio. Nevertheless, the quantum method can be advantageous in high-accuracy calculation, and in fact yield less complexity than the classical method in some practically plausible setting.

TI Error rate reduction of single-qubit gates via noise-aware decomposition
   into native gates
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB In the current era of Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) technology, the practical use of quantum computers remains inhibited by our inability to aptly decouple qubits from their environment to mitigate computational errors. In this paper, we introduce an approach by which knowledge of a qubit's initial quantum state and the standard parameters describing its decoherence can be leveraged to mitigate the noise present during the execution of a single-qubit gate. We benchmark our protocol using cloud-based access to IBM quantum processors. On ibmq_rome, we demonstrate a reduction of the single-qubit error rate by 38%, from 1.6 x 10(-3) to 1.0 x 10(-3), provided the initial state of the input qubit is known. On ibmq_bogota, we prove that our protocol will never decrease gate fidelity, provided the system's T-1 and T-2 times have not drifted above 100 times their assumed values. The protocol can be used to reduce quantum state preparation errors, as well as to improve the fidelity of quantum circuits for which some knowledge of the qubits' intermediate states can be inferred. This paper presents a pathway to using information about noise levels and quantum state distributions to significantly reduce error rates associated with quantum gates via optimized decomposition into native hardware gates.

TI Dynamics of Quantum Networks in Noisy Environments

AB Noise exists inherently in realistic quantum systems and affects the evolution of quantum systems. We investigate the dynamics of quantum networks in noisy environments by using the fidelity of the quantum evolved states and the classical percolation theory. We propose an analytical framework that allows us to characterize the stability of quantum networks in terms of quantum noises and network topologies. The calculation results of the framework determine the maximal time that quantum networks with different network topologies can maintain the ability to communicate under noise. We demonstrate the results of the framework through examples of specific graphs under amplitude damping and phase damping noises. We further consider the capacity of the quantum network in a noisy environment according to the proposed framework. The analytical framework helps us better understand the evolution time of a quantum network and provides a reference for designing large quantum networks.

TI Coherent Microwave, Optical, and Mechanical Quantum Control of Spin
   Qubits in Diamond
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB Diamond has emerged as a highly promising platform for quantum network applications. Color centers in diamond fulfill the fundamental requirements for quantum nodes: they constitute optically accessible quantum systems with long-lived spin qubits. Furthermore, they provide access to a quantum register of electronic and nuclear spin qubits and they mediate entanglement between spins and photons. All these operations require coherent control of the color center's spin state. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the state-of-the-art, challenges, and prospects of such schemes, including high-fidelity initialization, coherent manipulation, and readout of spin states. Established microwave and optical control techniques are reviewed, and moreover, emerging methods such as cavity-mediated spin-photon interactions and mechanical control based on spin-phonon interactions are summarized. For different types of color centers, namely, nitrogen-vacancy and group-IV color centers, distinct challenges persist that are subject of ongoing research. Beyond fundamental coherent spin qubit control techniques, advanced demonstrations in quantum network applications are outlined, for example, the integration of individual color centers for accessing (nuclear) multiqubit registers. Finally, the role of diamond spin qubits in the realization of future quantum information applications is described.

TI Improved quantum computing with higher-order Trotter decomposition
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB In designing quantum control, it is generally required to simulate the controlled system evolution with a classical computer. However, computing the time evolution operator can be quite resource consuming since the total Hamiltonian is often hard to diagonalize. In this paper, we mitigate this issue by substituting the time evolution segments with their Trotter decompositions, which reduces the propagator into a combination of single-qubit operations and fixed-time system evolutions. The resulting procedure can provide substantial speed gain with acceptable costs in the propagator error. As a demonstration, we apply the proposed strategy to improve the efficiency of the gradient ascent pulse engineering algorithm for searching optimal control fields. Furthermore, we show that the higher-order Trotter decompositions can provide efficient Ansatze for the variational quantum algorithm, leading to improved performance in solving the ground-state problem. The strategy presented here is also applicable for many other quantum optimization and simulation tasks.

Here we establish a link between the two. We map two-dimensional (2D) surface codes under a class of incoherent or coherent errors (bit flips or uniaxial rotations) to (1 + 1)D free-fermion quantum circuits via Ising models. We show that the error-correcting phase implies a topologically nontrivial area law for the circuit's 1D long-time state |kIi.). Above the error threshold, we find a topologically trivial area law for incoherent errors and logarithmic entanglement in the coherent case. In establishing our results, we formulate 1D parent Hamiltonians for |Ilf,,,) via linking Ising models and 2D scattering networks, the latter displaying respective insulating and metallic phases and setting the 1D fermion gap and topology via their localization length and topological invariant. We expect our results to generalize to a duality between the error-correcting phase of (d + 1)D topological codes and d-dimensional area laws; this can facilitate assessing code performance under various errors. The approach of combining Ising models, scattering networks, and parent Hamiltonians can be generalized to other fermionic circuits and may be of independent interest.

TI Digitally controlled conveyor-belt spin shuttling in silicon for
   large-scale quantum computation
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB We propose a digitally controlled conveyor-belt shuttling method for silicon-based quantum processors, addressing the scalability challenges of conventional analog sinusoidal implementations. By placing a switch matrix and low-pass filters in a cryogenic environment, our approach synthesizes near-sinusoidal waveforms from a limited number of dc voltage levels. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves fidelity comparable to analog methods while significantly reducing wiring overhead and power dissipation. Moreover, the design offers robustness against device-level variations, enabling largescale integration of high-fidelity spin shuttling for quantum error correction.

AB Quantum networks will enable the implementation of communication tasks with qualitative advantages with respect to the communication networks known today. While it is expected that the first demonstrations of small scale quantum networks will take place in the near term, many challenges remain to scale them. To compare different solutions, optimize over parameter space, and inform experiments, it is necessary to evaluate the performance of concrete quantum network scenarios. Here, the authors review the state-of-the-art of tools for evaluating the performance of quantum networks. The authors present them from three different angles: information-theoretic benchmarks, analytical tools, and simulation.

TI Loop Feynman integration on a quantum computer
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
AB This work investigates in detail the performance and advantages of a new quantum Monte Carlo integrator, dubbed quantum Fourier iterative amplitude estimation (QFIAE), to numerically evaluate for the first time loop Feynman integrals in a near-term quantum computer and a quantum simulator. In order to achieve a quadratic speedup, QFIAE introduces a quantum neural network (QNN) that efficiently decomposes the multidimensional integrand into its Fourier series. For a one-loop tadpole Feynman diagram, we have successfully implemented the quantum algorithm on a real quantum computer and obtained a reasonable agreement with the analytical values. One-loop Feynman diagrams with more external legs have been analyzed in a quantum simulator. These results thoroughly illustrate how our quantum algorithm effectively estimates loop Feynman integrals and the method employed could also find applications in other fields such as finance, artificial intelligence, or other physical sciences.

TI Efficient and Robust Certification of Genuine Multipartite Entanglement
   in Noisy Quantum Error Correction Circuits
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Ensuring the correct functioning of quantum error correction (QEC) circuits is crucial to achieve fault tolerance in realistic quantum processors subjected to noise. The first checkpoint for a fully operational QEC circuit is to create genuine multipartite entanglement (GME) across all subsystems of physical qubits. We introduce a conditional witnessing technique to certify GME that is efficient in the number of subsystems and, importantly, robust against experimental noise and imperfections. Specifically, we prove that the detection of entanglement in a linear number of bipartitions by a number of measurements that also scales linearly, suffices to certify GME. Moreover, our method goes beyond the standard procedure of separating the state from the convex hull of biseparable states, yielding an improved finesse and robustness compared to previous techniques. We apply our method to the noisy readout of stabilizer operators of the distance-three topological color code and its flag-based fault-tolerant version. In particular, we subject the circuits to combinations of three types of noise, namely, uniform depolarizing noise, two-qubit gate depolarizing noise, and bit-flip measurement noise. We numerically compare our method with the standard, yet generally inefficient, fidelity test and to a pair of efficient witnesses, verifying the increased robustness of our method. Last but not least, we provide the full translation of our analysis to a trapped-ion native gate set that makes it suitable for experimental applications.

TI QSAN: A Near-Term Achievable Quantum Self-Attention Network
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NEURAL NETWORKS AND LEARNING SYSTEMS
AB Self-attention mechanism (SAM) is good at capturing the intrinsic connection between features to dramatically boost the performance of machine learning models. Nevertheless, the capability of SAM is not equipped with many current quantum machine learning (QML) models, thus confining their expansion on massive high-dimensional quantum data. To address the above problems, a quantum SAM (QSAM) consisting of a quantum logic similarity (QLS)-based quantum bit self-attention score matrix (QBSASM) is introduced to augment the data representation of SAM exponentially. According to QSAM, the framework and quantum circuits of a one-step achievable quantum self-attention network (QSAN) are designed to consider measurement times compression fully. Moreover, a prototype of quantum coordinates is presented during the design process to describe the mathematical relationship between the output bits and the control bits to facilitate the programming. Ultimately, MNIST binary classification experiments on the PennyLane platform and comparisons with cutting-edge QML models demonstrate QSAN converges about 1.7 x and 2.3 x faster than hardware-efficient ansatz and quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) ansatz, respectively, with similar parameter configurations and 100% prediction accuracy, which indicates that it has a better learning capability. In the CIFAR-10 classification experiments, QSAN achieves high prediction accuracy at a small scale relative to classical machine learning models. Predictably, QSAN elevates the efficiency of QML models and lays the foundation for future quantum computers to perform machine learning on massive amounts of data while promoting the advancement of quantum computer vision and other fields.

TI Quantum entanglement without nonlocal causation in (3,2)-dimensional
   spacetime
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB This work aims at exploring whether the nonlocal correlations due to quantum entanglement could exist without nonlocal causation. This is done with the aid of a toy model to investigate whether the ability of two quantum entangled particles to "correlate" their behaviors even at very large distances and in the absence of any physical connection can be seen as due to an exchange of information through an extra-temporal dimension. Since superluminal information exchange is forbidden in our (3,1) spacetime, an extra-temporal dimension is needed to recover the physical picture of finite velocity information exchange between entangled entities. Assuming that the geometry of spacetime of dimension (3,2) is described by a metric containing a warping factor, the confinement of the massive particles in the extra time dimension follows. Therefore why we do not experience an infinitely large extra time dimension can be explained. The toy model proposed here is defined by borrowing Bohm-Bub's proposal to describe the wave function collapse using nonlinear (nonunitary) dynamical equations and then elaborating this approach for an entangled system. The model thus obtained aims to be a first step into unexplored territory, certainly a model that can be improved, but which already satisfies the purpose of giving the possibility to the hypotheses formulated above to be experimentally verified. The required experimental test has to resort to an unusual experiment which would otherwise be immediately dismissed as manifestly trivial. The proposed experiment would consist of checking the possible violation of Bell's inequality between two identical but independent systems under appropriate conditions. Beyond its theoretical interest, entanglement is a key topic in quantum computing and quantum technologies, so any attempt to gain a deeper understanding of it could be useful.

The problem is formatted as a Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP), where the edge rules in classical WFC are encoded as linear constraints. We successfully demonstrate the generation of valid tile configuration in both 2D and 3D, showcasing the potential of quantum computing in hybrid quantum-classical systems. However, our algorithm is constrained by limitations set by current quantum computers, which prevents real-world deployment at this stage.

SO CHINESE PHYSICS B
AB The utilization of qudits in quantum systems has led to significant advantages in quantum computation and information processing. Therefore, qudits have gained increased attention in recent research for their precise and efficient operations. In this work, we demonstrate the complete population transfer between the next-adjacent energy levels of a transmon qudit using the Pythagorean coupling method and energy level mapping. We achieve a |0 to |2 transfer with a process fidelity of 97.76% in the subspace spanned by |0 to |2. Moreover, the transfer operation is achieved within a remarkably fast timescale, as short as 20 ns. This study may present a promising avenue for enhancing the operation flexibility and efficiency of qudits in future implementations.

TI Enhanced qubit readout via reinforcement learning
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB Measurement is an essential component of robust and practical quantum computation. For superconducting qubits, the measurement process involves the effective manipulation of the joint qubit-resonator dynamics, and it should ideally provide the highest quality for qubit state discrimination with the shortest readout pulse and resonator reset time. Here, we harness model-free reinforcement learning (RL), together with a tailored training environment, to achieve this multifaceted optimization task. Using the IBM quantum device, we demonstrate that the pulse obtained by the RL agent not only successfully achieves state-of-the-art performance, with an assignment error of (4.6 +/- 0.4) x 10-3, but also executes the readout and the subsequent resonator reset almost three times faster than the system's default process. Furthermore, the learned waveforms are robust against realistic parameter drifts and follow an intuitive form, making them readily implementable on existing hardware with little computational overhead. Our results provide an effective readout strategy to boost the performance of superconducting quantum processors and demonstrate the value of RL in providing optimal and practical solutions for complex quantum information processing tasks.

TI Flux qubit based detector of microwave photons
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB A theory of detection of microwave photons with a flux qubit based detector is presented. We consider a semiclassical approximation with the electromagnetic field being in a coherent state. The flux qubit is considered as a multilevel quantum system (qudit). By solving the Lindblad equation, we describe the time evolution of occupations of the qudit's levels for readout and reset stages of detection. When considering the reset stage, the time evolution is described by multiple avoided-level crossings, thus providing a multilevel Landau-ZenerSt & uuml;ckelberg-Majorana (LZSM) problem. In addition to numerical calculations, we present an approximate solution for the description of the reset stage dynamics based on the adiabatic-impulse approximation and rate equation approach. Our theory may be useful for the theoretical description of driven-dissipative dynamics of qud its, including applications such as single-photon detection.

TI Cosmological constant as quantum error correction from generalized gauge
   invariance in double field theory
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MODERN PHYSICS A
AB The holographic principle and its realization as the anti-de Sitter/conformal field theory (AdS/CFT) correspondence leads to the existence of the so-called precursor operators. These are boundary operators that carry nonlocal information regarding events occurring deep inside the bulk and which cannot be causally connected to the boundary. Such nonlocal operators can distinguish nonvacuum-like excitations within the bulk that cannot be observed by any local gauge invariant operators in the boundary. The boundary precursors are expected to become increasingly nonlocal the further the bulk process is from the boundary. Such phenomena are expected to be related to the extended nature of the strings. Standard gauge invariance in the boundary theory equates to quantum error correction which furthermore establishes localization of bulk information. I show that when double field theory quantum error correction prescriptions are considered in the bulk, gauge invariance in the boundary manifests residual effects associated to stringy winding modes. Also, an effect of double field theory quantum error correction is the appearance of positive cosmological constant. The emergence of space-time from the entanglement structure of a dual quantum field theory appears in this context to generalize for de Sitter space-times as well.

TI Observation of the non-Hermitian skin effect and Fermi skin on a digital
   quantum computer
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Lately, the non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE) has been demonstrated in various classical metamaterials and even ultracold atomic arrays. Yet, its interplay with many-body dynamics have never been experimentally investigated. Here, we report the observation of the NHSE and its many-fermion analog on a universal quantum processor. To implement NHSE accumulation on a quantum computer, the time-evolution circuit not only needs to be non-reciprocal and non-unitary, but must also contain sufficiently many lattice qubits. We demonstrate this by systematically post-selecting ancilla qubits, as demonstrated through two paradigmatic non-reciprocal models on noisy quantum processors, with clear signatures of asymmetric spatial propagation and many-body "Fermi skin" accumulation. To minimize errors from inevitable device noise, time evolution is performed using trainable, variationally optimized quantum circuits. Our demonstration represents an important step in the quantum simulation of non-Hermitian lattices on present-day quantum hardware, and can be readily generalized to more sophisticated many-body models.

AB Quantum Computing has become a more and more prominent research field in the last few decades. This growth in interest is mainly related to the so-called quantum speed up that some quantum procedure exhibits. The two main examples are Shor and Grover algorithms. The latter will be a key ingredient of this paper. In particular, we propose an attempt to speed up Answer Set Programming (ASP) exploiting Quantum Computing. We rely on two proposals in the literature that use quantum computation for: finding stable models of ASP programs; counting solutions of propositional formulae. For combining such proposals we embed in the quantum framework a third proposal from the literature, namely a purely classical approach for navigating the solution space of ASP models. We end up with a quantum method for counting stable models of ASP programs. After providing the details of our method, we briefly describe a Proof of Concept implementation of these techniques.

TI Hardware-efficient preparation of architecture-specific graph states on
   near-term quantum computers
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Highly entangled quantum states are an ingredient in numerous applications in quantum computing. However, preparing these highly entangled quantum states on currently available quantum computers at high fidelity is limited by ubiquitous errors. Besides improving the underlying technology of a quantum computer, the scale and fidelity of these entangled states in near-term quantum computers can be improved by specialized compilation methods. In this work, the compilation of quantum circuits for the preparation of highly entangled architecture-specific graph states is addressed by defining and solving a formal model, i.e., a form of discrete constraint optimization. Our model incorporates information about gate cancellations, gate commutations, and accurate gate timing to determine an optimized graph state preparation circuit. Up to now, these aspects have only been considered independently of each other, typically applied to arbitrary quantum circuits. We quantify the quality of a generated state by performing stabilizer measurements and determining its fidelity. We show that our new method reduces the error when preparing a seven-qubit graph state by 3.5x on average compared to the state-of-the-art Qiskit solution. For a linear eight-qubit graph state, the error is reduced by 6.4x on average. The presented results highlight the ability of our approach to prepare higher fidelity or larger-scale graph states on gate-based quantum computing hardware.

AB We experimentally demonstrate the steady-state generation of propagating Wigner-negative states from a continuously driven superconducting qubit. We reconstruct the Wigner function of the radiation emitted into propagating modes defined by their temporal envelopes, using digital filtering. For an optimized temporal filter, we observe a large Wigner logarithmic negativity, in excess of 0.08, in agreement with theory. The fidelity between the theoretical predictions and the states generated experimentally is up to 99%, reaching state-of-the-art realizations in the microwave frequency domain. Our results provide a new way to generate and control nonclassical states, and may enable promising applications such as quantum networks and quantum computation based on waveguide quantum electrodynamics.

TI Quantum machine learning with adaptive linear optics
SO QUANTUM
AB We study supervised learning algorithms in which a quantum device is used to perform a computational subroutine-either for prediction via probability estimation, or to compute a kernel via estimation of quantum states overlap. We design implementations of these quantum subroutines using Boson Sampling architectures in linear optics, supplemented by adaptive measurements. We then challenge these quantum algorithms by deriving classical simulation algorithms for the tasks of output probability estimation and overlap estimation. We obtain different classical simulability regimes for these two computational tasks in terms of the number of adaptive measurements and input photons. In both cases, our results set explicit limits to the range of parameters for which a quantum advantage can be envisaged with adaptive linear optics compared to classical machine learning algorithms: we show that the number of input photons and the number of adaptive measurements cannot be simultaneously small compared to the number of modes. Interestingly, our analysis leaves open the possibility of a near-term quantum advantage with a single adaptive measurement.

TI Quantum speed limit time in two-qubit system by dynamical decoupling
   method
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Quantum state change cannot occur instantly, but the speed of quantum evolution is limited to an upper bound value, called quantum speed limit (QSL). Understanding the quantum speed limit time (QSLT) is fundamental to advancing the control and optimization of quantum systems under decoherence. While significant progress has been made for single-qubit systems, the dynamics of two-qubit systems remain less explored. Studying the effects of dynamical decoupling (DD), such as periodic dynamical decoupling (PDD), on QSLT in two-qubit systems provides an opportunity to explore how to approach coherence preservation, entanglement stabilization, and environmental noise suppression. This exploration can lead to optimized strategies for controlling the evolution of two-qubit systems, which serve as the foundation of quantum gates and scalable quantum architectures. By analyzing QSLT in two-qubit systems, this research seeks to find how DD techniques can be adapted to mitigate the adverse effects of decoherence and extend their coherence times. The insights from this work will also shed light on the role of non-Markovian effects in two-qubit systems, offering potential pathways for leveraging such phenomena to maintain quantum coherence. The results reveal that under special conditions when decoupling pulses are applied to both qubits, the PDD method can completely remove all undesirable effects of the pure dephasing process. Eventually, these findings try to bridge the gap between theoretical frameworks and practical applications in quantum technologies, aiming to develop high-performance quantum processors.

TI Deterministic photon source of genuine three-qubit entanglement
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Deterministic photon sources allow long-term advancements in quantum optics. A single quantum emitter embedded in a photonic resonator or waveguide may be triggered to emit one photon at a time into a desired optical mode. By coherently controlling a single spin in the emitter, multi-photon entanglement can be realized. We demonstrate a deterministic source of three-qubit entanglement based on a single electron spin trapped in a quantum dot embedded in a planar nanophotonic waveguide. We implement nuclear spin narrowing to increase the spin dephasing time to T2*similar or equal to 33\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$${T}_{2}<^>{*}\simeq 33$$\end{document} ns, which enables high-fidelity coherent optical spin rotations, and realize a spin-echo pulse sequence for sequential generation of spin-photon and spin-photon-photon entanglement. The emitted photons are highly indistinguishable, which is a key requirement for scalability and enables subsequent photon fusions to realize larger entangled states. This work presents a scalable deterministic source of multi-photon entanglement with a clear pathway for further improvements, offering promising applications in photonic quantum computing or quantum networks.
   Entanglement between single photons and solid-state emitters is a key component for photonic quantum computing and networks. Here, using a single electron spin in a quantum dot, the authors present a deterministic photon source achieving three-qubit entanglement of one electron spin and two photons.

TI Post-Quantum Key Exchange in TLS 1.3: Further Analysis on Performance of
   New Cryptographic Standards
SO CRYPTOGRAPHY
AB The emergence of quantum computing presents a significant threat to classical cryptographic primitives, particularly those employed in securing internet communications via widely used protocols such as Transport Layer Security (TLS). As conventional key exchange mechanisms will become increasingly vulnerable in the post-quantum era, the integration of post-quantum cryptographic (PQC) algorithms into existing security protocols is of utmost importance. This study investigates the impact of incorporating PQC key encapsulation mechanisms-specifically, the recent standards CRYSTALS-Kyber and HQC, in conjunction with the candidate standard BIKE-into the TLS 1.3 handshake. A comprehensive experimental evaluation was conducted to measure handshake latency under emulated network conditions with varying packet loss probabilities. The findings offer useful insights into the performance trade-offs introduced by PQC integration and further highlight the necessity of a timely transition to post-quantum cryptographic standards.

TI Bipartite bound entanglement
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Bound entanglement is a special form of quantum entanglement that cannot be used for distillation, i.e. the local transformation of copies of arbitrarily entangled states into a smaller number of approximately maximally entangled states. Implying an inherent irreversibility of quantum resources, this phenomenon highlights the gaps in our current theory of entanglement. This review provides a comprehensive exploration of the key findings on bipartite bound entanglement. We focus on systems of finite dimensions, an area of high relevance for many quantum information processing tasks. We elucidate the properties of bound entanglement and its interconnections with various facets of quantum information theory and quantum information processing. The paper highlights areas where our understanding of bound entangled states, particularly in their detection and characterization, remains underdeveloped. By highlighting the need for further research into this phenomenon and underscoring relevant open questions, this paper invites researchers to unravel its relevance for our understanding of entanglement in Nature and how this resource can most effectively be used for applications in quantum technology.

AB We present a graphical framework to represent entanglement in three-qubit states. The geometry associated with each entanglement class and type is analyzed, revealing distinct structural features. We explore the connection between this geometric perspective and the tangle, deriving bounds that depend on the entanglement class. Based on these insights, we conjecture a purely geometric expression for both the tangle and Cayley's hyperdeterminant for non-generic states. As an application, we analyze the energy eigenstates of physical Hamiltonians, identifying the sufficient conditions for genuine tripartite entanglement to be robust under symmetry-breaking perturbations and level repulsion effects.

TI Quantum computation with photochromic films in a Mach-Zehnder
   interferometer
SO FRONTIERS IN NANOTECHNOLOGY
AB Photochromic materials are of great interest because they enable the fabrication of photo-activated switches. In this study, an experiment is proposed in which two chromene-based photochromic layers were inserted into the arms of a Mach-Zehnder interferometer. The chromene was studied from the perspective of optical absorption to determine the wavelength-dependent complex refractive index. Impinging ultraviolet light on one of the chromene layers induces a transition from the closed to the open form of the chromene, resulting in different phase shifts in the two arms of the interferometer. This results in a change in the probability of detecting a photon by the two detectors after the second mirror of the Mach-Zehnder interferometer. The experiment may be of interest to researchers working in the fields of quantum information and quantum communications.

TI Quantum machine learning of molecular energies with hybrid
   quantum-neural wavefunction
SO DIGITAL DISCOVERY
AB Quantum computational chemistry holds great promise for simulating molecular systems more efficiently than classical methods by leveraging quantum bits to represent molecular wavefunctions. However, current implementations face significant limitations in accuracy due to hardware noise and algorithmic constraints. To overcome these challenges, we introduce a hybrid framework that learns molecular wavefunction using a combination of an efficient quantum circuit and a neural network. Numerical benchmarking on molecular systems shows that our hybrid quantum-neural wavefunction approach achieves near-chemical accuracy, comparable to advanced quantum and classical techniques. Based on the isomerization reaction of cyclobutadiene, a challenging multi-reference model, our approach is further validated on a superconducting quantum computer with high accuracy and significant resilience to noise.

TI Quantum computing for a profusion of postman problem variants
SO QUANTUM MACHINE INTELLIGENCE
AB In this paper we study the viability of solving the Chinese Postman Problem, a graph routing optimization problem, and many of its variants on a quantum annealing device. Routing problem variants considered include graph type, directionally varying weights, number of parties involved in routing, among others. We put emphasis on the explanation of how to convert such problems into quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) problems. QUBO is one of two equivalent natural paradigms for quantum annealing devices, the other being the Ising Model. We also expand upon a previously discovered algorithm for solving the Chinese Postman Problem on a closed undirected graph to decrease the number of constraints and variables used in the problem. Optimal annealing parameter settings and constraint weight values are discussed based on results from implementation on the D-Wave 2000Q and Advantage. Results from classical, purely quantum, and hybrid algorithms are compared.

TI Robust Preparation of Wigner-Negative States with Optimized
   SNAP-Displacement Sequences
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Hosting nonclassical states of light in three-dimensional microwave cavities has emerged as a promising paradigm for continuous-variable quantum information processing. Here we experimentally demonstrate high-fidelity generation of a range of Wigner-negative states useful for quantum computation, such as Schrodinger-cat states, binomial states, Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill states, as well as cubic phase states. The latter states have been long sought after in quantum optics and have never been achieved experimentally before. We use a sequence of interleaved selective number-dependent arbitrary phase (SNAP) gates and displacements. We optimize the state preparation in two steps. First we use a gradient-descent algorithm to optimize the parameters of the SNAP and displacement gates. Then we optimize the envelope of the pulses implementing the SNAP gates. Our results show that this way of creating highly nonclassical states in a harmonic oscillator is robust to fluctuations of the system parameters such as the qubit frequency and the dispersive shift.

TI Quantum error correction with higher Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill codes:
   Minimal measurements and linear optics
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We propose two schemes to obtain Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) error syndromes by means of linear-optical operations, homodyne measurements, and GKP ancillas. This includes showing that for a concatenation of GKP codes with an [n, k, d] stabilizer code only 2n measurements are needed in order to obtain the complete syndrome information, significantly reducing the number of measurements in comparison to the canonical concatenated measurement scheme and at the same time generalizing linear-optics-based syndrome detections to higher GKP codes. Furthermore, we analyze the possibility of building the required ancilla states from single-mode states and linear optics. We find that for simple GKP codes this is possible, whereas for concatenations with qubit Calderbank-Shor-Steane codes of distance d >= 3 it is not. We also consider the canonical concatenated syndrome measurements and propose methods for avoiding crosstalk between ancillas. In addition, we make use of the observation that the concatenation of a GKP code with a stabilizer code forms a lattice in order to see the analog information decoding of such codes from a different perspective allowing for semianalytic calculations of the logical error rates.

TI Hardware-Conscious Optimization of the Quantum Toffoli Gate
SO ACM TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM COMPUTING
AB While quantum computing holds great potential in combinatorial optimization, electronic structure calculation, and number theory, the current era of quantum computing is limited by noisy hardware. Many quantum compilation approaches can mitigate the effects of imperfect hardware by optimizing quantum circuits for objectives such as critical path length. Few approaches consider quantum circuits in terms of the set of vendor-calibrated operations (i.e., native gates) available on target hardware. This manuscript expands the analytical and numerical approaches for optimizing quantum circuits at this abstraction level. We present a procedure for combining the strengths of analytical native gate-level optimization with numerical optimization. Although we focus on optimizing Toffoli gates on the IBMQ native gate set, the methods presented are generalizable to any gate and superconducting qubit architecture. Our optimized Toffoli gate implementation demonstrates an 18% reduction in infidelity compared with the canonical implementation as benchmarked on IBM Jakarta with quantum process tomography. Assuming the inclusion of multi-qubit cross-resonance (MCR) gates in the IBMQ native gate set, we produce Toffoli implementations with only six multi-qubit gates, a 25% reduction from the canonical eight multi-qubit implementations for linearly connected qubits.

TI Quantum sensing for particle physics
SO NATURE REVIEWS PHYSICS
AB Quantum sensing uses properties of quantum mechanics to go beyond what is possible with traditional measurement techniques. In particle physics, key problems in which quantum sensing can have a vital role include neutrino properties, tests of fundamental symmetries (Lorentz invariance and the equivalence principle, searches for electric dipole moments and possible variations of the fundamental constants), the search for dark matter and testing ideas about the nature of dark energy. Quantum sensor technologies using atom interferometry, optomechanical devices, or atomic and nuclear clocks are inherently relevant for low-energy physics, but other platforms, such as quantum dots, superconducting devices or spin sensors, might also be useful in future high-energy particle physics detectors. This Perspective explores the opportunities for these technologies in future particle physics experiments and outlines the challenges that could be tackled through collaborative efforts.
   Quantum sensing exploits properties of quantum systems to go beyond what is possible with traditional measurement techniques, hence opening exciting opportunities in both low-energy and high-energy particle physics experiments.

TI Supercharged two-dimensional tweezer array with more than 1000 atomic
   qubits
SO OPTICA
AB We report on the realization of a large-scale quantum-processing architecture surpassing the tier of 1000 atomic qubits. By tiling multiple microlens-generated tweezer arrays, each operated by an independent laser source, we can eliminate laser-power limitations in the number of allocatable qubits. Already with two separate arrays, we implement combined 2D configurations of 3000 qubit sites with a mean number of 1167(46) single-atom quantum systems. The transfer of atoms between the two arrays is achieved with high efficiency. Thus, supercharging one array designated as the quantum processing unit with atoms from the secondary array significantly increases the number of qubits and the initial filling fraction. This drastically enlarges attainable qubit cluster sizes and success probabilities allowing us to demonstrate the defect-free assembly of clusters of up to 441 qubits with persistent stabilization at a near-unity filling fraction over tens of detection cycles. The presented method substantiates neutral atom quantum information science by facilitating configurable geometries of highly scalable quantum registers with immediate application in Rydberg-state-mediated quantum simulation, fault-tolerant universal quantum computation, quantum sensing, and quantum metrology.

TI Stationary Phase Method in Discrete Wigner Functions and Classical
   Simulation of Quantum Circuits
SO QUANTUM
AB One of the lowest-order corrections to Gaussian quantum mechanics in infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces are Airy functions: a uniformization of the stationary phase method applied in the path integral perspective. We introduce a "periodized stationary phase method" to discrete Wigner functions of systems with odd prime dimension and show that the pi/8 gate is the discrete analog of the Airy function. We then establish a relationship between the stabilizer rank of states and the number of quadratic Gauss sums necessary in the periodized stationary phase method. This allows us to develop a classical strong simulation of a single qutrit marginal on t qutrit pi/8 gates that are followed by Clifford evolution, and show that this only requires 3(t/2 +1) quadratic Gauss sums. This outperforms the best alternative qutrit algorithm (based on Wigner negativity and scaling as similar to 3(0.8t) for 10(-2) precision) for any number of pi/8 gates to full precision.

TI Variational quantum algorithms
SO NATURE REVIEWS PHYSICS
AB Applications such as simulating complicated quantum systems or solving large-scale linear algebra problems are very challenging for classical computers, owing to the extremely high computational cost. Quantum computers promise a solution, although fault-tolerant quantum computers will probably not be available in the near future. Current quantum devices have serious constraints, including limited numbers of qubits and noise processes that limit circuit depth. Variational quantum algorithms (VQAs), which use a classical optimizer to train a parameterized quantum circuit, have emerged as a leading strategy to address these constraints. VQAs have now been proposed for essentially all applications that researchers have envisaged for quantum computers, and they appear to be the best hope for obtaining quantum advantage. Nevertheless, challenges remain, including the trainability, accuracy and efficiency of VQAs. Here we overview the field of VQAs, discuss strategies to overcome their challenges and highlight the exciting prospects for using them to obtain quantum advantage.
   The advent of commercial quantum devices has ushered in the era of near-term quantum computing. Variational quantum algorithms are promising candidates to make use of these devices for achieving a practical quantum advantage over classical computers.

TI With a Few Square Roots, Quantum Computing Is as Easy as Pi
SO PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACM ON PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES-PACMPL
AB Rig groupoids provide a semantic model of., a universal classical reversible programming language over finite types. We prove that extending rig groupoids with just two maps and three equations about them results in a model of quantum computing that is computationally universal and equationally sound and complete for a variety of gate sets. The first map corresponds to an 8th root of the identity morphism on the unit 1. The second map corresponds to a square root of the symmetry on 1 + 1. As square roots are generally not unique and can sometimes even be trivial, the maps are constrained to satisfy a nondegeneracy axiom, which we relate to the Euler decomposition of the Hadamard gate. The semantic construction is turned into an extension of Pi, called root Pi, that is a computationally universal quantum programming language equipped with an equational theory that is sound and complete with respect to the Clifford gate set, the standard gate set of Clifford+T restricted to <= 2 qubits, and the computationally universal Gaussian Clifford+T gate set.

TI A hybrid quantum computing pipeline for real world drug discovery
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Quantum computing, with its superior computational capabilities compared to classical approaches, holds the potential to revolutionize numerous scientific domains, including pharmaceuticals. However, the application of quantum computing for drug discovery has primarily been limited to proof-of-concept studies, which often fail to capture the intricacies of real-world drug development challenges. In this study, we diverge from conventional investigations by developing a hybrid quantum computing pipeline tailored to address genuine drug design problems. Our approach underscores the application of quantum computation in drug discovery and propels it towards more scalable system. We specifically construct our versatile quantum computing pipeline to address two critical tasks in drug discovery: the precise determination of Gibbs free energy profiles for prodrug activation involving covalent bond cleavage, and the accurate simulation of covalent bond interactions. This work serves as a pioneering effort in benchmarking quantum computing against veritable scenarios encountered in drug design, especially the covalent bonding issue present in both of the case studies, thereby transitioning from theoretical models to tangible applications. Our results demonstrate the potential of a quantum computing pipeline for integration into real world drug design workflows.

TI Experimental quantum homomorphic encryption
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Quantum computers promise not only to outperform classical machines for certain important tasks, but also to preserve privacy of computation. For example, the blind quantum computing protocol enables secure delegated quantum computation, where a client can protect the privacy of their data and algorithms from a quantum server assigned to run the computation. However, this security comes with the practical limitation that the client and server must communicate after each step of computation. A practical alternative is homomorphic encryption, which does not require any interactions, while providing quantum-enhanced data security for a variety of computations. In this scenario, the server specifies the computation to be performed, and the client provides only the input data, thus enabling secure noninteractive computation. Here, we demonstrate homomorphic-encrypted quantum computing with unitary transformations of individual qubits, as well as multi-qubit quantum walk computations using single-photon states and non-birefringent integrated optics. The client encrypts their input in the photons' polarization state, while the server performs the computation using the path degree of freedom. Our demonstration using integrated quantum photonics underlines the applicability of homomorphic-encrypted quantum computations, and shows the potential for delegated quantum computing using photons.

TI Quantum entanglement dynamics of spacetime and matter
SO FUNDAMENTAL RESEARCH
AB It was known long ago that quantum theory and general relativity are in sharp conflict in their foundations. Their fundamental inconsistencies render a consistent theory of quantum gravity the most challenging problem in physics. Here we propose an information-complete quantum field theory (ICQFT), which describes elementary fermions, their gauge fields, and gravity (together, called the trinary fields) as an elementary trinity without any conceptual inconsistency of existing theories. The ICQFT unifies matter and spacetime (gravity) as information via spacetime-matter entanglement, which encodes complete physical predictions of the theory and leads to a compelling solution to the problem of time. We consider two particular forms of spacetime-matter entangled states and their physical consequences. One of them results in a universal relation between entanglement entropy and geometry (area and volume), allowing us to determine the cosmological constant term in the classical Einstein equation. Based on a quantum-information definition of dark energy, our Universe is not strictly holographic. We predict the interior quantum state of a Schwarzschild black hole to be maximally information-complete. As a concrete quantum formulation of gravity coupled with matter, the ICQFT is quantum entanglement dynamics for spacetime and matter and eliminates the conceptual obstacles of existing quantum gravity theory.

TI A Sagnac-based arbitrary time-bin state encoder for quantum
   communication applications
SO EPJ QUANTUM TECHNOLOGY
AB Time-bin encoding of quantum information is highly advantageous for long-distance quantum communication protocols over optical fibres due to its inherent robustness in the channel and the possibility of generating high-dimensional quantum states. The most common implementation of time-bin quantum states using unbalanced interferometers presents challenges in terms of stability and flexibility of operation. In particular, a limited number of states can be generated without modifying the optical scheme. Here we present the implementation of a fully controllable arbitrary time-bin quantum state encoder, which is easily scalable to arbitrary dimensions and time-bin separations. The encoder presents high stability and low quantum bit error rate (QBER) for all the tested repetition rates and time-bin separations, without requiring hardware modifications. We further demonstrate phase randomisation and phase encoding without the need for additional resources.

TI Enhanced quantum channel uncertainty relations by skew information
SO QUANTUM INFORMATION PROCESSING
AB By revisiting the mathematical foundation of the uncertainty relation, skew information-based uncertainty sequences are developed for any two quantum channels. A reinforced version of the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality is adopted to improve the uncertainty relation, and a sampling technique of observables' coordinates is used to offset randomness in the inequality. It is shown that the lower bounds of the uncertainty relations are tighter than some previous studies.

TI Implementing quantum gates using length-3 dynamic quantum walks
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB It is well known that any quantum gate can be decomposed into the universal gate set {T, H, CNOT}, and recent results have shown that each of these gates can be implemented using a dynamic quantum walk, which is a continuous-time quantum walk on a sequence of graphs. This procedure for converting a quantum gate into a dynamic quantum walk, however, can result in long sequences of graphs. To alleviate this, in this paper, we develop a length-3 dynamic quantum walk that implements any single-qubit gate. Furthermore, we extend this result to give length-3 dynamic quantum walks that implement any single-qubit gate controlled by any number of qubits. Using these, we implement Draper's quantum addition circuit, which is based on the quantum Fourier transform, using a dynamic quantum walk.

TI Splitting phonons: Building a platform for linear mechanical quantum
   computing
SO SCIENCE
AB Linear optical quantum computing provides a desirable approach to quantum computing, with only a short list of required computational elements. The similarity between photons and phonons points to the interesting potential for linear mechanical quantum computing using phonons in place of photons. Although single-phonon sources and detectors have been demonstrated, a phononic beam splitter element remains an outstanding requirement. Here we demonstrate such an element, using two superconducting qubits to fully characterize a beam splitter with single phonons. We further use the beam splitter to demonstrate two-phonon interference, a requirement for two-qubit gates in linear computing. This advances a new solid-state system for implementing linear quantum computing, further providing straightforward conversion between itinerant phonons and superconducting qubits.

TI What can quantum information theory offer to quantum chemistry?
SO FARADAY DISCUSSIONS
AB It is the ultimate goal of this work to foster synergy between quantum chemistry and the flourishing field of quantum information theory. For this, we first translate quantum information concepts, such as entanglement and correlation, into the context of quantum chemical systems. In particular, we establish two conceptually distinct perspectives on 'electron correlation', leading to a notion of orbital and particle correlation. We then demonstrate that particle correlation equals total orbital correlation minimized over all orbital bases. Accordingly, particle correlation resembles the minimal, thus intrinsic, complexity of many-electron wave functions, while orbital correlation quantifies their complexity relative to a basis. We illustrate these concepts of intrinsic and extrinsic correlation complexity in molecular systems, which also manifests the crucial link between the two correlation pictures. Our results provide theoretical justification for the long-favored natural orbitals for simplifying electronic structures, and open new pathways for developing more efficient approaches towards the electron correlation problem.
   QIT offers a comprehensive toolbox for electron correlation analysis, and development of new methods for solving the electronic problem. QChem in turn provides a platform to realize quantum technology, and supplies the valuable resource of quantum entanglement in molecules.

TI The quartic Blochnium: an anharmonic quasicharge superconducting qubit
SO QUANTUM
AB The quasicharge superconducting qubit realizes the dual of the transmon and shows strong robustness to flux and charge fluctuations thanks to a very large inductance closed on a Josephson junction. At the same time, a weak anharmonicity of the spectrum is inherited from the parent transmon, that introduces leakage errors and is prone to frequency crowding in multi-qubit setups. We propose a novel design that employs a quartic superinductor and confers a good degree of anharmonicity to the spectrum. The quartic regime is achieved through a properly designed chain of Josephson junction loops that shows minimal quantum fluctuations without introducing a severe dependence on the external fluxes.

TI Flow to Nishimori Universality in Weakly Monitored Quantum Circuits with
   Qubit Loss
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB In circuit-based quantum state preparation, qubit loss and coherent errors are circuit imperfections that imperil the formation of long-range entanglement beyond a certain threshold. The critical theory at the threshold is a continuous entanglement transition known to be described by a (2 + 0)-dimensional nonunitary conformal field theory which, for the two types of imperfections of certain circuits, is described by either percolation or Nishimori criticality, respectively. Here we study the threshold behavior when the two types of errors simultaneously occur and show that, when moving away from the Clifford regime of projective stabilizer measurements, the percolation critical point becomes unstable and the critical theory flows to Nishimori universality. We track this critical renormalization group (RG) crossover flow by mapping out the entanglement phase diagrams, parametrized by the probability and strength of random weak measurements, of two dual protocols preparing surface code or GHZ-class cat states from a parent cluster state via constant-depth circuits. Extensive numerical simulations, using hybrid Gaussian fermion and tensor network/Monte Carlo sampling techniques on systems with more than a million qubits, demonstrate that an infinitesimal deviation from the Clifford regime leads to a sudden, strongly nonmonotonic entanglement growth at the incipient nonunitary RG flow. We argue that spectra of scaling dimensions of both the percolation and Nishimori fixed points exhibit multifractality. For percolation, we provide the exact (nonquadratic) multifractal spectrum of exponents, while for the Nishimori fixed point we show high-precision numerical results for five leading exponents characterizing multifractality.

TI Intercept/resend and translucent attacks on the quantum key distribution
   protocol based on the pre- and post-selection effect
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB We investigate the security against the intercept/resend and translucent attacks on the quantum key distribution protocol based on the pre- and post-selection effect. In 2001, Bub proposed the quantum cryptography scheme, which was an application of the so-called mean king's problem. We evaluate a probability that legitimate users cannot detect eavesdropper's malicious acts for Bub's protocol. We also estimate a probability that the eavesdropper guesses right at the random secret key one of the legitimate users tries to share with the other one. From rigorous mathematical and numerical analyses, we conclude that Bub's protocol is weaker than the Bennett-Brassard protocol of 1984 (BB84) against both the intercept/resend and translucent attacks. Because Bub's protocol uses a two-way quantum channel, the analyses of its security are tough to accomplish. We refer to their technical points accurately in the current paper. For example, we impose some constraints upon the eavesdropper's strategies in order to let their degrees of freedom be small.

TI Hybrid III-V/Silicon Quantum Photonic Device Generating Broadband
   Entangled Photon Pairs
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB The demand for integrated photonic chips combining the generation and manipulation of quantum states of light is steadily increasing, driven by the need for compact and scalable platforms for quantum information technologies. While photonic circuits with diverse functionalities are being developed in different single material platforms, it has become crucial to realize hybrid photonic circuits that harness the advantages of multiple materials while mitigating their respective weaknesses, resulting in enhanced capabilities. Here, we demonstrate a hybrid III-V/silicon quantum photonic device combining the strong second-order nonlinearity and direct band gap of the III-V semiconductor platform with the high maturity and CMOS compatibility of the silicon photonic platform. Our device embeds the spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) of photon pairs into an AlGaAs source and their vertical routing to an adhesively bonded silicon-on-insulator circuitry, within an evanescent coupling scheme managing both polarization states. This enables the on-chip generation of broadband (> 40 nm) telecom photons by type-0 and type- 2 SPDC from the hybrid device, at room temperature and with internal pair generation rates exceeding 10(5) s( - 1 )for both types, while the pump beam is strongly rejected. Two-photon interference with 92% visibility (and up to 99% upon 5-nm spectral filtering) proves the high energy-time entanglement quality of the produced quantum state, thereby enabling a wide range of quantum information applications on chip, within a hybrid architecture compliant with electrical pumping and merging the assets of two mature and highly complementary platforms in view of out-of-the-lab deployment of quantum technologies.

TI BEADS: a canonical visualization of quantum states for applications in
   quantum information processing
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB We introduce a generalized phase-space representation of qubit systems called the BEADS representation which makes it possible to visualize arbitrary quantum states in an intuitive and an easy to grasp way. Our representation is exact, bijective, and general. It bridges the gap between the highly abstract mathematical description of quantum mechanical phenomena and the mission to convey them to non-specialists in terms of meaningful pictures and tangible models. Several levels of simplifications can be chosen, e.g. when using the BEADS representation in the communication of quantum mechanics to the general public. In particular, this visualization has predictive power in contrast to simple metaphors such as Schr & ouml;dinger's cat.

TI Huckel molecular orbital theory on a quantum computer: A scalable
   system-agnostic variational implementation with compact encoding
SO JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS
AB Huckel molecular orbital (HMO) theory provides a semi-empirical treatment of the electronic structure in conjugated pi-electronic systems. A scalable system-agnostic execution of HMO theory on a quantum computer is reported here based on a variational quantum deflation (VQD) algorithm for excited state quantum simulation. A compact encoding scheme is proposed here that provides an exponential advantage over the direct mapping and allows for quantum simulation of the HMO model for systems with up to 2(n) conjugated centers with n qubits. The transformation of the Huckel Hamiltonian to qubit space is achieved by two different strategies: an iterative refinement transformation and the Frobenius-inner-product-based transformation. These methods are tested on a series of linear, cyclic, and hetero-nuclear conjugated pi-electronic systems. The molecular orbital energy levels and wavefunctions from the quantum simulation are in excellent agreement with the exact classical results. However, the higher excited states of large systems are found to suffer from error accumulation in the VQD simulation. This is mitigated by formulating a variant of VQD that exploits the symmetry of the Hamiltonian. This strategy has been successfully demonstrated for the quantum simulation of C(60 )fullerene containing 680 Pauli strings encoded on six qubits. The methods developed in this work are easily adaptable to similar problems of different complexity in other fields of research.

TI Dimension Reduction and Redundancy Removal through Successive Schmidt
   Decompositions
SO APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
AB Quantum computers are believed to have the ability to process huge data sizes, which can be seen in machine learning applications. In these applications, the data, in general, are classical. Therefore, to process them on a quantum computer, there is a need for efficient methods that can be used to map classical data on quantum states in a concise manner. On the other hand, to verify the results of quantum computers and study quantum algorithms, we need to be able to approximate quantum operations into forms that are easier to simulate on classical computers with some errors. Motivated by these needs, in this paper, we study the approximation of matrices and vectors by using their tensor products obtained through successive Schmidt decompositions. We show that data with distributions such as uniform, Poisson, exponential, or similar to these distributions can be approximated by using only a few terms, which can be easily mapped onto quantum circuits. The examples include random data with different distributions, the Gram matrices of iris flower, handwritten digits, 20newsgroup, and labeled faces in the wild. Similarly, some quantum operations, such as quantum Fourier transform and variational quantum circuits with a small depth, may also be approximated with a few terms that are easier to simulate on classical computers. Furthermore, we show how the method can be used to simplify quantum Hamiltonians: In particular, we show the application to randomly generated transverse field Ising model Hamiltonians. The reduced Hamiltonians can be mapped into quantum circuits easily and, therefore, can be simulated more efficiently.

TI Crystalline materials for quantum computing: Semiconductor
   heterostructures and topological insulators exemplars
SO MRS BULLETIN
AB High-purity crystalline solid-state materials play an essential role in various technologies for quantum information processing, from qubits based on spins to topological states. New and improved crystalline materials emerge each year and continue to drive new results in experimental quantum science. This article summarizes the opportunities for a selected class of crystalline materials for qubit technologies based on spins and topological states and the challenges associated with their fabrication. We start by describing semiconductor heterostructures for spin qubits in gate-defined quantum dots and benchmark GaAs, Si, and Ge, the three platforms that demonstrated two-qubit logic. We then examine novel topologically nontrivial materials and structures that might be incorporated into superconducting devices to create topological qubits. We review topological insulator thin films and move onto topological crystalline materials, such as PbSnTe, and its integration with Josephson junctions. We discuss advances in novel and specialized fabrication and characterization techniques to enable these. We conclude by identifying the most promising directions where advances in these material systems will enable progress in qubit technology.

TI Orbital transformations to reduce the 1-norm of the electronic structure
   Hamiltonian for quantum computing applications
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Reducing the complexity of quantum algorithms to treat quantum chemistry problems is essential to demonstrate an eventual quantum advantage of noisy-intermediate scale quantum devices over their classical counterpart. Significant improvements have been made recently to simulate the time-evolution operator U(t) = e(i (H) over cap >t), where (H) over cap is the electronic structure Hamiltonian, or to simulate (H) over cap directly (when written as a linear combination of unitaries) by using block encoding or qubitization techniques. A fundamental measure quantifying the practical implementation complexity of these quantum algorithms is the so-called 1-norm of the qubit representation of the Hamiltonian, which can be reduced by writing the Hamiltonian in factorized or tensor-hypercontracted forms, for instance. In this paper, we investigate the effect of classical preoptimization of the electronic structure Hamiltonian representation, via single-particle basis transformation, on the 1-norm. Specifically, we employ several localization schemes and benchmark the 1-norm of several systems of different sizes (number of atoms and active space sizes). We also derive a formula for the 1-norm as a function of the electronic integrals and use this quantity as a cost function for an orbital-optimization scheme that improves over localization schemes. This paper gives more insights about the importance of the 1-norm in quantum computing for quantum chemistry and provides simple ways of decreasing its value to reduce the complexity of quantum algorithms.

TI Coherent states and unilateral coherence in strengthening entropic
   uncertainty relations
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB In this paper, we examine entropy uncertainty relations in the presence of quantum memory and quantum entanglement for non-orthogonal states constructed from two-qubit coherent states. Our results reveal that for the studied state, the entropy uncertainty relations under quantum memory conditions remain tight across a broad range of parameters, leading to lower error rates and higher precision in observable predictions. We explicitly demonstrate that in the presence of quantum memory, the ability to predict observables is fundamentally tied to entanglement. Stronger entanglement leads to reduced entropy uncertainty and greater predictive accuracy. On the other hand, as entanglement weakens, even though the uncertainty relations remain tight, prediction errors increase accordingly. In the maximum entanglement state, the accuracy of the predictions is also maximized. As the entanglement decreases, despite the tightening of the uncertainty relations, the accuracy of the predictions decreases. The prediction accuracy is fully proportional to the amount of entanglement, and it is possible to achieve the desired minimum entropy uncertainty and high correlation according to the problem's requirements. This is while the numerical values of the components forming the upper bound of the entropy uncertainty relations are not equal in all cases. With respect to the changes examined from the presented state, quantum correlation, entropy uncertainty, and the components forming the upper bound, regardless of the amount of entanglement, each separately tend to a constant value.

TI Resource-Efficient Decoding of Topological Color Codes via Neural-Guided
   Union-Find Optimization
SO APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
AB Quantum error correction (QEC) is crucial for achieving reliable quantum computation. Among topological QEC codes, color codes can correct bit-flip and phase-flip errors simultaneously, enabling efficient resource utilization. However, existing decoders such as the Union-Find (UF) algorithm exhibit limited accuracy under high noise levels. We propose a hybrid decoding framework that augments a modified UF algorithm-enhanced with a secondary growth strategy-with a lightweight recurrent neural network (RNN). The RNN refines the error chains identified by UF, improving resolution without significantly increasing computational overhead. The simulation results show that our method achieves notable accuracy gains over baseline UF decoding, particularly in high-error regimes, while preserving the near-linear runtime scaling and low memory footprint of UF. At higher physical error rates, RNN-based path optimization improves UF decoding accuracy by approximately 4.7%. The decoding threshold of the color code reaches 0.1365, representing an increase of about 2% compared to UF without RNN optimization. With its simple data structure and low space complexity, the proposed method is well suited for low-latency, resource-constrained quantum computing environments.

   literature review
SO EGYPTIAN INFORMATICS JOURNAL
AB The greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions issue that is directly related to the 13th Sustainable Development Goals; Climate Action has gained attention on a global scale, prompting the utilization of all available technological advancements, including quantum computing. This systematic literature review, employing Kitchenham's method, explores the realm of quantum computing and its application to the pressing issue of GHG emissions. Through a meticulous analysis of scholarly articles, we identify key trends, influential authors, core sources, and relevant affiliations within this research domain. Notably, our findings underscore a robust connection between quantum computing studies and the fields of machine learning and optimization, where various optimization tasks attempt to minimize GHG emissions, predominantly in the Energy and Logistics problem domain using Quantum-inspired Evolutionary Algorithm, Quantum-inspired Swarm Optimization, or Quantum Annealing. An insightful map reveals the emergence of diverse quantum computing implementations for varied tasks, across various domains, providing nuanced perspectives and identifying potential research directions, particularly in optimization and prediction tasks. This study offers a foundational understanding of trends, challenges, and opportunities associated with quantum computing implementation in addressing GHG emissions, contributing to the ongoing establishment of sustainable technology.

TI Proposal for superconducting quantum networks using multioctave
   transduction to lower frequencies
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We propose networking superconducting quantum circuits by transducing their excitations (typically 4-8 GHz) to 200-500 MHz photons for transmission via superconducting cryogenic coaxial cables. This frequency down-conversion reduces transmission losses and, counterintuitively, reduces noise. We introduce a multioctave asymmetrically threaded superconducting quantum interference device circuit capable of the required efficient, high-rate transduction. For a 100-meter cable with Qi = 105 at 10 mK, we theoretically show that our approach achieves single-photon fidelities of 0.962 at 200 MHz versus 0.772 at 8 GHz, and triples the lower bound on quantum channel capacity. This method enables highly efficient networking of superconducting qubits while maintaining high fidelities, combining improved performance with the practical advantages of flexible, compact coaxial cables.

TI One-Step Implementation of Time-Optimal Three-Qubit Nonadiabatic
   Holonomic Gates via Dipole-Dipole Interaction in Rydberg Atoms
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB In this study, a one-step scheme is proposed to implement time-optimal three-qubit nonadiabatic holonomic gates using unconventional Rydberg pumping mechanism. The system dynamics of three Rydberg atoms are investigated in the regime of dipole-dipole interaction, which may provide relatively strong interaction strengths. By analyzing the system dynamics of three atoms, an effective three-level interaction Hamiltonian is derived. Based on this, a three-qubit nonadiabatic holonomic gate can be implemented in one step by modulating Rabi frequencies of control pulses on the target atom. The scheme is further optimized using time-optimal control technology based on quantum-brachistochrone formalism, which minimizes the evolution time of the system and mitigates the influence from the environmental decoherence. Numerical simulations results show that the scheme is robust against the Doppler dephasing error, system parameter variations, and atomic spontaneous emissions. Therefore, it is hoped that the scheme may facilitate the realization of fault-tolerant quantum computation in Rydberg atoms.

AB The unbreakable security and higher data rates offered by quantum communication networks have made quantum communication an inevitable necessity of the future. Many quantum communication frameworks, such as quantum key distribution and super dense coding, require entangled pairs to be shared between the source and destination nodes. Communication nodes in quantum networks have a minimum fidelity requirement for the entangled pairs. If the fidelity requirement is not satisfied, the entangled pairs may not be used for the desired operations. Successful sharing of the entangled pairs between the nodes is a crucial step in making quantum communication practical. In this work, we propose a framework to maximize entanglement sharing between a source and multiple destination nodes in a fair manner. We consider a system that takes advantage of the purification process to improve the fidelity of the entangled pairs when necessary. The proposed solution framework provides the optimal number of entangled pairs required for the purification process and the optimal transmission rate at the source node to achieve the desired system objective. The non-convex problem is first transformed into a convex form, and then a Lagrangian dual-based framework is proposed to find the optimal solution values. Moreover, to optimize the number of entangled pairs for purification at each link, we derive a closed-form expression that provides the optimal value in a single step. Selected simulation results demonstrate that the proposed framework exhibits excellent performance.

TI Estimating quantum steering and Bell nonlocality through quantum
   entanglement in two-photon systems
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Quantum entanglement, quantum steering and Bell nonlocality, as significant quantum resources in the field of quantum intimation science, can achieve variously valuable quantum information tasks. Among of them, quantum entanglement and Bell nonlocality are the weakest and strongest nonlocal correlations, respectively. One can capture the quantum steering and Bell nonlocality via violating steering inequality and Bell inequality, respectively. In general, the detections of quantum steering and Bell nonlocality are strictly harder than entanglement detection. Here, based on steering inequality test and quantum state tomography, we attain various nonlocal correlations and experimentally demonstrate that the estimations of quantum steering and Bell nonlocality can be realized according to the quantum entanglement of the prepared two-photon test states. The estimated efficiency of quantum steering is stronger than the one of Bell nonlocality in this scenario, i.e., more steerable two-photon test states can be verified through quantum entanglement. In addition, quantum steering and Bell nonlocality are bounded by the corresponding upper and lower bounds, and these bounds cannot be punctured by all prepared two-photon states in experiment. These results are conducive to understand the relations among these nonlocal correlations. (C) 2021 Optical Society of America under the terms of the OSA Open Access Publishing Agreement

AB We propose a linear optical quantum computation scheme using time-frequency degrees of freedom. In this scheme, a qubit is encoded in single-photon frequency combs, and manipulation of the qubits is performed using time-resolving detectors, beam splitters, and optical interleavers. This scheme does not require active devices such as high-speed switches and electro-optic modulators and is robust against temporal and spectral errors, which are mainly caused by the detectors' finite resolution. We show that current technologies almost meet the requirements for fault-tolerant quantum computation.

The availability of memory qubits and deterministic entangling gates enables interactive protocols without postselection -key requirements for any scalable blind server, which previous realizations could not provide.

TI Rabi-Robustness Multiqubit Geometric Gate with Rydberg Atoms
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB Due to the limitation of quantum resources, direct synthesis of a multiqubit logic gate can significantly improve the efficiency of practical quantum information processing. In this article, an enhanced-robustness gate scheme is proposed to implement three-qubit controlled gates, i.e., C2U and CU2, by using resonant dipole-dipole exchange interaction-induced adiabatic evolutions along with the dark state dynamics and super-robust pulse sequences in Rydberg atoms. Such a gate scheme can execute arbitrary single-qubit operations on the target qubit with pure geometric phase and is especially suitable for the case where the decoherence is not very obvious. Taking C2NOT and CNOT2 as typical examples, various experimental imperfections are studied, including the Doppler effect, spontaneous emission of the intermediate state, laser phase noise, and fluctuations of interaction and external fields. Therefore, with the increasing demand for multiqubit gates, the proposal provides a more promising alternative for future fault-tolerant and scalable quantum computation.

TI A Survey and Comparison of Post-Quantum and Quantum Blockchains
SO IEEE COMMUNICATIONS SURVEYS AND TUTORIALS
AB Blockchains have gained substantial attention from academia and industry for their ability to facilitate decentralized trust and communications. However, the rapid progress of quantum computing poses a significant threat to the security of existing blockchain technologies. Notably, the emergence of Shor's and Grover's algorithms raises concerns regarding the compromise of the cryptographic systems underlying blockchains. Consequently, it is essential to develop methods that reinforce blockchain technology against quantum attacks. In response to this challenge, two distinct approaches have been proposed. The first approach involves post-quantum blockchains, which aim to utilize classical cryptographic algorithms resilient to quantum attacks. The second approach explores quantum blockchains, which leverage the power of quantum computers and networks to rebuild the foundations of blockchains. This paper aims to provide a comprehensive overview and comparison of post-quantum and quantum blockchains while exploring open questions and remaining challenges in these domains. It offers an in-depth introduction, examines differences in blockchain structure, security, privacy, and other key factors, and concludes by discussing current research trends.

TI Hybrid quantum communication protocol for fiber and atmosphere channel
SO NANOSYSTEMS-PHYSICS CHEMISTRY MATHEMATICS
AB In this paper, we explore a hybrid quantum communication protocol that operates concurrently over fiber optic and atmospheric channels. This new protocol addresses challenges in urban settings where laying optical fiber may be impractical or costly. By integrating the subcarrier wave (SCW) quantum key distribution (QKD) with phase coding, our approach enhances the flexibility and reliability of quantum communication systems. We have developed and tested an atmospheric optical module equipped with an auto-tuning system to ensure precise optical axis alignment, crucial for minimizing signal loss in turbulent environments. Experimental results demonstrate stable sifted key rates and low quantum bit error rate (QBER) across various channel lengths, confirming the efficacy of our hybrid protocol in securing communication over diverse transmission environments.

TI Fully quantum algorithm for mesoscale fluid simulations with application
   to partial differential equations
SO AVS QUANTUM SCIENCE
AB Fluid flow simulations marshal our most powerful computational resources. In many cases, even this is not enough. Quantum computers provide an opportunity to speed up traditional algorithms for flow simulations. We show that lattice-based mesoscale numerical methods can be executed as efficient quantum algorithms due to their statistical features. This approach revises a quantum algorithm for lattice gas automata to reduce classical computations and state preparation at every time step. For this, the algorithm approximates the qubit relative phases and subtracts them at the end of each time step. Phases are evaluated using the iterative phase estimation algorithm and subtracted using single-qubit rotation phase gates. This method optimizes the quantum resource required and makes it more appropriate for near-term quantum hardware. We also demonstrate how the checkerboard deficiency that the D1Q2 scheme presents can be resolved using the D1Q3 scheme. The algorithm is validated by simulating two canonical partial differential equations: the diffusion and Burgers' equations on different quantum simulators. We find good agreement between quantum simulations and classical solutions for the presented algorithm.

TI A randomized transformation for data processing on quantum computers
SO QUANTUM MACHINE INTELLIGENCE
AB Quantum state preparation circuits for loading classical data into quantum computers significantly influence the performance and complexity of variational quantum algorithms within hybrid quantum-classical systems. Since real-world data is often high-dimensional and mapping it to a quantum state is costly and non-trivial, it is transformed on classical computers to overcome limitations regarding quantum register size and circuit complexity. We present a data transformation method using Bloom filters to represent classical data for quantum state preparation circuits. Further, the paper illustrates that tiny fragments of this classical data encoding can be used for quantum machine learning to make an ensemble of the resulting quantum models surprisingly powerful. Due to the representation of the transformed data as a fragmented bit array, the quantum state preparation circuit only relies on a single rotational gate per qubit and small quantum registers. We demonstrate our approach and its representation power in a series of simulations. The simulations indicate that the randomized transformation provides diversity for ensemble models and that even small bit arrays with high error rates in data representation are sufficient for binary classification tasks.

SO INFORMATION
AB We present two propositions and a theorem to establish a foundational framework for a novel perspective on quantum information framed in terms of differential geometry and topology. In particular, we show that the mapping to S0 naturally encodes the binary outcomes of entangled quantum states, providing a minimal yet powerful abstraction of quantum duality. Building on this, we introduce the concept of a discrete fiber bundle to represent quantum steering and correlations, where each fiber corresponds to the two possible measurement outcomes of entangled qubits. This construction offers a new topological viewpoint on quantum information, distinct from traditional Hilbert-space or metric-based approaches. The present work serves as a preliminary formulation of this framework, with further developments to follow.

The contribution of the work is in formulating penalty functions that ensure the ground state of the QUBO Hamiltonian corresponds to valid solutions that split the input subsets. This approach scales linearly in terms of the number of logical qubits relative to problem size.

TI Quantum computing algorithms: getting closer to critical problems in
   computational biology
SO BRIEFINGS IN BIOINFORMATICS
AB The recent biotechnological progress has allowed life scientists and physicians to access an unprecedented, massive amount of data at all levels (molecular, supramolecular, cellular and so on) of biological complexity. So far, mostly classical computational efforts have been dedicated to the simulation, prediction or de novo design of biomolecules, in order to improve the understanding of their function or to develop novel therapeutics. At a higher level of complexity, the progress of omics disciplines (genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics and metabolomics) has prompted researchers to develop informatics means to describe and annotate new biomolecules identified with a resolution down to the single cell, but also with a high-throughput speed. Machine learning approaches have been implemented to both the modelling studies and the handling of biomedical data. Quantum computing (QC) approaches hold the promise to resolve, speed up or refine the analysis of a wide range of these computational problems. Here, we review and comment on recently developed QC algorithms for biocomputing, with a particular focus on multi-scale modelling and genomic analyses. Indeed, differently from other computational approaches such as protein structure prediction, these problems have been shown to be adequately mapped onto quantum architectures, the main limit for their immediate use being the number of qubits and decoherence effects in the available quantum machines. Possible advantages over the classical counterparts are highlighted, along with a description of some hybrid classical/quantum approaches, which could be the closest to be realistically applied in biocomputation.

TI Complete description of fault-tolerant quantum gate operations for
   topological Majorana qubit systems
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Among the list of major threats to quantum computation, quantum decoherence poses one of the largest because it generates losses to the environment within a computational system which cannot be recovered via error correction methods. These methods require the assumption that the environmental interaction forces the qubit state into some linear combination of qubit eigenstates. In reality, the environment causes the qubit to enter into a mixed state where the original is no longer recoverable. A promising solution to this problem bases the computational states on the low lying energy excitations within topological materials. The existence of these states is protected by a global parameter within the Hamiltonian which prevents the computational states from coupling locally and decohering. In this paper, the qubit is based on nonlocal, topological Majorana fermions (MF), and the gate operations are generated by swapping or braiding the positions of said MF. The algorithmic calculation for such gate operations is well known, but, the opposite gates-to-braid calculation is currently underdeveloped. Additionally, because one may choose from a number of different possible qubit definitions, the resultant gate operations from calculation to calculation appear different. Here, the calculations for the twoand four-MF cases are recapitulated for the sake of logical flow. This set of gates serves as the foundation for the understanding and construction of the six-MF cases. Using these, a full characterization of the system is made by completely generalizing the list of gates and transformations between possible qubit definitions. A complete description of this system is desirable and will hopefully serve future iterations of topological qubits.

TI Assessing Quantum Computing Performance for Energy Optimization in a
   Prosumer Community
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SMART GRID
AB The efficient management of energy communities relies on the solution of the "prosumer problem", i.e., the problem of scheduling the household loads on the basis of the user needs, the electricity prices, and the availability of local renewable energy, with the aim of reducing costs and energy waste. Quantum computers can offer a significant breakthrough in treating this problem thanks to the intrinsic parallel nature of quantum operations. The most promising approach is to devise variational hybrid algorithms, in which quantum computation is driven by parameters that are optimized classically, in a cycle that aims at finding the best solution with a significant speed-up with respect to classical approaches. This paper provides a reformulation of the prosumer problem, allowing to address it with a hybrid quantum algorithm, namely, Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA), and with a recent variant, the Recursive QAOA. We report on an extensive set of experiments, on simulators and real quantum hardware, for different problem sizes. Results are encouraging in that Recursive QAOA is able, for problems involving up to 10 qubits, to provide optimal and admissible solutions with good probabilities, while the computation time is nearly independent of the system size.

TI On the Capacity Region of Bipartite and Tripartite Entanglement
   Switching
SO ACM TRANSACTIONS ON MODELING AND PERFORMANCE EVALUATION OF COMPUTING
   SYSTEMS
AB We study a quantum entanglement distribution switch serving a set of users in a star topology with equal-length links. The quantum switch, much like a quantum repeater, can perform entanglement swapping to extend entanglement across longer distances. Additionally, the switch is equipped with entanglement switching logic, enabling it to implement switching policies to better serve the needs of the network. In this work, the function of the switch is to create bipartite or tripartite entangled states among users at the highest possible rates at a fixed ratio. Using Markov chains, we model a set of randomized switching policies. Discovering that some are better than others, we present analytical results for the case where the switch stores one qubit per user, and find that the best policies outperform a time division multiplexing policy for sharing the switch between bipartite and tripartite state generation. This performance improvement decreases as the number of users grows. The model is easily augmented to study the capacity region in the presence of quantum state decoherence and associated cut-off times for qubit storage, obtaining similar results. Moreover, decoherence-associated quantum storage cut-off times appear to have little effect on capacity in our identical-link system. We also study a smaller class of policies when the switch stores two qubits per user.

TI A New Hard Problem for Post-Quantum Cryptography: Q-Problem Primitives
SO MATHEMATICS
AB This article investigates the Q-Problem, a novel theoretical framework for post-quantum cryptography. It aims to redefine cryptographic hardness by moving away from problems with unique solutions toward problems that admit multiple indistinguishable preimages. This shift is motivated by the structural vulnerabilities that quantum algorithms may exploit in traditional formulations. To support this paradigm, we define new cryptographic primitives and security notions, including Q-Indistinguishability, Long-Term Secrecy, and a spectrum of Q-Secrecy levels. The methodology formalizes the Q-Problem as a system of expressions, called Q-expressions, that must satisfy a set of indistinguishability and reduction properties. We also propose a taxonomy of its models, including Connected/Disconnected, Totally/Partly, Fully/Partially Probabilistic, Perfect, and Ideal Q-Problem variants. These models illustrate the versatility across a range of cryptographic settings. By abstracting hardness through indistinguishability rather than solvability, Q-Problem offers a new direction for designing cryptographic protocols resilient to future quantum attacks. This foundational framework provides the foundations for long-term, composable, and structure-aware security in the quantum era.

TI Constrained Device Performance Benchmarking with the Implementation of
   Post-Quantum Cryptography
SO CRYPTOGRAPHY
AB Advances in quantum computers may pose a significant threat to existing public-key encryption methods, which are crucial to the current infrastructure of cyber security. Both RSA and ECDSA, the two most widely used security algorithms today, may be (in principle) solved by the Shor algorithm in polynomial time due to its ability to efficiently solve the discrete logarithm problem, potentially making present infrastructures insecure against a quantum attack. The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) reacted with the post-quantum cryptography (PQC) standardization process to develop and optimize a series of post-quantum algorithms (PQAs) based on difficult mathematical problems that are not susceptible to being solved by Shor's algorithm. Whilst high-powered computers can run these PQAs efficiently, further work is needed to investigate and benchmark the performance of these algorithms on lower-powered (constrained) devices and the ease with which they may be integrated into existing protocols such as TLS. This paper provides quantitative benchmark and handshake performance data for the most recently selected PQAs from NIST, tested on a Raspberry Pi 4 device to simulate today's IoT (Internet of Things) devices, and provides quantitative comparisons with previous benchmarking data on a range of constrained systems. CRYSTALS-Kyber and CRYSTALS-Dilithium are shown to be the most efficient PQAs in the key encapsulation and signature algorithms, respectively, with Falcon providing the optimal TLS handshake size.

TI Lightweight FPGA-Based Number-Theoretic Transform for ML-KEM in
   Post-Quantum Cryptography
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB This study introduces a lightweight, energy-efficient Number Theoretic Transform (NTT) implementation tailored for the ML-KEM scheme in post-quantum cryptography. Unlike prior efforts focusing mainly on multipliers and modular reduction, the proposed design emphasizes the address generator, a critical yet often overlooked component. A compact counter-based mechanism integrated with XOR logic and multiplexing eliminates large look-up tables, reduces redundant operations, and ensures efficient memory access for both NTT and INTT. The unified butterfly unit and a LUT-based modular reduction circuit enable multi-cycle modular operations without requiring digital signal processing (DSP) or block RAM (BRAM) resources. The complete architecture occupies only 147 slices and 557 LUTs, achieving very low power consumption. Implemented on a Virtex-7 platform, the design demonstrates up to 88.8% reduction in area, 22% decrease in dynamic power, and a 17.57x improvement in A(2)T efficiency compared with state-of-the-art implementations. These results highlight the significance of optimizing address generation to achieve compact, power-aware accelerators. The architecture's elimination of memory-intensive components and reliance on LUT-based logic make it highly portable and suitable for resource-constrained devices.

TI Scalable universal quantum gates between nitrogen-vacancy centers in
   levitated nanodiamond arrays
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in nanodiamond offer a promising platform for quantum information processing due to their room-temperature spin coherence and optical addressability. However, scalable quantum processors remain limited by the challenge of achieving strong, controllable interactions between distant NV spins. Here, we propose a scalable architecture utilizing optically levitated nanodiamond arrays, where torsional vibrations mediate the coherent coupling between the embedded NV centers. By optimizing the shape of ellipsoidal nanoparticles, we achieve a light-induced coupling strength exceeding 119 kHz between torsional modes of the distant levitated nanodiamonds, which are two orders of magnitude larger than the typical decoherence rates in this system. This strong interaction, combined with magnetic-field-enabled spin-torsion coupling, establishes an effective interaction between the spatially separated NV centers in the distant nanodiamonds. Numerical simulations confirm that dynamic decoupling can suppress both thermal noise and spin dephasing, enabling two-qubit gates with fidelity exceeding 99%. This work provides a foundation for reconfigurable quantum hybrid systems, with potential applications in rotational sensing and programmable quantum processing.

TI Quantum Simulation of Molecular Electronic States with a Transcorrelated
   Hamiltonian: Higher Accuracy with Fewer Qubits
SO JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL THEORY AND COMPUTATION
AB Simulation of electronic structure is one of the most promising applications on noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) era devices. However, NISQ devices suffer from a number of challenges like limited qubit connectivity, short coherence times, and sizable gate error rates. Thus, desired quantum algorithms should require shallow circuit depths and low qubit counts to take advantage of these devices. Here, we attempt to reduce quantum resource requirements for molecular simulations on a quantum computer while maintaining the desired accuracy with the help of classical quantum chemical theories of canonical transformation and explicit correlation. In this work, compact ab initio Hamiltonians are generated classically, in the second quantized form, through an approximate similarity transformation of the Hamiltonian with (a) an explicitly correlated two-body unitary operator with generalized pair excitations that remove the Coulombic electron-electron singularities from the Hamiltonian and (b) a unitary one-body operator to efficiently capture the orbital relaxation effects required for accurate description of the excited states. The resulting transcorrelated Hamiltonians are able to describe both the ground and the excited states of molecular systems in a balanced manner. Using the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) method based on the unitary coupled cluster with singles and doubles (UCCSD) ansatz and only a minimal basis set (ANO-RCC-MB), we demonstrate that the transcorrelated Hamiltonians can produce ground state energies comparable to the reference CCSD energies with the much larger cc-pVTZ basis set. This leads to a reduction in the number of required CNOT gates by more than 3 orders of magnitude for the chemical species studied in this work. Furthermore, using the quantum equation of motion (qEOM) formalism in conjunction with the transcorrelated Hamiltonian, we are able to reduce the deviations in the excitation energies from the reference EOM-CCSD/cc-pVTZ values by an order of magnitude. The transcorrelated Hamiltonians developed here are Hermitian and contain only one-and two-body interaction terms and thus can be easily combined with any quantum algorithm for accurate electronic structure simulations.

TI ArtA: automating Design Space Exploration of spin-qubit architectures
SO QUANTUM INFORMATION PROCESSING
AB In the fast-paced field of quantum computing, identifying the architectural characteristics that will enable quantum processors to achieve high performance across a diverse range of quantum algorithms continues to pose a significant challenge. Given the extensive and costly nature of experimentally testing different designs, this paper introduces the first Design Space Exploration (DSE) for quantum-dot spin-qubit architectures. Utilizing the upgraded SpinQ compilation framework, this study explores a substantial design space comprising 29,312 spin-qubit-based architectures and applies an innovative optimization tool, ArtA (Artificial Architect), to speed up the design space traversal. ArtA can leverage 17 optimization configurations, significantly reducing exploration times by up to 99.1% compared to a traditional brute force approach while maintaining the same result quality. After a comprehensive evaluation of best-matching optimization configurations per quantum circuit, ArtA suggests specific as well as universal architectural features that provide optimal performance across the examined circuits. Our work demonstrates that combining DSE methodologies with optimization algorithms can be effectively used to generate meaningful design insights for quantum processor development.

In this paper, we give a brief overview of the current state of quantum computing by highlighting challenges it poses and opportunities it offers to the NHEP community. Noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) computers, while limited by imperfections and small scale, may hold promise for near-term quantum advantages when coupled with co-designed quantum algorithms and special-purpose quantum processing units (QPUs). We explore various applications in NHEP, including quantum simulation, event classification, and real-time experiment control, emphasising the potential of variational quantum circuits and related techniques. To identify current interests of the community, we perform an analysis of recent literature in NHEP related to QC.

   computing and artificial intelligence-based quantum hybrid models
SO JOURNAL OF SUPERCOMPUTING
AB This study examines how quantum computing, quantum algorithms, and AI-quantum hybrid models enhance logistics efficiency and sustainability in e-commerce. Logistics optimization is analyzed to improve routing, scheduling, and resource allocation. The mixed-method design combines a cross-sectional survey of professionals with semi-structured interviews. Quantitative data were analyzed using structural equation modeling in SmartPLS, and qualitative data were thematically assessed. A perception-based analysis examined how professionals perceive quantum-based logistic models compared to traditional AI-driven approaches. Professionals believe that these models can enhance logistics optimization, increasing efficiency and sustainability. Respondents perceived that quantum models could outperform AI-driven approaches, particularly in routing and freight scheduling, but highlighted high implementation costs, limited expertise, and cross-industry collaboration. Logistic optimization mediates the relationship between quantum technology and performance outcomes. This study provides empirical evidence on industry perceptions and strategic guidance for firms considering quantum logistics. Quantum-enabled logistics enhance operational performance and support global sustainability goals. The findings underscore the opportunities and challenges of quantum logistics, offering guidance for research and adoption strategies.

TI Solving an industrially relevant quantum chemistry problem on quantum
   hardware
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Quantum chemical calculations are among the most promising applications for quantum computing. Implementations of dedicated quantum algorithms on available quantum hardware were so far, however, mostly limited to comparatively simple systems without strong correlations. As such, they can also be addressed by classically efficient single-reference methods. Here we calculate the lowest energy eigenvalue of active space Hamiltonians of industrially relevant and strongly correlated metal chelates on trapped ion quantum hardware, and integrate the results into a typical industrial quantum chemical workflow to arrive at chemically meaningful properties. We are able to achieve chemical accuracy by training a variational quantum algorithm on quantum hardware, followed by a classical diagonalization in the subspace of states measured as outputs of the quantum circuit. This approach is particularly measurement-efficient, requiring 600 single-shot measurements per cost function evaluation on a ten qubit system, and allows for efficient post-processing to handle erroneous runs.

TI Enhanced QSVM with elitist non-dominated sorting genetic optimisation
   algorithm for breast cancer diagnosis
SO IET QUANTUM COMMUNICATION
AB Machine learning has emerged as a promising method for predicting breast cancer using quantum computation techniques. Quantum machine learning algorithms, such as quantum support vector machines (QSVMs), are demonstrating superior efficiency and economy in tackling complex problems compared to traditional machine learning methods. When compared with classical support vector machine, the quantum machine produces remarkably accurate results. The suggested quantum SVM model in this study effectively resolved the binary classification problem for diagnosing malignant breast cancer. This work introduces an enhanced approach to breast cancer diagnosis by integrating QSVM with elitist non-dominated sorting genetic optimization (ENSGA), leveraging the strengths of both techniques to achieve more accurate and efficient classification results. ENSGA plays a crucial role in optimising QSVM parameters, ensuring that the model attains the best possible classification accuracy while considering multiple objectives simultaneously. Moreover, the quantum kernel estimation method demonstrated exceptional performance by achieving high accuracy within an impressive execution time of 0.14 in the IBM QSVM simulator. The seamless integration of quantum computation techniques with optimisation strategies such as ENSGA highlights the potential of quantum machine learning in revolutionising the field of healthcare, particularly in the domain of breast cancer diagnosis.
   The work presented here focuses on quantum machine learning and related studies. This article focuses on elitist non-dominated sorting genetic optimization algorithm for efficient breast cancer diagnosis. image

TI A new entropic quantum correlation measure for adversarial systems
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Quantum correlation often refers to correlations exhibited by two or more local subsystems under a suitable measurement. These correlations are beyond the framework of classical statistics and the associated classical probability distribution. Quantum entanglement is the most well-known of such correlations and plays an important role in quantum information theory. However, there exist non-entangled states that still possess quantum correlations which cannot be described by classical statistics. One such measure that captures these non-classical correlations is discord. Here we introduce a new measure of quantum correlations which we call entropic accord that fits between entanglement and discord. It is defined as the optimised minimax mutual information of the outcome of the projective measurements between two parties. We show a strict hierarchy exists between entanglement, entropic accord and discord for two-qubit states. We study two-qubit states which shows the relationship between the three entropic quantities. In addition to revealing a class of correlations that are distinct from discord and entanglement, the entropic accord measure can be inherently more intuitive in certain contexts.

TI Learning a quantum channel from its steady-state
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB We present a scalable method for learning local quantum channels using local expectation values measured on a single state-their steady state. Our method is inspired by the algorithms for learning local Hamiltonians from their ground states. For it to succeed, the steady state must be non-trivial, and therefore the channel needs to be non-unital. Such non-unital channels are readily implementable on present day quantum computers using mid-circuit measurements or RESET gates. We demonstrate that the full structure of such channels is encoded in their steady states, and can be learned efficiently using only the expectation values of local observables on these states. We emphasize two immediate applications to illustrate our approach: (i) Using engineered dissipative dynamics, we offer a straightforward way to assess the accuracy of a given noise model in a regime where all qubits are actively utilized for a significant duration. (ii) Given a parameterized noise model for the entire system, our method can learn its underlying parameters. We demonstrate both applications using numerical simulations and experimental trials conducted on an IBMQ machine.

TI The ZX-calculus as a language for topological quantum computation
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS A-MATHEMATICAL AND THEORETICAL
AB Unitary fusion categories formalise the algebraic theory of topological quantum computation. These categories come naturally enriched in a subcategory of the category of Hilbert spaces, and by looking at this subcategory, one can identify a collection of generators for implementing quantum computation. We represent such generators for the Fibonacci and Ising models, namely the encoding of qubits and the associated braid group representations, with the ZX-calculus and show that in both cases, the Yang-Baxter equation is directly connected to an important rule in the complete ZX-calculus known as the P-rule, which enables one to interchange the phase gates defined with respect to complementary bases. In the Ising case, this reduces to a familiar rule relating two distinct Euler decompositions of the Hadamard gate as pi/2 Z- and X-phase gates, whereas in the Fibonacci case, we give a previously unconsidered exact solution of the P-rule involving the Golden ratio. We demonstrate the utility of these representations by giving graphical derivations of the single-qubit braid equations for Fibonacci anyons and the single- and two-qubit braid equations for Ising anyons. We furthermore present a fully graphical procedure for simulating and simplifying braids with the ZX-representation of Fibonacci anyons.

TI Collective unitary evolution with linear optics by Cartan decomposition
SO EPL
AB Unitary operation is an essential step for quantum information processing. We first propose an iterative procedure for decomposing a general unitary operation without resorting to controlled-NOT gate and single-qubit rotation library. Based on the results of decomposition, we design two compact architectures to deterministically implement arbitrary two-qubit polarization-spatial and spatial-polarization collective unitary operations, respectively. The involved linear optical elements are reduced from 25 to 20 and 21 to 20, respectively. Moreover, the parameterized quantum computation can be flexibly manipulated by wave plates and phase shifters. As an application, we construct the specific quantum circuits to realize two-dimensional quantum walk and quantum Fourier transformation. Our schemes are simple and feasible with the current technology. Copyright (C) 2022 EPLA

TI Quantum Coding with Low-Depth Random Circuits
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW X
AB Random quantum circuits have played a central role in establishing the computational advantages of near-term quantum computers over their conventional counterparts. Here, we use ensembles of low-depth random circuits with local connectivity in D >= 1 spatial dimensions to generate quantum error-correcting codes. For random stabilizer codes and the erasure channel, we find strong evidence that a depth OologNTHORN random circuit is necessary and sufficient to converge (with high probability) to zero failure probability for any finite amount below the optimal erasure threshold, set by the channel capacity, for any D. Previous results on random circuits have only shown that O(N-1/D) depth suffices or that O(log(3) N) depth suffices for all-to-all connectivity (D -> 8). We then study the critical behavior of the erasure threshold in the socalled moderate deviation limit, where both the failure probability and the distance to the optimal threshold converge to zero with N. We find that the requisite depth scales like O(logN) only for dimensions D >= 2 and that random circuits require O(root N) depth for D = 1. Finally, we introduce an "expurgation" algorithm that uses quantum measurements to remove logical operators that cause the code to fail by turning them into either additional stabilizers or into gauge operators in a subsystem code. With such targeted measurements, we can achieve sublogarithmic depth in D >= 2 spatial dimensions below capacity without increasing the maximum weight of the check operators. We find that for any rate beneath the capacity, high-performing codes with thousands of logical qubits are achievable with depth 4-8 expurgated random circuits in D = 2 dimensions. These results indicate that finite-rate quantum codes are practically relevant for near-term devices and may significantly reduce the resource requirements to achieve fault tolerance for near-term applications.

AB Qubits on solid state devices could potentially provide the rapid control necessary for developing scalable quantum information processors. Materials innovation and design breakthroughs have increased functionality and coherence of qubits substantially over the past two decades. Here, we show by improving interface between InAs as a semiconductor and Al as a superconductor, one can reliably fabricate voltage-controlled Josephson junction field effect transistor (JJ-FET) that can be used as tunable qubits, resonators, and coupler switches. We find that bandgap engineering is crucial in realizing a two-dimensional electron gas near the surface. In addition, we show how the coupling between the semiconductor layer and the superconducting contacts can affect qubit properties. We present the anharmonicity and coupling strengths from one and two-photon absorption in a quantum two level system fabricated with a JJ-FET. Published under license by AVS.

TI Extending NMR Quantum Computation Systems by Employing Compounds with
   Several Heavy Metals as Qubits
SO MAGNETOCHEMISTRY
AB Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) is a spectroscopic method that can be applied to several areas. Currently, this technique is also being used as an experimental quantum simulator, where nuclear spins are employed as quantum bits or qubits. The present work is devoted to studying heavy metal complexes as possible candidates to act as qubit molecules. Nuclei such Cd-113 Hg-199 Te-125, and Se-77 assembled with the most common employed nuclei in NMR-QIP implementations (H-1, C-13, F-19, Si-29, and P-31) could potentially be used in heteronuclear systems for NMR-QIP implementations. Hence, aiming to contribute to the development of future scalable heteronuclear spin systems, we specially designed four complexes, based on the auspicious qubit systems proposed in our previous work, which will be explored by quantum chemical calculations of their NMR parameters and proposed as suitable qubit molecules. Chemical shifts and spin-spin coupling constants in four complexes were examined using the spin-orbit zeroth-order regular approximation (ZORA) at the density functional theory (DFT) level, as well as the relaxation parameters (T-1 and T-2). Examining the required spectral properties of NMR-QIP, all the designed complexes were found to be promising candidates for qubit molecules.

TI Quantum annealing for enhanced feature selection in single-cell RNA
   sequencing data analysis
SO QUANTUM MACHINE INTELLIGENCE
AB Feature selection is a machine learning technique for identifying relevant variables in classification and regression models. In single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data analysis, feature selection is used to identify relevant genes that are crucial for understanding cellular processes. Traditional feature selection methods often struggle with the complexity of scRNA-seq data and suffer from interpretation difficulties. Quantum annealing presents a promising alternative approach. In this study, we implement quantum annealing-empowered quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) for feature selection in scRNA-seq data. Using data from a human cell differentiation system and an anticancer drug resistance study, we demonstrate that QUBO feature selection effectively identifies genes whose expression patterns reflect critical cell state transitions associated with differentiation and drug resistance development. Our findings indicate that quantum annealing-powered QUBO reveals complex gene expression patterns potentially missed by traditional methods, thereby enhancing scRNA-seq data analysis and interpretation.

TI Gate-Based Quantum Simulation of Gaussian Bosonic Circuits on
   Exponentially Many Modes
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB We introduce a framework for simulating, on an (n & thorn; 1)-qubit quantum computer, the action of a Gaussian bosonic (GB) circuit on a state over 2nmodes. Specifically, we encode the initial bosonic state's expectation values over quadrature operators (and their covariance matrix) as an input qubit state. This is then evolved by a quantum circuit that effectively implements the symplectic propagators induced by the GB gates. We find families of GB circuits and initial states leading to efficient quantum simulations. For this purpose, we introduce a dictionary that maps between GB and qubit gates such that particle- (nonparticle-) preserving GB gates lead to real- (imaginary-) time evolutions at the qubit level. For the special case of particle-preserving circuits, we present a bounded-error-quantum-polynomial time (BQP)-complete GB decision problem, indicating that GB evolutions of Gaussian states on exponentially many modes are as powerful as universal quantum computers. We also perform numerical simulations of an interferometer on similar to 8 x 109 modes, illustrating the power of our framework.

TI Entanglement in a qubit-qubit-tardigrade system
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB Quantum and biological systems are seldom discussed together as they seemingly demand opposing conditions. Life is complex, "hot and wet' whereas quantum objects are small, cold and well controlled. Here, we overcome this barrier with a tardigrade-a microscopic multicellular organism known to tolerate extreme physicochemical conditions via a latent state of life known as cryptobiosis. We observe coupling between the animal in cryptobiosis and a superconducting quantum bit and prepare a highly entangled state between this combined system and another qubit. The tomographic data shows entanglement in the qubit-qubit-tardigrade system, with the tardigrade modelled as an ensemble of harmonic oscillators or collection of electric dipoles. The animal is then observed to return to its active form after 420 h at sub 10 mK temperatures and pressures below 6 x 10(-6) mbar, setting a new record for the conditions that a complex form of life can survive.

TI High-rate continuous-variable measurement device-independent quantum key
   distribution with finite-size security
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Building scalable and secure quantum networks requires advanced quantum key distribution (QKD) protocols that support multi-user connectivity. Continuous-variable (CV) measurement-device-independent (MDI) QKD, which eliminates all detector side-channel attacks, is a promising candidate for creating various quantum network topologies-such as quantum access networks and star-type topologies-using standard technology and providing high secure key rates. However, its security has so far only been experimentally demonstrated in asymptotic regimes with limited secret key rates and complex experimental setups, limiting its practical applications. Here, we report an experimental validation of a CV MDI-QKD system, achieving a secure key rate of 2.6 Mbit s-1 against collective attacks in the finite-size regime over a 10 km fiber link. This is achieved using a new system design, incorporating a locally generated local oscillator, a new relay structure, a real-time phase locking system, and a well-designed digital-signal-processing pipeline for quantum state preparation and CV Bell measurements at a symbol rate of 20 MBaud. Our results set a new benchmark for secure key exchange and open the possibility of establishing high-performance CV MDI-QKD networks, paving the way toward a scalable quantum network.

TI Quantum squeezing-induced quantum entanglement and EPR steering in a
   coupled optomechanical system
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB We propose a theoretical project in which quantum squeezing induces quantum entanglement and Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen steering in a coupled whispering-gallery-mode optomechanical system. Through pumping the x(2)-nonlinear resonator with the phase matching condition, the generated squeezed resonator mode and the mechanical mode of the optomechanical resonator can generate strong quantum entanglement and EPR steering, where the squeezing of the nonlinear resonator plays the vital role. The transitions from zero entanglement to strong entanglement and one-way steering to two-way steering can be realized by adjusting the system parameters appropriately. The photon-photon entanglement and steering between the two resonators can also be obtained by deducing the amplitude of the driving laser. Our project does not need an extraordinarily squeezed field, and it is convenient to manipulate and provides a novel and flexible avenue for diverse applications in quantum technology dependent on both optomechanical and photon-photon entanglement and steering.

TI Simulating groundstate and dynamical quantum phase transitions on a
   superconducting quantum computer
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Strongly correlated condensed matter systems are among those for which quantum simulation should be able to give an advantage. Here, the authors use a translationally invariant tensor network technique to simulate a quantum critical system on a superconducting quantum processor.
   The phenomena of quantum criticality underlie many novel collective phenomena found in condensed matter systems. They present a challenge for classical and quantum simulation, in part because of diverging correlation lengths and consequently strong finite-size effects. Tensor network techniques that work directly in the thermodynamic limit can negotiate some of these difficulties. Here, we optimise a translationally invariant, sequential quantum circuit on a superconducting quantum device to simulate the groundstate of the quantum Ising model through its quantum critical point. We further demonstrate how the dynamical quantum critical point found in quenches of this model across its quantum critical point can be simulated. Our approach avoids finite-size scaling effects by using sequential quantum circuits inspired by infinite matrix product states. We provide efficient circuits and a variety of error mitigation strategies to implement, optimise and time-evolve these states.

Then we utilize the Hadamard test and the linear combination of unitaries based methods to compute the expectation values. We apply these methods to calculate the electric quadrupole moment of the deuteron. The results are compared for the Jordan-Wigner transformation and Gray code encoding. We discuss the versatility of our approach that can be utilized in general to calculate several observables on a quantum computer.

TI Quantum multi-programming for Grover's search
SO QUANTUM INFORMATION PROCESSING
AB Quantum multi-programming is a method utilizing contemporary noisy intermediate-scale quantum computers by executing multiple quantum circuits concurrently. Despite early research on it, the research remains on quantum gates or small-size quantum algorithms without correlation. In this paper, we propose a quantum multi-programming (QMP) algorithm for Grover's search. Our algorithm decomposes Grover's algorithm by the partial diffusion operator and executes the decomposed circuits in parallel by QMP. We proved that this new algorithm increases the rotation angle of the Grover operator which, as a result, increases the success probability. The new algorithm is implemented on IBM quantum computers and compared with the canonical Grover's algorithm and other variations of Grover's algorithms. The empirical tests validate that our new algorithm outperforms other variations of Grover's algorithms as well as the canonical Grover's algorithm.

TI Time-Efficient Constant-Space-Overhead Fault-Tolerant Quantum
   Computation
SO NATURE PHYSICS
AB Scaling up quantum computers to attain substantial speedups over classical computing requires fault tolerance. Conventionally, protocols for fault-tolerant quantum computation demand excessive space overheads by using many physical qubits for each logical qubit. A more recent protocol using quantum analogues of low-density parity-check codes needs only a constant space overhead that does not grow with the number of logical qubits. However, the overhead in the processing time required to implement this protocol grows polynomially with the number of computational steps. To address these problems, here we introduce an alternative approach to constant-space-overhead fault-tolerant quantum computing using a concatenation of multiple small-size quantum codes rather than a single large-size quantum low-density parity-check code. We develop techniques for concatenating different quantum Hamming codes with growing size. As a result, we construct a low-overhead protocol to achieve constant space overhead and only quasi-polylogarithmic time overhead simultaneously. Our protocol is fault tolerant even if a decoder has a non-constant runtime, unlike the existing constant-space-overhead protocol. This code concatenation approach will make possible a large class of quantum speedups with feasibly bounded space overhead yet negligibly short time overhead.
   Large quantum computers will require error correcting codes, but most proposals have prohibitive requirements for overheads in the number of qubits, processing time or both. A way to combine smaller codes now gives a much more efficient protocol.

TI Native multi-qubit gates in transmon qubits via synchronous driving
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Quantum computation holds the promise of solving computational problems which are believed to be classically intractable. However, in practice, quantum devices are still limited by their relatively short coherence times and imperfect circuit-hardware mapping. In this work, we present the parallelization of pre-calibrated pulses at the hardware level as an easy-to-implement strategy to optimize quantum gates. Focusing on RZX\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$R_{ZX}$$\end{document} gates, we demonstrate that such parallelization leads to improved fidelity and gate time reduction, when compared to serial concatenation. As measured by Cycle Benchmarking and Process Tomography, we reduce gate errors by half. We show that this strategy can be applied to other gates like the CNOT and CZ, and it may benefit tasks such as Hamiltonian simulation problems, amplitude amplification, and error-correction codes.

TI Secure keys data distribution based user-storage-transit server
   authentication process model using mathematical post-quantum
   cryptography methodology
SO NETWORKS AND HETEROGENEOUS MEDIA
AB The central remote servers are essential for storing and processing data for cloud computing evaluation. However, traditional systems need to improve their ability to provide technical data security solutions. Many data security challenges and complexities await technical solutions in today's fast-growing technology. These complexities will not be resolved by combining all secure encryption techniques. Quantum computing efficiently evolves composite algorithms, allowing for natural advances in cyber security, forensics, artificial intelligence, and machine learning-based complex systems. It also demonstrates solutions to many challenging problems in cloud computing security. This study proposes a user-storage-transit-server authentication process model based on secure keys data distribution and mathematical post-quantum cryptography methodology. The post-quantum cryptography mathematical algorithm is used in this study to involve the quantum computing-based distribution of security keys. It provides security scenarios and technical options for securing data in transit, storage, user, and server modes. Post-quantum cryptography has defined and included the mathematical algorithm in generating the distributed security key and the data in transit, on-storage, and on-editing. It has involved reversible computations on many different numbers by super positioning the qubits to provide quantum services and other product-based cloud-online access used to process the end-user's artificial intelligence-based hardware service components. This study will help researchers and industry experts prepare specific scenarios for synchronizing data with medicine, finance, engineering, and banking cloud servers. The proposed methodology is implemented with single-tenant, multi-tenant, and cloud-tenant-level servers and a database server. This model is designed for four enterprises with 245 users, and it employs integration parity rules that are implemented using salting techniques. The experimental scenario considers the plain text size ranging from 24 to 8248 for analyzing secure key data distribution, key generation, encryption, and decryption time variations. The key generation and encryption time variations are 2.3233 ms to 8.7277 ms at quantum-level 1 and 0.0355 ms to 1.8491 ms at quantum-level 2. The key generation and decryption time variations are 2.1533 ms to 19.4799 ms at quantum-level 1 and 0.0525 ms to 3.3513 ms at quantum-level 2.

TI Coherence of Microwave and Optical Qubit Levels in Neutral Thulium
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Hyperfine-encoded qubits in alkali atoms have established themselves as robust platforms for quantum computing, while alkaline-earth-like elements expand the state manipulation toolbox through their rich spectrum of optical transitions and metastable states. In this work, we demonstrate that thulium is a viable candidate for quantum computing, combining advantages of hyperfine qubit encoding with a rich energy-level structure of alkaline-earth-like atoms. We describe protocols for the initial state preparation and state-selective readout, and show single-qubit operations on the microwave transition at 1497 MHz. We demonstrate ground-state hyperfine qubit coherence times up to T2 & lowast; = 22+2 resenting record-scale performance for neutral-atom systems. Furthermore, we show operations involving metastable optical states, including shelving for the state-selective readout as well as coherent population transfer of the ground-state qubit with coherence time primarily limited by the metastable level natural lifetime of 112 ms. These results mark the first step toward using thulium for quantum computing applications and highlight its promising characteristics.

TI Quantum Simulation of Bound State Scattering
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB The last few years have seen rapid development of applications of quantum computation to quantum field theory. The first algorithms for quantum simulation of scattering have been proposed in the context of scalar and fermionic theories, requiring thousands of logical qubits. These algorithms are not suitable to simulate scattering of incoming bound states, as the initial -state preparation relies typically on adiabatically transforming wavepackets of the free theory into wavepackets of the interacting theory. In this paper we present a strategy to excite wavepackets of the interacting theory directly from the vacuum of the interacting theory, allowing the preparation of states of composite particles. This is the first step towards digital quantum simulation of scattering of bound states. The approach is based on the Haag-Ruelle scattering theory, which provides a way to construct creation and annihilation operators of a theory in a full, nonperturbative framework. We provide a quantum algorithm requiring a number of ancillary qubits that is logarithmic in the size of the wavepackets, and with a success probability vanishing at most like a polynomial in the lattice parameters and the energy of the wavepacket. The gate complexity for a single iteration of the circuit is equivalent to that of a time evolution for a fixed time. Furthermore, we propose a complete protocol for scattering simulation using this algorithm. We study its efficiency and find improvements with respect to previous algorithms in the literature.

TI Quantum entanglement in the anisotropic Heisenberg model with
   multicomponent DM and KSEA interactions
SO QUANTUM INFORMATION PROCESSING
AB Using group-theoretical approach, we found a family of four nine-parameter quantum states for the two-spin-1/2 Heisenberg system in an external magnetic field and with multiple components of Dzyaloshinsky-Moriya (DM) and Kaplan-Shekhtman-Entin-Wohlman-Aharony (KSEA) interactions. Exact analytical formulas are derived for the entanglement of formation for the quantum states found. The influence of DM and KSEA interactions on the behavior of entanglement and on the shape of disentangled region is studied. A connection between the two-qubit quantum states and the reduced density matrices of many-particle systems is discussed.

TI An efficient quantum algorithm for independent component analysis
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB Independent component analysis (ICA) is a fundamental data processing technique to decompose the captured signals into as independent as possible components. Computing the contrast function, which serves as a measure of the independence of signals, is vital and costs major computing resources in ICA. This paper presents a quantum algorithm that focuses on computing a specified contrast function on a quantum computer. Using the quantum acceleration in matrix operations, we efficiently deal with Gram matrices and estimate the contrast function with the complexity of O(epsilon(-2)(1) poly log(N/epsilon(1))). This estimation subprogram, combined with the classical optimization framework, builds up our ICA algorithm, which exponentially reduces the complexity dependence on the data scale compared with algorithms using only classical computers. The outperformance is further supported by numerical experiments, while our algorithm is then applied for the separation of a transcriptomic dataset and for financial time series forecasting, to predict the Nikkei 225 opening index to show its potential application prospect.

TI Experimental quantum key distribution certified by Bell's theorem
SO NATURE
AB Cryptographic key exchange protocols traditionally rely on computational conjectures such as the hardness of prime factorization(1) to provide security against eavesdropping attacks. Remarkably, quantum key distribution protocols such as the Bennett-Brassard scheme(2) provide information-theoretic security against such attacks, a much stronger form of security unreachable by classical means. However, quantum protocols realized so far are subject to a new class of attacks exploiting a mismatch between the quantum states or measurements implemented and their theoretical modelling, as demonstrated in numerous experiments(3-6). Here we present the experimental realization of a complete quantum key distribution protocol immune to these vulnerabilities, following Ekert's pioneering proposal(7) to use entanglement to bound an adversary's information from Bell's theorem(8). By combining theoretical developments with an improved optical fibre link generating entanglement between two trapped-ion qubits, we obtain 95,628 key bits with device-independent security(9-12) from 1.5 million Bell pairs created during eight hours of run time. We take steps to ensure that information on the measurement results is inaccessible to an eavesdropper. These measurements are performed without space-like separation. Our result shows that provably secure cryptography under general assumptions is possible with real-world devices, and paves the way for further quantum information applications based on the device-independence principle.

TI Grand Unification of Quantum Algorithms
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Quantum algorithms offer significant speed-ups over their classical counterparts for a variety of problems. The strongest arguments for this advantage are borne by algorithms for quantum search, quantum phase estimation, and Hamiltonian simulation, which appear as subroutines for large families of composite quantum algorithms. A number of these quantum algorithms have recently been tied together by a novel technique known as the quantum singular value transformation (QSVT), which enables one to perform a polynomial transformation of the singular values of a linear operator embedded in a unitary matrix. In the seminal GSLW'19 paper on the QSVT [Gilyen et al., ACM STOC 2019], many algorithms are encompassed, including amplitude amplification, methods for the quantum linear systems problem, and quantum simulation. Here, we provide a pedagogical tutorial through these developments, first illustrating how quantum signal processing may be generalized to the quantum eigenvalue transform, from which the QSVT naturally emerges. Paralleling GSLW'19, we then employ the QSVT to construct intuitive quantum algorithms for search, phase estimation, and Hamiltonian simulation, and also showcase algorithms for the eigenvalue threshold problem and matrix inversion. This overview illustrates how the QSVT is a single framework comprising the three major quantum algorithms, suggesting a grand unification of quantum algorithms.

TI An open-source data storage and visualization platform for collaborative
   qubit control
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Developing collaborative research platforms for quantum bit control is crucial for driving innovation in the field, as they enable the exchange of ideas, data, and implementation to achieve more impactful outcomes. Furthermore, considering the high costs associated with quantum experimental setups, collaborative environments are vital for maximizing resource utilization efficiently. However, the lack of dedicated data management platforms presents a significant obstacle to progress, highlighting the necessity for essential assistive tools tailored for this purpose. Current qubit control systems are unable to handle complicated management of extensive calibration data and do not support effectively visualizing intricate quantum experiment outcomes. In this paper, we introduce Qubit Control Storage and Visualization (QubiCSV), a platform specifically designed to meet the demands of quantum computing research, focusing on the storage and analysis of calibration and characterization data in qubit control systems. As an open-source tool, QubiCSV facilitates efficient data management of quantum computing, providing data versioning capabilities for data storage and allowing researchers and programmers to interact with qubits in real time. The insightful visualization are developed to interpret complex quantum experiments and optimize qubit performance. QubiCSV not only streamlines the handling of qubit control system data but also improves the user experience with intuitive visualization features, making it a valuable asset for researchers in the quantum computing domain.

AB Efficient methods for the simulation of quantum circuits on classic computers are crucial for their analysis due to the exponential growth of the problem size with the number of qubits. Here we study lumping methods based on bisimulation, an established class of techniques that has been proven successful for (classic) stochastic and deterministic systems such as Markov chains and ordinary differential equations. Forward constrained bisimulation yields a lower-dimensional model which exactly preserves quantum measurements projected on a linear subspace of interest. Backward constrained bisimulation gives a reduction that is valid on a subspace containing the circuit input, from which the circuit result can be fully recovered. We provide an algorithm to compute the constraint bisimulations yielding coarsest reductions in both cases, using a duality result relating the two notions. As applications, we provide theoretical bounds on the size of the reduced state space for well-known quantum algorithms for search, optimization, and factorization. Using a prototype implementation, we report significant reductions on a set of benchmarks. Furthermore, we show that constraint bisimulation complements state-of-the-art methods for the simulation of quantum circuits based on decision diagrams.

AB Quantum repeaters are necessary to fully realize the capabilities of the emerging quantum internet, especially applications involving distributing entanglement across long distances. A more general notion of this can be called a quantum switch, which connects to many users and can act as a repeater to create end-to-end entanglement between different subsets of these users. Here we present a method of calculating the capacity region of both discrete- and continuous-variable quantum switches that in general support mixed-partite entanglement generation. The method uses tools from convex analysis to generate the boundaries of the capacity region. We show example calculations with illustrative topologies and perform simulations to support the analytical results.

TI Trans-Media Continuous-Variable Quantum Key Distribution via Untrusted
   Entanglement Source
SO IEEE PHOTONICS JOURNAL
AB We propose a continuous-variable quantum key distribution (CVQKD) scheme based on the atmosphere-to-seawater channel. In particular, an untrusted entanglement source (two modes of the compressed vacuum state, TMSV) is deployed on the surface of the seawater, each mode of TMSV is sent to one of the two legitimate parts, respectively. In this way, we can establish a trans-media CVQKD link between the atmosphere and the underwater. Meanwhile, a suitable non-Gaussian operation, namely photon subtraction, is introduced to enhance the performance of the trans-media CVQKD scheme. Security analysis shows that the proposed scheme can establish a trans-media quantum communication system on the atmosphere-to-seawater channel. Moreover, the maximum transmission distance can be further extended by using proper photon subtraction operation. Our scheme provides a guidance for applying CVQKD to trans-media channels.

TI High-dimensional time-frequency entanglement in a singly-filtered
   biphoton frequency comb
SO COMMUNICATIONS PHYSICS
AB High-dimensional quantum entanglement is a cornerstone for advanced technology enabling large-scale noise-tolerant quantum systems, fault-tolerant quantum computing, and distributed quantum networks. The recently developed biphoton frequency comb (BFC) provides a powerful platform for high-dimensional quantum information processing in its spectral and temporal quantum modes. Here we propose and generate a singly-filtered high-dimensional BFC via spontaneous parametric down-conversion by spectrally shaping only the signal photons with a Fabry-Perot cavity. High-dimensional energy-time entanglement is verified through Franson-interference recurrences and temporal correlation with low-jitter detectors. Frequency- and temporal- entanglement of our singly-filtered BFC is then quantified by Schmidt mode decomposition. Subsequently, we distribute the high-dimensional singly-filtered BFC state over a 10 km fiber link with a post-distribution time-bin dimension lower bounded to be at least 168. Our demonstrations of high-dimensional entanglement and entanglement distribution show the singly-filtered quantum frequency comb's capability for high-efficiency quantum information processing and high-capacity quantum networks.

With the emergence of 6G applications where the real-time quality of experience is prioritized, AI-enabled task offloading leverages the benefits of edge computing. Moreover, the execution time of complex applications can be reduced by using quantum computers at the edge or in the cloud. In addition, by incorporating quantum key distribution and post-quantum cryptography, we can ensure the safety of mobile networks in the quantum computing era. Collectively, these technologies will provide ultra-fast and ultra-safe 6G networks, meeting the requirements of challenging real-time applications that were not supported in the previous generations, thus advancing the state of the art of mobile communication networks.

TI Sampling rare conformational transitions with a quantum computer
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Structural rearrangements play a central role in the organization and function of complex biomolecular systems. In principle, Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations enable us to investigate these thermally activated processes with an atomic level of resolution. In practice, an exponentially large fraction of computational resources must be invested to simulate thermal fluctuations in metastable states. Path sampling methods focus the computational power on sampling the rare transitions between states. One of their outstanding limitations is to efficiently generate paths that visit significantly different regions of the conformational space. To overcome this issue, we introduce a new algorithm for MD simulations that integrates machine learning and quantum computing. First, using functional integral methods, we derive a rigorous low-resolution spatially coarse-grained representation of the system's dynamics, based on a small set of molecular configurations explored with machine learning. Then, we use a quantum annealer to sample the transition paths of this low-resolution theory. We provide a proof-of-concept application by simulating a benchmark conformational transition with all-atom resolution on the D-Wave quantum computer. By exploiting the unique features of quantum annealing, we generate uncorrelated trajectories at every iteration, thus addressing one of the challenges of path sampling. Once larger quantum machines will be available, the interplay between quantum and classical resources may emerge as a new paradigm of high-performance scientific computing. In this work, we provide a platform to implement this integrated scheme in the field of molecular simulations.

TI Quantum decoherence of dark pulses in optical microresonators
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Quantum fluctuations disrupt the cyclic motions of dissipative Kerr solitons (DKSs) in nonlinear optical microresonators and consequently cause timing jitter of the emitted pulse trains. This problem is translated to the performance of several applications that employ DKSs as compact frequency comb sources. Recently, device manufacturing and noise reduction technologies have advanced to unveil the quantum properties of DKSs. Here we investigate the quantum decoherence of DKSs existing in normal-dispersion microresonators known as dark pulses. By virtue of the very large material nonlinearity, we directly observe the quantum decoherence of dark pulses in an AlGaAs-on-insulator microresonator, and the underlying dynamical processes are resolved by injecting stochastic photons into the microresonators. Moreover, phase correlation measurements show that the uniformity of comb spacing of quantum-limited dark pulses is better than 1.2 x 10(-16) and 2.5 x 10(-13) when normalized to the optical carrier frequencies and repetition frequencies, respectively. Comparing DKSs generated in different material platforms explicitly confirms the advantages of dark pulses over bright solitons in terms of quantum-limited coherence. Our work establishes a critical performance assessment of DKSs, providing guidelines for coherence engineering of chip-scale optical frequency combs.
   Authors report quantum decoherence of dissipative Kerr solitons in normal-dispersion microresonators, also known as dark pulses. They show the quantum decoherence of dark pulses and their potential advantages over bright solitons in an AlGaAs-on-insulator system.

TI Shortcuts to Adiabaticity in Digitized Adiabatic Quantum Computing
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB Shortcuts to adiabaticity are well-known methods for controlling the quantum dynamics beyond the adiabatic criteria, where counterdiabatic (CD) driving provides a promising means to speed up quantum many-body systems. In this work, we show the applicability of CD driving to enhance the digitized adiabatic quantum computing paradigm in terms of fidelity and total simulation time. We study the state evolution of an Ising spin chain using the digitized version of the standard CD driving and its variants derived from the variational approach. We apply this technique in the preparation of Bell and GreenbergerHorne-Zeilinger states with high fidelity using a very shallow quantum circuit. We implement this proposal on the IBM quantum computer, proving its usefulness for the speed up of adiabatic quantum computing in noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices.

AB This paper generalizes results in noncoherent spacetime block code (STBC) design based on quantum error correction (QEC) to new antenna configurations. Previous work proposed QEC-inspired STBCs for antenna geometries where the number of transmit and receive antennas were equal and a power of two. In this work we extend these results by providing QEC-inspired STBCs applicable to all square antenna geometries and some rectangular geometries where the number of receive antennas is greater than the number of transmit antennas. We derive the maximum-likelihood decoding rule for this family of codes for the special case of Rayleigh fading with additive white Gaussian noise. We present Monte Carlo simulations of the performance of the codes in this environment for a three-antenna square geometry and a three-by-six rectangular geometry. We demonstrate competitive performance for these codes with respect to a popular noncoherent differential code.

TI Quantum algorithms for the generalized eigenvalue problem
SO QUANTUM INFORMATION PROCESSING
AB The generalized eigenvalue (GE) problems are of particular importance in various areas of science engineering and machine learning. We present a variational quantum algorithm for finding the desired generalized eigenvalue of the GE problem, A vertical bar psi  = lambda B vertical bar psi , by choosing suitable loss functions. Our approach imposes the superposition of the trial state and the obtained eigenvectors with respect to the weighting matrix B on the Rayleigh quotient. Furthermore, both the values and derivatives of the loss functions can be calculated on near-term quantum devices with shallow quantum circuit. Finally, we propose a full quantum generalized eigensolver (FQGE) to calculate the minimal generalized eigenvalue with quantum gradient descent algorithm. As a demonstration of the principle, we numerically implement our algorithms to conduct a 2-qubit simulation and successfully find the generalized eigenvalues of the matrix pencil (A, B). The numerically experimental result indicates that FQGE is robust under Gaussian noise.

TI Exploring the quantum capacity of a Gaussian random-displacement channel
   using Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill codes and maximum-likelihood decoding
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Determining the quantum capacity of a noisy quantum channel is an important problem in the field of quantum communication theory. In this work, we consider the Gaussian random-displacement channel N sigma, a type of bosonic Gaussian channels relevant in various bosonic quantum information processing systems. In particular, we attempt to make progress on the problem of determining the quantum capacity of a Gaussian random-displacement channel by analyzing the error-correction performance of several families of multimode Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) codes. In doing so we analyze the surface-square GKP codes using an efficient and exact maximum-likelihood decoder (MLD) up to a large code distance of d = 39. We find that the error threshold of the surface-square GKP code is remarkably close to sigma = 1//e 0.6065 at which the best-known lower bound of the quantum capacity of N sigma vanishes. We also analyze the performance of color-hexagonal GKP codes up to a code distance of d = 13 using a tensor-network decoder serving as an approximate MLD. By focusing on multimode GKP codes that encode just one logical qubit over multiple bosonic modes, we show that GKP codes can achieve nonzero quantum state transmission rates for a Gaussian random-displacement channel N sigma at larger values of sigma than previously demonstrated. Thus, our work reduces the gap between the quantum communication theoretic bounds and the performance of explicit bosonic quantum error-correcting codes in regards to the quantum capacity of a Gaussian random-displacement channel.

TI Satellite-based quantum information networks: use cases, architecture,
   and roadmap
SO COMMUNICATIONS PHYSICS
AB The first generation of global-scale quantum networks are expected to make extensive use of satellite-mediated channels. As a first step towards this goal, this manuscript proposes a full-scale architecture to implement the exchange of quantum information, taking us from use cases through to a detailed plan for the road ahead.
   Quantum Information Networks (QINs) attract increasing interest, as they enable connecting quantum devices over long distances, thus greatly enhancing their intrinsic computing, sensing, and security capabilities. The core mechanism of a QIN is quantum state teleportation, consuming quantum entanglement, which can be seen in this context as a new kind of network resource. Here we identify use cases per activity sector, including key performance targets, as a reference for the network requirements. We then define a high-level architecture of a generic QIN, before focusing on the architecture of the Space segment, with the aim of identifying the main design drivers and critical elements. A survey of the state-of-the-art of these critical elements is presented, as are issues related to standardisation. Finally, we explain our roadmap to developing the first QINs and detail the already concluded first step, the design and numerical simulation of a Space-to-ground entanglement distribution demonstrator.

TI Efficient solution of the non-unitary time-dependent Schródinger
   equation on a quantum computer with complex absorbing potential
SO QUANTUM
AB We explore the possibility of adding complex absorbing potential at the boundaries when solving the one-dimensional real -time Schrodinger evolution on a grid using a quantum computer with a fully quantum algorithm described on a n qubit register. Due to the complex potential, the evolution mixes realand imaginary-time propagation and the wave function can potentially be continuously absorbed during the time propagation. We use the dilation quantum algorithm to treat the imaginary-time evolution in parallel to the real -time propagation. This method has the advantage of using only one reservoir qubit at a time, that is measured with a certain success probability to implement the desired imaginary-time evolution. We propose a specific prescription for the dilation method where the success probability is directly linked to the physical norm of the continuously absorbed state evolving on the mesh. We expect that the proposed prescription will have the advantage of keeping a high probability of success in most physical situations. Applications of the method are made on one-dimensional wave functions evolving on a mesh. Results obtained on a quantum computer identify with those obtained on a classical computer. We finally give a detailed discussion on the complexity of implementing the dilation matrix. Due to the local nature of the potential, for n qubits, the dilation matrix only requires 2n CNOT and 2n unitary rotation for each time step, whereas it would require of the order of 4n+1 C -NOT gates to implement it using the best known algorithm for general unitary matrices.

TI Universal Phase Correction for Quantum State Transfer in One-Dimensional
   Topological Spin Chains
SO PHOTONICS
AB Gap-protected topological channels are a promising way to realize robust and high-fidelity state transfer in quantum networks. Although various topological transfer protocols based on the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model or its variants have been proposed, the phase accumulation during the evolution, as an essential aspect, is underestimated. Here, by numerically studying the phase information of quantum state transfer (QST) in one-dimensional (1D) topological spin chains, we uncover a universal phase correction phi 0=(N-1)pi/2 for both adiabatic and diabatic topological schemes. Interestingly, the site-number-dependent phase correction satisfies Z4 symmetry and is equally effective for perfect mirror transmission in spin chains. Our work reveals a universal phase correction in 1D topologically protected QST, which will prompt a reevaluation of the topological protection mechanism in quantum systems.

TI Superconducting routing platform for large-scale integration of quantum
   technologies
SO MATERIALS FOR QUANTUM TECHNOLOGY
AB To reach large-scale quantum computing, three-dimensional integration of scalable qubit arrays and their control electronics in multi-chip assemblies is promising. Within these assemblies, the use of superconducting interconnections, as routing layers, offers interesting perspectives in terms of (1) thermal management to protect the qubits from control electronics self-heating, (2) passive device performance with significant increase of quality factors and (3) density rise of low and high frequency signals thanks to minimal dispersion. We report on the fabrication, using 200 mm silicon wafer technologies, of a multi-layer routing platform designed for the hybridization of spin qubit and control electronics chips. A routing level couples the qubits and the control circuits through one layer of Al0.995Cu0.005 and superconducting layers of TiN, Nb or NbN, connected between them by W-based vias. Wafer-level parametric tests at 300 K validate the yield of these technologies while low temperature electrical measurements in cryostat are used to extract the superconducting properties of the routing layers. Preliminary low temperature radio-frequency characterizations of superconducting passive elements, embedded in these routing levels, are presented.

TI Automatic quantum circuit encoding of a given arbitrary quantum state
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB We introduce an quantum-classical hybrid algorithm, named automatic quantum circuit encoding (AQCE), that is designed to encode an arbitrary quantum state |111) onto an optimal quantum circuit C composed of a finite set of single- and two-qubit quantum gates. The algorithm employs an objective function based on the absolute value of fidelity, F = (0| C dagger|'I'), which is iteratively maximized to construct an optimal quantum circuit C with controlled accuracy. Here, |0) denotes a trivial product state in the computational basis of a quantum computer. The core of this algorithm lies in the sequential determination of an optimal set of two-qubit unitary operators, identified one by one through the singular value decomposition of the fidelity tensor. Once an optimal set of operators is determined, including the location of qubits on which each operator acts, elementary quantum gates are assigned algebraically to these two-qubit unitary operators. Importantly, these procedures are deterministic without assuming any quantum circuit ansatz and therefore eliminate the need for parameter optimization of parametrized quantum gates. Through noiseless numerical simulations, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the AQCE algorithm in encoding ground states of quantum many-body systems, including the spin-1/2 antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model and the spin-1/2 XY model. We also compare these results with quantum circuit encoding employing predefined circuit structures such as Trotter-like and MERA-like circuit ansatze. Furthermore, our algorithm extends to classical data, for instance, classical images represented as quantum states using amplitude encoding. The adaptability enables us to adjust the quantum resource requirement, i.e., the number of qubits, by partitioning classical data into multiple distinct segments. This feature holds potential for near-term applications in quantum machine learning, such as a state preparation of classical data for an input quantum state to be processed. Finally, using a real quantum device provided by IBM Quantum, we experimentally validate that a quantum circuit generated by the AQCE algorithm can indeed reasonably represent the original quantum state.

TI Diamond spin quantum sensing under extreme conditions
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB Extreme conditions, such as ultra-low temperatures, high pressures, and strong magnetic fields, are critical to producing and studying exotic states of matter. To measure physical properties under extreme conditions, the advanced sensing schemes are required. As a promising quantum sensor, the diamond nitrogen-vacancy (NV)center can detect magnetic field, electronic field, pressure, and temperature with high sensitivity. Considering its nanoscale spatial resolution and ultra-wide working range, the diamond quantum sensing can play an important role in frontier studies involving extreme conditions. This paper reviews the spin and optical properties of diamond NV center under extreme conditions, including low temperature, high temperature, zero field, strong magnetic fields, and high pressures. The opportunities and challenges of diamond quantum sensing under extreme conditions are discussed. The basic knowledge of spin-based quantum sensing and its applications under extreme conditions are also covered

TI Quantum optimization algorithm based on multistep quantum computation
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB We present a quantum algorithm for finding the minimum of a function based on multistep quantum computation, and apply the algorithm for solving optimization problems with continuous variables. We construct the state space of the problem by discretizing the variables of the problem, and divide the state space according to the function values of the vectors of the state space. By comparing the function values of the vectors with a series of threshold values in decreasing order, we construct a sequence of Hamiltonians where the search space of a Hamiltonian is nested in that of the previous one. By applying a multistep quantum computation process for finding the ground state of the last Hamiltonian, the optimal vector of the state space of the problem is located in a small search space and can be determined efficiently. One of the most difficult problems in optimization algorithms is that a trial vector is trapped in a deep local minimum while the global minimum is missed, this problem can be alleviated in our algorithm and the run time is proportional to the number of the steps of the algorithm, provided that the reduction rate of the search spaces is polynomial large. We discuss the implementation of the algorithm and test the algorithm for some test functions.

TI Benchmarking Quantum Machine Learning Kernel Training for Classification
   Tasks
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM ENGINEERING
AB Quantum-enhanced machine learning is a rapidly evolving field that aims to leverage the unique properties of quantum mechanics to enhance classical machine learning. However, the practical applicability of these methods remains an open question, particularly beyond the context of specifically crafted toy problems, and given the current limitations of quantum hardware. This study focuses on quantum kernel methods in the context of classification tasks. In particular, it examines the performance of quantum kernel estimation and quantum kernel training (QKT) in connection with two quantum feature mappings, namely, ZZFeatureMap and CovariantFeatureMap. Remarkably, these feature maps have been proposed in the literature under the conjecture of possible near-term quantum advantage and have shown promising performance in ad hoc datasets. This study aims to evaluate their versatility and generalization capabilities in a more general benchmark, encompassing both artificial and established reference datasets. Classical machine learning methods, specifically support vector machines and logistic regression, are also incorporated as baseline comparisons. Experimental results indicate that quantum methods exhibit varying performance across different datasets. Despite outperforming classical methods in ad hoc datasets, mixed results are obtained for the general case among standard classical benchmarks. The experimental data call into question a general added value of applying QKT optimization, for which the additional computational cost does not necessarily translate into improved classification performance. Instead, it is suggested that a careful choice of the quantum feature map in connection with proper hyperparameterization may prove more effective.

TI Signal-Induced Heap Transform-Based QR-Decomposition and Quantum Circuit
   for Implementing 3-Qubit Operations
SO INFORMATION
AB This article presents a novel approach to the decomposition of unitary operations for 3-qubit systems by 28 controlled rotations and no permutations. The QR decomposition is described, which is based on the concept of the discrete signal-induced heap transform (DsiHT) and its quantum analogue. This transform is generated by a given signal and may use different paths, or orders, of processing the data, and, among them, one can find paths that allow one to construct efficient quantum circuits for implementing multi-qubit unitary gates. The case of real unitary matrices is considered. The proposed approach is described in detail, and quantum circuits are presented for computing 3-qubit operations. This approach allowed us to write simple Qiskit codes to implement the decomposition of 3-qubit operations. Examples with quantum circuits for the quantum 3-qubit quantum cosine and Hartley transforms are described.

TI Optical vortex manipulation for topological quantum computation
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB Topological quantum computation based on Majorana bound states may enable new paths to fault-tolerant quantum computing. Several recent experiments have suggested that the vortex cores of topological superconductors, such as iron-based superconductors, may host Majorana bound states at zero energy. However, quantum computation with these zero-energy vortex bound states requires precise and fast manipulation of individual vortices, which is difficult to do in a scalable manner. To address this issue, we propose a control scheme based on local heating via, for example, scanning optical microscopy to braid vortex-bound Majorana zero modes in a two-dimensional topological superconductor. First, we derive the conditions required for transporting a single vortex between two defects in the superconducting material by trapping it with a hot spot generated by local optical heating. Equipped with critical conditions for the vortex motion, we then establish the ideal material properties for vortex braiding and describe how transition errors resulting from finite speed and/or temperature can be minimized. Our work paves the way toward optical or microscopic control of zero-energy vortex bound states in two-dimensional topological superconductors.

TI Characterizing noise correlation and enhancing coherence via qubit
   motion
SO FUNDAMENTAL RESEARCH
AB The identification of spacial noise correlation is of critical importance in developing error-corrected quantum devices, but it has barely been studied so far. In this work, we utilize an effective method called qubit motion, to efficiently determine the noise correlations between any pair of qubits in a 7-qubit superconducting quantum system. The noise correlations between the same pairs of qubits are also investigated when the qubits are at distinct operating frequencies. What???s more, in this multi-qubit system with the presence of noise correlations, we demonstrate the enhancing effect of qubit motion on the coherence of logic qubits, and we propose a Motion-CPMG operation sequence to more efficiently protect the logic state from decoherence, which is experimentally demonstrated to extend the coherence time of logic qubits by nearly one order of magnitude.

TI Time-Marching Quantum Algorithm for Simulation of Nonlinear Lorenz
   Dynamics
SO ENTROPY
AB Simulating nonlinear classical dynamics on a quantum computer is an inherently challenging task due to the linear operator formulation of quantum mechanics. In this work, we provide a systematic approach to alleviate this difficulty by developing an explicit quantum algorithm that implements the time evolution of a second-order time-discretized version of the Lorenz model. The Lorenz model is a celebrated system of nonlinear ordinary differential equations that has been extensively studied in the contexts of climate science, fluid dynamics, and chaos theory. Our algorithm possesses a recursive structure and requires only a linear number of copies of the initial state with respect to the number of integration time-steps. This provides a significant improvement over previous approaches, while preserving the characteristic quantum speed-up in terms of the dimensionality of the underlying differential equations system, which similar time-marching quantum algorithms have previously demonstrated. Notably, by classically implementing the proposed algorithm, we showcase that it accurately captures the structural characteristics of the Lorenz system, reproducing both regular attractors-limit cycles-and the chaotic attractor within the chosen parameter regime.

AB In many leading architectures for quantum computing, it remains to be understood if we can equate single-qubit coherence times measured in isolation, to that of coherence times measured in multi-qubit devices. On a multi-qubit superconducting circuit platform we show an increase in the dephasing rate of a control qubit due to the spontaneous relaxation of spectator qubits coupled to the control qubit. We attribute this increased dephasing to random in time Z-phase kicks on the control qubit due to the interplay between spectator relaxation and the control-spectator ZZ-interaction. We measure the magnitude of this extra dephasing using Ramsey decay experiments, show how it can be corrected via dynamical decoupling pulse sequences, and demonstrate that randomized benchmarking is insensitive to the effect. Our experimental results are supported by a robust theoretical model that captures an arbitrary number of spectator qubits, and gives a simple, intuitive picture for the mechanism behind the enhanced dephasing.

TI Superconducting circuit architecture for digital-analog quantum
   computing
SO EPJ QUANTUM TECHNOLOGY
AB We propose a superconducting circuit architecture suitable for digital-analog quantum computing (DAQC) based on an enhanced NISQ family of nearest-neighbor interactions. DAQC makes a smart use of digital steps (single qubit rotations) and analog blocks (parametrized multiqubit operations) to outperform digital quantum computing algorithms. Our design comprises a chain of superconducting charge qubits coupled by superconducting quantum interference devices (SQUIDs). Using magnetic flux control, we can activate/deactivate exchange interactions, double excitation/de-excitations, and others. As a paradigmatic example, we present an efficient simulation of an l x h fermion lattice (with 2 < l <= h), using only 2(2l + 1)(2) + 24 analog blocks. The proposed architecture design is feasible in current experimental setups for quantum computing with superconducting circuits, opening the door to useful quantum advantage with fewer resources.

TI Quantum data encoding as a distinct abstraction layer in the design of
   quantum circuits
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Complex quantum circuits are constituted by combinations of quantum subroutines. The computation is possible as long as the quantum data encoding is consistent throughout the circuit. Despite its fundamental importance, the formalization of quantum data encoding has never been addressed systematically so far. We formalize the concept of quantum data encoding, namely the format providing a representation of a data set through a quantum state, as a distinct abstract layer with respect to the associated data loading circuit. We survey existing encoding methods and their respective strategies for classical-to-quantum exact and approximate data loading, for the quantum-to-classical extraction of information from states, and for quantum-to-quantum encoding conversion. Next, we show how major quantum algorithms find a natural interpretation in terms of data loading. For instance, the quantum Fourier transform is described as a quantum encoding converter, while the quantum amplitude estimation as an extraction routine. The new conceptual framework is exemplified by considering its application to the simple case of the Bernstein-Vazirani algorithm, and then to quantum-based Monte Carlo simulations, thus showcasing the power of the proposed formalism for the description of complex quantum circuits. Indeed, the approach clarifies the structure of complex quantum circuits and enables their efficient design.

SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB The most well-known tool for studying contextuality in quantum computation is the n-qubit Stabilizer state tableau representation. We provide an extension that not only describes the quantum state but is also outcome deterministic. The extension enables a value assignment to exponentially many Pauli observables, yet it remains quadratic in both memory and computational complexity. Furthermore, we show that the mechanisms employed for contextuality and measurement disturbance are wholly separate. The model will be useful for investigating the role of contextuality in n-qubit quantum computation.

TI Hybrid quantum sensing in diamond
SO FRONTIERS IN PHYSICS
AB Quantum sensing is a quantum technology for ultrasensitive detection, which is particularly useful for sensing weak signals at the nanoscale. Nitrogen vacancy centers in diamond, thanks to their superb quantum coherence under ambient conditions and the stability of the material in extreme and complicated environments, have been demonstrated as promising quantum probes in multi-parameter sensing. Their spin properties make them particularly sensitive to magnetic fields, but they are insensitive to temperature, electric field, pressure, etc., and even immune to some bio-parameters (e.g., pH and glucose concentration). Recently, hybrid quantum sensing has emerged as a promising avenue for further enhancing the capabilities of diamond sensors. Different techniques can potentially improve the sensitivity, range of detectable parameters, and sensing frequencies of diamond sensors. This review provides an overview of hybrid quantum sensing using diamond. We first give a brief introduction to quantum sensing using diamond, and then review various hybrid sensing schemes that have been developed to enhance the sensing capabilities of diamond sensors. Finally, the potential applications and challenges associated with hybrid quantum sensing in diamond are discussed.

TI Rapid preparation of Rydberg superatom W state using superadiabatic
   techniques
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB The W state, as a robust multipartite entangled state, plays an important role in quantum information processing, quantum network construction and quantum computing. In this paper, a three-level ladder-type Rydberg atomic system is placed into a Rydberg blocking sphere to form a superatom. Each superatom has many collective states including just one Rydberg excitation constrained by the Rydberg blockade effect. In the weak cavity field limit, at most one atom can be pumped into excited state, then we can describe the superatom by using a three-level ladder-type system. Afterwards we encode quantum information about the effective energy levels of Rydberg superatoms and propose a fast scheme for preparing the Rydberg superatom W state based on the superadiabatic iterative technique and quantum Zeno dynamics.This scheme can be achieved in only one step by controlling the laser pulses. In this scheme, the superatoms are trapped in spatially separated cavities connected by optical fibers, thereby greatly improving the feasibility of experimental manipulation. A remarkable feature is that it does not need to accurately control experimental parameters and interaction time. Meanwhile, the form of counterdiabatic Hamiltonian is the same as that of the effective Hamiltonian. Through numerical simulations, the fidelity of this scheme can reach 99.94%. Even considering decoherence effects, including atomic spontaneous emission and photon leakage, the fidelity can still exceed 97.5%, thereby further demonstrating the strong robustness of the solution. In addition, the Rabi frequency can be characterized as a linear superposition of Gaussian functions, and this representation significantly alleviates the complexity encountered in practical experiments. Futhermore, we also analyze the influence of parameter fluctuations on the fidelity, and the results show that this scheme is robust against parameter fluctuations. Finally, the present scheme is extended to the case of N Rydberg superatoms, which shows the scalability of our scheme.

TI DARIUS: A Digital Twin to Improve the Performance of Quantum Key
   Distribution
SO JOURNAL OF LIGHTWAVE TECHNOLOGY
AB Polarization encoded Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) is attracting great attention as it generates unlimitedly and unconditionally secure keys for different use cases. Despite its theoretical excellence based on quantum physics, commercial optical devices supporting QKD systems lack precision, which highly limits the final Key Exchange Rate (KER) of the system. Beside optical component imperfections, eavesdropping and unpredicted environmental events occurred in the quantum channel increase quantum Bit Error Rate (qBER), which leads to further KER reduction. In this article, we propose DARIUS, a digital twin for polarization encoded QKD systems that bridges the gap between perfect theoretical QKD systems and real implementations to: i) address optical components' non-ideal behavior; ii) discern eavesdropping from high qBER; and iii) dynamically compensate for environmental events. Taking advantage of DARIUS, even moderate eavesdropping rates can be distinguished from qBER. Moreover, significant improvement in proactive environmental event compensation is achieved, as DARIUS can derive proper optical component tuning.

TI Quantum memory effects in atomic ensembles coupled to photonic cavities
SO AVS QUANTUM SCIENCE
AB This article explores the dynamics of many-body atomic systems symmetrically coupled to Lorentzian photonic cavity systems. Our study reveals interesting dynamical characteristics, including non-zero steady states, super-radiant decay, enhanced energy transfer, and the ability to modulate oscillations in the atomic system by tuning environmental degrees of freedom. We also analyze a configuration consisting of a three-atom chain embedded in a photonic cavity. Similarly, we find a strong enhancement of the energy transfer rate between the two ends of the chain and identified specific initial conditions that lead to significantly reduced dissipation between the two atoms at the end of the chain. Another configuration of interest consists of two symmetrical detuned reservoirs with respect to the atomic system. In the single atom case, we show that it is possible to enhance the decay rate of the system by modulating its reservoir detuning. In contrast, in the many-atom case, this results in dynamics akin to the on-resonant cavity. Finally, we examine the validity of the rotating wave approximation through a direct comparison against the numerically exact hierarchical equations of motion. We find good agreement in the weak coupling regime, while in the intermediate coupling regime, we identify qualitative similarities, but the rotating wave approximation becomes less reliable. In the moderate coupling regime, we find deviations of the steady states due to the formation of mixed photon-atom states.

AB Classical and learned query optimizers (LQOs) use cardinality estimations as one of the critical inputs for query planning. Thus, accurately predicting the cardinality of arbitrary queries plays a vital role in query optimization. A recent boom in novel deep learning methods stimulated not only the rise of LQOs but also contributed to the appearance of learned cardinality estimators (LCEs). However, the majority of them are based on classical neural networks, ignoring that multivariate correlations between attributes across different tables could be naturally represented via entanglements in quantum circuits.
   In this paper, we introduce QardEst - Quantum Cardinality Estimator - a novel quantum neural network approach to estimate the cardinality of join queries. Our experiments conducted with a similar number of trainable parameters suggest that quantum neural networks executed on a quantum simulator outperform classical neural networks in terms of mean squared error as well as the q-error.

TI Quantum computing for energy correlators
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
AB In recent years, energy correlators have emerged as powerful observables for probing the fragmentation dynamics of high-energy collisions. We introduce the first numerical strategy for calculating energy correlators using the Hamiltonian lattice approach, providing access to the intriguing nonperturbative dynamics of these observables. Furthermore, motivated by rapid advances in quantum computing hardware and algorithms, we propose a quantum algorithm for calculating energy correlators in quantum field theories. This algorithm includes ground state preparation, the application of source, sink, energy flux and real-time evolution operators, and the Hadamard test. We validate our approach by applying it to the SU(2) pure gauge theory in 2 & thorn; 1 dimensions on 3 x 3 and 5 x 5 honeycomb lattices with jmax 1/4 12 at various couplings, utilizing both classical methods and the quantum algorithm, the latter tested using the IBM emulator for specific configurations. The results are consistent with the expected behavior of the strong coupling regime and motivate a more comprehensive study to probe the confinement dynamics across the weak and strong coupling regimes.

TI χ-colorable graph states: closed-form expressions and quantum
   orthogonal arrays
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS A-MATHEMATICAL AND THEORETICAL
AB Graph states are a fundamental class of multipartite entangled quantum states with wide-ranging applications in quantum information and computation. In this work, we develop a systematic approach for constructing and analyzing chi-colorable graph states, deriving explicit closed-form expressions for arbitrary chi. For a broad family of two- and three-colorable graph states, the representations obtained using only local operations require a minimal number of terms in the Z-eigenbasis. We prove that every two-colorable graph state is local Clifford (LC) equivalent to a state expressible as a summation of rows of an orthogonal array (OA). For graph states with chi > 2, we show that they are LC-equivalent to quantum OAs, establishing a direct combinatorial connection between multipartite entanglement and structured quantum states. Furthermore, the upper and lower bounds of the Schmidt measure for graph states with arbitrary chi colorability are discussed, extending the results for an arbitrary local dimension. Our results offer an efficient and practical method for systematically constructing graph states, optimizing their representation in quantum circuits, and identifying structured forms of multipartite entanglement. This approach also connects graph states to k-uniform and absolutely maximally entangled states, motivating further exploration of the structure of entangled states and their applications in quantum networks, quantum error correction, and measurement based quantum computing.

TI Quantum generative models for data generation
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB In recent years, many generation-based machine learning algorithms such as generative adversarial networks, Boltzmann machine, auto-encoder, etc. are widely used in data generation and probability distribution simulation. On the other hand, the combined algorithms of quantum computation and classical machine learning algorithms are proposed in various styles. Especially, there exist many relevant researches about quantum generative models, which are regarded as the branch of quantum machine learning. Quantum generative models are hybrid quantum-classical algorithms, in which parameterized quantum circuits are introduced to obtain the cost function of the task as well as its gradient, and then classical optimization algorithms are used to find the optima. Compared with its classical counterpart, quantum generative models map the data stream to high-dimensional Hilbert space with parameterized quantum circuits. In the mapping space, data features are easier to learn, which can surpass classical generative models in some tasks. Besides, quantum generative models are potential to realize the quantum advantage in noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices.

TI Hybrid quantum network for sensing in the acoustic frequency range
SO NATURE
AB Ultimate limits for the sensing of fields and forces are set by the quantum noise of a sensor1, 2-3. Entanglement allows for suppression of such noise and for achieving sensitivity beyond standard quantum limits4, 5, 6-7. Applicability of quantum optical sensing is often restricted by fixed wavelengths of available photonic quantum sources. Another ubiquitous limitation is associated with challenges of achieving quantum-noise-limited sensitivity in the acoustic noise frequency range relevant for several applications. Here we demonstrate a tool for broadband quantum sensing by performing quantum state processing that can be applied to a wide range of the optical spectrum and by suppressing quantum noise over an octave in the acoustic frequency range. An atomic spin ensemble is strongly coupled to one of the frequency-tunable beams of an Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) source of light. The other EPR beam of light, entangled with the first one, is tuned to a disparate wavelength. Engineering the spin ensemble to act as a negative-mass or positive-mass oscillator, we demonstrate frequency-dependent quantum noise reduction for measurements at the disparate wavelength. The tunability of the spin ensemble enables targeting quantum noise in a variety of systems with dynamics ranging from kHz to MHz. As an example of broadband quantum noise reduction in the acoustic frequency range, we analyse the applicability of our approach to gravitational-wave detectors (GWDs). Other possible applications include continuous-variable quantum repeaters and distributed quantum sensing.

TI Neural predictor based quantum architecture search
SO MACHINE LEARNING-SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) are widely speculated to deliver quantum advantages for practical problems under the quantum-classical hybrid computational paradigm in the near term. Both theoretical and practical developments of VQAs share many similarities with those of deep learning. For instance, a key component of VQAs is the design of task-dependent parameterized quantum circuits (PQCs) as in the case of designing a good neural architecture in deep learning. Partly inspired by the recent success of AutoML and neural architecture search (NAS), quantum architecture search (QAS) is a collection of methods devised to engineer an optimal task-specific PQC. It has been proven that QAS-designed VQAs can outperform expert-crafted VQAs in various scenarios. In this work, we propose to use a neural network based predictor as the evaluation policy for QAS. We demonstrate a neural predictor guided QAS can discover powerful quantum circuit ansatz, yielding state-of-the-art results for various examples from quantum simulation and quantum machine learning. Notably, neural predictor guided QAS provides a better solution than that by the random-search baseline while using an order of magnitude less of circuit evaluations. Moreover, the predictor for QAS as well as the optimal ansatz found by QAS can both be transferred and generalized to address similar problems.

TI A Post-Quantum Cryptography Enabled Feature-Level Fusion Framework for
   Privacy-Preserving Multimodal Biometric Recognition
SO CRYPTOGRAPHY
AB As quantum computing continues to advance, it threatens the long-term protection of traditional cryptographic methods, especially in biometric authentication systems where it is important to protect sensitive data. To overcome this challenge, we present a comprehensive, privacy-preserving framework for multimodal biometric authentication that can easily integrate any two binary-encoded modalities through feature-level fusion, ensuring that all sensitive information remains encrypted under a CKKS-based homomorphic encryption scheme resistant to both classical and quantum-enabled attacks. To demonstrate its versatility and effectiveness, we apply this framework to the retinal vascular patterns and palm vein features, which are inherently spoof-resistant and particularly well suited to high-security applications. This method not only ensures the secrecy of the combined biometric sample, but also enables the complete assessment of recognition performance and resilience against adversarial attacks. The results show that our approach provides protection against threats such as data leakage and replay attacks while maintaining high recognition performance and operational efficiency. These findings demonstrate the feasibility of integrating multimodal biometrics with post-quantum cryptography, giving a strong, privacy-oriented authentication solution suitable for mission-critical applications in the post-quantum era.

TI No Quantum Ramsey Theorem for Stabilizer Codes
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION THEORY
AB Recently, Nik Weaver proved a quantum analogue of the Ramsey theorem. Weaver's theorem states that for every positive integer k, there exists a positive integer n(k) such for any quantum channel on the n(k) x n(k) matrices, the corresponding quantum graph possesses either a k-dimensional quantum clique or a k-dimensional quantum anti-clique. Quantum anticliques coincide with error-correcting codes, while quantum cliques satisfy a dual property. In this paper we study the quantum graphs of mixed-unitary channels generated by tensor products of Pauli operators, which we call Pauli channels. We show that most quantum graphs arising from Pauli channels have non-trivial quantum cliques or quantum anti-cliques which are stabilizer codes. However, a reformulation of the quantum Ramsey theorem in terms of stabilizer codes and Pauli channels fails. Specifically, for every positive integer n, there exists an n-qubit Pauli channel for which any non-trivial quantum clique or quantum anti-clique fails to be a stabilizer code. We also show that this example is essentially unique, and hence most n-qubit Pauli channels have non-trivial quantum cliques or quantum anti-cliques which are stabilizer codes.

Detecting network steering is particularly challenging in complex network structures. We have studied the steering inequality criteria for a 2-forked 3-layer tree-shaped network. Assuming the first and third layers are trusted and the second layer is untrusted, we derived a steering inequality criterion using the correlation matrix between trusted and untrusted observables. In particular, we apply the steering criterion to three classes of measurements which are of special significance: local orthogonal observables, mutually unbiased measurements, and general symmetric informationally complete measurements. We further illustrate the effectiveness of our method through an example.

TI Review on the decoding algorithms for surface codes
SO QUANTUM
AB Quantum technologies have the potential to solve certain computationally hard problems with polynomial or super-polynomial speedups when compared to classical methods. Unfortunately, the unstable nature of quantum information makes it prone to errors. For this reason, quantum error correction is an invaluable tool to make quantum information reliable and enable the ultimate goal of fault- tolerant quantum computing. Surface codes currently stand as the most promising candidates to build near term error corrected qubits given their two-dimensional architecture, the requirement of only local operations, and high tolerance to quantum noise. Decoding algorithms are an integral component of any error correction scheme, as they are tasked with producing accurate estimates of the errors that affect quantum information, so that they can subsequently be corrected. A critical aspect of decoding algorithms is their speed, since the quantum state will suffer additional errors with the passage of time. This poses a connundrum, where decoding performance is improved at the expense of complexity and viceversa. In this review, a thorough discussion of state-of-the-art decoding algorithms for surface codes is provided. The target audience of this work are both readers with an introductory understanding of the field as well as those seeking to further their knowledge of the decoding paradigm of surface codes. We describe the core principles of these decoding methods as well as existing variants that show promise for improved results. In addition, both the decoding performance, in terms of error correction capability, and decoding complexity, are compared. A review of the existing software tools regarding surface codes decoding is also

TI Design and Evaluation of Device Authentication and Secure Communication
   System with PQC for AIoT Environments
SO ELECTRONICS
AB With the rapid development of Internet of Things (IoT) technology, the number of IoT users is growing year after year. IoT will become a part of our daily lives, so it is likely that the security of these devices will be an important issue in the future. Quantum computing is maturing, and the security threat associated with quantum computing will be faced in the transmissions of IoT devices, which mainly use wireless communication technologies. Therefore, to ensure the protection of transmitted data, a cryptographic algorithm that is efficient in defeating quantum computer attacks needs to be developed. In this paper, we propose a device authentication and secure communication system with post-quantum cryptography (PQC) for AIoT environments using the NTRU and Falcon signature mechanism, which can resist quantum computer attacks and be used in AIoT environments to effectively protect the confidentiality, integrity, and non-repudiation of transmitted data. We also used Raspberry Pi to simulate AIoT devices for implementation.

TI Quantum for 6G communication: A perspective
SO IET QUANTUM COMMUNICATION
AB In the technologically changing world, the demand for ultra-reliable, faster, low power, and secure communication has significantly risen in recent years. Researchers have shown immense interest in emerging quantum computing (QC) due to its potentials of solving the computing complexity in the robust and efficient manner. It is envisioned that QC can act as critical enablers and strong catalysts to considerably reduce the computing complexities and boost the future of sixth generation (6G) and beyond communication systems in terms of their security. In this study, the fundamentals of QC, the evolution of quantum communication that encompasses a wide spectrum of technologies and applications and quantum key distribution, which is one of the most promising applications of quantum security, have been presented. Furthermore, various parameters and important techniques are also investigated to optimise the performance of 6G communication in terms of their security, computing, and communication efficiency. Towards the end, potential challenges that QC and quantum communication may face in 6G have been highlighted along with future directions.
   The paper presents how quantum technologies will enable future 6G and what are the future research directions in this area.image

AB In a multi-user system with multiple antennas at the base station, precoding techniques in the downlink broadcast channel allow users to detect their respective data in a noncooperative manner. Vector Perturbation Precoding (VPP) is a non-linear variant of transmit-side channel inversion that perturbs user data to achieve full diversity order. While promising, finding an optimal perturbation in VPP is known to be an NP-hard problem, demanding heavy computational support at the base station and limiting the feasibility of the approach to small MIMO systems. This work proposes a radically different processing architecture for the downlink VPP problem, one based on Quantum Annealing (QA), to enable the applicability of VPP to large MIMO systems. Our design reduces VPP to a quadratic polynomial form amenable to QA, then refines the problem coefficients to mitigate the adverse effects of QA hardware noise. We evaluate our proposed QA based VPP (QAVP) technique on a real Quantum Annealing device over a variety of design and machine parameter settings. With existing hardware, QAVP can achieve a BER of 10(-4) with 100 mu s compute time, for a 6x6 MIMO system using 64 QAM modulation at 32 dB SNR.

TI Radiation effect on silicon photonics chips for space quantum key
   distribution
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Quantum communication satellites have potential for applications in future quantum networks. Photonics integrated chips, due to their compact and lightweight nature, are well-suited for satellite deployment. However, the harsh radiation environment of space can cause permanent damage to these chips, resulting in degraded performance or complete loss of functionality. In this work, we conducted a series of radiation experiments to evaluate the effects of gamma rays and high energy protons on quantum key distribution transmitter chips. The results suggest that the insertion loss of the chip is slightly reduced by about 1.5 dB after 100 krad (Si) gamma ray irradiation, and further reduced by about 0.5 to 1 dB after 2.39 x 1011/cm2 proton radiation. The half-wave voltages, extinction ratios, and polarization angles are not changed significantly within the measurement error range. Our work proves the feasibility of deploying quantum constellations utilizing terminals based on photonics chips.

TI Distributed Entangled State Production by Using Quantum Repeater
   Protocol
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF THEORETICAL PHYSICS
AB We consider entangled state production utilizing a full optomechanical arrangement, based on which we create entanglement between two far three-level V-type atoms using a quantum repeater protocol. At first, we consider eight identical atoms (1,2,MIDLINE HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS ,8), while adjacent pairs (i,i + 1) with i = 1,3,5,7 have been prepared in entangled states and the atoms 1, 8 are the two target atoms. The three-level atoms (1,2,3,4) and (5,6,7,8) distinctly become entangled with the system including optical and mechanical modes by performing the interaction in optomechanical cavities between atoms (2,3) and (6,7), respectively. Then, by operating appropriate measurements, instead of Bell state measurement which is a hard task in practical works, the entangled states of atoms (1,4) and (5,8) are achieved. Next, via interacting atoms (4,5) of the pairs (1,4) and (5,8) and operating proper measurement, the entangled state of target atoms (1,8) is obtained. In the continuation, entropy and success probability of the produced entangled state are then evaluated. It is observed that the time period of entropy is increased by increasing the mechanical frequency (omega(M)) and by decreasing optomechanical coupling strength to the field modes (G). Also, in most cases, the maximum of success probability is increased by decreasing G and via decreasing omega(M).

TI Information flow in parameterized quantum circuits
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB In this work, we introduce a new way to quantify information flow in quantum systems, especially for parameterized quantum circuits (PQCs). We use a graph representation of the circuits and propose a new distance metric using the mutual information between gate nodes. We then present an optimization procedure for variational algorithms using paths based on the distance measure. We explore the features of the algorithm by means of the variational quantum eigensolver, in which we compute the ground state energies of the Heisenberg model. In addition, we employ the method to solve a binary classification problem using variational quantum classification. From numerical simulations, we show that our method can be successfully used for optimizing the PQCs primarily used in near-term algorithms. We further note that information-flow based paths can be used to improve convergence of existing stochastic gradient based methods.

TI Authenticated Secure Quantum-Based Communication Scheme in
   Internet-of-Drones Deployment
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB The rapid advance of manufacturing Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs, aka drones) has led to a rise in the use of their civilian and commercial applications. The access of these drones to controlled airspace can be efficiently coordinated through particular layered network architecture, often referred to as the Internet-of-Drones (IoD). The nature of IoD, which is deployed in an open-access environment, brings significant safety and security concerns. Classical cryptosystems such as elliptic curve cryptography, Rivest-Shamir-Adleman, and Diffie-Hellman are essential building blocks to secure communication in the IoD. However, with the rapid development of quantum computing, it will be easy to break public-key cryptosystems using efficient quantum algorithms like Shor's algorithm. Thus, building quantum-safe solutions to enhance IoD security has become imperative. Fortunately, quantum technologies can provide unconditional security solutions to protect data and communications in the IoD environment. This paper proposes a quantum-based scheme to prevent unauthorized drones from accessing a specific flight zone and authenticates the identities and shared secret messages of involved entities. To do so, we used a quantum channel to encode the private information based on a pre-shared key and a random key generated in a session. The involved entities also perform mutual authentication and share a secret key. We also provide the security proofs and analysis of the proposed scheme that indicates its resistance to well-known attacks.

TI Unbalanced gain and loss in a quantum photonic system
SO JOURNAL OF OPTICS
AB Theories in physics can provide a kind of map of the physical system under investigation, showing all of the possible types of behavior which may occur. Certain points on the map are of greater significance than others, because they describe how the system responds in a useful or interesting manner. For example, the point of resonance is of particular importance when timing the pushes onto a person sat on a swing. More sophisticatedly, so-called exceptional points have been shown to be significant in optical systems harbouring both gain and loss, as typically described by non-Hermitian Hamiltonians. However, expressly quantum points of interest-be they exceptional points or otherwise-arising in quantum photonic systems have been far less studied. Here we consider a paradigmatic model: a pair of coupled qubits subjected to an unbalanced ratio of gain and loss. We mark on its map several flavours of both exceptional and critical points, each of which are associated with unconventional physical responses. In particular, we uncover the points responsible for characteristic spectral features and for the sudden loss of quantum entanglement in the steady state. Our results provide perspectives for characterizing quantum photonic systems beyond effective non-Hermitian Hamiltonians, and suggest a hierarchy of intrinsically quantum points of interest.

TI Robustness of entanglement-based discrete- and continuous-variable
   quantum key distribution against channel noise
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB Discrete-variable (DV) and continuous-variable (CV) schemes constitute the two major families of quantum key distribution (QKD) protocols. Unfortunately, since the setup elements required by these schemes are quite different, making a fair comparison of their potential performance in particular applications is often troublesome, limiting the experimenters' capability to choose an optimal solution. In this work we perform a general comparison of the major entanglement-based DV and CV QKD protocols in terms of their resistance to the channel noise, with the otherwise perfect setup, showing the definite superiority of the DV family. We analytically derive fundamental bounds on the tolerable channel noise and attenuation for entanglement-based CV QKD protocols. We also investigate the influence of DV QKD setup imperfections on the obtained results in order to determine benchmarks for the parameters of realistic photon sources and detectors, allowing the realistic DV protocols to outperform even the ideal CV QKD analogs. Our results indicate the realistic advantage of DV entanglement-based schemes over their CV counterparts and suggests the practical efforts for maximizing this advantage.

TI Multi-hop non-destructive qudit teleportation via non-maximally

AB A scheme for the multihop non-destructive teleportation of an arbitrary single-qudit state based on various non-maximally entangled Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger channels is proposed here. The parallel entanglement swap is used to form a direct d-dimensional (d >= 2) entangled channel shared between the sender and the receiver. The authors' propose a novel idea that the third-party Charlie with high quantum information processing technology executes the channel modulation, which reduces the technical requirements of the sender and the receiver. In addition, if the teleportation fails, the unknown state will be restored by the sender. This work provides a feasible method for teleportation and ensures the integrity of the unknown quantum information.

TI Storage of photonic time-bin qubits for up to 20 ms in a rare-earth
   doped crystal
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Long-duration quantum memories for photonic qubits are essential components for achieving long-distance quantum networks and repeaters. The mapping of optical states onto coherent spin-waves in rare earth ensembles is a particularly promising approach to quantum storage. However, it remains challenging to achieve long-duration storage at the quantum level due to read-out noise caused by the required spin-wave manipulation. In this work, we apply dynamical decoupling techniques and a small magnetic field to achieve the storage of six temporal modes for 20, 50, and 100 ms in a Eu-151(3+):Y2SiO5 crystal, based on an atomic frequency comb memory, where each temporal mode contains around one photon on average. The quantum coherence of the memory is verified by storing two time-bin qubits for 20 ms, with an average memory output fidelity of F = (85 +/- 2)% for an average number of photons per qubit of mu(in) = 0.92 +/- 0.04. The qubit analysis is done at the read-out of the memory, using a type of composite adiabatic read-out pulse we developed.

AB Interesting problems in quantum computation take the form of finding low-energy states of (pseudo)spin systems with engineered Hamiltonians that encode the problem data. Motivated by the practical possibility of producing very low-temperature spin systems, we propose and exemplify the possibility to compute by coupling the computational spins to a quantum coherent bath that serves as a heat sink. The quantum tunneling effect provides additional cooling channels to accelerate the cooling process. We demonstrate both analytically and numerically that this strategy can achieve a quantum advantage in the unstructured search problem.

TI Fast partitioning of Pauli strings into commuting families for optimal
   expectation value measurements of dense operators
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB The Pauli strings appearing in the decomposition of an operator can be can be grouped into commuting families, reducing the number of quantum circuits needed to measure the expectation value of the operator. We detail an algorithm to completely partition the full set of Pauli strings acting on any number of qubits into the minimal number of sets of commuting families, and we provide python code to perform the partitioning. The partitioning method scales linearly with the size of the set of Pauli strings and it naturally provides a fast method of diagonalizing the commuting families with quantum gates. We provide a package that integrates the partitioning into QISKIT, , and use this to benchmark the algorithm with dense Hamiltonians, such as those that arise in matrix quantum mechanics models, on IBM hardware. We demonstrate computational speedups close to the theoretical limit of (3/2)m / 2) m relative to qubit-wise commuting groupings, for m = 2, , ... , 6 qubits.

TI Generating Multi-Issued Session Key by Using Semi Quantum Key
   Distribution With Time-Constraint
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Information security refers to protect the information from unauthorized access or modification. Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) is a way to generate a key preventing those malicious activities. One of QKD protocol, namely Semi-quantum key distribution (SQKD) protocol, is designed to allow two users to establish a secure secret key when either of them is limited to performing certain "classical" operations. It is proven to be secure from any type of attack. However, it will be a problem in the multi-session communication since the SQKD activities follow the number of the session. In this paper, we propose two modified SQKDs with time-constraint approach. Time-constraint is beneficial in QKD activity since it could generate session key between two parties within a certain time-constraint. By setting the number of session key and its time-constraint before QKD activities, many scheduled communications would be prepared well. Furthermore, BAN Logic analysis is applied to analyze the goal of the protocol, the considered assumptions, wasted phase, and the demand for data encryption. Finally, the performance analysis of the protocols is presented, and it shows a better performance compared with other certain QKDs.

TI Topological Order, Quantum Codes, and Quantum Computation on Fractal
   Geometries
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB We investigate topological order on fractal geometries embedded in n dimensions. We consider the n-dimensional lattice with holes at all length scales the corresponding fractal (Hausdorff) dimension of which is DH = n - 8. In particular, we diagnose the existence of the topological order through the lens of quantum information and geometry, i.e., via its equivalence to a quantum error-correcting code with a macroscopic code distance or the presence of macroscopic systoles in systolic geometry. We first prove a no-go theorem that ZN topological order cannot survive on any fractal embedded in two spatial dimensions and with D-H = 2 - 8. For fractal-lattice models embedded in three dimensions (3D) or higher spatial dimensions, Z(N) topological order survives if the boundaries on the holes condense only loop or, more generally, k-dimensional membrane excitations (k >= 2), thus predicting the existence of fractal topological quantum memories (at zero temperature) or topological codes that are embeddable in 3D. Moreover, for a class of models that contain only loop or membrane excitations and are hence self-correcting on an n-dimensional manifold, we prove that Z(N) topological order survives on a large class of fractal geometries independent of the type of hole boundary and is hence extremely robust. We further construct fault-tolerant logical gates in the Z(2) version of these fractal models, which we term fractal surface codes, using their connection to global and higher-form topological symmetries equivalent to sweeping the corresponding gapped domain walls. In particular, we discover a logical controlled-controlled-Z (CCZ) gate corresponding to a global symmetry in a class of fractal codes embedded in 3D with Hausdorff dimension asymptotically approaching D-H = 2 + E for arbitrarily small E, which hence only requires a space overhead O (d2+E), where d is the code distance. This in turn leads to the surprising discovery of certain exotic gapped boundaries that only condense the combination of loop excitations and certain gapped domain walls. We further obtain logical C(p)Z gates with p <= n - 1 on fractal codes embedded in n dimensions. In particular, for the logical C(n-1)Z in the nth level of the Clifford hierarchy, we can reduce the space overhead to O (d(n-1+is an element of)). On the mathematical side, our findings in this paper also lead to the discovery of macroscopic relative systoles in a class of fractal geometries.

TI Asleep at the wheel? Responsible Innovation in quantum computing
SO TECHNOLOGY ANALYSIS & STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT
AB Quantum computing is an emerging set of technologies which promise to transform aspects of computing in ways that, though increasingly defined, are still largely theoretical. Responsible Innovation (RI) asserts that technologies with potentially transformative capacity on society should be approached with care and forethought; this paper is based on applying RI in one of the UK's National Quantum Technology Hubs. Quantum computing is at a key juncture as it emerges from the laboratory to be of interest commercially. This provides an opportunity to observe and influence the trajectory of this technology. Quantum computing is widely envisioned to have major impacts on computing and society; there are, however, great uncertainties about development timescales and the scope and impact of applications. From experiences with a major quantum computing project in the UK, we discuss the challenges in applying RI to quantum computing. Existing RI practices struggle to address the societal implications of such a complex and innovative technology. We argue that uncovering the visions and sociotechnical imaginaries that inform the development this technology enables RI to make valuable insights into future societal implications of quantum computing. This provides lessons for RI in emerging technologies more widely.

TI Ab initio quantum simulation of strongly correlated materials with
   quantum embedding
SO NPJ COMPUTATIONAL MATERIALS
AB Quantum computing has shown great potential in various quantum chemical applications such as drug discovery, material design, and catalyst optimization. Although significant progress has been made in the quantum simulation of simple molecules, ab initio simulation of solid-state materials on quantum computers is still in its early stage, mostly owing to the fact that the system size quickly becomes prohibitively large when approaching the thermodynamic limit. In this work, we introduce an orbital-based multifragment approach on top of the periodic density matrix embedding theory, resulting in a significantly smaller problem size for the current near-term quantum computer. We demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of our method compared with the conventional methodologies and experiments on solid-state systems with complex electronic structures. These include spin-polarized states of a hydrogen chain (1D-H), the equation of state of a boron nitride layer (h-BN) as well as the magnetic ordering in nickel oxide (NiO), a prototypical strongly correlated solid. Our results suggest that quantum embedding combined with a chemically intuitive fragmentation can greatly advance quantum simulation of realistic materials, thereby paving the way for solving important yet classically hard industrial problems on near-term quantum devices.

TI Low-overhead fault-tolerant quantum computing using long-range
   connectivity
SO SCIENCE ADVANCES
AB Vast numbers of qubits will be needed for large-scale quantum computing because of the overheads associated with error correction. We present a scheme for low-overhead fault-tolerant quantum computation based on quantum low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes, where long-range interactions enable many logical qubits to be encoded with a modest number of physical qubits. In our approach, logic gates operate via logical Pauli measurements that preserve both the protection of the LDPC codes and the low overheads in terms of the required number of additional qubits. Compared with surface codes with the same code distance, we estimate order-of-magnitude improvements in the overheads for processing around 100 logical qubits using this approach. Given the high thresholds demonstrated by LDPC codes, our estimates suggest that fault-tolerant quantum computation at this scale may be achievable with a few thousand physical qubits at comparable error rates to what is needed for current approaches.

TI Visualizing quantum states: A pilot study on problem solving in quantum
   information science education
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW PHYSICS EDUCATION RESEARCH
AB In the rapidly evolving interdisciplinary field of quantum information science and technology, a major obstacle is the need to understand advanced mathematics to solve complex problems. Current findings in educational research suggest that incorporating visualizations into problem-solving settings can have beneficial effects on students' performance and cognitive load compared to relying solely on symbolic problem-solving content. Visualizations like the (dimensional) circle notation enable us to represent not only single-qubit but also more complex multiqubit states, entanglement, and quantum algorithms. In this pilot study, we aim to take an initial step toward identifying the contexts in which students benefit from the presentation of visualizations of single-and multiqubit systems in addition to mathematical formalism. For this purpose, we propose a set of test items and a comprehensive methodology to assess students' performance and cognitive load when solving problems. This is a pilot investigation with a large breadth of questions intended to generate hypotheses and guide larger-scale, more focused studies in the future. Specifically, we compare two approaches: using the mathematical-symbolic Dirac notation alone and using it in combination with the (dimensional) circle notation. In surveys in one-, two-and three-qubit systems, we gather qualitative data from five, five and two think-aloud interviews, identifying problems that students encounter and their problem-solving strategies. In addition, we analyze quantitative data (performance and cognitive load) from 23, 27, and 17 participants in surveys on one-, two-, and three-qubit systems recruited mainly from our quantum computing lectures. We find that most of the test items are appropriate for a heterogeneous target group, as they can differentiate between participants in terms of performance and time taken. In general, the A-B crossover structure of the study is suitable for investigating the benefits of visualization for problem solving with regard to length and feasibility. Future studies should, however, be narrower in scope, given the observable dependence on student characteristics and context, with particular interest lying in the further investigation of the Hadamard gate, the CNOT gate, and entanglement in multiqubit systems.

TI Random-Matrix Models of Monitored Quantum Circuits
SO JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL PHYSICS
AB We study the competition between Haar-random unitary dynamics and measurements for unstructured systems of qubits. For projective measurements, we derive various properties of the statistical ensemble of Kraus operators analytically, including the purification time and the distribution of Born probabilities. The latter generalizes the Porter-Thomas distribution for random unitary circuits to the monitored setting and is log-normal at long times. We also consider weak measurements that interpolate between identity quantum channels and projective measurements. In this setting, we derive an exactly solvable Fokker-Planck equation for the joint distribution of singular values of Kraus operators, analogous to the Dorokhov-Mello-Pereyra-Kumar (DMPK) equation modelling disordered quantum wires. We expect that the statistical properties of Kraus operators we have established for these simple systems will serve as a model for the entangling phase of monitored quantum systems more generally.

TI Quantum complexity in gravity, quantum field theory, and quantum
   information science
SO PHYSICS REPORTS-REVIEW SECTION OF PHYSICS LETTERS
AB Quantum complexity quantifies the difficulty of preparing a state or implementing a unitary transformation with limited resources. Applications range from quantum computation to condensed matter physics and quantum gravity. We seek to bridge the approaches of these fields, which define and study complexity using different frameworks and tools. We describe several definitions of complexity, along with their key properties. In quantum information theory, we focus on complexity growth in random quantum circuits. In quantum many-body systems and quantum field theory (QFT), we discuss a geometric definition of complexity in terms of geodesics on the unitary group. In dynamical systems, we explore a definition of complexity in terms of state or operator spreading, as well as concepts from tensor-networks. We also outline applications to simple quantum systems, quantum many-body models, and QFTs including conformal field theories (CFTs). Finally, we explain the proposed relationship between complexity and gravitational observables within the holographic anti-de Sitter (AdS)/CFT correspondence. (c) 2025 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB We establish an operator algebra generalization of Watrous' theorem (Watrous 2009 Quantum Inf. Comput. 9 403-413) on mixing unital quantum channels (completely positive trace-preserving maps) with the completely depolarizing channel, wherein the more general objects of focus become (finite-dimensional) von Neumann algebras, the unique trace preserving conditional expectation onto the algebra, the group of unitary operators in the commutant of the algebra, and the fixed point algebra of the channel. As an application, we obtain a result on the asymptotic theory of quantum channels, showing that all unital channels are eventually mixed unitary. We also discuss the special case of the diagonal algebra in detail, and draw connections to the theory of correlation matrices and Schur product maps.

However, despite its major potential impact for industry and society, the question of their energetic footprint has remained in a blind spot of current deployment strategies. In this Perspective, I argue that quantum technologies must urgently plan for the creation and structuration of a transverse quantum energy initiative, connecting quantum thermodynamics, quantum information science, quantum physics, and engineering. Such an initiative is the only path towards energy-efficient, sustainable quantum technologies, and to possibly bring out an energetic quantum advantage.

   management of a spontaneous four-wave mixing source
SO SCIENCE ADVANCES
AB Leveraging the unique properties of quantum entanglement, quantum entanglement distribution networks support multiple quantum information applications and are essential to the development of quantum networks. However, practical implementation poses fundamental challenges to network scalability and flexibility. Here, we propose a reconfigurable entanglement distribution network scheme based on tunable multipump excitation of a spontaneous four-wave mixing (SFWM) source and a time-sharing method. We characterize the two-photon correlation under different pump conditions to demonstrate the effect of pump degenerate and pump nondegenerate SFWM processes on the two-photon correlation and its tunability. Then, as a benchmark application, a 10-user fully connected quantum key distribution network is established in a time-sharing way with triple pump lights. Our results provide a promising networking scheme for large-scale entanglement distribution networks owing to its scalability, functionality, and reconfigurability.

TI New advanced computing architecture for cryptography design and analysis
   by D-Wave quantum annealer
SO TSINGHUA SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Universal quantum computers are far from achieving practical applications. The D-Wave quantum computer is initially designed for combinatorial optimizations. Therefore, exploring the potential applications of the D-Wave device in the field of cryptography is of great importance. First, although we optimize the general quantum Hamiltonian on the basis of the structure of the multiplication table (factor up to 1 005 973), this study attempts to explore the simplification of Hamiltonian derived from the binary structure of the integers to be factored. A simple factorization on 143 with four qubits is provided to verify the potential of further advancing the integer-factoring ability of the D-Wave device. Second, by using the quantum computing cryptography based on the D-Wave 2000Q system, this research further constructs a simple version of quantum-classical computing architecture and a Quantum-Inspired Simulated Annealing (QISA) framework. Good functions and a high-performance platform are introduced, and additional balanced Boolean functions with high nonlinearity and optimal algebraic immunity can be found. Further comparison between QISA and Quantum Annealing (QA) on six-variable bent functions not only shows the potential speedup of QA, but also suggests the potential of architecture to be a scalable way of D-Wave annealer toward a practical cryptography design.

TI Matrix low-rank approximate quantum algorithm based on singular value
   decomposition
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB In the era of big data, efficient data processing is crucial. Quantum computing has the capability of parallel computing, which provides a new solution for convenient data processing. We propose a matrix low-rank approximate quantum algorithm based on singular value decomposition with a complexity of O[poly(pq)]. We conduct the principle demonstration of the algorithm in the NMR quantum computing system. In the experiment, C-13 labeled cromaric acid is used as a four-bit sample, dissolved in d6-acetone, and H-1 is decoupled in the whole process. In the case of a large number of bits, quantum principal component analysis, quantum recommendation algorithm, and other quantum algorithms can achieve the same goal, and their time complexities are basically the same. In this paper, the resonance transition algorithm is used to effectively replace the phase estimation algorithm in this kind of problem, which greatly reduces the need of auxiliary bits. Only one auxiliary bit is used and a singular value is retained to better restore the image, which is currently unable to be achieved by other algorithms based on phase estimation. Firstly, an 8 x 8-dimensional image matrix is selected, and the pseudo-pure state is prepared by using the spatial averaging method. The quantum state reaches the target state by using gradient descent pulse to complete the preparation of the initial state. Then the shape pulse is used to apply the time-evolution operator to the initial state several times to realize the time evolution of the Hamiltonian H of the resonance transition algorithm. Finally, the quantum state chromatography is used to read out the different components of the density matrix and reconstruct the density matrix. The experimental results are analyzed by quantum state chromatography, and the experimental values are in agreement with the theoretical ones. The fidelity is 99.84%, and the error comes mainly from the experimental equipment and the gradient pulse's optimization algorithm. This verifies the correctness of the matrix low-rank approximate quantum algorithm proposed in this paper within the error range. For the classical algorithm, it usually takes O[poly(pq)] to solve the low-rank matrix on the classical computer. Compared with the classical algorithm, the quantum algorithm achieves exponential acceleration.

TI Impact of Spectators on a Two-Qubit Gate in a Tunable Coupling
   Superconducting Circuit
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Cross-resonance (CR) gates have emerged as a promising scheme for fault-tolerant quantum computation with fixed-frequency qubits. We experimentally implement an entangling CR gate by using a microwave-only control in a tunable coupling superconducting circuit, where the tunable coupler provides extra degrees of freedom to verify optimal conditions for constructing a CR gate. By developing a three-qubit Hamiltonian tomography protocol, we systematically investigate the dependency of gate fidelities on spurious qubit interactions and present the first experimental approach to the evaluation of the perturbation impact arising from spectator qubits. Our results reveal that the spectator qubits lead to reductions in CR gate fidelity dependent on ZZ interactions and particular frequency detunings between spectator and gate qubits. The target spectator demonstrates a more serious impact than the control spectator under a standard echo pulse scheme, whereas the degradation of gate fidelity is observed up to 22.5% as both the spectators are present with a modest ZZ coupling to the computational qubits. Our experiments uncover an optimal CR operation regime, and the method we develop here can readily be applied to improving other kinds of two-qubit gates in large-scale quantum circuits.

TI Realization of a Fast Triple-Magic All-Optical Qutrit in 88Sr
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB The optical clock states of alkaline earth and alkaline earthlike atoms are the fundament of state-of-theart optical atomic clocks. An important prerequisite for the operation of optical clocks is the magic trapping conditions where electronic and motional dynamics decouple. Here, we identify and experimentally demonstrate simultaneous magic trapping for two clock transitions in 88Sr, realizing so-called triple-magic conditions at a specially chosen magic angle. Under these conditions, we operate an all-optical qutrit comprising the ground state 1S0, and the two metastable clock states 3P0 and 3P2. We demonstrate fast optical control in an atom array using two- and three-photon couplings to realize high-fidelity manipulation between all qutrit states. At the magic angle, we probe the coherence achievable in magic-angle-tuned traps and find atom-atom coherence times between the metastable states as long as 715(30) ms. Our work opens several new directions, including qutrit-based quantum metrology on optical transitions and high-fidelity and high-coherence manipulation on the 88Sr fine-structure qubit.

TI Experimental study of efficient temporal-multimode
   Duan-Lukin-Cirac-Zoller storage scheme
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB Quantum interfaces that generate entanglement or correlations between a photon and an atomic memory are fundamental building blocks in quantum repeater research. Temporal, spatial, and spectral multiplexed atom-photon entanglement interfaces in cold atomic systems based on spontaneous Raman scattering processes, present an effective technical approach to realizing quantum repeaters. Compared with the other schemes, temporal-multiplexing schemes are particularly attractive since they repeatedly use the same physical process. In these schemes, readout efficiency plays a crucial role. Theoretical models indicate that even if the readout efficiency is increased by 1%, the probability of long-distance entanglement distribution will be increased by 7%-18%. However, current implementation of temporal-multimode quantum memory often suffers low readout efficiency unless an optical cavity or an atomic ensemble with a large optical- depth is adopted.
   In this study, we solve this challenge by using the expandable pulsed light fabricating technology and carefully selecting energy level transitions, so as to develop an efficient temporal-multiplexed quantum source. Our approach involves applying a train of write laser pulses to an atomic ensemble from different directions, thereby creating spin-wave memories and Stokes-photon emissions. We design an expandable pulsed light fabrication device based on the principle of optical path reversibility, allowing a writing laser beam to pass through an acousto-optic modulator (AOM) network in two different directions. This setup enables precise control over the directions of the write pulse train through real-time manipulation of the field-programmable gate array (FPGA) and the diffraction order of the AOMs. In our experiment, we prepare six pairs of modes . After detecting Stokes photons during the experimental cycle, the FPGA outputs a feedforward signal after a specified storage time, triggering the application of a corresponding reading pulse from the read AOM network to the atomic ensemble, thereby generating an anti-Stokes photon. To enhance readout efficiency, we optimize the energy level structure of the read pulse transitions, |b -> e(2)> to |b -> e(1)>; specifically, we adjust the transition frequencies of the read pulses by comparing with those used in current temporal-multimode quantum memory schemes. Theoretical calculations show that when the frequencies of the read pulses are tuned to the transitions |b -> e(1)> and |b -> e(2)>, the readout efficiencies are about 33% and 15%, suggesting that the chosen energy level transitions can double the readout efficiency.
   Experimental results indicate a readout efficiency of 38% for the multiplexed source and the Bell parameter of 2.35. Additionally, our device has a 5.83-fold higher probability of successfully generating entanglement than a single channel entanglement source. Our method is cost-effective, easy to operate, and highly applicable. For instance, based on our findings, the readout efficiency can be further improved through cavity-enhanced atom-photon coupling, and entanglement fidelity can be increased by suppressing noise in temporal-multimode memory schemes. This work provides a solid foundation and effective methods for realizing the high-efficiency temporal-multimode quantum memory and developing the large-scale quantum networks.

TI Decoding topological XYZ 2 codes with reinforcement
   learning based on attention mechanisms
SO CHINESE PHYSICS B
AB Quantum error correction, a technique that relies on the principle of redundancy to encode logical information into additional qubits to better protect the system from noise, is necessary to design a viable quantum computer. For this new topological stabilizer code-XYZ(2) code defined on the cellular lattice, it is implemented on a hexagonal lattice of qubits and it encodes the logical qubits with the help of stabilizer measurements of weight six and weight two. However topological stabilizer codes in cellular lattice quantum systems suffer from the detrimental effects of noise due to interaction with the environment. Several decoding approaches have been proposed to address this problem. Here, we propose the use of a state-attention based reinforcement learning decoder to decode XYZ(2) codes, which enables the decoder to more accurately focus on the information related to the current decoding position, and the error correction accuracy of our reinforcement learning decoder model under the optimisation conditions can reach 83.27% under the depolarizing noise model, and we have measured thresholds of 0.18856 and 0.19043 for XYZ(2) codes at code spacing of 3-7 and 7-11, respectively. our study provides directions and ideas for applications of decoding schemes combining reinforcement learning attention mechanisms to other topological quantum error-correcting codes.

SO PHYSICS LETTERS A
AB Out-of-time-ordered correlators (OTOC) are a quantifier of quantum information scrambling and are useful in characterizing quantum chaos. We propose an efficient quantum algorithm to measure OTOCs that provides an exponential speed-up over the best known classical algorithm provided the OTOC operator to be estimated admits an efficient gate decomposition. We also discuss a scheme to obtain information about the eigenvalue spectrum and the spectral density of OTOCs as well as an efficient algorithm to estimate gate fidelities. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

TI Quantum correlations and coherence in a mixed spin- (1/2,1) Heisenberg
   dimer under intrinsic decoherence
SO PHYSICA SCRIPTA
AB This research delves into the dynamical behavior of quantum correlations and coherence within a mixed Heisenberg dimer system under the intrinsic decoherence. Our approach involves the application of logarithmic negativity, local quantum uncertainty, and the l(1) norm-based coherence as quantifiers for entanglement, skew information correlations, and quantum coherence in this qubit-qutrit model. Our primary objective is to explore the impact of various factors on the dynamics of quantum correlations and quantum coherence. These factors encompass the initial density matrix and its mixing parameter, the intrinsic decoherence rate (gamma), the external magnetic field, as well as intrinsic system parameters, notably the XXZ and uniaxial single-ion anisotropies. Our results demonstrate that the introduction of intrinsic decoherence (ID) significantly erodes quantum resources. Particularly, for high values of the ID rate (gamma), excessive damping occurs, leading to the absence of oscillations or a rapid decay of quantum resources, ultimately stabilizing in steady states. Furthermore, the presence of an external homogeneous magnetic field further diminishes quantum resources within the system. However, despite the degradation induced by the combined influence of intrinsic decoherence and high external magnetic field intensities, the judicious selection of the initial density matrix and precise adjustment of the uniaxial single-ion anisotropy enable the preservation of quantum resources within the mixed spin-(1/2, 1) Heisenberg dimer.

TI Classical variational simulation of the Quantum Approximate Optimization
   Algorithm
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB A key open question in quantum computing is whether quantum algorithms can potentially offer a significant advantage over classical algorithms for tasks of practical interest. Understanding the limits of classical computing in simulating quantum systems is an important component of addressing this question. We introduce a method to simulate layered quantum circuits consisting of parametrized gates, an architecture behind many variational quantum algorithms suitable for near-term quantum computers. A neural-network parametrization of the many-qubit wavefunction is used, focusing on states relevant for the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA). For the largest circuits simulated, we reach 54 qubits at 4 QAOA layers, approximately implementing 324 RZZ gates and 216 RX gates without requiring large-scale computational resources. For larger systems, our approach can be used to provide accurate QAOA simulations at previously unexplored parameter values and to benchmark the next generation of experiments in the Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) era.

TI Prospects for quantum enhancement with diabatic quantum annealing
SO NATURE REVIEWS PHYSICS
AB Optimization, sampling and machine learning are topics of broad interest that have inspired significant developments and new approaches in quantum computing. One such approach is quantum annealing (QA). In this Review, we assess the prospects for algorithms within the general framework of QA to achieve a quantum speedup relative to classical state-of-the-art methods. We argue for continued exploration in the QA framework on the basis that improved coherence times and control capabilities will enable the near-term exploration of several heuristic quantum optimization algorithms. These continuous-time Hamiltonian computation algorithms rely on control protocols that are more advanced than those in traditional ground-state QA, while still being considerably simpler than those used in gate-model implementations. The inclusion of coherent diabatic transitions to excited states results in a generalization we refer to collectively as diabatic quantum annealing, which we believe is the most promising route to quantum enhancement within this framework. Other promising variants of traditional QA include reverse annealing, continuous-time quantum walks and analogues of parameterized quantum circuit ansatzes for machine learning. Most of these algorithms have no known efficient classical simulations, making them worthy of further investigation with quantum hardware in the intermediate-scale regime.
   Quantum annealing is a widely used heuristic algorithm for optimization and sampling, implemented in commercial processors. This Review provides a critical assessment of the field and points to new opportunities for a quantum advantage via recently developed alternative quantum annealing protocols.

TI Simulating quantum circuits using the multi-scale entanglement
   renormalization ansatz
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Understanding the limiting capabilities of classical methods in simulating complex quantum systems is of paramount importance for quantum technologies. Although many advanced approaches have been proposed and recently used to challenge quantum advantage experiments, novel efficient methods for the approximate simulation of complex quantum systems are still in high demand. Here, we propose a scalable technique for approximate simulations of intermediate-size quantum circuits on the basis of the multi-scale entanglement renormalization ansatz (MERA) and Riemannian optimization. The MERA is a tensor network, whose geometry together with orthogonality constraints imposed on its tensors allow approximating many-body quantum states lying beyond the area-law scaling of the entanglement entropy. We benchmark the proposed technique for brickwall quantum circuits of up to 243 qubits with various depths up to 20 layers. Our approach paves a way to exploring efficient simulation techniques for quantum many-body systems.

TI Robustness of quantum correlations in photonic systems under
   non-Markovian dephasing: theoretical analysis in the experimental range
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB We investigate the preservation and dynamics of entanglement and Bell nonlocality in a two-photon system subject to local dephasing, particularly emphasizing environments exhibiting non-Markovian memory effects. By analyzing the interplay between entanglement, as measured by concurrence, and Bell inequality violation, we identify time regions where Bell inequality is not violated, even when concurrence remains high. This indicates that strongly entangled states do not always exhibit nonclassical correlations with certainty. Our study further explores the effects of refractive index variations, spectral width, and interaction symmetry, demonstrating how structured environments and controlled environmental interactions can mitigate decoherence and enhance the resilience of quantum correlations. We propose that these theoretical predictions can be tested using modifications of recent experimental optical setups. These findings provide valuable insights into the conditions under which quantum correlations remain irreproducible by classical local hidden-variable models, with direct implications for quantum communication, quantum information processing, and foundational studies in quantum mechanics. Furthermore, our findings highlight the crucial importance of quantum coherence in maintaining entanglement and nonlocality over extended time evolution. These results show remarkable alignment with the experimental observations, demonstrating high accuracy and consistency within the expected parameter range.

TI Breaking Landauer's bound in a spin-encoded quantum computer
SO QUANTUM INFORMATION PROCESSING
AB It is commonly recognized that Landauer's bound holds in (irreversible) quantum measurement. In this study, we overturned this common sense by extracting a single spin from a spin-spin magnetic interaction experiment to demonstrate that Landauer's bound can be broken quantitatively by a factor of 10(4) similar to 10(10) via quantum spin tunneling. It is the quantum limit (h/2 approximate to 10(-34) J . s), rather than Landauer's bound, that governs the performance of a spin qubit. An optically-manipulated spin-encoded quantum computer is designed, in which energy bound well below k(B)T to erase a spin qubit at the expense of a long spin relaxation time is theoretically sensible and experimentally verified. This work may represent the last piece of the puzzle in quantum Landauer erasure in terms of a single spin being the smallest and the closest to the quantum limit.

SO BRAZILIAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB As superconducting circuits emerge as a leading platform for scalable quantum information processing, building comprehensive bridges from the foundational principles of macroscopic quantum phenomena to the architecture of modern quantum devices is increasingly essential for introducing new researchers to the field. This tutorial provides a self-contained, pedagogical introduction to superconducting quantum circuits at the undergraduate level. Beginning with an overview of superconductivity and the Josephson effect, the tutorial systematically develops the quantization of microwave circuits into the framework of circuit quantum electrodynamics (cQED). The transmon qubit is then introduced as a state-of-the-art application, with a detailed derivation of its Hamiltonian and its interaction with control and readout circuitry. The theoretical formalism is consolidated through a numerical simulation of vacuum Rabi oscillations in a driven transmon-resonator system, a canonical experiment that demonstrates the coherent energy exchange characteristic of the strong coupling regime. This work serves as a foundational guide and first point of contact, equipping students and researchers with the conceptual and mathematical tools necessary to understand and engineer superconducting quantum hardware.

This paper provides a reference design approach that allows the wireless community to effectively leverage QML in optimizing their own wireless communications networks. Such an approach will become increasingly valuable as quantum computing matures and conventional computing methods reach their practical limits due to the high dimensionality of optimization problems. We present a detailed methodology enabling wireless communications practitioners to construct their own Quantum Neural Networks (QNN) implementations and benchmark their performance against conventional techniques. Optimization strategies for wireless communication channels using QNNs are explored.

TI Detection of quantum information masking via machine learning

AB Recently, machine learning has been widely applied in the field of quantum information, notably in tasks such as entanglement detection, steering characterization, and nonlocality verification. However, few studies have focused on utilizing machine learning to detect quantum information masking (QIM). In this work, we investigate supervised machine learning for detecting QIM in both pure and mixed qubit states. For pure qubit states, we randomly generate the corresponding density matrices and train an XGBoost model to detect QIM. For mixed qubit states, we improve the XGBoost method by optimizing the selection of training samples. The experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves higher classification accuracy. Furthermore, we analyze the area under the curve of the receiver operating characteristic curve for this method, which further confirms its classification performance.

TI Neural Architecture Search Algorithms for Quantum Autoencoders
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM ENGINEERING
AB The design of quantum circuits is currently driven by the specific objectives of the quantum algorithm in question. This approach thus relies on a significant manual effort by the quantum algorithm designer to design an appropriate circuit for the task. However, this approach cannot scale to more complex quantum algorithms in the future without exponentially increasing the circuit design effort and introducing unwanted inductive biases. Motivated by this observation, we propose to automate the process of circuit design by drawing inspiration from neural architecture search (NAS). In this work, we propose two quantum-NAS algorithms that aim to find efficient circuits given a particular quantum task. We choose quantum data compression as our driver quantum task and demonstrate the performance of our algorithms by finding efficient autoencoder designs that outperform baselines on three different tasks: quantum data denoising, classical data compression, and pure quantum data compression. Our results indicate that quantum NAS algorithms can significantly alleviate the manual effort while delivering performant quantum circuits for any given task.

We provide necessary and sufficient conditions for the complete positivity of such channels, and we also show that complete positivity can be equivalent to simple positivity when the ground sector is one-dimensional. Finally, we examine the time-dependent scenario and characterize all CP-divisible channels and Markovian semigroups belonging to this class, thus providing a general recipe, beyond the Markovian scenario, to promote a given decay process to a legitimate quantum process on a larger space.

SO MACHINE LEARNING-SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Quantum machine learning is a relatively new research field that aims to combine the dramatic performance advantage offered by quantum computing and the ability of machine learning algorithms to learn complex distributions of high-dimensional data. The primary focus of this domain is the implementation of classical machine learning algorithms in the quantum mechanical domain and study of the speedup due to quantum parallelism, which could enable the development of novel techniques for solving problems such as quantum phase recognition and quantum error correction optimization. In this paper, we propose a hybrid quantum machine learning pipeline for predicting the atomization energies of various molecules using the nuclear charges and atomic positions of the constituent atoms. Firstly, we will be using a deep convolutional auto-encoder model for the feature extraction of data constructed from the eigenvalues and eigenvector centralities of the pairwise distance matrix calculated from atomic positions and the unrolled upper triangle of each Coulomb matrix calculated from nuclear charges, and we will then be using a quantum regression algorithm such as quantum linear regression, quantum radial basis function neural network and, a quantum neural network for estimating the atomization energy. The hybrid quantum neural network models do not seem to provide any speedup over their classical counterparts. Before implementing a quantum algorithm, we will also be using state-of-the-art classical machine learning and deep learning models such as XGBoost, multilayer perceptron, deep convolutional neural network, and a long short-term memory network to study the correlation between the extracted features and corresponding atomization energies of molecules.

TI Characterizing the loss landscape of variational quantum circuits
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Machine learning techniques enhanced by noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices and especially variational quantum circuits (VQC) have recently attracted much interest and have already been benchmarked for certain problems. Inspired by classical deep learning, VQCs are trained by gradient descent methods which allow for efficient training over big parameter spaces. For NISQ sized circuits, such methods show good convergence. There are however still many open questions related to the convergence of the loss function and to the trainability of these circuits in situations of vanishing gradients. Furthermore, it is not clear how 'good' the minima are in terms of generalization and stability against perturbations of the data and there is, therefore, a need for tools to quantitatively study the convergence of the VQCs. In this work, we introduce a way to compute the Hessian of the loss function of VQCs and show how to characterize the loss landscape with it. The eigenvalues of the Hessian give information on the local curvature and we discuss how this information can be interpreted and compared to classical neural networks. We benchmark our results on several examples, starting with a simple analytic toy model to provide some intuition about the behaviour of the Hessian, then going to bigger circuits, and also train VQCs on data. Finally, we show how the Hessian can be used to adjust the learning rate for faster convergence during the training of variational circuits.

TI Enhancing computation and security in MEC-Aided IoT for medical imaging
   with QCNNs and post-Quantum cryptography
SO INTERNET OF THINGS
AB Efficient optimization of computational resources in Mobile Edge Computing (MEC)-enabled Internet of Things (IoT) environments is critical for enhancing energy efficiency and minimizing latency. This research focuses on medical image analysis, specifically kidney tumor segmentation using CT scan images from the KiTS19 dataset. To address the challenges of high computational demands and complex feature extraction, we propose an integrated framework that combines two advanced technologies: quantum-inspired operations implemented through classical simulation along with a Residual U-Net architecture for improved computation and post-quantum cryptography for robust security. The quantum-inspired neural network design leverages principles from quantum computing to create classical algorithms that boost computational efficiency, enabling faster and more accurate segmentation of medical images within resource-constrained IoT environments. Additionally, the framework employs a quantum-inspired Double Deep Reinforcement Learning (QiDDRL) strategy to dynamically optimize resource allocation, further enhancing segmentation accuracy while reducing latency. To safeguard data transmission between IoT devices and MEC servers, the system incorporates post-quantum cryptographic techniques-specifically Kyber for encryption and Dilithium for digital signatures-providing resistance against potential quantum-computing attacks. The proposed approach achieves 98% segmentation accuracy on the KiTS19 dataset while addressing deep learning challenges such as the vanishing gradient problem, resulting in stable model performance. Overall, this combination of quantum-inspired computing and reinforcement learning with post-quantum cryptographic protection demonstrates the potential for secure and efficient medical image analysis in IoT environments, contributing to improved diagnostics and treatment planning in resource-and security-constrained healthcare settings.

TI Triplet-radical spin entanglement: potential of molecular materials for
   high-temperature quantum information processing
SO NPG ASIA MATERIALS
AB Recently, spin-bearing molecules have been experimentally demonstrated to have great potential as building blocks for quantum information processing due to their substantial advantages including tunability, portability, and scalability. Here, we propose a theoretical model based on the theory of open quantum systems for spin dynamics in a molecule containing one radical, which can interact with the triplet state arising from another part of the molecule owing to optical excitation and intersystem crossing. With the initial state being a classical mixture of a radical 1/2-spin, the exchange interaction between the radical and the triplet produces a spin coherent state, which could potentially be used for a qubit-qutrit quantum entangling gate. Our calculations for the time-resolved electron paramagnetic resonance spectra showed good qualitative agreement with the related experimental results for radical-bearing molecules at high temperature (similar to 77 K, the boiling point of liquid nitrogen). This work therefore lays a solid theoretical cornerstone for optically driven quantum gate operations in radical-bearing molecular materials, aiming toward high-temperature quantum information processing.

AB In the current Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum era, quantum circuit analysis is an essential technique for designing high-performance quantum programs. Current analysis methods exhibit either accuracy limitations or high computational complexity for obtaining precise results. To reduce this tradeoff, we propose QuCT, a unified framework for extracting, analyzing, and optimizing quantum circuits. The main innovation of QuCT is to vectorize each gate with each element, quantitatively describing the degree of the interaction with neighboring gates. Extending from the vectorization model, we propose two representative downstream models for fidelity prediction and unitary decomposition. The fidelity prediction model performs a linear transformation on all gate vectors and aggregates the results to estimate the overall circuit fidelity. By identifying critical weights in the transformation matrix, we propose two optimizations to improve the circuit fidelity. In the unitary decomposition model, we significantly reduce the search space by bridging the gap between unitary and circuit via gate vectors. Experiments show that QuCT improves the accuracy of fidelity prediction by 4.2x on 5-qubit and 18-qubit quantum devices and achieves 2.5x fidelity improvement compared to existing quantum compilers [19, 55]. In unitary decomposition, QuCT achieves 46.3x speedup for 5-qubit unitary and more than hundreds of speedup for 8-qubit unitary, compared to the state-of-the-art method [87].

AB The execution of quantum algorithms typically requires classical pre- and post-processing, making quantum applications inherently hybrid. Classical resources are of particular importance for so-called variational quantum algorithms, as they leverage classical computational power to overcome the limitations imposed by today's noisy quantum devices. However, the additional complex tasks required by these algorithms, complicate the challenge of integrating quantum circuit executions with classical programs. To overcome this challenge, we leverage the advantages and versatility of workflows, and introduce a workflow modeling extension for orchestrating variational quantum algorithms. The modeling extension comprises new task types, data objects, and a comprehensible graphical notation. Furthermore, we ensure interoperability and portability by providing a method for transforming all new modeling constructs to native modeling constructs, and showcase the practical feasibility of our modeling extension by presenting a system architecture, prototype, and case study.

TI Construction of bias-preserving operations for pair-cat codes
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Fault-tolerant quantum computation with depolarization error often requires demanding error threshold and resource overhead. If the operations can maintain high noise bias-dominated by dephasing error with small bit-flip error-we can achieve hardware-efficient fault-tolerant quantum computation with a more favorable error threshold. Distinct from two-level physical systems, multilevel systems (such as harmonic oscillators) can achieve a desirable set of bias-preserving quantum operations while using continuous engineered dis-sipation or Hamiltonian protection to stabilize to the encoding subspace. For example, cat codes stabilized with driven-dissipation or Kerr nonlinearity can possess a set of bias-preserving gates while continuously correcting bosonic dephasing error. However, cat codes are not compatible with continuous quantum error correction against excitation loss error, because it is challenging to continuously monitor the parity to correct photon loss errors. In this work, we generalize the bias-preserving operations to pair-cat codes, which can be regarded as a multimode generalization of cat codes, to be compatible with continuous quantum error correction against both bosonic loss and dephasing errors. Our results open the door towards hardware-efficient robust quantum information processing with both bias-preserving operations and continuous quantum error correction simultaneously correcting bosonic loss and dephasing errors.

TI QUANTUM CORRELATIONS AND FISHER INFORMATION IN MULTIPARTITE TWO-LEVEL
   SYSTEM UNDER KERR MEDIUM EFFECT
SO THERMAL SCIENCE
AB This paper investigates the evolution of global quantum discord (GQD) and quantum Fisher information (QFI) of the interaction of multiple two-level atomic systems (TLS) with a single thermal field mode and a non-linear Kerr medium (NLKM) considering the cases of intrinsic decoherence and its absence. Results indicate that increasing the number of atomic systems (N) while maintaining the NLKM parameter constant chi leads to higher GQD and QFI values for both intrinsic intrinsic decoherence cases. With rising chi, the GQD values decrease but the oscillation rate of the GQD increases. The presence of intrinsic decoherence does not significantly reduce the GQD quasi-static value compared to the no-decoherence scenario for certain chi values. At the same time, a different trend is observed for higher chi values. The average QFI value rises with reduced oscillation amplitudes for higher chi values and larger N subsystems. Unlike the GQD, higher chi values aid in maintaining average QFI in the presence of intrinsic decoherence. For moving TLS, changing chi does not alter the oscillation periods of the GQD and QFI. The GQD values decrease with increased chi in the moving system case, while the QFI improves with higher chi values. Additionally, higher average thermal photons within the system suppress the GQD and QFI values and decrease oscillation amplitudes for both quantifiers.

TI Graph gauge theory of mobile non-Abelian anyons in a qubit stabilizer
   code
SO ANNALS OF PHYSICS
AB Stabilizer codes allow for non-local encoding and processing of quantum information. Deformations of stabilizer surface codes introduce new and non-trivial geometry, in particular leading to emergence of long sought after objects known as projective Ising non-Abelian anyons. Braiding of such anyons is a key ingredient of topological quantum computation. We suggest a simple and systematic approach to construct effective unitary protocols for braiding, manipulation and readout of non-Abelian anyons and preparation of their entangled states. We generalize the surface code to a more generic graph with vertices of degree 2, 3 and 4. Our approach is based on the mapping of the stabilizer code defined on such a graph onto a model of Majorana fermions charged with respect to two emergent gauge fields. One gauge field is akin to the physical magnetic field. The other one is responsible for emergence of the non-Abelian anyonic statistics and has a purely geometric origin. This field arises from assigning certain rules of orientation on the graph known as the Kasteleyn orientation in the statistical theory of dimer coverings. Each 3 -degree vertex on the graph carries the flux of this "Kasteleyn"field and hosts a non-Abelian anyon. In our approach all the experimentally relevant operators are unambiguously fixed by locality, unitarity and gauge invariance. We illustrate the power of our method by making specific prescriptions for experiments verifying the non-Abelian statistics.& COPY; 2023 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Inc.

TI The Value of the Early-Time Lieb-Robinson Correlation Function for Qubit
   Arrays
SO SYMMETRY-BASEL
AB The Lieb-Robinson correlation function is one way to capture the propagation of quantum entanglement and correlations in many-body systems. We consider arrays of qubits described by the tranverse-field Ising model and examine correlations as the expanding front of entanglement first reaches a particular qubit. Rather than a new bound for the correlation function, we calculate its value, both numerically and analytically. A general analytical result is obtained that enables us to analyze very large arrays of qubits. The velocity of the entanglement front saturates to a constant value, for which an analytic expression is derived. At the leading edge of entanglement, the correlation function is well-described by an exponential reduced by the square root of the distance. This analysis is extended to arbitrary arrays with general coupling and topologies. For regular two and three dimensional qubit arrays with near-neighbor coupling we find the saturation values for the direction-dependent Lieb-Robinson velocity. The symmetry of the underlying 2D or 3D lattice is evident in the shape of surfaces of constant entanglement, even as the correlations front expands over hundreds of qubits.

TI Long-range quantum entanglement in dielectric mu-near-zero metamaterials
SO LIGHT-SCIENCE & APPLICATIONS
AB Entanglement is paramount in quantum information processing. Many quantum systems suffer from spatial decoherence in distances over a wavelength and cannot be sustained over short time periods due to dissipation. However, long range solutions are required for the development of quantum information processing on chip. Photonic reservoirs mediating the interactions between qubits and their environment are suggested. Recent research takes advantage of extended wavelength inside near-zero refractive index media to solve the long-range problem along with less sensitivity on the position of quantum emitters. However, those recent proposals use plasmonic epsilon near-zero waveguides that are intrinsically lossy. Here, we propose a fully dielectric platform, compatible with the Nitrogen Vacancy (NV) diamond centers on-chip technology, to drastically improve the range of entanglement over 17 free-space wavelengths, or approximatively 12.5 mu m, using mu near-zero metamaterials. We evaluate transient and steady state concurrence demonstrating an order of magnitude enhancement compared to previous works. This is, to the best of our knowledge, the first time that such a long distance is reported using this strategy. Moreover, value of the zero time delay second order correlation function g12(2)(0)\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$${g}_{12}<^>{(2)}(0)$$\end{document} are provided, showing antibunching signature correlated with a high degree of concurrence.

TI Quantum circuit mapping for universal and scalable computing in
   MZI-based integrated photonics
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Linear optical quantum computing (LOQC) offers a quantum computation paradigm based on well -established and robust technology and flexible environmental conditions following DiVincenzo's criteria. Within this framework, integrated photonics can be utilized to achieve gate -based quantum computing, defining qubits by path -encoding, quantum gates through the use of Mach-Zehnder interferometers (MZIs), and measurements through single -photon detectors. In particular, universal two-qubit gates can be achieved by suitable structures of MZIs together with post -selection or heralding. The most resource -efficient choice is given by the post -selected Controlled -Z (CZ) gate. However, this implementation is characterized by a design which has a non -regular structure and cannot be cascaded. This limits the implementation of large-scale LOQC. Starting from these issues, we suggest an approach to move toward a universal and scalable LOQC on the integrated photonic platform. First of all, choosing the post -selected CZ as a universal two-qubit gate, we extend the path -encoded dual -rail qubit to a triplet of waveguides, composed of an auxiliary waveguide and the pair of waveguides corresponding to the qubit basis states. Additionally, we introduce a swap photonic network that maps the regularly -labeled structure of the new path -encoded qubits to the structure needed for the post -selected CZ. We also discuss the optical swap gate that allows the connection of non -nearest neighbor path -encoded qubits. In this way, we can deterministically exchange the locations of the qubits and execute controlled quantum gates between any path -encoded qubits. Next, by truncating the auxiliary waveguides after any post -selected CZ, we find that it is possible to cascade this optical gate when it acts on different pairs that share only one qubit. Finally, we show the Bell state and the Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) state generation circuits implementing the regular structure, the cascading procedure of post -selected CZ and the optical swap.

TI One-shot static entanglement cost of bipartite quantum channels
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We first investigate the one-shot static entanglement cost to simulate a bipartite quantum channel under the set of nonentangling channels. The lower bound on the one-shot static entanglement cost is given by the generalized robustness of the target channel as well as the robust-generating power of the channel, which implies that the cost necessary to generate a bipartite quantum channel might not be retrievable in general. Next, we conceive a set of quantum channels that extends the set of nonentangling channels. We find out that the one-shot static entanglement cost under the extended set of channels is given by the channel's standard log-robustness. This quantity also gives the one-shot dynamic entanglement cost under a set of free superchannels that do not generate a dynamic entanglement resource; the extended set is shown to be equivalent to the set of free superchannels.

TI Toward Practical Application of the Quantum Carleman Lattice Boltzmann
   Method in Industrial CFD Simulations
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM ENGINEERING
AB Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations are crucial in industrial applications but require extensive computational resources, particularly for extreme turbulent regimes. While classical digital approaches remain the standard, quantum computing promises a breakthrough by enabling a more efficient encoding of large-scale simulations with a limited number of qubits. This work presents a practical numerical assessment of a hybrid quantum-classical approach to CFD based on the lattice Boltzmann method (LBM). The inherently nonlinear LBM equations are linearized via a Carleman expansion and solved using the quantum Harrow-Hassidim-Lloyd algorithm (HHL). We evaluate this method on three benchmark cases featuring different boundary conditions-periodic, bounce-back, and moving wall-using state-vector emulation on high-performance computing resources. Our results confirm the validity of the approach, achieving median error fidelities on the order of 10(-3 )and success probabilities sufficient for practical quantum state sampling. Notably, the spectral properties of small lattice systems closely approximate those of larger ones, suggesting a pathway to mitigate one of HHL's bottlenecks: eigenvalue pre-evaluation.

TI Entangled States Are Harder to Transfer than Product States
SO ENTROPY
AB The distribution of entangled states is a key task of utmost importance for many quantum information processing protocols. A commonly adopted setup for distributing quantum states envisages the creation of the state in one location, which is then sent to (possibly different) distant receivers through some quantum channels. While it is undoubted and, perhaps, intuitively expected that the distribution of entangled quantum states is less efficient than that of product states, a thorough quantification of this inefficiency (namely, of the difference between the quantum-state transfer fidelity for entangled and factorized states) has not been performed. To this end, in this work, we consider n-independent amplitude-damping channels, acting in parallel, i.e., each, locally, on one part of an n-qubit state. We derive exact analytical results for the fidelity decrease, with respect to the case of product states, in the presence of entanglement in the initial state, for up to four qubits. Interestingly, we find that genuine multipartite entanglement has a more detrimental effect on the fidelity than two-qubit entanglement. Our results hint at the fact that, for larger n-qubit states, the difference in the average fidelity between product and entangled states increases with increasing single-qubit fidelity, thus making the latter a less trustworthy figure of merit.

TI Quantifying coherence of quantum channels based on the generalized
   α-z-relative Renyi entropy
SO QUANTUM INFORMATION PROCESSING
AB By using the Choi-Jamiolkowski isomorphism, we propose a well-defined coherence measure of quantum channels based on the generalized alpha-z-relative Renyi entropy. In addition, we present an alternative coherence measure of quantum channels by quantifying the commutativity between the channels and the completely dephasing channels with the generalized alpha-z-relative Renyi entropy. Some elegant properties of the measures are illustrated in detail. Explicit formulas of these coherence measures are derived for some detailed typical quantum channels.

TI Quantum Key Distribution-Adaptation-Based Security Enhancement of
   Software-Defined Optical Network via Dynamic Quantum Resource Management
SO IET QUANTUM COMMUNICATION
AB With the rising demand for secure and reliable telecommunication networks, efficient resource allocation strategies in quantum key distribution-based software-defined optical networks (SDONs) are becoming essential. In this research, we propose a heuristic adaptive quantum routing (RWTA_AQR) algorithm for routing, wavelength and timeslot assignment. RWTA_AQR utilises the FirstFit algorithm to assign wavelengths in both contiguous and noncontiguous timeslots for optimal resource utilisation based on the priority. To verify its effectiveness, the proposed RWTA_AQR is tested on NSFNET and UBN24 network topologies under diversified traffic models, towards low as well as high demand, network congestion scenarios. We use network security performance (NSP), success ratio of connection requests, timeslot utilisation, quantum key utilisation, blocking probability (BP) and security downgrade ratio as metrics to prove its effectiveness against the existing methods based on flexible security level, strict security level and classical approach. The results demonstrate that RWTA_AQR performs better by allowing NSP of up to 90% and having the lowest BP (below 10%) at lower traffic load. The proposed solution provides a systematic trade-off in security and resource utilisation with controlled overhead for improving the performance of QKD-SDONs in dynamic resource-constrained environments.

TI Artificial Intelligence-Assisted Design and Virtual Diagnostic for the
   Initial Condition of a Storage-Ring-Based Quantum Information System
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Developments in Artificial Intelligence (AI) are helping to solve complex physical problems that otherwise may be too computationally demanding to solve using traditional approaches. Universal Approximation Theorems tell us that we can model any physical system if we can approximate the system with some continuous function (i.e., compact convergence topology and algorithmically generated sets of functions, such as the convolutional neural network), whether for an arbitrary depth or arbitrary width neural network. We consider the problem of solving a set of N coupled algebraic equations as N becomes very large and apply machine learning (ML) to solve this problem for any value of N. The physical problem we are focusing on is to model the equilibrium positions of ions in an ion trap. A storage ring quantum computer could contain well over tens of thousands of ions. Quickly determining the equilibrium positions will be important to minimize the time to target and observe each ion. As each ion serves as a single qubit, this is important for setting and measuring the individual qubit states. The phonon modes from a collection of ions acts as another qubit, useful for gate operations. Measuring the phonon modes, where ions are oscillating around their respective equilibrium positions also means understanding the equilibrium positions very well. Turning all of this into a virtual diagnostic allows real time prediction and comparison to ensure unique definition of each ion.

TI Percolation Theories for Quantum Networks
SO ENTROPY
AB Quantum networks have experienced rapid advancements in both theoretical and experimental domains over the last decade, making it increasingly important to understand their large-scale features from the viewpoint of statistical physics. This review paper discusses a fundamental question: how can entanglement be effectively and indirectly (e.g., through intermediate nodes) distributed between distant nodes in an imperfect quantum network, where the connections are only partially entangled and subject to quantum noise? We survey recent studies addressing this issue by drawing exact or approximate mappings to percolation theory, a branch of statistical physics centered on network connectivity. Notably, we show that the classical percolation frameworks do not uniquely define the network's indirect connectivity. This realization leads to the emergence of an alternative theory called "concurrence percolation", which uncovers a previously unrecognized quantum advantage that emerges at large scales, suggesting that quantum networks are more resilient than initially assumed within classical percolation contexts, offering refreshing insights into future quantum network design.

TI Free electrons can induce entanglement between photons
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Entanglement of photons is a fundamental feature of quantum mechanics, which stands at the core of quantum technologies such as photonic quantum computing, communication, and sensing. An ongoing challenge in all these is finding an efficient and controllable mechanism to entangle photons. Recent experimental developments in electron microscopy enable to control the quantum interaction between free electrons and light. Here, we show that free electrons can create entanglement and bunching of light. Free electrons can control the second-order coherence of initially independent photonic states, even in spatially separated cavities that cannot directly interact. Free electrons thus provide a type of optical nonlinearity that acts in a nonlocal manner, offering a way of heralding the creation of entanglement. Intriguingly, pre-shaping the electron's wavefunction provides the knob for tuning the photonic quantum correlations. The concept can be generalized to entangle not only photons but also photonic quasiparticles such as plasmon-polaritons and phonons.

TI Quantum Control Landscapes for Generation of H and T Gates
   in an Open Qubit with Both Coherent and Environmental Drive
SO PHOTONICS
AB An important problem in quantum computation is the generation of single-qubit quantum gates such as Hadamard (H) and pi/8 (T) gates, which are components of a universal set of gates. Qubits in experimental realizations of quantum computing devices are interacting with their environment. While the environment is often considered as an obstacle leading to a decrease in the gate fidelity, in some cases, it can be used as a resource. Here, we consider the problem of the optimal generation of H and T gates using coherent control and the environment as a resource acting on the qubit via incoherent control. For this problem, we studied the quantum control landscape, which represents the behavior of the infidelity as a functional of the controls. We considered three landscapes, with infidelities defined by steering between two, three (via Goerz-Reich-Koch approach), and four matrices in the qubit Hilbert space. We observed that, for the H gate, which is a Clifford gate, for all three infidelities, the distributions of minimal values obtained with a gradient search have a simple form with just one peak. However, for the T gate, which is a non-Clifford gate, the situation is surprisingly different-this distribution for the infidelity defined by two matrices also has one peak, whereas distributions for the infidelities defined by three and four matrices have two peaks, which might indicate the possible existence of two isolated minima in the control landscape. It is important that, among these three infidelities, only those defined with three and four matrices guarantee the closeness of the generated gate to a target and can be used as a good measure of closeness. We studied sets of optimized solutions for the most general and previously unexplored case of coherent and incoherent controls acting together and discovered that they form sub-manifolds in the control space, and unexpectedly, in some cases, two isolated sub-manifolds.

To create the quantum ALU, we utilized IBM's Python package Qiskit and JupyterLab. We believe that a quantum ALU has the potential to be faster than its classical counterpart and the ability to calculate quantum specific operations. The simple classical functions translated to a quantum circuit show a promising future for the development of a full quantum ALU with unique quantum operations.

This study presents a detailed, mathematically oriented overview of the round-three finalists of NIST's post-quantum cryptography standardization consisting of the lattice-based key encapsulation mechanisms (KEMs) CRYSTALS-Kyber, NTRU and SABER; the code-based KEM Classic McEliece; the lattice-based signature schemes CRYSTALS-Dilithium and FALCON; and the multivariate-based signature scheme Rainbow. The above-cited algorithm descriptions are precise technical specifications intended for cryptographic experts. Nevertheless, the documents are not well-suited for a general interested mathematical audience. Therefore, the main focus is put on the algorithms' corresponding algebraic foundations, in particular LWE problems, NTRU lattices, linear codes and multivariate equation systems with the aim of fostering a broader understanding of the mathematical concepts behind post-quantum cryptography.

TI Solving free fermion problems on a quantum computer
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Simulating noninteracting fermion systems is a common task in computational many-body physics. In the absence of translational symmetries, modeling free fermions on N modes usually requires poly(N) computational resources. While often moderate, these costs can be prohibitive in practice when large systems are considered. We present several free fermion problems that can be solved by a quantum algorithm with substantially reduced computational costs. The memory costs are exponentially improved, poly log(N). The run-time improvement, compared to the best known classical algorithms, is either exponential or significantly polynomial, depending on the geometry of the problem. The simulation of free fermion dynamics belongs to the BQP-hard complexity class (i.e., as hard as any (decision) problem that can be solved on a quantum computer). This implies (under standard assumptions) that our algorithm yields an exponential speedup for any classical algorithm at least for some geometries. The key technique in our algorithm is the block encoding of objects such as correlation matrices and Green's functions into a unitary. We demonstrate how such unitaries can be efficiently realized as quantum circuits, in the context of dynamics and thermal states of tight-binding Hamiltonians. The special cases of disordered and inhomogeneous lattices, as well as large nonlattice graphs, are presented in detail. Finally, we show that our simulation algorithm generalizes to other promising targets, including free-boson systems.

The approach is shaped as a set of four principles that have been pointed out to design instructional materials to enhance the educational and cultural potential of quantum computing, beyond the technical aspects. In the paper, following a presentation of the design principles, we focus on an activity on quantum teleportation protocol. The activity is described in detail to show how the principles have been concretely implemented. A pilot study with a small sample of secondary school students has been carried out to evaluate the potential of the approach. The results, although preliminary, show that the approach appears to be promising in creating an inclusive and productive learning environment, in which students feel encouraged to search for personal ways to combine different levels of discourse (narrative, logical, mathematical, technicalexperimental) and generate meaningful descriptions of the phenomenon.

TI Preparation of quantum correlations assisted by a steering Maxwell demon
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW E
AB A Maxwell demon can reduce the entropy of a quantum system by performing measurements on its environment. The nonsignaling theorem prevents the demon from affecting the average state of the system. We study the preparations of quantum correlations from a system qubit and an auxiliary qubit, assisted by a demon who obtains information of the system qubit from measurements on its environment. The demon can affect the postmeasured states of system by choosing different measurements, which establishes the relationships between quantum steering and other correlations in the thermodynamic framework. We present the optimal protocols for creating mutual information, entanglement, and Bell-nonlocality. These maximal correlations are found to relate exactly to the steerable boundary of the system-environment state with maximally mixed marginals. We also present upper bounds of the prepared correlations by utilizing classical environment-system correlation, which can be regarded as steering-type inequalities bounding the correlations created with the aid of classical demons.

TI One-Shot Min-Entropy Calculation of Classical-Quantum States and Its
   Application to Quantum Cryptography
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB In quantum Shannon theory, various kinds of quantum entropies are used to characterize the capacities of noisy physical systems. Among them, min-entropy and its smooth version attract wide interest especially in the field of quantum cryptography as they can be used to bound the information obtained by an adversary. However, calculating the exact value or nontrivial bounds of min-entropy are extremely difficult because the composite system dimension may scale exponentially with the dimension of its subsystem. Here, we develop a one-shot lower bound calculation technique for the min-entropy of a classical-quantum state that is applicable to both finite and infinite dimensional reduced quantum states. Moreover, we show our technique is of practical interest in at least three situations. First, it offers an alternative tight finite-data analysis for the BB84 quantum key distribution scheme. Second, it gives the best finite-key bound known to date for a variant of device independent quantum key distribution protocol. Third, it provides a security proof for a novel source-independent continuous-variable quantum random number generation protocol. These results show the effectiveness and wide applicability of our approach.

For example, it allows designers to insert classical logic (defined at a high abstraction level, e.g., a Python function) directly into quantum circuits. We describe its design principles, concrete implementation, and, in particular, the library's core: An intuitive and flexible intermediate representation (IR) that supports different abstraction levels across the same circuit structure.

TI Local fermion-to-qudit mappings: A practical recipe for four-level
   systems
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB In this paper, we present a set of local fermion-to-qudit mappings for simulating fermionic lattice systems. We focus on the use of multilevel qudits, specifically ququarts. Traditional mappings, such as the Jordan-Wigner transformation (JWT), while useful, often result in nonlocal operators that scale unfavorably with system size. To address these challenges, we introduce mappings that efficiently localize fermionic operators on qudits, reducing the nonlocality and operator weights associated with JWT. We propose one mapping for spinless fermions and two mappings for spinful fermions, comparing their performance in terms of qudit weight, circuit depth, and gate complexity. Notably, for superconducting devices, the control complexity of qudits compared to qubits does not increase prohibitively for four-level systems, making them practical for near-term demonstrations, though control challenges grow with increasing dimensionality. Therefore, we provide solutions to the operator decompositions of the Trotterized quantum dynamics into one- and two-qudit gates for all mappings. By leveraging the extended local Hilbert space of qudits, we show that these mappings enable more efficient quantum simulations in terms of two-qudit gates, reducing hardware requirements without increasing computational complexity. We validate our approach by simulating prototypical models such as the spinless t-V model and the Fermi-Hubbard model in two dimensions, using Trotterized time evolution. Finally, we show the connection between the plaquette constraint of our mapping and the Z2 toric code. This connection can be exploited to prove that the ground state of the localized qudit mapping can be efficiently prepared using quantum circuits or measurement-based feedback control. Our results highlight the potential of qudit-based quantum simulations in achieving scalability and efficiency for fermionic systems on near-term quantum devices.

TI Quantum Complexity and Chaos in Many-Qudit Doped Clifford Circuits
SO QUANTUM
AB We investigate the emergence of quantum complexity and chaos in doped Clifford circuits acting on qudits of odd prime dimension d. Using doped Clifford Weingarten calculus and a replica tensor network formalism, we derive exact results and perform large-scale simulations in regimes challenging for tensor network and Pauli-based methods. We begin by analyzing generalized stabilizer entropies-computable magic monotones in many-qudit systems-and identify a dynamical phase transition in the doping rate, marking the breakdown of classical simulability and the onset of Haar-random behavior. The critical behavior is governed by the qudit dimension and the magic content of the non-Clifford gate. Using the qudit T-gate as a benchmark, we show that higher-dimensional qudits converge faster to Haar-typical stabilizer entropies. For qutrits (d = 3), analytical predictions match numerics on brickwork circuits, showing that locality plays a limited role in magic spreading. We also examine anticoncentration and entanglement growth, showing that O (log N) non-Clifford gates suffice for approximating Haar expectation values to precision epsilon, and relate antiflatness measures to stabilizer entropies in qutrit systems. Finally, we analyze out-of-time-order correlators and show that a finite density of non-Clifford gates is needed to induce chaos, with a sharp transition fixed by the local dimension-twice that of the magic transition. Altogether, these results establish a unified framework for diagnosing complexity in doped Clifford circuits and deepen our understanding of resource theories in multiqudit systems.

TI Impact of dynamics, entanglement and Markovian noise on the fidelity of
   few-qubit digital quantum simulation
SO JOURNAL OF PLASMA PHYSICS
AB Quantum algorithms have been proposed to accelerate the simulation of the chaotic dynamical systems that are ubiquitous in the physics of plasmas. Quantum computers without error correction might even use noise to their advantage to calculate the Lyapunov exponent by measuring the Loschmidt echo fidelity decay rate. For the first time, digital Hamiltonian simulations of the quantum sawtooth map, performed on the IBM-Q quantum hardware platform, show that the fidelity decay rate of a digital quantum simulation increases during the transition from dynamical localization to chaotic diffusion in the map. The observed error per CNOT gate increases by $1.5{\times }$ as the dynamics varies from localized to diffusive, while only changing the phases of virtual RZ gates and keeping the overall gate count constant. A gate-based Lindblad noise model that captures the effective change in relaxation and dephasing errors during gate operation qualitatively explains the effect of dynamics on fidelity as being due to the localization and entanglement of the states created. Specifically, highly delocalized states that are entangled with random phases show an increased sensitivity to dephasing and, on average, a similar sensitivity to relaxation as localized states. In contrast, delocalized unentangled states show an increased sensitivity to dephasing but a lower sensitivity to relaxation. This gate-based Lindblad model is shown to be a useful benchmarking tool by estimating the effective Lindblad coherence times during CNOT gates and finding a consistent $2\unicode{x2013}3{\times }$ shorter $T_2$ time than reported for idle qubits. Thus, the interplay of the dynamics of a simulation with the noise processes that are active can strongly influence the overall fidelity decay rate.

TI Towards practical and massively parallel quantum computing emulation for
   quantum chemistry
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Quantum computing is moving beyond its early stage and seeking for commercial applications in chemical and biomedical sciences. In the current noisy intermediate-scale quantum computing era, the quantum resource is too scarce to support these explorations. Therefore, it is valuable to emulate quantum computing on classical computers for developing quantum algorithms and validating quantum hardware. However, existing simulators mostly suffer from the memory bottleneck so developing the approaches for large-scale quantum chemistry calculations remains challenging. Here we demonstrate a high-performance and massively parallel variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) simulator based on matrix product states, combined with embedding theory for solving large-scale quantum computing emulation for quantum chemistry on HPC platforms. We apply this method to study the torsional barrier of ethane and the quantification of the protein-ligand interactions. Our largest simulation reaches 1000 qubits, and a performance of 216.9 PFLOP/s is achieved on a new Sunway supercomputer, which sets the state-of-the-art for quantum computing emulation for quantum chemistry.

TI Continuous variable port-based teleportation
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS A-MATHEMATICAL AND THEORETICAL
AB Port-based teleportation (PBT) is a generalisation of the standard teleportation protocol which does not require unitary operations by the receiver. This comes at the price of requiring N > 1 entangled pairs, while N = 1 for the standard teleportation protocol. The lack of correction unitaries allows PBT to be used as a fundamental theoretical tool to simulate arbitrary channels with a general resource, with applications to study fundamental limits of quantum communication, cryptography and sensing, and to define general programmable quantum computers. Here we introduce a general formulation of port-based teleportation in continuous variable systems and study in detail the N = 2 case. In particular, we interpret the resulting channel as an energy truncation and analyse the kinds of channels that can be naturally simulated after this restriction.

TI Effects of quantum decoherence in a future supernova neutrino detection
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
AB Quantum decoherence effects in neutrinos, described by the open quantum systems formalism, serve as a gateway to explore potential new physics, including quantum gravity. Previous research extensively investigated these effects across various neutrino sources, imposing stringent constraints on the spontaneous loss of coherence. In this study, we demonstrate that even within the supernovae environment, where neutrinos are released as incoherent states, quantum decoherence could influence the flavor equipartition of 3v mixing. Additionally, we examine the potential energy dependence of quantum decoherence parameters (F = F0(E=E0)n) with different power laws (n = 0; 2; 5=2). Our findings indicate that future-generation detectors (DUNE, Hyper-K, and JUNO) can significantly constrain quantum decoherence effects under different scenarios. For a supernova located 10 kpc away from Earth, if no quantum decoherence is observed, DUNE could potentially establish 3u bounds of F <= 6.2 x 10-14 eV in the normal mass hierarchy (NH) scenario, while Hyper-K would impose a 2u limit of F <= 3.6 x 10-14 eV for the inverted mass hierarchy (IH) with n = 0-assuming no energy exchange between the neutrino subsystem and nonstandard environment. These limits become even more restrictive for a closer supernova. When we relax the assumption of energy exchange, for a 10 kpc distance, DUNE could establish a 3u limit of F8 <= 4.2 x 10-28 eV for NH, while Hyper-K could constrain F8 <= 1.3 x 10-27 eV for IH (n = 0) with 2u, which would be orders of magnitude stronger than the bounds reported to date. Furthermore, we examine the impact of neutrino loss during propagation for future supernova detection.

TI Unveiling quantum phase transitions from traps in variational quantum
   algorithms
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Understanding quantum phase transitions in physical systems is fundamental to characterize their behavior at low temperatures. Achieving this requires both accessing good approximations to the ground state and identifying order parameters to distinguish different phases. Addressing these challenges, our work introduces a hybrid algorithm that combines quantum optimization with classical machine learning. This approach leverages the capability of near-term quantum computers to prepare locally trapped states through finite optimization. Specifically, we apply LASSO for identifying conventional phase transitions and the Transformer model for topological transitions, utilizing these with a sliding window scan of Hamiltonian parameters to learn appropriate order parameters and locate critical points. We validated the method with numerical simulations and real-hardware experiments on Rigetti's Ankaa 9Q-1 quantum computer. This protocol provides a framework for investigating quantum phase transitions with shallow circuits, offering enhanced efficiency and, in some settings, higher precision-thus contributing to the broader effort to integrate near-term quantum computing and machine learning.

TI Robustness of diabatic enhancement in quantum annealing
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB In adiabatic quantum annealing, the speed with which an anneal can be run, while still achieving a high final ground state (GS) fidelity, is dictated by the size of the minimum gap that appears between the ground and first excited state in the annealing spectrum. To avoid the exponential slowdown associated with exponentially closing gaps, diabatic transitions to higher energy levels may be exploited in such a way that the system returns to the GS before the end of the anneal. In certain cases, this is facilitated by the original annealing spectrum. However, there are also examples where careful manipulation of the annealing Hamiltonian has been used to alter the spectrum to create a diabatic path to the GS. Since diabatic transitions depend on the evolution rate and the gap sizes in the spectrum, it is important to consider the sensitivity of any potential enhancement to changes in the anneal time as well as any parameters involved in the manipulation of the spectrum. We explore this sensitivity using annealing spectra containing an exponentially closing gap and an additional, tuneable, small gap created by a catalyst. We find that there is a trade-off between the precision needed in the catalyst strength and the anneal time in order to maintain the enhancement to the final GS fidelity.

TI Rapid and unconditional parametric reset protocol for tunable
   superconducting qubits
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Qubit initialization is a critical task in quantum computation and communication. Extensive efforts have been made to achieve this with high speed, efficiency and scalability. However, previous approaches have either been measurement-based and required fast feedback, suffered from crosstalk or required sophisticated calibration. Here, we report a fast and high-fidelity reset scheme, avoiding the issues above without any additional chip architecture. By modulating the flux through a transmon qubit, we realize a swap between the qubit and its readout resonator that suppresses the excited state population to 0.08% +/- 0.08% within 34 ns (284 ns if photon depletion of the resonator is required). Furthermore, our approach (i) can achieve effective second excited state depletion, (ii) has negligible effects on neighboring qubits, and (iii) offers a way to entangle the qubit with an itinerant single photon, useful in quantum communication applications.
   Reliable and fast active reset protocols are key to the functioning of quantum computing systems. Here, the authors use parametric driving to swap an excitation from a transmon qubit to its readout resonator within 34 ns, with negligible effects on neighboring qubits.

TI Quantum computing for fusion energy science applications
SO PHYSICS OF PLASMAS
AB This is a review of recent research exploring and extending present-day quantum computing capabilities for fusion energy science applications. We begin with a brief tutorial on both ideal and open quantum dynamics, universal quantum computation, and quantum algorithms. Then, we explore the topic of using quantum computers to simulate both linear and nonlinear dynamics in greater detail. Because quantum computers can only efficiently perform linear operations on the quantum state, it is challenging to perform nonlinear operations that are generically required to describe the nonlinear differential equations of interest. In this work, we extend previous results on embedding nonlinear systems within linear systems by explicitly deriving the connection between the Koopman evolution operator, the Perron-Frobenius evolution operator, and the Koopman-von Neumann evolution (KvN) operator. We also explicitly derive the connection between the Koopman and Carleman approaches to embedding. Extension of the KvN framework to the complex-analytic setting relevant to Carleman embedding, and the proof that different choices of complex analytic reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces depend on the choice of Hilbert space metric are covered in the appendixes. Finally, we conclude with a review of recent quantum hardware implementations of algorithms on present-day quantum hardware platforms that may one day be accelerated through Hamiltonian simulation. We discuss the simulation of toy models of wave-particle interactions through the simulation of quantum maps and of wave-wave interactions important in nonlinear plasma dynamics. (C) 2023 Author(s).

AB Circuit description languages are a class of quantum programming languages in which programs are classical and produce a description of a quantum computation, in the form of a quantum circuit. Since these programs can leverage all the expressive power of high-level classical languages, circuit description languages have been successfully used to describe complex and practical quantum algorithms, whose circuits, however, may involve many more qubits and gate applications than current quantum architectures can actually muster. In this paper, we present Proto-Quipper-R, a circuit description language endowed with a linear dependent type-and-effect system capable of deriving parametric upper bounds on the width of the circuits produced by a program. We prove both the standard type safety results and that the resulting resource analysis is correct with respect to a big-step operational semantics. We also show that our approach is expressive enough to verify realistic quantum algorithms.

TI Efficient evaluation of Arrhenius rates for quantum computing
   applications in reactive flow problems using Carleman linearization
SO PROCEEDINGS OF THE COMBUSTION INSTITUTE
AB This research introduces a novel approach toward integrating quantum computing into reactive flow analysis in combustion science, addressing the challenges posed by the nonlinear behavior of Arrhenius reaction rates. Combustion systems are described by nonlinear equations. Quantum computers, however, work based on linear algebra and are good at solving linear systems, necessitating a method to bridge this disparity. The study utilizes Carleman linearization, a technique that transforms nonlinear equations into linear ones, making them suitable for quantum algorithms. To address the exponential temperature dependence of Arrhenius rate constants, Taylor series expansions are employed. The method is validated through numerical simulations of ignition in H2/air and CH4/air mixtures. By examining the impact of truncation order in Carleman linearization and fitting order in the Taylor expansion, the study balances computational accuracy and cost. Results reveal that higher-order approximations improve accuracy but can introduce numerical stiffness, particularly in systems with high activation energies, such as CH4/air in this study.

TI Leveraging analog quantum computing with neutral atoms for solvent
   configuration prediction in drug discovery
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB We introduce an approach to sampling equilibrium solvent water molecule configurations within proteins that leverages analog quantum computing. We present a complete end-to-end study from the molecular biology application to the development of the quantum algorithm to the implementation on a neutral atom quantum processing unit (QPU). To do so, we combine a quantum placement strategy to the 3D Reference Interaction Site Model, an approach capable of predicting continuous solvent distributions. The intrinsic quantum nature of such coupling guarantees molecules not to be placed too close to each other, a constraint usually imposed by hand in classical approaches. We present first a full quantum adiabatic evolution model that uses a local Rydberg Hamiltonian to cast the general problem into an antiferromagnetic Ising model. Its solution is embodied into a Rydberg atom array QPU. Following a classical emulator implementation, a QPU portage allows to experimentally validate the algorithm performances on an actual quantum computer. As a perspective of use on next generation devices, we emulate a second hybrid quantum-classical version of the algorithm. Such a variational quantum approach uses a classical Bayesian minimization routine to find the optimal laser parameters. Overall, these Quantum-3D-RISM algorithms open a route towards the application of analog quantum computing in molecular modeling and drug design.

TI Quantum convolutional neural network for classical data classification
SO QUANTUM MACHINE INTELLIGENCE
AB With the rapid advance of quantum machine learning, several proposals for the quantum-analogue of convolutional neural network (CNN) have emerged. In this work, we benchmark fully parameterized quantum convolutional neural networks (QCNNs) for classical data classification. In particular, we propose a quantum neural network model inspired by CNN that only uses two-qubit interactions throughout the entire algorithm. We investigate the performance of various QCNN models differentiated by structures of parameterized quantum circuits, quantum data encoding methods, classical data pre-processing methods, cost functions and optimizers on MNIST and Fashion MNIST datasets. In most instances, QCNN achieved excellent classification accuracy despite having a small number of free parameters. The QCNN models performed noticeably better than CNN models under the similar training conditions. Since the QCNN algorithm presented in this work utilizes fully parameterized and shallow-depth quantum circuits, it is suitable for Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices.

TI Quantum simulation of fundamental particles and forces
SO NATURE REVIEWS PHYSICS
AB Quantum simulations of the fundamental particles and forces of nature have a central role in understanding key static and dynamic quantum properties of matter. Motivations, techniques and future challenges for simulations of quantum fields are discussed, highlighting examples of early progress towards the dynamics of high-density, non-equilibrium systems of quarks, gluons and neutrinos.
   Key static and dynamic properties of matter - from creation in the Big Bang to evolution into subatomic and astrophysical environments - arise from the underlying fundamental quantum fields of the standard model and their effective descriptions. However, the simulation of these properties lies beyond the capabilities of classical computation alone. Advances in quantum technologies have improved control over quantum entanglement and coherence to the point at which robust simulations of quantum fields are anticipated in the foreseeable future. In this Perspective article, we discuss the emerging area of quantum simulations of standard-model physics, outlining the challenges and opportunities for progress in the context of nuclear and high-energy physics.

TI Trade-Offs on Number and Phase Shift Resilience in Bosonic Quantum Codes
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION THEORY
AB Quantum codes typically rely on large numbers of degrees of freedom to achieve low error rates. However each additional degree of freedom introduces a new set of error mechanisms. Hence minimizing the degrees of freedom that a quantum code utilizes is helpful. One quantum error correction solution is to encode quantum information into one or more bosonic modes. We revisit rotation-invariant bosonic codes, which are supported on Fock states that are gapped by an integer g apart, and the gap g imparts number shift resilience to these codes. Intuitively, since phase operators and number shift operators do not commute, one expects a trade-off between resilience to number-shift and rotation errors. Here, we obtain results pertaining to the non-existence of approximate quantum error correcting g-gapped single-mode bosonic codes with respect to Gaussian dephasing errors. We show that by using arbitrarily many modes, g-gapped multi-mode codes can yield good approximate quantum error correction codes for any finite magnitude of Gaussian dephasing and amplitude damping errors.

TI Performance of quantum annealing inspired algorithms for combinatorial
   optimization problems
SO COMMUNICATIONS PHYSICS
AB Two classes of quantum-annealing-inspired-algorithms (QAIA), namely different variants of simulated coherent Ising machine and simulated bifurcation, have been proposed for efficiently solving combinatorial optimization problems recently. In order to certify the superiority of these algorithms, standardized comparisons among them and against other physics-based algorithms are necessary. In this work, for Max-Cut problems up to 20,000 nodes, we benchmark QAIA against quantum annealing and other physics-based algorithms. We found that ballistic simulated bifurcation excelled for chimera and small-scale graphs, achieving nearly a 50-fold reduction in time-to-solution compared to quantum annealing. For large-scale graphs, discrete simulated bifurcation achieves the lowest time-to-target and outperforms D-Wave Advantage system when tasked with finding the maximum cut value in pegasus graphs. Our results suggest that QAIA represents a promising means for solving combinatorial optimization problems in practice, and can act as a natural baseline for competing quantum algorithms.
   One of the most considered applications for quantum-inspired algorithms is solving combinatorial optimization problems. In this manuscript, the authors benchmark several quantum-annealing-inspired algorithms against other state-of-the-art optimizers and quantum annealer, comparing their success probabilities and time-to-solution.

TI Error-tolerant oblivious transfer in the noisy-storage model
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB The noisy-storage model of quantum cryptography allows for information-theoretically secure two-party computation based on the assumption that a cheating user has at most access to an imperfect, noisy quantum memory, whereas the honest users do not need a quantum memory at all. In general, the more noisy the quantum memory of the cheating user, the more secure the implementation of oblivious transfer, which is a primitive that allows universal secure two-party and multiparty computation. For experimental implementations of oblivious transfer, one has to consider that also the devices held by the honest users are lossy and noisy, and error correction needs to be applied to correct these trusted errors. The latter are expected to reduce the security of the protocol, since a cheating user may hide themselves in the trusted noise. Here we leverage entropic uncertainty relations to derive tight bounds on the security of oblivious transfer with a trusted and untrusted noise. In particular, we discuss noisy storage and bounded storage, with independent and correlated noise.

TI Random Quantum Circuits
SO ANNUAL REVIEW OF CONDENSED MATTER PHYSICS
AB Quantum circuits-built from local unitary gates and local measurements-are a new playground for quantum many-body physics and a tractable setting to explore universal collective phenomena far from equilibrium. These models have shed light on longstanding questions about thermalization and chaos, and on the underlying universal dynamics of quantum information and entanglement. In addition, such models generate new sets of questions and give rise to phenomena with no traditional analog, such as dynamical phase transitions in quantum systems that are monitored by an external observer. Quantum circuit dynamics is also topical in view of experimental progress in building digital quantum simulators that allow control of precisely these ingredients. Randomness in the circuit elements allows a high level of theoretical control, with a key theme being mappings between real-time quantum dynamics and effective classical lattice models or dynamical processes. Many of the universal phenomena that can be identified in this tractable setting apply to much wider classes of more structured many-body dynamics.

TI Versatile and Concurrent FPGA-Based Architecture for Practical Quantum
   Communication Systems
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM ENGINEERING
AB This article presents a hardware and software architecture, which can be used in those systems that implement practical quantum key distribution (QKD) and quantum random-number generation (QRNG) schemes. This architecture fully exploits the capability of a System on a Chip (SoC), which comprehends both a field-programmable gate array (FPGA) and a dual-core CPU unit. By assigning the time-related tasks to the FPGA and the management to the CPU, we built a flexible system with optimized resource sharing on a commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) evaluation board, which includes an SoC. Furthermore, by changing the dataflow direction, the versatile system architecture can be exploited as a QKD transmitter, QKD receiver, and QRNG control-acquiring unit. Finally, we exploited the dual-core functionality and realized a concurrent stream device to implement a practical QKD transmitter, where one core continuously receives fresh data at a sustained rate from an external QRNG source, while the other operates with the FPGA to drive the qubit transmission to the QKD receiver. The system was successfully tested on a long-term run proving its stability and security. This demonstration paves the way toward a more secure QKD implementation, with fully unconditional security as the QKD states are entirely generated by a true random process and not by deterministic expansion algorithms. Eventually, this enables the realization of a standalone quantum transmitter, including both the random numbers and the qubit generation.

TI Quantum Computing Meets Deep Learning: A QCNN Model for Accurate and
   Efficient Image Classification
SO MATHEMATICS
AB In deep learning, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) serve as fundamental models, leveraging the correlational structure of data for tasks such as image classification and processing. However, CNNs face significant challenges in terms of computational complexity and accuracy. Quantum computing offers a promising avenue to overcome these limitations by introducing a quantum counterpart-Quantum Convolutional Neural Networks (QCNNs). QCNNs significantly reduce computational complexity, enhance the models ability to capture intricate patterns, and improve classification accuracy. This paper presents a fully parameterized QCNN model, specifically designed for Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices. The proposed model employs two-qubit interactions throughout the algorithm, leveraging parameterized quantum circuits (PQCs) with rotation and entanglement gates to efficiently encode and process image data. This design not only ensures computational efficiency but also enhances compatibility with current quantum hardware. Our experimental results demonstrate the model's notable performance in binary classification tasks on the MNIST dataset, highlighting the potential of quantum-enhanced deep learning in image recognition. Further, we extend our framework to the Wine dataset, reformulated as a binary classification problem distinguishing Class 0 wines from the rest. The QCNN again demonstrates remarkable learning capability, achieving 97.22% test accuracy. This extension validates the versatility of the model across domains and reinforces the promising role of quantum neural networks in tackling a broad range of classification tasks.

TI Quantum Computing Method for Solving Electromagnetic Problems Based on
   the Finite Element Method
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON MICROWAVE THEORY AND TECHNIQUES
AB Applying quantum computation to solve electromagnetic (EM) problems is still at an early age. Recently, an initial study on applying quantum computation to solve the finite element method (FEM) equations in the EM domain has been made. This article makes a further development beyond the initial study. Specifically, we first develop an approach to systematically prepare the quantum state to represent the right-hand side (RHS) vector of the finite element equation in EM problems. Then, to reduce the number of gates needed in the quantum state preparation process, we propose a quantum-gate-reduction method, which explores the fact that the FEM cells in the input port are a small portion of the total cells in the 3-D EM structure and that the number of gates needed for state preparation depends on the RHS vector's sparsity pattern. Based on the proposed quantum-gate-reduction method, we further derive the upper and lower bounds analytically for the number of gates needed in the quantum state preparation circuit. Furthermore, to deal with the large condition number of the finite element matrix in EM, we leverage a matrix preconditioner to modify the original linear equations, so as to reduce the number of qubits required in using quantum computation to solve EM problems. Two EM examples are used to illustrate how the proposed quantum computing method can be used to find solutions to EM problems.

TI Barriers of adopting quantum technology in blockchain: a

SO SOFT COMPUTING
AB The advent of quantum technology holds significant transformative potential for blockchain systems, promising new realms of security, speed, and efficiency. However, the lack of clear guidelines for adopting and implementing quantum technology within blockchain presents a critical challenge. This research aims to address this problem, bridging the gap by investigating the essential process areas needing expert attention while integrating quantum technology in the blockchain. To address this study, firstly, we have identified challenging factors of adopting quantum technology in blockchain reported by the existing literature. Secondly, we conducted a questionnaire survey study and get the experts opinions conceding to the criticality of the identified challenges towards adopting quantum technology in blockchain. According to the results of this study, lack of adequate expertise, security concerns and regulatory hurdles are the top-ranked barriers for considering quantum computing in blockchain technology. Moreover, the result of this study provides a prioritization-based taxonomy that assists the practitioners and researchers to consider the highest-ranked barriers on priority.

TI Suppressing laser phase noise in an optomechanical system
SO FRONTIERS OF PHYSICS
AB We propose a scheme to suppress the laser phase noise without increasing the optomechanical single-photon coupling strength. In the scheme, the parametric amplification terms, created by Kerr and Duffing nonlinearities, can restrain laser phase noise and strengthen the effective optomechanical coupling, respectively. Interestingly, decreasing laser phase noise leads to increasing thermal noise, which is inhibited by bringing in a broadband-squeezed vacuum environment. To reflect the superiority of the scheme, we simulate quantum memory and stationary optomechanical entanglement as examples, and the corresponding numerical results demonstrate that the laser phase noise is extremely suppressed. Our method can pave the way for studying other quantum phenomena.

TI New and improved bounds on the contextuality degree of multi-qubit
   configurations
SO MATHEMATICAL STRUCTURES IN COMPUTER SCIENCE
AB We present algorithms and a C code to reveal quantum contextuality and evaluate the contextuality degree (a way to quantify contextuality) for a variety of point-line geometries located in binary symplectic polar spaces of small rank. With this code we were not only able to recover, in a more efficient way, all the results of a recent paper by de Boutray et al. [(2022). Journal of Physics A: Mathematical and Theoretical 55 475301], but also arrived at a bunch of new noteworthy results. The paper first describes the algorithms and the C code. Then it illustrates its power on a number of subspaces of symplectic polar spaces whose rank ranges from 2 to 7. The most interesting new results include: (i) non-contextuality of configurations whose contexts are subspaces of dimension 2 and higher, (ii) non-existence of negative subspaces of dimension 3 and higher, (iii) considerably improved bounds for the contextuality degree of both elliptic and hyperbolic quadrics for rank 4, as well as for a particular subgeometry of the three-qubit space whose contexts are the lines of this space, (iv) proof for the non-contextuality of perpsets and, last but not least, (v) contextual nature of a distinguished subgeometry of a multi-qubit doily, called a two-spread, and computation of its contextuality degree. Finally, in the three-qubit polar space we correct and improve the contextuality degree of the full configuration and also describe finite geometric configurations formed by unsatisfiable/invalid constraints for both types of quadrics as well as for the geometry whose contexts are all 315 lines of the space.

TI Controlling All Degrees of Freedom of the Optical Coupling in Hybrid
   Quantum Photonics
SO ACS PHOTONICS
AB Nanophotonic quantum devices can significantly boost light-matter interaction, which is important for applications such as quantum networks. Reaching a high interaction strength between an optical transition of a spin system and a single mode of light is an essential step that demands precise control over all degrees of freedom of the optical coupling. While current devices have reached a high accuracy of emitter positioning, the placement process remains overall statistically, reducing the device fabrication yield. Furthermore, not all degrees of freedom of the optical coupling can be controlled, limiting the device performance. Here, we develop a hybrid approach based on negatively charged silicon vacancy center in nanodiamonds coupled to a mode of a Si3N4-photonic crystal cavity, where all terms of the coupling strength can be controlled individually. We used the frequency of coherent Rabi oscillations and line-broadening as a measure of the device performance. This allows for iterative optimization of the position and rotation of the dipole with respect to individual preselected modes of light. Therefore, our work marks an important step for optimization of hybrid quantum photonics and enables us to align device simulations with real device performance.

AB Description of quantum many-body dynamics is extremely challenging on classical computers, as it requires taking into account many degrees of freedom. In nuclear physics, this translates on a large number of break up channels that have to be taken into account depending on available energy. Even using classical computing exascale capabilities will not allow a full description of dynamical processes starting from internucleon interactions beyond drastic approximations. On the other hand, the dynamics can be naturally implemented on quantum hardware that is designed to easily handle unitary transformations, and hence the hope that in the future we will be able to obtain reaction observables from first principles. In this contribution, I describe the main steps involved in quantum algorithms and review our efforts to apply quantum computing to the nuclear many-body problem using realistic inter-nucleon interactions.

TI Theoretical Investigation on Repeated Quantum Error Detection Based on
   Surface Codes
SO ACTA OPTICA SINICA
AB Objective Quantum computing represents a transformative computational paradigm with the potential to solve problems intractable for classical computers, ranging from molecular simulation to cryptography. However, the practical realization of quantum computation faces significant challenges due to the inherent fragility of quantum systems under environmental noise. Quantum error correction (QEC) has become an essential approach to protect quantum information, with surface codes demonstrating particular promise due to their high fault-tolerance thresholds and compatibility with near-term quantum hardware. Despite these advantages, existing surface code implementations typically require substantial numbers of physical qubits, creating a critical bottleneck for practical deployment on current quantum processors with limited qubit counts. To address this challenge, we propose an optimized surface code architecture that reduces resource requirements while maintaining robust error correction capabilities. Methods We present a 6-qubit surface code architecture comprising 4 data qubits and 2 strategically reused ancilla qubits. The key innovation lies in the development of a repeated error detection protocol that enables sequential measurement of three stabilizer operators (X0X1X2X3, Z(0)Z(2), and Z(1)Z(3)) through careful qubit reset and reuse operations. This hybrid approach combines elements of both serial and parallel measurement schemes to optimize resource utilization. We implement comprehensive numerical simulations using Qiskit Aer with realistic noise models, including amplitude damping (T-1) and pure dephasing (T phi) noise at experimentally relevant parameters (20 mu s). The simulations evaluate logical qubit performance through multiple metrics, including lifetime and coherence time under various noise conditions. Results and Discussions The 6-qubit architecture demonstrates remarkable performance, achieving a 14% reduction in physical qubit requirements compared to the 7-qubit implementations reported by Andersen et al, while maintaining full error detection capabilities. Under amplitude damping noise (T-1 = 20 mu s), the logical qubit shows a lifetime (Fig. 3) of (92.06 +/- 1.37) mu s (4.6 times improvement over physical qubits). For pure dephasing noise (T phi= 20 mu s), the logical coherence time (Fig. 4) reaches (172.95 +/- 3.51) mu s (8.6 times enhancement). These improvements persist under combined noise conditions (T-1 = T phi= 20 mu s), with the logical qubit exhibiting a 3.1-fold extension in lifetime (Fig. 5) and a 4.6-fold extension in coherence time (Fig. 6) compared to physical qubits. This demonstrates the architecture's robustness in practical experimental environments. Compared with the aforementioned 7-qubit surface code implementation, the proposed approach achieves comparable error detection performance while requiring reduced resource overhead. The 7-qubit scheme provides slightly faster measurement cycles through fully parallel stabilizer measurements, but requires additional physical qubits that may be prohibitive for near-term devices. Conversely, a more aggressive 5-qubit approach, where only one measurement qubit is required, while theoretically possible, would require complete serialization of stabilizer measurements, resulting in a 43% increase in measurement cycle time that could critically impact performance in coherence-limited systems.
   Our 6-qubit solution strikes an optimal balance, offering meaningful resource savings (14% reduction compared with 7-qubit) while maintaining operational efficiency (with only slightly longer cycles than 7-qubit). Conclusions In summary, we demonstrate that strategic architectural optimization can yield significant improvements in both resource efficiency and error detection capability for surface code implementations. The 6-qubit variant represents a pragmatic solution for current quantum hardware, offering a balanced compromise between the resource demands of conventional surface codes and the limitations of more radical reductions. Future research directions should focus on experimental realization across different hardware platforms, integration with efficient decoding algorithms, and extension to fault-tolerant logical operations. As quantum processors continue to scale, such resource-efficient approaches will become increasingly important for bridging the gap between theoretical QEC schemes and practical implementation.

TI Variational quantum algorithms with invariant probabilistic error
   cancellation on noisy quantum processors
SO SCIENCE CHINA-PHYSICS MECHANICS & ASTRONOMY
AB In the noisy intermediate-scale quantum era, emerging classical-quantum hybrid optimization algorithms, such as variational quantum algorithms (VQAs), can leverage the unique characteristics of quantum devices to accelerate computations tailored to specific problems with shallow circuits. However, these algorithms encounter biases and iteration difficulties due to significant noise in quantum processors. These difficulties can only be partially addressed without error correction by optimizing hardware, reducing circuit complexity, or fitting and extrapolating. A compelling solution is applying probabilistic error cancellation (PEC), a quantum error mitigation technique that enables unbiased results without full error correction. Traditional PEC is challenging to apply in VQAs due to its variance amplification, contradicting iterative process assumptions. This paper proposes a novel noise-adaptable strategy that combines PEC with the quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA). It is implemented through invariant sampling circuits (invariant-PEC, or IPEC) and substantially reduces iteration variance. This strategy marks the first successful integration of PEC and QAOA, resulting in efficient convergence. Moreover, we introduce adaptive partial PEC (APPEC), which modulates the error cancellation proportion of IPEC during iteration. We experimentally validate this technique on a superconducting quantum processor, cutting sampling cost by 90.1%. Notably, we find that dynamic adjustments of error levels via APPEC can enhance the ability to escape from local minima and reduce sampling costs. These results open promising avenues for executing VQAs with large-scale, low-noise quantum circuits, paving the way for practical quantum computing advancements.

TI Quantum neural networks with multi-qubit potentials
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB We propose quantum neural networks that include multi-qubit interactions in the neural potential leading to a reduction of the network depth without losing approximative power. We show that the presence of multi-qubit potentials in the quantum perceptrons enables more efficient information processing tasks such as XOR gate implementation and prime numbers search, while it also provides a depth reduction to construct distinct entangling quantum gates like CNOT, Toffoli, and Fredkin. This simplification in the network architecture paves the way to address the connectivity challenge to scale up a quantum neural network while facilitating its training.

AB Optimization of quantum programs or circuits is a fundamental problem in quantum computing and remains a major challenge. State-of-the-art quantum circuit optimizers rely on heuristics and typically require superlinear, and even exponential, time. Recent work [8] proposed a new approach that pursues a weaker form of optimality called local optimality. Parameterized by a natural number O, local optimality insists that each and every Omega-segment of the circuit is optimal with respect to an external optimizer, called the oracle. Local optimization can be performed using only a linear number of calls to the oracle but still incurs quadratic computational overheads in addition to oracle calls. Perhaps most importantly, the algorithm is sequential.
   In this paper, we present a parallel algorithm for local optimization of quantum circuits. To ensure efficiency, the algorithm operates by keeping a set of fingers into the circuit and maintains the invariant that a O-deep circuit needs to be optimized only if it contains a finger. Operating in rounds, the algorithm selects a set of fingers, optimizes in parallel the segments containing the fingers, and updates the finger set to ensure the invariant. For constant Omega, we prove that the algorithm requires O (n lg n) work and r (n lg n) span, where n is the circuit size and r is the number of rounds. We prove that the optimized circuit returned by the algorithm is locally optimal in the sense that any Omega-segment of the circuit is optimal with respect to the oracle.
   To assess the algorithm's effectiveness in practice, we implement it in the Rust programming language and evaluate it by considering a range of quantum benchmarks and several state-of-the-art optimizers. The evaluation shows that the algorithm is work efficient and scales well as the number of processors (cores) increases. On our benchmarks, the algorithm outperforms existing optimizers, which are all sequential, by as much as several orders of magnitude, without degrading the quality. Our code is available on GitHub at https://github.com/UmutAcarLab/popqc.

TI Free-space continuous-variable quantum key distribution under high

SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB One of the difficulties in the application of quantum communication is the fragility of its encoded quantum states. Conventional quantum key distribution (QKD) requires strict filtering operations at the receiver. Any ambient light entering the system can significantly increase the bit error rate and even render the system inoperable. We present a continuous-variable quantum key distribution (CV-QKD) system that can function effectively during the day or even on rainy days without complex filtering operations. The Gaussian modulated coherent state continuous-variable quantum key distribution (GMCS CV-QKD) system demonstrates robustness, maintaining a secure key rate (SKR) of more than 100 kbps when operating at a frequency of 10 MHz, which lays the foundation for low-cost, highly robust free-space quantum communication.

TI Effect of Induced Transition on the Quantum Entanglement and Coherence

SO ANNALEN DER PHYSIK
AB Studying quantum properties in solid-state systems is a significant avenue for research. In this scenario, double quantum dots appear as a versatile platform for technological breakthroughs in quantum computation and nanotechnology. This work inspects the thermal entanglement and quantum coherence in two-coupled DODs, where the system is exposed to an external stimulus that induces an electronic transition within each subsystem. The results show that the introduction of external stimulus induces a quantum level crossing that relies upon the Coulomb potential changing the degree of quantum entanglement and coherence of the system. Thus, the quantum properties of the system can be tuned by changing the transition frequency, leading to the enhancement of its quantum properties.

TI Implementation of the Rydberg double anti-blockade regime and the
   quantum logic gate based on resonant dipole-dipole interactions
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB Quantum information science is an emerging field that applies the quantum coherence and correlation to cause the revolutionary advances in computation, communication, and fundamental quantum science. As an irreducible ingredient, Rydberg quantum gate is considered to be a powerful resource with great promises to a wide range of quantum information tasks far beyond the original gate proposals, since the remarkable features characterized by Rydberg atom are long lifetime and giant polarizability. In recent years, the research mainly focused on the properties of Rydberg atom, especially for the case where the effects of Rydberg blockade and antiblockade involving single level for each atom are dominated by van der Waals forces. However, with the variation of interatomic distance, Rydberg interactions can induce more complicated dynamical behavior. This paper studies the implementation of controlled-phase gate and swap gate in one step based on the constructed Rydberg antiblockade (RAB) and double antiblockade (RDAB) regimes when the interatomic distance is less than the characteristic length. Different from the conventional RAB regime that requires weak Rydberg-Rydberg interaction (RRI), our attainable strategy is to compensate the RRI-induced energy shift by properly tuning the detuning between the driving field and atomic transition frequencies. In addition, the proposed RDAB mechanism is a new physical insight that can enable two pairs of Rydberg states belonging to different atoms to be excited, simultaneously. In contrast to other blocking schemes or the schemes without requirements for strong interactions, the merits of our proposal lies in the strong dipole-dipole interaction between two atoms, leading to the population exchange of multiple energy levels. Numerical simulations show that the time evolution of the population for collective double-atom basis obtained from the original Hamiltonian agrees well with the analytical results given by the effective Hamiltonian. In the ideal case, the average fidelity of the controlled-phase (swap) gate can reach 99.35% (99.67%) at final time t = root 2 pi Delta/Omega(2) (t = 2 pi/Omega(2)), and our protocol is robustness against spontaneous emission of high-lying Rydberg states. We believe our present investigation is feasible in upcoming experimental realization and may offer an new venue with respect to on-demand design of new types of effective Rydberg quantum gate devices.

We provide a complete characterization of this class of maps showing intricate relation between positivity, operator Schwarz inequality, and complete positivity. Finally, it is shown how to generalize the entire picture beyond unital case (so called generalized Schwarz maps). Interestingly, the first example of Schwarz but not completely positive map found by Choi belongs to our class. As a case study we provide a full characterization of Pauli maps.

TI A gate tunable transmon qubit in planar Ge
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Gate-tunable transmons (gatemons) employing semiconductor Josephson junctions have recently emerged as building blocks for hybrid quantum circuits. In this study, we present a gatemon fabricated in planar Germanium. We induce superconductivity in a two-dimensional hole gas by evaporating aluminum atop a thin spacer, which separates the superconductor from the Ge quantum well. The Josephson junction is then integrated into an Xmon circuit and capacitively coupled to a transmission line resonator. We showcase the qubit tunability in a broad frequency range with resonator and two-tone spectroscopy. Time-domain characterizations reveal energy relaxation and coherence times up to 75 ns. Our results, combined with the recent advances in the spin qubit field, pave the way towards novel hybrid and protected qubits in a group IV, CMOS-compatible material.
   A gatemon is a transmon-type superconducting qubit made using a hybrid superconductor-semiconductor approach enabling tunability with electric gates. Here the authors demonstrate a gatemon qubit in planar germanium, which is anticipated to have various advantages.

TI Correlated charge noise and relaxation errors in superconducting qubits
SO NATURE
AB The central challenge in building a quantum computer is error correction. Unlike classical bits, which are susceptible to only one type of error, quantum bits (qubits) are susceptible to two types of error, corresponding to flips of the qubit state about the X and Z directions. Although the Heisenberg uncertainty principle precludes simultaneous monitoring of X- and Z-flips on a single qubit, it is possible to encode quantum information in large arrays of entangled qubits that enable accurate monitoring of all errors in the system, provided that the error rate is low1. Another crucial requirement is that errors cannot be correlated. Here we characterize a superconducting multiqubit circuit and find that charge noise in the chip is highly correlated on a length scale over 600 micrometres; moreover, discrete charge jumps are accompanied by a strong transient reduction of qubit energy relaxation time across the millimetre-scale chip. The resulting correlated errors are explained in terms of the charging event and phonon-mediated quasiparticle generation associated with absorption of.-rays and cosmic-ray muons in the qubit substrate. Robust quantum error correction will require the development of mitigation strategies to protect multiqubit arrays from correlated errors due to particle impacts.

TI Noise-Aware Quantum Amplitude Estimation
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM ENGINEERING
AB In this article, based on some simple and reasonable assumptions, we derive a Gaussian noise model for quantum amplitude estimation. We provide results from quantum amplitude estimation run on various IBM superconducting quantum computers and on Quantinuum's H1 trapped-ion quantum computer to show that the proposed model is a good fit for real-world experimental data. We also show that the proposed Gaussian noise model can be easily composed with other noise models in order to capture effects that are not well described by Gaussian noise. We give a generalized procedure for how to embed this noise model into any quantum-phase-estimation-free quantum amplitude estimation algorithm, such that the amplitude estimation is "noise aware." We then provide experimental results from running an implementation of noise-aware quantum amplitude estimation using data from an IBM superconducting quantum computer, demonstrating that the addition of "noise awareness" serves as an effective means of quantum error mitigation.

TI Rapid and efficient wavefront correction for spatially entangled photons
   using symmetrized optimization
SO APL PHOTONICS
AB Spatial entanglement is a key resource in quantum technologies, enabling applications in quantum communication, imaging, and computation. However, propagation through complex media distorts spatial correlation, posing a challenge for practical implementations. We introduce a symmetrized genetic algorithm (sGA) for adaptive wavefront correction of spatially entangled photons, leveraging the insight that only the even-parity component of wavefront distortions affects two-photon correlation. By enforcing symmetry constraints, sGA reduces the optimization parameter space by half, leading to faster convergence and improved enhancement within a finite number of generations compared to standard genetic algorithms. In addition, we establish the dependence of enhancement on the signal-to-noise ratio of the feedback signal, which is controlled by detector integration time. This technique enables correction of entanglement degradation, enhancing quantum imaging, secure quantum communication, and quantum sensing in complex environments.

TI A Performance-Consumption Balanced Scheme of Multi-Hop Quantum Networks
   for Teleportation
SO APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
AB Teleportation is an important protocol in quantum communication. Realizing teleportation between arbitrary nodes in multi-hop quantum networks is of great value. Most of the existing multi-hop quantum networks are based on Bell states or Greeberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) states. Bell state is more susceptible to noise than GHZ states after purification, but generating a GHZ state consumes more basic states. In this paper, a new quantum multi-hop network scheme is proposed to improve the interference immunity of the network and avoid large consumption at the same time. Teleportation is realized in a network based on entanglement swapping, fusion, and purification. To ensure the robustness of the system, we also design the purification algorithm. The simulation results show the successful establishment of entanglement with high fidelity. Cirq is used to verify the network on the Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) platform. The robustness of the fusion scheme is better than the Bell states scheme, especially with the increasing number of nodes. This paper provides a solution to balance the performance and consumption in a multi-hop quantum network.

TI Avoiding coherent errors with rotated concatenated stabilizer codes
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Coherent errors, which arise from collective couplings, are a dominant form of noise in many realistic quantum systems, and are more damaging than oft considered stochastic errors. Here, we propose integrating stabilizer codes with constant-excitation codes by code concatenation. Namely, by concatenating an [[n,k,d]] stabilizer outer code with dual-rail inner codes, we obtain a [[2n,k,d]] constant-excitation code immune from coherent phase errors and also equivalent to a Pauli-rotated stabilizer code. When the stabilizer outer code is fault-tolerant, the constant-excitation code has a positive fault-tolerant threshold against stochastic errors. Setting the outer code as a four-qubit amplitude damping code yields an eight-qubit constant-excitation code that corrects a single amplitude damping error, and we analyze this code's potential as a quantum memory.

TI Macroscopic quantum teleportation with ensembles of qubits
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We develop methods for performing quantum teleportation of the total spin variables of an unknown state, using quantum nondemolition measurements, spin projection measurements, and classical communication. While, theoretically, teleportation of high-dimensional states can be attained with the assumption of generalized Bell measurements, this is typically experimentally nontrivial to implement. We introduce two protocols and show that on average, the teleportation succeeds in teleporting the spin variables of a spin coherent state with average zero angular error in the ideal case, beating classical strategies based on quantum state estimation. In a single run of the teleportation, there is an angular error at the level of similar to 0.1 radians for large ensembles. A potential physical implementation for the scheme is with atomic ensembles and quantum nondemolition measurements performed with light. We analyze the decoherence of the protocols and find that the protocol is robust even in the limit of large ensemble sizes.

TI Percolation Distribution in Small-World Quantum Networks
SO APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
AB Quantum networks have good prospects for applications in the future. Compared with classical networks, small-world quantum networks have some interesting properties. The topology of the network can be changed through entanglement exchange operations, and different network topologies will result in different percolation thresholds when performing entanglement percolation. A lower percolation threshold means that quantum networks require fewer minimum resources for communication. Since a shared singlet between two nodes can still be a limitation, concurrency percolation theory (ConPT) can be used to relax the condition. In this paper, we investigate how entanglement distribution is performed in small-world quantum networks to ensure that nodes in the network can communicate with each other by establishing communication links through entanglement swapping. Any node can perform entanglement swapping on only part of the connected edges, which can reduce the influence of each node in the network during entanglement swapping. In addition, the ConPT method is used to reduce the percolation threshold even further, thus obtaining a better network structure and reducing the resources required.

TI Designing microplastic-binding peptides with a variational quantum
   circuit-based hybrid quantum-classical approach
SO SCIENCE ADVANCES
AB De novo peptide design exhibits great potential in materials engineering, particularly for the use of plastic-binding peptides to help remediate microplastic pollution. There are no known peptide binders for many plastics-a gap that can be filled with de novo design. Current computational methods for peptide design exhibit limitations in sampling and scaling that could be addressed with quantum computing. Hybrid quantum-classical methods can leverage complementary strengths of near-term quantum algorithms and classical techniques for complex tasks like peptide design. This work introduces a hybrid quantum-classical generative framework for designing plastic-binding peptides combining variational quantum circuits with a variational autoencoder network. We demonstrate the framework's effectiveness in generating peptide candidates, evaluate its efficiency for property-oriented design, and validate the candidates with molecular dynamics simulations. This quantum computing-based approach could accelerate the development of biomolecular tools for environmental and biomedical applications while advancing the study of biomolecular systems through quantum technologies.

TI Classical simulations of noisy variational quantum circuits
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Noise detrimentally affects quantum computations so that they not only become less accurate but also easier to simulate classically as systems scale up. We construct a classical simulation algorithm, lowesa (low weight efficient simulation algorithm), for estimating expectation values of noisy parameterised quantum circuits with a fixed observable. It combines previous results on spectral analysis of parameterised circuits with Pauli back-propagation and recent ideas for simulations of noisy random circuits. We show, under some conditions on the circuits and mild assumptions on noise, that lowesa gives an efficient, polynomial algorithm in the number of qubits (and depth), with approximation error that vanishes exponentially in the physical error rate and a controllable cutoff parameter. This is valid for any expectation value that may be efficiently evaluated on a quantum computer. We discuss the practical limitations of the method for circuit classes with correlated parameters and its scaling with decreasing error rates.

TI Leveraging off-the-shelf silicon chips for quantum computing
SO APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS
AB There is a growing demand for quantum computing across various sectors, including finance, materials, and studying chemical reactions. A promising implementation involves semiconductor qubits utilizing quantum dots within transistors. While academic research labs currently produce their own devices, scaling this process is challenging, requires expertise, and results in devices of varying quality. Some initiatives are exploring the use of commercial transistors, offering scalability, improved quality, affordability, and accessibility for researchers. This paper delves into potential realizations and the feasibility of employing off-the-shelf commercial devices for qubits. It addresses challenges such as noise, coherence, limited customizability in large industrial fabs, and scalability issues. The exploration includes discussions on potential manufacturing approaches for early versions of small qubit chips. The use of state-of-the-art transistors as hosts for quantum dots, incorporating readout techniques based on charge sensing or reflectometry, and methods like electron shuttling for qubit connectivity are examined. Additionally, more advanced designs, including 2D arrays and crossbar or DRAM-like access arrays, are considered for the path toward accessible quantum computing.

TI Symmetries in quantum networks lead to no-go theorems for entanglement
   distribution and to verification techniques
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB The analysis of correlations in quantum networks is a difficult problem in the general case, and have so far been limited to small examples. Here, the authors show how to use symmetries and the inflation technique to derive general network entanglement criteria and certification methods.
   Quantum networks are promising tools for the implementation of long-range quantum communication. The characterization of quantum correlations in networks and their usefulness for information processing is therefore central for the progress of the field, but so far only results for small basic network structures or pure quantum states are known. Here we show that symmetries provide a versatile tool for the analysis of correlations in quantum networks. We provide an analytical approach to characterize correlations in large network structures with arbitrary topologies. As examples, we show that entangled quantum states with a bosonic or fermionic symmetry can not be generated in networks; moreover, cluster and graph states are not accessible. Our methods can be used to design certification methods for the functionality of specific links in a network and have implications for the design of future network structures.

TI Ultra-Compact and Ultra-Broadband Polarization-Insensitive Mach-Zehnder
   Interferometer in Silicon-on-Insulator Platform for Quantum Internet
   Application
SO PHOTONICS
AB Polarization dependence in integrated silicon photonics has a detrimental effect on the manipulation of quantum state with different polarizations in the quantum technology. Those limits have profound implications for further technological developments, especially in quantum photonic internet. Here, we propose a polarization-independent Mach-Zehnder interferometer (MZI) structure based on a 340 nm-thick silicon-on-insulator (SOI) platform. The MZI facilitates low loss, broad operating bandwidth, and large tolerance of the fabrication imperfection. We achieve an excess loss of 18 in the 100 nm bandwidth (1500 similar to 1600 nm) for both transverse electric (TE) and transverse magnetic (TM) modes. We numerically demonstrate an interference visibility of 99% and a polarization-independent loss (PDL) of 0.03 for both polarizations at 1550 nm. Furthermore, by using the principle of phase compensation and self-image, we shorten the length of the waveguide taper by almost an order of magnitude with the transmission of > 95% for both TE and TM polarizations. Up to now, the proposed structure could significantly improve the integration and promote the development of monolithic integrated quantum internet.

TI Realistic continuous-variable quantum teleportation using a displaced
   Fock state channel
SO QUANTUM INFORMATION PROCESSING
AB We investigate ideal and non-ideal continuous-variable quantum teleportation protocols realized by using an entangled displaced Fock state resource. The characteristic function formulation is applied to measure the relative performance of displaced Fock state for teleporting squeezed and coherent states. It is found that for such single-mode input fields, the average fidelity remains at the classical threshold, suggesting that the displaced Fock states are not advantageous for teleportation. We also discuss the major decoherence effects, caused by the inaccuracy in Bell measurements and photon losses for the propagation of optical fields via fibre channels. The changes in the teleportation fidelity are described by adjusting the gain factor (g), reflectivity (R), mode damping (tau), and the number of thermal photons (n(th)). The possibility of successful teleportation can be optimized by fixing these realistic parameters.

TI Low-depth amplitude estimation on a trapped-ion quantum computer
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Amplitude estimation (AE) is a fundamental quantum algorithmic primitive that enables quantum computers to achieve quadratic speedups for a large class of statistical estimation problems, including Monte Carlo methods. Recent works have succeeded in somewhat reducing the necessary resources for AE by trading off some of the speedup for lower depth circuits, but high quality qubits are still needed for demonstrating such algorithms. Here, we report the results of an experimental demonstration of AE on a state-of-the-art trapped ion quantum computer. AE was used to estimate the inner product of randomly chosen four-dimensional unit vectors, and the low-depth AE algorithms were based on the maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) and the Chinese remainder theorem (CRT) techniques. Significant improvements in accuracy were observed for the MLE based approach when deeper quantum circuits were taken into account, including circuits with more than 90 two-qubit gates and depth 60, achieving a mean additive estimation error on the order of 10(-2). The CRT based approach was found to provided accurate estimates for many of the data points but was less robust against noise on average. Last, we analyze two more AE algorithms that take into account the specifics of the hardware noise to further improve the results.

TI On the Bipartite Entanglement Capacity of Quantum Networks
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM ENGINEERING
AB We consider the problem of multipath entanglement distribution to a pair of nodes in a quantum network consisting of devices with nondeterministic entanglement swapping capabilities. Multipath entanglement distribution enables a network to establish end-to-end entangled links across any number of available paths with preestablished link-level entanglement. Probabilistic entanglement swapping, on the other hand, limits the amount of entanglement that is shared between the nodes; this is especially the case when, due to practical constraints, swaps must be performed in temporal proximity to each other. Limiting our focus to the case where only bipartite entanglement is generated across the network, we cast the problem as an instance of generalized flow maximization between two quantum end nodes wishing to communicate. We propose a mixed-integer quadratically constrained program (MIQCP) to solve this flow problem for networks with arbitrary topology. We then compute the overall network capacity, defined as the maximum number of Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) states distributed to users per time unit, by solving the flow problem for all possible network states generated by probabilistic entangled link presence and absence, and subsequently by averaging over all network state capacities. The MIQCP can also be applied to networks with multiplexed links. While our approach for computing the overall network capacity has the undesirable property that the total number of states grows exponentially with link multiplexing capability, it nevertheless yields an exact solution that serves as an upper bound comparison basis for the throughput performance of more easily implementable yet nonoptimal entanglement routing algorithms.

TI Quantum error correction in the black hole interior
SO JOURNAL OF HIGH ENERGY PHYSICS
AB We study the quantum error correction properties of the black hole interior in a toy model for an evaporating black hole: Jackiw-Teitelboim gravity entangled with a non-gravitational bath. After the Page time, the black hole interior degrees of freedom in this system are encoded in the bath Hilbert space. We use the gravitational path integral to show that the interior density matrix is correctable against the action of quantum operations on the bath which (i) do not have prior access to details of the black hole microstates, and (ii) do not have a large, negative coherent information with respect to the maximally mixed state on the bath, with the lower bound controlled by the black hole entropy and code subspace dimension. Thus, the encoding of the black hole interior in the radiation is robust against generic, low-rank quantum operations. For erasure errors, gravity comes within an O(1) distance of saturating the Singleton bound on the tolerance of error correcting codes. For typical errors in the bath to corrupt the interior, they must have a rank that is a large multiple of the bath Hilbert space dimension, with the precise coefficient set by the black hole entropy and code subspace dimension.

TI Efficient quantum circuits based on the quantum natural gradient
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Efficient preparation of arbitrary entangled quantum states is crucial for quantum computation. This is particularly important for noisy intermediate-scale quantum simulators relying on variational hybrid quantum-classical algorithms. To that end, we propose symmetry-conserving modified quantum approximate optimization algorithm (SCom-QAOA) circuits. The depths of these circuits depend not only on the desired fidelity to the target state but also on the amount of entanglement the state contains. The parameters of the SCom-QAOA circuits are optimized using the quantum natural gradient method based on the Fubini-Study metric. The SCom-QAOA circuit transforms an unentangled state into a ground state of a gapped one-dimensional Hamiltonian with a circuit depth that depends not on the system size but rather on the finite correlation length. In contrast, the circuit depth grows proportionally to the system size for preparing low-lying states of critical one-dimensional systems. Even in the latter case, SCom-QAOA circuits with depth less than the system size were sufficient to generate states with fidelity in excess of 99%, which is relevant for near-term applications. The proposed scheme enlarges the set of the initial states accessible for variational quantum algorithms and widens the scope of investigation of nonequilibrium phenomena in quantum simulators.

TI QSAC: Quantum-assisted Secure Audio Communication using quantum
   entanglement, audio steganography, and classical encryption
SO ENGINEERING SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY-AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL-JESTECH
AB The emergence of quantum computing poses a significant security threat to the current classical cryptography system since it has the potential to outperform the current classical computer in some specific tasks due to unique principle of operation. This necessitates finding a method that is resistant to quantum computers to securely transfer information. This research addresses these challenges by proposing a novel method combining quantum key distribution (QKD), specifically the E91 protocol, with the classical encryption-authentication protocol ChaCha20-Poly1305, and concealing information within another message through steganography to securely transfer audio messages. A shared secret key is created between the communicating parties using E91 QKD, which exploits the stellar protection of quantum entanglement against eavesdropping. The shared key is hashed through the SHA-3 hash function to generate a fixed-length, high-entropy symmetric key. The audio message is hidden inside another audio signal through steganography. The steganographic signal is encrypted using ChaCha20-Poly1305 AEAD in order to provide another layer of obfuscation as well as a means verify integrity. Through rigorous experiments, we validated the robustness of the proposed methodology both classical and quantum attacks. The processing of secret audio signals of varying duration (00:01:32 00:01:36) exhibits consistent encryption results. The encrypted stego audios show high randomness, with average entropy of 15.9984, an average correlation of 1.4627 x 10-5, an average UACI of 49.9977%, and average NSCR of 99.9985%. We demonstrated the safety of the shared key using the CHSH inequality test, root where in the presence of an eavesdropper, the CHSH value is much less than 2 2. In addition, the integrity the secret audio is also validated through the verification of the authenticator tag generated during the encryption process. Our research offers a novel framework for secure audio transmission, combining classical encryption and authentication methods with QKD to enhance confidentiality, integrity, and resilience against eavesdropping and tampering, ensuring robust end-to-end security.

TI Experimental generation and characterization of partially spatially
   coherent qubits
SO PHYSICA SCRIPTA
AB Partially spatially coherent qubits are more immune to turbulent atmospheric conditions than coherent qubits, which makes them excellent candidates for free-space quantum communication. In this article, we report the generation of partially spatially coherent qubits in a spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) process using a Gaussian Schell model (GSM) pump beam. For this non-linear process, we demonstrate experimentally for the first time, the transfer of spatial coherence features of the pump (classical) to the biphotons (quantum) field. Also, the spatial profiles of partially coherent qubits generated in type-I and type-II non-collinear SPDC process are experimentally observed and multi-mode nature of partially coherent photons (qubit) is ascertained. These investigations pave the way toward the efficient generation of partially spatially coherent qubits with a tunable degree of spatial coherence, which lead to wide range of applications in frontier areas such as quantum cryptography, teleportation, imaging, and lithography.

SO JOURNAL OF HIGH ENERGY PHYSICS
AB We consider quantum-decoherence effects in neutrino oscillation data. Working in the open quantum system framework we adopt a phenomenological approach that allows to parameterize the energy dependence of the decoherence effects. We consider several phenomenological models. We analyze data from the reactor experiments RENO, Daya Bay and KamLAND and from the accelerator experiments NOvA, MINOS/MINOS+ and T2K. We obtain updated constraints on the decoherence parameters quantifying the strength of damping effects, which can be as low as Gamma ij less than or similar to 8 x 10-27 GeV at 90% confidence level in some cases. We also present sensitivities for the future facilities DUNE and JUNO.

TI A Programmable Crypto-Processor for National Institute of Standards and
   Technology Post-Quantum Cryptography Standardization Based on the RISC-V
   Architecture
SO SENSORS
AB The advancement of quantum computing threatens the security of conventional public-key cryptosystems. Post-quantum cryptography (PQC) was introduced to ensure data confidentiality in communication channels, and various algorithms are being developed. The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has initiated PQC standardization, and the selected algorithms for standardization and round 4 candidates were announced in 2022. Due to the large memory footprint and highly repetitive operations, there have been numerous attempts to accelerate PQC on both hardware and software. This paper introduces the RISC-V instruction set extension for NIST PQC standard algorithms and round 4 candidates. The proposed programmable crypto-processor can support a wide range of PQC algorithms with the extended RISC-V instruction set and demonstrates significant reductions in code size, the number of executed instructions, and execution cycle counts of target operations in PQC algorithms of up to 79%, 92%, and 87%, respectively, compared to RV64IM with optimization level 3 (-O3) in the GNU toolchain.

In this paper, we proposed a quantum KNN classification algorithm based on the Mahalanobis distance, which combines the classical KNN algorithm with quantum computing to solve supervised classification problem in machine learning. Firstly, a quantum sub-algorithm for searching the minimum of disordered data set is utilized to find out K nearest neighbors of the testing sample. Finally, its category can be obtained by counting the categories of K nearest neighbors. Moreover, it is shown that the proposed quantum algorithm has the effect of squared acceleration compared with the classical counterpart.

TI Free-mode removal and mode decoupling for simulating general
   superconducting quantum circuits
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB Superconducting quantum circuits is one of the leading candidates for a universal quantum computer. Designing novel qubit and multiqubit superconducting circuits requires the ability to simulate and analyze the properties of a general circuit. In particular, going outside the transmon approach, we cannot make assumptions on anharmonicity, thus precluding blackbox quantization approaches and necessitating the formal circuit quantization approach. We consider and solve two issues involved in simulating general superconducting circuits. One of the issues is the handling of free modes in the circuit, that is, circuit modes with no potential term in the Hamiltonian. Another issue is circuit size, namely, the challenge of simulating strongly coupled multimode circuits. The main mathematical tool we use to address these issues is the linear canonical transformation in the setting of quantum mechanics. We address the first issue by giving a provably correct algorithm for removing free modes by performing a linear canonical transformation to completely decouple the free modes from other circuit modes. We address the second by giving a series of different linear canonical transformations to reduce intermode couplings, thereby reducing the problem to the weakly coupled case and greatly mitigating the overhead for classical simulation. We benchmark our decoupling methods by applying them to the circuit of two inductively coupled fluxonium qubits, obtaining several orders of magnitude reduction in the size of the Hilbert space that needs to be simulated.

TI Quantum information processing with nuclear spins mediated by a

SO COMMUNICATIONS IN THEORETICAL PHYSICS
AB We propose a scheme to achieve nuclear-nuclear indirect interactions mediated by a mechanically driven nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in a diamond. Here we demonstrate two-qubit entangling gates and quantum-state transfer between two carbon nuclei. When the dipole-dipole interaction strength is much larger than the driving field strength, the scheme is robust against decoherence caused by coupling between the NV center (nuclear spins) and the environment. Conveniently, precise control of dipole coupling is not required so this scheme is insensitive to fluctuating positions of the nuclear spins and the NV center. Our scheme provides a general blueprint for multi-nuclear-spin gates and for multi-party communication.

TI SARS-CoV-2 spike and ACE2 entanglement-like binding
SO QUANTUM MACHINE INTELLIGENCE
AB We describe the binding between the glycoprotein Spike of SARS-CoV-2 and the human host cell receptor ACE2 as a quantum circuit, comprising the one-qubit Hadamard quantum logic gate performing the quantum superposition of the S-1 subunit of the Spike protein, and the two-qubit quantum logic gate CNOT, which performs maximum entanglement between the Spike-qubit S-1 and the ACE2 receptor protein. Also, we consider two strategies to prevent the binding process between the Spike-qubit -S1 and the ACE2 receptor. The first one is the use of competitive peptidomimetic inhibitors that can selectively bind to the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the Spike glycoprotein with much higher affinity than the cell surface receptor itself. These inhibitors are targeted to the CNOT quantum logic gate and will get maximally entangled with the S-1 qubit in place of the natural ACE2 receptor. The second one is to use covalent inhibitors, which will destroy S-1 by acting as a projective quantum measurement. Finally, the conjecture that S-1 is a quantum bio-robot is formulated.

TI Optical memory for arbitrary perfect Poincare states in an atomic
   ensemble
SO OPTICS LETTERS
AB Inherent spin angular momentum (SAM) and orbital angular momentum (OAM), which manifest as polarization and spatial degrees of freedom (DOFs) of photons, hold a promise of large capability for applications in classical and quantum information processing. To enable these photonic spin and orbital dynamic properties strongly coupled with each other, Poincare states have been proposed and offer advantages in data multiplexing, information encryption, precision metrology, and quantum memory. However, since the transverse size of Laguerre-Gaussian beams strongly depends on their topological charge numbers | l |, it is difficult to store asymmetric Poincare states due to the significantly different light-matter interaction for distinct spatial modes. Here, we experimentally realize the storage of perfect Poincare states with arbitrary OAMquanta using the perfect optical vortex, in which 121 arbitrarily selected perfect Poincare states have been stored with high fidelity. The reported work has great prospects in optical communication and quantum networks for dramatically increased encoding flexibility of information. (c) 2023 Optica Publishing Group

It is confirmed that the quasi-quantum annealing method works as well as other methods in identifying the optimum layouts, while the optimum layout of an offshore wind farm composed of even more than 100 wind turbines can be identified with reasonable CPU time.

TI Machine-learning-inspired quantum optimal control of nonadiabatic
   geometric quantum computation via reverse engineering
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Quantum control plays an irreplaceable role in practical use of quantum computers. However, some challenges have to be overcome to find more suitable and diverse control parameters. We propose a promising and generalizable average-fidelity-based machine-learning-inspired method to optimize the control parameters, in which a neural network with periodic feature enhancement is used as an ansatz. In the implementation of a single-qubit gate by cat-state nonadiabatic geometric quantum computation via reverse engineering, compared with the control parameters in the simple form of a trigonometric function, our approach can yield significantly higher-fidelity (>99.99%) phase gates, such as the pi/8 gate (T gate). Single-qubit gates are robust against systematic noise, additive white Gaussian noise, and decoherence. We numerically demonstrate that the neural network possesses the ability to expand the model space. With the help of our optimization, we provide a feasible way to implement cascaded multiqubit gates with high quality in a bosonic system. Therefore, the machine-learning-inspired method may be feasible in quantum optimal control of nonadiabatic geometric quantum computation.

TI General Simulation Method for Quantum-Sensing Systems
SO LASER & PHOTONICS REVIEWS
AB Quantum sensing encompasses highly promising techniques with diverse applications including noise-reduced imaging, super-resolution microscopy, as well as imaging and spectroscopy in challenging spectral ranges. These detection schemes use biphoton correlations to surpass classical limits or transfer information to different spectral ranges. Theoretical analysis is mostly confined to idealized conditions. Therefore, theoretical predictions and experimental results for the performance of quantum-sensing systems often diverge. This general simulation method that includes experimental imperfections bridges the gap between theory and experiment. A theoretical approach is developed and the capabilities are demonstrated with the simulation of aligned and misaligned quantum-imaging experiments. The results recreate the characteristics of the experimental data. The simulation results were further used to improve the obtained images in post-processing. As a simulation method for general quantum-sensing systems, this work provides a step toward powerful simulation tools for interactively exploring the design space and optimizing the experiment's characteristics.

TI Two-qubit sweet spots for capacitively coupled exchange-only spin qubits
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB The implementation of high fidelity two-qubit gates is a bottleneck in the progress toward universal quantum computation in semiconductor quantum dot qubits. We study capacitive coupling between two triple quantum dot spin qubits encoded in the S = 1/2, S-z = -1/2 decoherence-free subspace-the exchange-only (EO) spin qubits. We report exact gate sequences for CPHASE and CNOT gates, and demonstrate theoretically, the existence of multiple two-qubit sweet spots (2QSS) in the parameter space of capacitively coupled EO qubits. Gate operations have the advantage of being all-electrical, but charge noise that couple to electrical parameters of the qubits cause decoherence. Assuming noise with a 1/f spectrum, two-qubit gate fidelities and times are calculated, which provide useful information on the noise threshold necessary for fault-tolerance. We study two-qubit gates at single and multiple parameter 2QSS. In particular, for two existing EO implementations-the resonant exchange (RX) and the always-on exchange-only (AEON) qubits-we compare two-qubit gate fidelities and times at positions in parameter space where the 2QSS are simultaneously single-qubit sweet spots (1QSS) for the RX and AEON. These results provide a potential route to the realization of high fidelity quantum computation.

TI Solving nonlinear differential equations with differentiable quantum
   circuits
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We propose a quantum algorithm to solve systems of nonlinear differential equations. Using a quantum feature map encoding, we define functions as expectation values of parametrized quantum circuits. We use automatic differentiation to represent function derivatives in an analytical form as differentiable quantum circuits (DQCs), thus avoiding inaccurate finite difference procedures for calculating gradients. We describe a hybrid quantum-classical workflow where DQCs are trained to satisfy differential equations and specified boundary conditions. As a particular example setting, we show how this approach can implement a spectral method for solving differential equations in a high-dimensional feature space. From a technical perspective, we design a Chebyshev quantum feature map that offers a powerful basis set of fitting polynomials and possesses rich expressivity. We simulate the algorithm to solve an instance of Navier-Stokes equations and compute density, temperature, and velocity profiles for the fluid flow in a convergent-divergent nozzle.

TI Creating and concentrating quantum resource states in noisy environments
   using a quantum neural network
SO NEURAL NETWORKS
AB Quantum information processing tasks require exotic quantum states as a prerequisite. They are usually prepared with many different methods tailored to the specific resource state. Here we provide a versatile unified state preparation scheme based on a driven quantum network composed of randomly coupled fermionic nodes. The output of such a system is then superposed with the help of linear mixing where weights and phases are trained in order to obtain desired output quantum states. We explicitly show that our method is robust and can be utilized to create almost perfect maximally entangled, NOON, W, cluster, and discorded states. Furthermore, the treatment includes energy decay in the system as well as dephasing and depolarization. Under these noisy conditions we show that the target states are achieved with high fidelity by tuning controllable parameters and providing sufficient strength to the driving of the quantum network. Finally, in very noisy systems, where noise is comparable to the driving strength, we show how to concentrate entanglement by mixing more states in a larger network. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

TI Cavity-Enhanced Atom-Photon Entanglement with Subsecond Lifetime
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB A cold atomic ensemble suits well for optical quantum memories, and its entanglement with a single photon forms the building block for quantum networks that give promise for many revolutionary applications. Efficiency and lifetime are among the most important figures of merit for a memory. In this Letter, we report the realization of entanglement between an atomic ensemble and a single photon with subsecond lifetime and high efficiency. We engineer dual control modes in a ring cavity to create entanglement and make use of three-dimensional optical lattice to prolong memory lifetime. The memory efficiency is 38% for 0.1 s storage. We verify the atom-photon entanglement after 1 s storage by testing the Bell inequality with a result of S = 2.36 +/- 0.14.

TI Characterization of superconducting through-silicon vias as capacitive
   elements in quantum circuits
SO APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS
AB The large physical size of superconducting qubits and their associated on-chip control structures presents a practical challenge toward building a large-scale quantum computer. In particular, transmons require a high-quality-factor shunting capacitance that is typically achieved by using a large coplanar capacitor. Other components, such as superconducting microwave resonators used for qubit state readout, are typically constructed from coplanar waveguides, which are millimeters in length. Here, we use compact superconducting through-silicon vias to realize lumped-element capacitors in both qubits and readout resonators to significantly reduce the on-chip footprint of both of these circuit elements. We measure two types of devices to show that through-silicon vias are of sufficient quality to be used as capacitive circuit elements and provide a significant reduction in size over existing approaches.

TI Improving classical capacity of qubit dynamical maps through stationary
   state manipulation
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS A-MATHEMATICAL AND THEORETICAL
AB We analyze the evolution of Holevo and entanglement-assisted classical capacities for two classes of phase-covariant channels. In particular, we show that these capacities can be improved by changing the stationary state of the channel, which is closely related to its non-unitality degree. The more non-unital the channel, the greater its capacity. The channel parameters are engineered through mixtures on the level of dynamical maps, time-local generators, and memory kernels, for which we propose construction methods. For highly non-unital maps, we achieve a temporary increase in the classical capacity that exceeds the entanglement-assisted classical capacity of the unital map. This shows that non-unitality can become a better quantum resource for information transition purposes than quantum entanglement.

TI Energy-dependent barren plateau in bosonic variational quantum circuits
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Bosonic variational quantum circuits (VQCs) are crucial for information processing in microwave cavities, trapped ions, and optical systems, widely applicable in quantum communication, sensing and error correction. The trainability of such VQCs is less understood, hindered by the lack of theoretical tools such as t-design due to the infinite dimension of the continuous-variable systems involved. We overcome this difficulty to reveal an energy-dependent barren plateau in such VQCs. The variance of the gradient decays as 1/EM nu, exponential in the number of modes M but polynomial in the (per-mode) circuit energy E. The exponent nu = 1 for shallow circuits and nu = 2 for deep circuits. We prove these results for state preparation of general Gaussian states and number states. We also provide numerical evidence demonstrating that the results extend to general state preparation tasks. As circuit energy is a controllable parameter, we provide a strategy to mitigate the barren plateau in bosonic continuous-variable VQCs.

TI Review and perspectives in quantum computing for partial differential
   equations in structural mechanics
SO FRONTIERS IN MECHANICAL ENGINEERING-SWITZERLAND
AB Structural mechanics is commonly modeled by (systems of) partial differential equations (PDEs). Except for very simple cases where analytical solutions exist, the use of numerical methods is required to find approximate solutions. However, for many problems of practical interest, the computational cost of classical numerical solvers running on classical, that is, silicon-based computer hardware, becomes prohibitive. Quantum computing, though still in its infancy, holds the promise of enabling a new generation of algorithms that can execute the most cost-demanding parts of PDE solvers up to exponentially faster than classical methods, at least theoretically. Also, increasing research and availability of quantum computing hardware spurs the hope of scientists and engineers to start using quantum computers for solving PDE problems much faster than classically possible. This work reviews the contributions that deal with the application of quantum algorithms to solve PDEs in structural mechanics. The aim is not only to discuss the theoretical possibility and extent of advantage for a given PDE, boundary conditions and input/output to the solver, but also to examine the hardware requirements of the methods proposed in literature.

With this contribution, we seek to lay the foundations for other urban and regional scientists to begin to consider quantum technologies. We obtained promising results, but it is clear that there is a need for more capable devices with more qubits and less susceptibility to electronic noise to solve instances that currently cannot be optimally solved by traditional solvers. We foresee that QC will be of common use in urban and regional science and its applications in the years to come.

TI Compact fiber-coupled narrowband two-mode squeezed light source
SO OPTICS LETTERS
AB Quantum correlated states of light, such as squeezed states, are a fundamental resource for the development of quantum technologies, as they are needed for applications in quantum metrology, quantum computation, and quantum communications. It is thus critical to develop compact, efficient, and robust sources to generate such states. Here, we report on a compact, narrowband, fiber-coupled source of two-mode squeezed states of light at 795 nm based on four-wave mixing (FWM) in an 85Rb atomic vapor. The source is designed in a small modular form factor, with two input fiber-coupled beams, the seed and pump beams required for the FWM, and two output fibers, one for each of the modes of the squeezed state. The system is optimized for low pump power (135 mW) to achieve a maximum intensity-difference squeezing of 4.4 dB after the output of fibers at an analysis frequency of 1 MHz. The narrowband nature of the source makes it ideal for atomic-based quantum sensing and quantum networking configurations that rely on atomic quantum memories. Such a source paves the way for a versatile and portable platform for applications in quantum information science. (c) 2025 Optica Publishing Group.

TI Adiabatic dynamics of entanglement
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB We show that, during adiabatic evolution, any changes in entanglement can be attributed to a succession of avoided energy level crossings at which eigenvalues swap their eigenvectors. These swaps mediate the generation and redistribution of entanglement in multipartite systems. The efficiency of this redistribution depends on the narrowness of the avoided level crossings and thus constrains the speed of adiabatic evolution. Moreover, we relate the amount of entanglement involved to the ruggedness of the energy landscape, which directly affects the hardness of a computational problem. This enables an analysis of computational complexity and quantum advantage from the point of view of entanglement requirements. Applied to adiabatic quantum computation, our findings directly relate the computation's speed to its utilization of entanglement as a resource. The same principles extend to gate-based discretized adiabatic quantum algorithms, including those for Hamiltonian simulation and combinatorial optimization.

TI Approximation and Generalization Capacities of Parametrized Quantum
   Circuits for Functions in Sobolev Spaces
SO QUANTUM
AB Parametrized quantum circuits (PQC) are quantum circuits which consist of both fixed and parametrized gates. In recent approaches to quantum machine learning (QML), PQCs are essentially ubiquitous and play the role analogous to classical neural networks. They are used to learn various types of data, with an underlying expectation that if the PQC is made sufficiently deep, and the data plentiful, the generalization error will vanish, and the model will capture the essential features of the distribution. While there exist results proving the approximability of square-integrable functions by PQCs under the L2 distance, the approximation for other function spaces and under other distances has been less explored. In this work we show that PQCs can approximate the space of continuous functions, p-integrable functions and the Hk Sobolev spaces under specific distances. Moreover, we develop generalization bounds that connect different function spaces and distances. These results provide a theoretical basis for different applications of PQCs, for example for solving differential equations. Furthermore, they provide us with new insight on the role of the data normalization in PQCs and of loss functions which better suit the specific needs of the users.

TI A posteriori corrections to the iterative qubit coupled cluster
   method to minimize the use of quantum resources in large-scale
   calculations
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB The iterative qubit coupled cluster (iQCC) method is a systematic variational approach to solve the electronic structure problem on universal quantum computers. It is able to use arbitrarily shallow quantum circuits at expense of iterative canonical transformation of the Hamiltonian and rebuilding a circuit. Here we present a variety of a posteriori corrections to the iQCC energies to reduce the number of iterations to achieve the desired accuracy. Our energy corrections are based on a low-order perturbation theory series that can be efficiently evaluated on a classical computer. Moreover, capturing a part of the total energy perturbatively, allows us to formulate the qubit active-space concept, in which only a subset of all qubits is treated variationally. As a result, further reduction of quantum resource requirements is achieved. We demonstrate the utility and efficiency of our approach numerically on the examples of 10-qubit N-2 molecule dissociation, the 24-qubit H2O symmetric stretch, and 56-qubit singlet-triplet gap calculations for the technologically important complex, tris-(2-phenylpyridine)iridium(III) Ir(ppy)(3).

AB Quantum computing (QC) is a new paradigm offering the potential of exponential speedups over classical computing for certain computational problems. Each additional qubit doubles the size of the computational state space available to a QC algorithm. This exponential scaling underlies QC's power, but today's Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices face significant engineering challenges in scalability. The set of quantum circuits that can be reliably run on NISQ devices is limited by their noisy operations and low qubit counts.
   This paper introduces CutQC, a scalable hybrid computing approach that combines classical computers and quantum computers to enable evaluation of quantum circuits that cannot be run on classical or quantum computers alone. CutQC cuts large quantum circuits into smaller subcircuits, allowing them to be executed on smaller quantum devices. Classical postprocessing can then reconstruct the output of the original circuit. This approach offers significant runtime speedup compared with the only viable current alternative-purely classical simulations-and demonstrates evaluation of quantum circuits that are larger than the limit of QC or classical simulation. Furthermore, in real-system runs, CutQC achieves much higher quantum circuit evaluation fidelity using small prototype quantum computers than the state-of-the-art large NISQ devices achieve. Overall, this hybrid approach allows users to leverage classical and quantum computing resources to evaluate quantum programs far beyond the reach of either one alone.

TI Efficient quantum algorithm to simulate open systems through a single
   environmental qubit
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB We present an efficient algorithm for simulating open quantum systems dynamics described by the Lindblad master equation on quantum computers, addressing key challenges in the field. In contrast to existing approaches, our method achieves two significant advancements. First, we employ a repetition of unitary gates on a set of n system qubits and, remarkably, only a single ancillary bath qubit representing the environment. It follows that, for the typical case of m locality of the Lindblad operators, we reach an exponential improvement of the number of ancilla in terms of m and up to a polynomial improvement in ancilla overhead for large n with respect to other approaches. Although stochasticity is introduced, requiring multiple circuit realizations, the sampling overhead is independent of the system size. Second, we show that, under fixed accuracy conditions, our algorithm enables a reduction in the number of Trotter steps compared to other approaches, substantially decreasing circuit depth. These advancements hold particular significance for near-term quantum computers, where minimizing both width and depth is critical due to inherent noise in their dynamics.

TI Quantum state preparation protocol for encoding classical data into the
   amplitudes of a quantum information processing register's wave function
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB We present a protocol for encoding N real numbers stored in N memory registers into the amplitudes of the quantum superposition that describes the state of log(2) N qubits. This task is one of the main steps in quantum machine learning algorithms applied to classical data. The protocol combines partial CNOT gate rotations with probabilistic projection onto the desired state. The number of additional ancilla qubits used during the implementation of the protocol, as well as the number of quantum gates, scales linearly with the number of qubits in the processing register and hence logarithmically with N. The average time needed to successfully perform the encoding scales logarithmically with the number of qubits, in addition to being inversely proportional to the acceptable error in the encoded amplitudes. It also depends on the structure of the dataset in such a way that the protocol is most efficient for nonsparse data.

TI Quantum computing critical exponents
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We show that the variational quantum-classical simulation algorithm admits a finite circuit depth scaling collapse when targeting the critical point of the transverse field Ising chain. The order parameter only collapses on one side of the transition due to a slowdown of the quantum algorithm when crossing the phase transition. In order to assess performance of the quantum algorithm and compute correlations in a system of up to 752 qubits, we use techniques from integrability to derive closed form analytical expressions for expectation values with respect to the output of the quantum circuit. We also reduce a conjecture made by Ho and Hsieh [W. W. Ho and T. H. Hsieh, SciPost Phys. 6, 029 (2019)] about the exact preparation of the transverse field Ising ground state to a system of equations.

TI Sending-or-Not-Sending Twin-Field Quantum Key Distribution with a
   Passive Decoy-State Method
SO ENTROPY
AB Twin-field quantum key distribution (TF-QKD) has attracted considerable attention because it can exceed the basic rate-distance limit without quantum repeaters. Its variant protocol, sending or not-sending quantum key distribution (SNS-QKD), not only fixes the security vulnerability of TF-QKD, but also can tolerate large misalignment errors. However, the current SNS-QKD protocol is based on the active decoy-state method, which may lead to side channel information leakage when multiple light intensities are modulated in practice. In this work, we propose a passive decoy-state SNS-QKD protocol to further enhance the security of SNS-QKD. Numerical simulation results show that the protocol not only improves the security in source, but also retains the advantages of tolerating large misalignment errors. Therefore, it may provide further guidance for the practical application of SNS-QKD.

TI LDPC-cat codes for low-overhead quantum computing in 2D
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB The main obstacle to large scale quantum computing are the errors present in every physical qubit realization. Correcting these errors requires a large number of additional qubits. Two main avenues to reduce this overhead are (i) low-density parity check (LDPC) codes requiring very few additional qubits to correct errors (ii) cat qubits where bit-flip errors are exponentially suppressed by design. In this work, we combine both approaches to obtain an extremely low overhead architecture. Assuming a physical phase-flip error probability & varepsilon; approximate to 0.1% per qubit and operation, one hundred logical qubits can be implemented on a 758 cat qubit chip, with a total logical error probability per cycle and per logical qubit & varepsilon;L <= 10-8. Our architecture also features two major advantages. First, the hardware implementation of the code can be realised with short-range qubit interactions in 2D and low-weight stabilizers, under constraints similar to those of the popular surface code architecture. Second, we demonstrate how to implement a fault-tolerant universal set of logical gates with an additional layer of routing cat qubits stacked on top of the LDPC layer, while maintaining the local connectivity. Furthermore, our architecture benefits from a high capacity of parallelization for these logical gates.

TI Asymmetric Protocols for Mode Pairing Quantum Key Distribution with
   Finite-Key Analysis
SO ENTROPY
AB The mode pairing quantum key distribution (MP-QKD) protocol has attracted considerable attention for its capability to ensure high secure key rates over long distances without requiring global phase locking. However, ensuring symmetric channels for the MP-QKD protocol is challenging in practical quantum communication networks. Previous studies on the asymmetric MP-QKD protocol have relied on ideal decoy state assumptions and infinite-key analysis, which are unattainable for real-world deployment. In this paper, we conduct a security analysis of the asymmetric MP-QKD protocol with the finite-key analysis, where we discard the previously impractical assumptions made in the decoy state method. Combined with statistical fluctuation analysis, we globally optimized the 10 independent parameters in the asymmetric MP-QKD protocol by employing our modified particle swarm optimization. Through further analysis, the simulation results demonstrate that our work achieves improved secure key rates and transmission distances compared to the strategy with additional attenuation. We further investigate the relationship between the intensities and probabilities of signal, decoy, and vacuum states with transmission distance, facilitating their more efficient deployment in future quantum networks.

TI Entanglement asymmetry dynamics in random quantum circuits
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB We study the dynamics of entanglement asymmetry in random unitary circuits (RUCs). Focusing on a local U (1) charge, we consider symmetric initial states evolved by both local one-dimensional circuits and geometrically nonlocal RUCs made of two-qudit gates. We compute the entanglement asymmetry of subsystems of arbitrary size, analyzing the relaxation timescales. We show that the entanglement asymmetry of the whole system approaches its stationary value in a time independent of the system size for both local and nonlocal circuits. For subsystems, we find qualitative differences depending on their size. When the subsystem is larger than half of the full system, the equilibration timescales are again independent of the system size for both local and nonlocal circuits and the entanglement asymmetry grows monotonically in time. Conversely, when the subsystems are smaller than half of the full system, we show that the entanglement asymmetry is nonmonotonic in time and that it equilibrates in a time proportional to the quantum-information scrambling time, providing a physical intuition. As a consequence, the subsystem-equilibration time depends on the locality of interactions, scaling linearly and logarithmically in the system size, respectively, for local and nonlocal RUCs. Our work confirms the entanglement asymmetry as a versatile and computable probe of symmetry in many-body physics and yields a phenomenological overview of entanglement-asymmetry evolution in typical nonintegrable dynamics.

TI A Proposed Quantum Framework for Low-Complexity Quantum Simulation and
   Spectrum Estimation of Hankel-Patterned Systems
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM ENGINEERING
AB The structured matrix completion problem (SMCP) is ubiquitous in several signal processing applications. In this article, we consider a fixed pattern, namely, the Hankel-structure for the SMCP under quantum formalism. By exploiting its structure, a lower-gate-complexity quantum circuit realization of a Hankel system is demonstrated. Further, we propose a quantum simulation algorithm for the Hankel-structured Hamiltonian with an advantage in quantum gate-operation complexity in comparison with the standard quantum Hamiltonian simulation technique. We show its application in eigenvalue spectrum estimation for signal processing applications. An error bound associated with this proposed quantum evolution is proposed with the consideration of spectrum estimation and measurement uncertainty. Numerical results are reported adopting random matrix theory in its fold to evaluate the efficacy of the proposed architecture and algorithm for large-dimensional systems, including an example application in delay estimation for ranging operations in a wireless communication system.

TI Two instances of random access code in the quantum regime
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB We consider two classes of quantum generalisations of random access code (RAC) and study the bounds for probabilities of success for such tasks. It provides a useful framework for the study of certain information processing tasks with constrained resources. The first class is based on a RAC with quantum inputs and output known as the no-signalling quantum RAC (NS-QRAC) box (Grudka et al 2015 Phys. Rev. A 92 052312), where unbounded entanglement and constrained classical communication are allowed. We show that it can be seen as quantum teleportation with constrained classical communication and provide a lower quantum bound for the success probability. We consider two modifications to the NS-QRAC scenario: the first, where unbounded entanglement and constrained quantum communication is allowed and the second, where bounded entanglement and unconstrained classical communication is allowed. We find a monogamy relation for the transmission fidelities, which-in contrast to the usual communication schemes-involves multiple senders and a single receiver. We provide an upper bounds for the latter and a lower one for the former. The second class is based on a RAC with a quantum channel and shared entanglement (Tavakoli et al 2021 PRX Quantum 2 040357). We study the set of tasks where two inputs made of two digits of d-base are encoded over a qudit and a maximally entangled state. We show that such tasks can be seen as quantum dense-coding with constrained quantum communication and explicit protocols, which give lower quantum bounds for the tasks' efficiency, in dimensions d = 2,3,4. The employed encoding utilises Gray codes.

TI Simulating quantum chaos on a quantum computer
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) computers provide a new experimental platform for investigating the behaviour of complex quantum systems. We show that currently available NISQ devices can be used for versatile quantum simulations of chaotic systems. We introduce a classical-quantum hybrid approach for exploring the dynamics of the chaotic quantum kicked top (QKT) on a quantum computer. The programmability of this approach allows us to experimentally explore a broad range of QKT chaoticity parameter regimes inaccessible to previous studies. Furthermore, the number of gates in our simulation does not increase with the number of kicks, thus making it possible to study the QKT evolution for arbitrary number of kicks without fidelity loss. Using a publicly accessible NISQ computer (IBMQ), we observe periodicities in the evolution of the 2-qubit QKT, as well as signatures of chaos in the time-averaged 2-qubit entanglement. We also demonstrate a connection between entanglement and delocalization in the 2-qubit QKT, confirming theoretical predictions.

TI Quantum Simulation of Pseudo-Hermitian-φ-Symmetric Two-Level Systems
SO ENTROPY
AB Non-Hermitian (NH) quantum theory has been attracting increased research interest due to its featured properties, novel phenomena, and links to open and dissipative systems. Typical NH systems include PT-symmetric systems, pseudo-Hermitian systems, and their anti-symmetric counterparts. In this work, we generalize the pseudo-Hermitian systems to their complex counterparts, which we call pseudo-Hermitian-phi-symmetric systems. This complex extension adds an extra degree of freedom to the original symmetry. On the one hand, it enlarges the non-Hermitian class relevant to pseudo-Hermiticity. On the other hand, the conventional pseudo-Hermitian systems can be understood better as a subgroup of this wider class. The well-defined inner product and pseudo-inner product are still valid. Since quantum simulation provides a strong method to investigate NH systems, we mainly investigate how to simulate this novel system in a Hermitian system using the linear combination of unitaries in the scheme of duality quantum computing. We illustrate in detail how to simulate a general P-pseudo-Hermitian-phi-symmetric two-level system. Duality quantum algorithms have been recently successfully applied to similar types of simulations, so we look forward to the implementation of available quantum devices.

TI A Graph-Based Approach for Modelling Quantum Circuits
SO APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
AB A crucial task for the systematic application of model-driven engineering techniques in the development of quantum software is the definition of metamodels, as a first step towards automatic code generation and integration with other tools. The importance is even greater when considering recent work where the first extensions to UML for modelling quantum circuits are emerging and the characterisation of these extensions in terms of their suitability for a model-driven approach becomes unavoidable. After reviewing the related work, this article proposes a unified metamodel for modelling quantum circuits, together with five strategies for its use and some examples of its application. The article also provides a set of constraints for using the identified strategies, a set of procedures for transforming the models between the strategies, and an analysis of the suitability of each strategy for performing common tasks in a model-driven quantum software development environment. All of these resources will enable the quantum software community to speak the same language and use the same set of abstractions, which are key to furthering the development of tools to be built as part of future model-driven quantum software development frameworks.

TI Bridging the theory - practice gap: a university course on quantum
   information science and transfer to career-oriented physics teaching
SO EPJ QUANTUM TECHNOLOGY
AB This study presents the design and implementation of a university course for physics teacher training with a focus on quantum technologies and quantum information science. The course aims to equip prospective teachers with the knowledge and skills to teach quantum physics at upper secondary level and provide their students with insights into the professional world of quantum technologies. To this end, the course comprises three parts: a theoretical seminar at university, a didactic internship at quantum technology companies and a transfer phase implementing corresponding teaching units at school. The course was developed and implemented in several cycles within the framework of design-based research. The effect of the course was evaluated by an exploratory interview study. The focus was on its impact on prospective teachers' attitudes and knowledge concerning quantum technologies, as well as on the implementation of career-oriented teaching units in the classroom. The results show that the internship was considered interesting and motivating by the prospective teachers, who valued the opportunity to gain insights into professional fields. However, transferring the content and experiences from the internship into actual school practice proved to be challenging. This process was perceived as difficult and required extensive support from university supervisors. From the results it can be concluded that the approach achieves its aims of providing prospective teachers with an introduction to quantum technologies and related professions and of stimulating students interest in the subject.

TI Learning Quantum Processes and Hamiltonians via the Pauli Transfer
   Matrix
SO ACM TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM COMPUTING
AB Learning about physical systems from quantum-enhanced experiments can outperform learning from experiments in which only classical memory and processing are available. Whereas quantum advantages have been established for state learning, quantum process learning is less understood. We establish an exponential quantum advantage for learning an unknown n-qubit quantum process N. We show that a quantum memory allows to efficiently solve the following tasks: (a) learning the Pauli transfer matrix (PTM) of an arbitrary N, (b) predicting expectation values of Pauli-sparse observables measured on the output of an arbitrary N upon input of a Pauli-sparse state, and (c) predicting expectation values of arbitrary observables measured on the output of an unknown N with sparse PTM upon input of an arbitrary state. With quantum memory, these tasks can be solved using linearly-in-n many copies of the Choi state of N. In contrast, any learner without quantum memory requires exponentially-in-n many queries, even when using adaptively designed experiments. In proving this separation, we extend existing shadow tomography bounds from states to channels. Moreover, we combine PTM learning with polynomial interpolation to learn arbitrary Hamiltonians from short-time dynamics. Our results highlight the power of quantum-enhanced experiments for learning highly complex quantum dynamics.

TI A fully integrated nanosecond burst RF generator for quantum
   technologies
SO ELECTRONICS LETTERS
AB Quantum technologies is an emerging field of physics and engineering based on exploiting properties of quantum mechanics such as entanglement, superposition, or tunneling, and which is expected to impact many applications, such as communications, simulation, computation, or sensing and metrology. The operation of quantum technologies is based on the manipulation of the quantum states of certain devices, either to induce transitions between states or to detect the transitions. Irrespective of the practical realization of these quantum devices, their manipulation requires interacting with their quantum resonant states, for which very narrow radio-frequency (RF) bursts in the range of the GHz are required. Arbitrary waveform generators are used to generate these signals for test purposes, but this is not suitable for practical quantum technology applications, which will need to produce the required bursts by specific circuit building blocks with low power and small dimensions. Here, an integrated RF burst generator capable of producing GHz bursts shorter than 1 ns is presented. The proposed architecture is tested using a 5 GHz quadrature LC-tank voltage-controlled oscillator (LC-VCO), showing that the four equally spaced phases can be switched every 500 ps, which allows the generation of more complex RF bursts for optimized quantum state manipulation.

TI The Quantum Wasserstein Distance of Order 1
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION THEORY
AB We propose a generalization of the Wasserstein distance of order 1 to the quantum states of n qudits. The proposal recovers the Hamming distance for the vectors of the canonical basis, and more generally the classical Wasserstein distance for quantum states diagonal in the canonical basis. The proposed distance is invariant with respect to permutations of the qudits and unitary operations acting on one qudit and is additive with respect to the tensor product. Our main result is a continuity bound for the von Neumann entropy with respect to the proposed distance, which significantly strengthens the best continuity bound with respect to the trace distance. We also propose a generalization of the Lipschitz constant to quantum observables. The notion of quantum Lipschitz constant allows us to compute the proposed distance with a semidefinite program. We prove a quantum version of Marton's transportation inequality and a quantum Gaussian concentration inequality for the spectrum of quantum Lipschitz observables. Moreover, we derive bounds on the contraction coefficients of shallow quantum circuits and of the tensor product of one-qudit quantum channels with respect to the proposed distance. We discuss other possible applications in quantum machine learning, quantum Shannon theory, and quantum many-body systems.

TI Quantum key distribution over 100 km of underwater optical fiber
   assisted by a fast-gated single-photon detector
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB Nowadays quantum key distribution (QKD) represents the most mature quantum technology, and multiple countries as well as private institutions are building their quantum network. However, QKD devices are still far from representing a product within everyone's reach. Indeed, limitations in terms of compatibility with existing telecom infrastructure and limited performances in terms of secret key rate, using noncryogenic detection systems, are still critical. In this work, we implemented a quantum key distribution link between Sicily (Italy) and Malta utilizing two different single-photon avalanche diode (SPAD) detectors. The performances of a standard commercial SPAD have been compared with the results achieved with an alternative prototype of fast-gated system in a package (SIP) SPAD; the SIP detector has shown to be able to accomplish a 14 times higher key rate compared with the commercial device over the channel showing 20 dB of losses.

TI Effects of cavity birefringence in polarisation-encoded quantum networks
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB The generation of entanglement between distant atoms via single photons is the basis for networked quantum computing, a promising route to large-scale trapped-ion and trapped-atom processors. Locating the emitter within an optical cavity provides an efficient matter-light interface, but mirror-induced birefringence within the cavity introduces time-dependence to the polarisation of the photons produced. We show that such 'polarisation oscillation' effects can lead to severe loss of fidelity in the context of two-photon, polarisation encoded measurement-based remote entanglement schemes. It is always preferable to suppress these errors at source by minimising mirror ellipticity, but we propose two remedies for systems where this cannot be achieved. We conclude that even modest cavity birefringence can be detrimental to remote entanglement performance, to an extent that may limit the suitability of polarisation-encoded schemes for large-scale quantum networks.

TI Approaching optimal entangling collective measurements on quantum
   computing platforms
SO NATURE PHYSICS
AB Entanglement is a fundamental feature of quantum mechanics and holds great promise for enhancing metrology and communications. Much of the focus of quantum metrology so far has been on generating highly entangled quantum states that offer better sensitivity, per resource, than what can be achieved classically. However, to reach the ultimate limits in multi-parameter quantum metrology and quantum information processing tasks, collective measurements, which generate entanglement between multiple copies of the quantum state, are necessary. Here, we experimentally demonstrate theoretically optimal single- and two-copy collective measurements for simultaneously estimating two non-commuting qubit rotations. This allows us to implement quantum-enhanced sensing, for which the metrological gain persists for high levels of decoherence, and to draw fundamental insights about the interpretation of the uncertainty principle. We implement our optimal measurements on superconducting, trapped-ion and photonic systems, providing an indication of how future quantum-enhanced sensing networks may look.

TI Nonlinearity symmetry breaking for generating tunable quantum
   entanglement in semiconductor metasurfaces
SO SCIENCE ADVANCES
AB Tunable biphoton quantum entanglement generated from nonlinear flat optics is highly desirable for cutting-edge quantum technologies, yet its tunability is substantially constrained by the symmetry of material nonlinear tensors. Here, we overcome this constraint by introducing symmetry breaking in nonlinear polarization via resonant metasurfaces. While asymmetric optical responses have enabled breakthroughs in classical applications like nonreciprocal light transmission, we report the experimental demonstration of asymmetric nonlinear responses for biphoton entanglement. Using a structural-asymmetric semiconductor metasurface incorporating [110] InGaP nanoresonators, we realize continuous tuning of polarization entanglement from partially entangled states to a Bell state by adjusting the pump wavelength. We also observe pronounced spatial anti-correlations and theoretically confirm that this approach can extend to tailor hyperentanglement. Furthermore, our nanoscale entanglement source features an ultrahigh coincidence-to-accidental ratio of approximate to 7 x 104, outperforming existing semiconductor flat optics by two orders of magnitude. Introducing asymmetric nonlinear response in quantum metasurfaces opens directions for tailoring on-demand quantum states.

TI Quantum information approach to high energy interactions
SO PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY A-MATHEMATICAL PHYSICAL
   AND ENGINEERING SCIENCES
AB High energy hadron interactions are commonly described by using a probabilistic parton model that ignores quantum entanglement present in the light-cone wave functions. Here, we argue that since a high energy interaction samples an instant snapshot of the hadron wave function, the phases of different Pock state wave functions cannot be measured-therefore the light-cone density matrix has to be traced over these unobservable phases. Performing this trace with the corresponding U(1) Haar integration measure leads to 'Haar scrambling' of the density matrix, and to the emergence of entanglement entropy. This entanglement entropy is determined by the Fock state probability distribution, and is thus directly related to the parton structure functions. As proposed earlier, at large rapidity eta the hadron state becomes maximally entangled, and the entanglement entropy is S-E( )similar to eta according to QCD evolution equations. When the phases of Fock state components are controlled, for example in spin asymmetry measurements, the Haar average cannot be performed, and the probabilistic parton description breaks down.
   This article is part of the theme issue 'Quantum technologies in particle physics'.

AB Atom-cavity interconnected systems offer an outstanding possibility for experiments in quantum computing and quantum information. Investigating the interaction between different light fields and atoms in a cavity vital study area of quantum optics. In this paper, we examine the interaction between an atom (qubit) and the cavity. The Jaynes-Cummings approach determines the probability of the cavity and qubit into bad and good regimes. Moreover, we examine the Wigner functions of the cavity depending on the coupling strength. is possible to synchronize atoms to create exact atomic clocks, which might revolutionize several sectors, including navigation, communications, and scientific study. We show that the synchronization of two qubits inside an optical lattice can be accomplished using the driven Tavis-Cummings Hamiltonian. In this framework, we employ sixteen photons and show that the best quantum synchronization can be achieved between two qubits q 1 and q 2 in a weak regime.

TI Quantum computing on magnetic racetracks with flying domain wall qubits
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Domain walls (DWs) on magnetic racetracks are at the core of the field of spintronics, providing a basic element for classical information processing. Here, we show that mobile DWs also provide a blueprint for largescale quantum computers. Remarkably, these DW qubits showcase exceptional versatility, serving not only as stationary qubits, but also performing the role of solid-state flying qubits that can be shuttled in an ultrafast way. We estimate that the DW qubits are long-lived because they can be operated at sweet spots to reduce potential noise sources. Single-qubit gates are implemented by moving the DW, and two-qubit entangling gates exploit naturally emerging interactions between different DWs. These gates, sufficient for universal quantum computing, are fully compatible with current state-of-the-art experiments on racetrack memories. Further, we discuss possible strategies for qubit readout and initialization, paving the way toward future quantum computers based on mobile topological textures on magnetic racetracks.

AB Quantum networks present various research challenges that need to be addressed for the development of future quantum Internet architectures, such as the interconnection of large numbers of end devices, and remote long distance connection. The recursive inter-network architecture (RINA) introduces great flexibility, scalability and a set of principles that can be applied to quantum networks, yielding a network model based on RINA, which we refer to as RINA-based quantum network. Such approach offers an appropriate solution to address the challenges posed by quantum networks. This paper presents the authors' vision on the potential of RINA-based quantum networks to advance the quantum Internet. First, a model based on packet switching is proposed to carry quantum payloads in local-area scenarios. Then, a RINA-based approach for entanglement-based teleportation is presented for wide-area scenarios. Last, a full RINA-based quantum network model for end-to-end communication is proposed. The proposed model enables the interconnection of packet-switching networks and entanglement-based networks. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first attempt at designing a RINA-based quantum inter-network model.

TI Scalable Architecture for Trapped-Ion Quantum Computing Using rf Traps
   and Dynamic Optical Potentials
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW X
AB Qubits based on ions trapped in linear radio-frequency traps form a successful platform for quantum computing, due to their high fidelity of operations, all-to-all connectivity, and degree of local control. In principle, there is no fundamental limit to the number of ion-based qubits that can be confined in a single 1D register. However, in practice, there are two main issues associated with long trapped-ion crystals, that stem from the "softening" of their modes of motion, upon scaling up: high heating rates of the ions' motion and a dense motional spectrum; both impede the performance of high-fidelity qubit operations. Here, we propose a holistic, scalable architecture for quantum computing with large ion crystals that overcomes these issues. Our method relies on dynamically operated optical potentials that instantaneously segment the ion crystal into cells of a manageable size. We show that these cells behave as nearly independent quantum registers, allowing for parallel entangling gates on all cells. The ability to reconfigure the optical potentials guarantees connectivity across the full ion crystal and also enables efficient midcircuit measurements. We study the implementation of large-scale parallel multiqubit entangling gates that operate simultaneously on all cells and present a protocol to compensate for crosstalk errors, enabling full-scale usage of an extensively large register. We illustrate that this architecture is advantageous both for fault-tolerant digital quantum computation and for analog quantum simulations.

TI Addressing security issues in Industry 4.0 through quantum key
   distribution
SO PROCEEDINGS OF THE ESTONIAN ACADEMY OF SCIENCES
AB Industry 4.0 is a recent manufacturing paradigm based on the automation and digitalization of industrial processes, leveraging the interconnection of systems and processes through automation and data exchange. Despite the fact that the fourth "industrial revolution" has not yet reached its maturity and is not being widely implemented, engineers have already outlined the characteristics and goals of the upcoming fifth one. On the other hand, quantum tech-nologies-quantum computing, sensing and communication-will soon become another point of rupture for society and industry, with a quantum-driven technological revolution expected in the next two decades. In this paper, we show that quantum key distribution, an emerging technique for secure communication, can be readily employed in Industry 4.0 to address a number of safety and privacy issues. In fact, due to the reliance of this industrial model on interconnectivity and data, cyberattacks can pose threats to production systems and in-frastructures such as power grids or water treatment facilities. This threat also increases with the level of automation, digitalization, and remote control. Moreover, data can be stolen and misused both at a personal level and for collective exploitation. We simulate the transmission of sensitive data within a power plant, encryption through quantum key distribution and tentative eavesdropping, to demonstrate that this approach ensures theoretically complete security in data transmission.

AB Quantum annealing (QA) is a way to solve combinational optimization problems. Kerr nonlinear parametric oscillators (KPOs) are promising devices for implementing QA. When we solve the combinational optimization problems using KPOs, it is necessary to precisely control the photon number of the KPOs. Here, we propose a feasible method to estimate the photon number of the KPO. We consider coupling an ancillary qubit to the KPO and show that spectroscopic measurements on the ancillary qubit provide information on the photon number of the KPO.

TI Qubit-state purity oscillations from anisotropic transverse noise
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We explore the dynamics of qubit-state purity in the presence of transverse noise that is anisotropically distributed in the Bloch-sphere XY plane. We perform Ramsey experiments with noise injected along a fixed laboratory-frame axis and observe oscillations in the purity at twice the qubit frequency arising from the intrinsic qubit Larmor precession. We probe the oscillation dependence on the noise anisotropy, orientation, and power spectral density, using a low-frequency fluxonium qubit. Our results elucidate the impact of transverse noise anisotropy on qubit decoherence and may be useful for disentangling charge and flux noise in superconducting quantum circuits.

TI PAPER An Efficient Method to Decompose and Map MPMCT Gates That Accounts
   for Qubit Placement
SO IEICE TRANSACTIONS ON FUNDAMENTALS OF ELECTRONICS COMMUNICATIONS AND
   COMPUTER SCIENCES
AB Mixed-Polarity Multiple-Control Toffoli (MPMCT) gates are generally used to implement large control logic functions for quan-tum computation. A logic circuit consisting of MPMCT gates needs to be mapped to a quantum computing device that invariably has a physical limitation, which means we need to (1) decompose the MPMCT gates into one-or two-qubit gates, and then (2) insert SWAP gates so that all the gates can be performed on Nearest Neighbor Architectures (NNAs). Up to date, the above two processes have only been studied independently. in this work, we investigate that the total number of gates in a circuit can be decreased if the above two processes are considered simultaneously as a single step. We developed a method that inserts SWAP gates while decomposing MPMCT gates unlike most of the existing methods. Also, we consider the effect on the latter part of a circuit carefully by considering the qubit placement when decomposing an MPMCT gate. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

TI Unlocking the advantage of qubit communication in multi-node network
   configurations
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB The extension of point-to-point communication to multi-node configurations has significant applications in internet and telecommunication networks. Quantum resources promise notable advantages in such settings. Here, we demonstrate a novel quantum advantage in simulating multiple access channels (MACs)-a common network configuration where multiple distant senders transmit messages to a single receiver (e.g. the uplink from several mobile phones to a server). Specifically, we show that qubit transmission outperforms its classical counterpart, even when the latter is supplemented with classical shared randomness. Remarkably, unlike the seminal quantum superdense coding protocol, this advantage is achieved without any pre-shared entanglement between the senders and the receiver-a feat prohibited by Holevo and Frenkel-Weiner no-go theorems in the one-sender-one-receiver scenario. The receiver's ability to simultaneously decode quantum systems from multiple senders underpins this distinct advantage in the MAC setup. Some of our MAC designs are inspired by constructs in quantum foundations, such as the Pusey-Barrett-Rudolph theorem and 'quantum nonlocality without entanglement'. Beyond network applications, this quantum advantage reveals a deeper connection to 'quantum nonlocality without inputs' phenomenon and suggests potential for semi-device-independent certification of entangled measurements.

TI Quantifying the Imaginarity via Different Distance Measures
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB The recently introduced resource theory of imaginarity facilitates a systematic investigation into the role of complex numbers in quantum mechanics and quantum information theory. In this work, well-defined measures of imaginarity are proposed using various distance metrics, drawing inspiration from recent advancements in quantum entanglement and coherence. Specifically, quantitatively evaluating imaginarity is focused through measures such as Tsallis relative alpha$\alpha$-entropy, Sandwiched R & eacute;nyi relative entropy, and Tsallis relative operator entropy. Additionally, the decay rates of these measures are analyzed. These findings reveal that the Tsallis relative alpha$\alpha$-entropy of imaginarity exhibits higher decay rate under quantum channels compared to other measures. Finally, the ordering of single-qubit states are examined under these imaginarity measures, demonstrating that the order remains invariant under the bit-flip channel for specific parameter ranges. This study enhances the understanding of imaginarity as a quantum resource and its potential applications in quantum information theory.

TI High-fidelity quantum gates via optimizing short pulse sequences in
   three-level systems
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB We propose a robust and high-fidelity scheme for realizing universal quantum gates by optimizing short pulse sequences in a three-level system. To alleviate the sensitivity to the errors, we recombine all elements of error matrices to construct a cost function with three types of weight factors. The modulation parameters are obtained by searching for the minimum value of this cost function. The purposes of introducing the weight factors are to reduce the detrimental impact of high-order error matrices, suppress population leakage to the third state, correct the operational error in the qubit space, and optimize the total pulse area of short pulse sequences. The results demonstrate that the optimized sequences exhibit strong robustness against errors and effectively reduce the total pulse area. Therefore, this work presents a valuable method for achieving exceptional robustness and high speed in quantum computations.

TI Optimal robust control of cat-state qubits against parameter
   imperfections
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Cat-state qubits formed by photonic coherent states are a promising candidate for realizing fault-tolerant quantum computing. Such logic qubits have a biased noise channel where the bit-flip error dominates over all the other errors. In this manuscript, we propose an optimally robust protocol using the control method of shortcuts to adiabaticity to realize a high-fidelity state transfer in a cat-state qubit. We construct a shortcut based on the Lewis-Riesenfeld invariant and examine the stability versus different types of perturbations for the fast and robust bit flipping. Numerical simulations demonstrate that the bit flipping can be robust against systematic errors in our protocol. Even when the parameter imperfection rate for bit-flip control is 20%, the final population of the target state can still reach >= 99%. The optimally robust control provides a feasible method for fault-tolerant and scalable quantum computation.

TI Constructing resource-efficient quantum circuits for AES
SO FRONTIERS IN PHYSICS
AB An efficient quantum implementation of the advanced encryption standard (AES) is crucial for reducing the complexity of implementing an exhaustive key search through Grover's algorithm. In this paper, we study how to construct resource-efficient quantum circuits for AES. We consider the product of T-gates depth and width (TDW) and the product of full depth and width (FDW) as optimization targets. We propose a generic method, called the controlled control qubit cascade (CCQC) technique, to construct quantum circuits for nonlinear components with reduced TDW and FDW. Using this, we construct a quantum circuit for the AES S-box. Compared with recent work presented at ASIACRYPT 2023, our S-box quantum circuit achieves reductions of 2.3% in TDW and 45.2% in FDW. Additionally, we propose a new key schedule strategy to reduce the full depth of the AES quantum circuit. Finally, the trade-offs between T-gates depth and width and the parallel numbers of S-box and TDW are analyzed.

TI Mixed-State Topological Order under Coherent Noise
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Mixed-state phases of matter under local decoherence have recently garnered significant attention due to the ubiquitous presence of noise in current quantum processors. One of the key issues is understanding how topological quantum memory is affected by realistic coherent noise, such as random rotation noise and amplitude-damping noise. In this work, we investigate the intrinsic error threshold of the twodimensional toric code (TC), a paradigmatic topological quantum memory, under these types of coherent noise by employing both analytical and numerical methods based on the doubled-Hilbert-space formalism. A connection between the mixed-state phase of the decohered TC and a non-Hermitian Ashkin-Teller-type statistical-mechanics model is established, and the mixed-state phase diagrams under the coherent noise are obtained. We find remarkable stability of mixed-state topological order under random rotation noise with axes near the Y axis of qubits. We also identify intriguing extended critical regions at the phase boundaries, highlighting a connection with non-Hermitian physics. We argue that these phase boundaries provide upper bounds for the intrinsic error threshold, beyond which quantum error correction becomes impossible. We complement these findings by estimating the error thresholds for random rotation noise under standard quantum error correction, thereby providing lower bounds on the intrinsic error threshold.

AB Quantum computing is an emerging technology that has the potential to revolutionize fields such as cryptography, machine learning, optimization, and quantum simulation. However, a major challenge in the realization of quantum algorithms on actual machines is ensuring that the gates in a quantum circuit (i.e., corresponding operations) match the topology of a targeted architecture so that the circuit can be executed while, at the same time, the resulting costs (e.g., in terms of the number of additionally introduced gates, fidelity, etc.) are kept low. This is known as the quantum circuit mapping problem. This summary paper provides an overview of QMAP-an open-source tool that is part of the Munich Quantum Toolkit (MQT) and offers efficient, automated, and accessible methods for tackling this problem. To this end, the paper first briefly reviews the problem. Afterwards, it shows how QMAP can be used to efficiently map quantum circuits to quantum computing architectures from both a user's and a developer's perspective. QMAP is publicly available as open-source at https://github.com/cda-tum/qmap.

TI Learning Rule for a Quantum Neural Network Inspired by Hebbian Learning
SO IEICE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION AND SYSTEMS
AB Utilizing the enormous potential of quantum computers requires new and practical quantum algorithms. Motivated by the success of machine learning, we investigate the fusion of neural and quantum computing, and propose a learning method for a quantum neural network inspired by the Hebb rule. Based on an analogy between neuron-neuron interactions and qubit-qubit interactions, the proposed quantum learning rule successfully changes the coupling strengths between qubits according to training data. To evaluate the effectiveness and practical use of the method, we apply it to the memorization process of a neuro-inspired quantum associative memory model. Our numerical simulation results indicate that the proposed quantum versions of the Hebb and anti-Hebb rules improve the learning performance. Furthermore, we confirm that the probability of retrieving a target pattern from multiple learned patterns is sufficiently high.

AB recommendation systems face fundamental challenges in processing complex user preferences and managing large-scale data, particularly in restaurant recommendations where traditional methods struggle with context integration and computational efficiency. Our study presents a quantum-enhanced context aware recommendation system that combines Ordering Points To Identify Cluster Structure (OPTICS) clustering, Long Short Term Memory (LSTM), Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), Quantum Machine Learning, and Whale Optimization to address these limitations. Applied to the NYC Restaurant Dataset, our framework utilizes quantum enhanced clustering with advanced word embeddings, quantum-augmented Long Short Term Memory Recurrent Neural Network (LSTM RNN) for temporal pattern analysis, and quantum similarity metrics for restaurant matching. The system achieves remarkable performance metrics: 89.54% accuracy, Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 0.2876, Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 0.2234, precision of 0.9021, and recall of 0.8876, with an F-value of 189.6754 and a statistically significant P-value of 3.45e-32. These results demonstrate substantial improvements over classical methods in processing speed, feature representation, and similarity calculations, establishing a new benchmark in restaurant recommendation systems.

TI On-demand continuous-variable quantum entanglement source for integrated
   circuits
SO NANOPHOTONICS
AB Integration of devices generating non-classical states (such as entanglement) into photonic circuits is one of the major goals in achieving integrated quantum circuits (IQCs). This is demonstrated successfully in recent decades. Controlling the non-classicality generation in these micron scale devices is also crucial for the robust operation of the IQCs. Here, we propose a micron-scale quantum entanglement device whose nonlinearity (so the generated non classicality) can be tuned by several orders of magnitude via an applied voltage without altering the linear response. Quantum emitters (QEs), whose level-spacing can be tuned by voltage, are embedded into the hotspot of a metal nanostructure (MNS). QE-MNS coupling introduces a Fano resonance in the "nonlinear response". Nonlinearity, already enhanced extremely due to localization, can be controlled by the QEs' level-spacing. Nonlinearity can either be suppressed or be further enhanced by several orders. Fano resonance takes place in a relatively narrow frequency window so that similar to meV voltage-tunability for QEs becomes sufficient for a continuous turning on/off of the non-classicality. This provides as much as 5 orders of magnitude modulation depths.

TI HQRNN-FD: A Hybrid Quantum Recurrent Neural Network for Fraud Detection
SO ENTROPY
AB Detecting financial fraud is a critical aspect of modern intelligent financial systems. Despite the advances brought by deep learning in predictive accuracy, challenges persist-particularly in capturing complex, high-dimensional nonlinear features. This study introduces a novel hybrid quantum recurrent neural network for fraud detection (HQRNN-FD). The model utilizes variational quantum circuits (VQCs) incorporating angle encoding, data reuploading, and hierarchical entanglement to project transaction features into quantum state spaces, thereby facilitating quantum-enhanced feature extraction. For sequential analysis, the model integrates a recurrent neural network (RNN) with a self-attention mechanism to effectively capture temporal dependencies and uncover latent fraudulent patterns. To mitigate class imbalance, the synthetic minority over-sampling technique (SMOTE) is employed during preprocessing, enhancing both class representation and model generalizability. Experimental evaluations reveal that HQRNN-FD attains an accuracy of 0.972 on publicly available fraud detection datasets, outperforming conventional models by 2.4%. In addition, the framework exhibits robustness against quantum noise and improved predictive performance with increasing qubit numbers, validating its efficacy and scalability for imbalanced financial classification tasks.

TI Nonreciprocal entanglement in cavity magnomechanics exploiting chiral
   cavity-magnon coupling
SO FUNDAMENTAL RESEARCH
AB We propose a new mechanism to achieve nonreciprocal quantum entanglement in a cavity magnomechanical system by exploiting the chiral cavity-magnon coupling. The system consists of a magnon mode, a mechanical vibration mode, and two degenerate counter-propagating microwave cavity modes in a torus-shaped cavity. We show that nonreciprocal stationary microwave-magnon and-phonon bipartite entanglements and photon-magnon-phonon tripartite entanglement can be achieved by respectively driving different circulating cavity modes that hold a chiral coupling to the magnon mode. The nonreciprocal entanglements are shown to be robust against various experimental imperfections. We specifically show how such nonreciprocal entanglement can realize the channel multiplexing quantum teleportation from a microwave field to a solidstate magnon mode. The work may find promising applications of the cavity magnomechanical systems in noise-tolerant quantum processing, channel multiplexing quantum teleportation, and chiral magnonic quantum networks.

   Quantum Asymmetric Cryptography: An Implementation Study on Quantum
   Hardware
SO ELECTRONICS
AB The emergence of quantum computing poses significant threats to conventional public-key cryptography, driving the urgent need for quantum-resistant cryptographic solutions. While quantum key distribution addresses secure key exchange, its dependency on symmetric keys and point-to-point limitations present scalability constraints. Quantum Asymmetric Encryption (QAE) offers a promising alternative by leveraging quantum mechanical principles for security. This paper presents the first practical implementation of a QAE protocol on IBM Quantum devices, building upon the theoretical framework originally proposed by Yoon et al. We develop a generalized Grover Search Algorithm (GSA) framework that supports non-standard initial quantum states through novel diffusion operator designs, extending its applicability beyond idealized conditions. The complete QAE protocol, including key generation, encryption, and decryption stages, is translated into executable quantum circuits and evaluated on both IBM Quantum simulators and real quantum hardware. Experimental results demonstrate significant scalability challenges, with success probabilities deteriorating considerably for larger systems. The 2-qubit implementation achieves near-perfect accuracy (100% on the simulator, and 93.88% on the hardware), while performance degrades to 78.15% (simulator) and 45.84% (hardware) for 3 qubits, and declines critically to 48.08% (simulator) and 7.63% (hardware) for 4 qubits. This degradation is primarily attributed to noise and decoherence effects in current Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices, highlighting the limitations of single-iteration GSA approaches. Our findings underscore the critical need for enhanced hardware fidelity and algorithmic optimization to advance the practical viability of quantum cryptographic systems, providing valuable insights for bridging the gap between theoretical quantum cryptography and real-world implementations.

TI Digital noise spectroscopy with a quantum sensor
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB We introduce and experimentally demonstrate a quantum sensing protocol to sample and reconstruct the autocorrelation of a noise process using a single-qubit sensor under digital control modulation. This Walsh noise spectroscopy method exploits simple sequences of spin-flip pulses to generate a complete basis of digital filters that directly sample the power spectrum of the target noise in the sequency domain, from which the autocorrelation function in the time domain, as well as the power spectrum in the frequency domain, can be reconstructed using linear transformations. Our method, which can also be seen as an implementation of frame-based noise spectroscopy, solves the fundamental difficulty in sampling continuous functions with digital filters by introducing a transformation that relates the arithmetic and logical time domains. In comparison to standard, frequency-based dynamical-decoupling noise spectroscopy protocols, the accuracy of our method is only limited by sampling and discretization in the time domain and can be easily improved, even under limited evolution time due to decoherence and hardware limitations. Finally, we experimentally reconstruct the autocorrelation function of the effective magnetic field produced by the nuclear-spin bath on the electronic spin of a single nitrogen-vacancy center in diamond, discuss practical limitations of the method, and avenues to further improve the reconstruction accuracy.

TI Indefinite causal order enables perfect quantum communication with zero
   capacity channels
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB Quantum mechanics is compatible with scenarios where the relative order between two events can be indefinite. Here we show that two independent instances of a noisy process can behave as a perfect quantum communication channel when used in a coherent superposition of two alternative orders. This phenomenon occurs even if the original process has zero capacity to transmit quantum information. In contrast, perfect quantum communication does not occur when the message is sent directly from the sender to the receiver through a superposition of alternative paths, with an independent noise process acting on each path. The possibility of perfect quantum communication through independent noisy channels highlights a fundamental difference between the superposition of orders in time and the superposition of paths in space.

TI Efficient Verification of Continuous-Variable Quantum States and Devices
   without Assuming Identical and Independent Operations
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Continuous-variable quantum information, encoded into infinite-dimensional quantum systems, is a promising platform for the realization of many quantum information protocols, including quantum computation, quantum metrology, quantum cryptography, and quantum communication. To successfully demonstrate these protocols, an essential step is the certification of multimode continuous-variable quantum states and quantum devices. This problem is well studied under the assumption that multiple uses of the same device result in identical and independently distributed (i.i.d.) operations. However, in realistic scenarios, identical and independent state preparation and calls to the quantum devices cannot be generally guaranteed. Important instances include adversarial scenarios and instances of time-dependent and correlated noise. In this Letter, we propose the first set of reliable protocols for verifying multimode continuous-variable entangled states and devices in these non-i.i.d scenarios. Although not fully universal, these protocols are applicable to Gaussian quantum states, non-Gaussian hypergraph states, as well as amplification, attenuation, and purification of noisy coherent states.

TI Pulse-Driven Spin Paradigm for Noise-Aware Quantum Classification
SO COMPUTERS
AB Quantum machine learning (QML) integrates quantum computing with classical machine learning. Within this domain, QML-CQ classification tasks, where classical data is processed by quantum circuits, have attracted particular interest for their potential to exploit high-dimensional feature maps, entanglement-enabled correlations, and non-classical priors. Yet, practical realizations remain constrained by the Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) era, where limited qubit counts, gate errors, and coherence losses necessitate frugal, noise-aware strategies. The Data Re-Uploading (DRU) algorithm has emerged as a strong NISQ-compatible candidate, offering universal classification capabilities with minimal qubit requirements. While DRU has been experimentally demonstrated on ion-trap, photonic, and superconducting platforms, no implementations exist for spin-based quantum processing units (QPU-SBs), despite their scalability potential via CMOS-compatible fabrication and recent demonstrations of multi-qubit processors. Here, we present a pulse-level, noise-aware DRU framework for spin-based QPUs, designed to bridge the gap between gate-level models and realistic spin-qubit execution. Our approach includes (i) compiling DRU circuits into hardware-proximate, time-domain controls derived from the Loss-DiVincenzo Hamiltonian, (ii) explicitly incorporating coherent and incoherent noise sources through pulse perturbations and Lindblad channels, (iii) enabling systematic noise-sensitivity studies across one-, two-, and four-spin configurations via continuous-time simulation, and (iv) developing a noise-aware training pipeline that benchmarks gate-level baselines against spin-level dynamics using information-theoretic loss functions. Numerical experiments show that our simulations reproduce gate-level dynamics with fidelities near unity while providing a richer error characterization under realistic noise. Moreover, divergence-based losses significantly enhance classification accuracy and robustness compared to fidelity-based metrics. Together, these results establish the proposed framework as a practical route for advancing DRU on spin-based platforms and motivate future work on error-attentive training and spin-quantum-dot noise modeling.

TI Constructing Dynamical Symmetries for Quantum Computing: Applications to
   Coherent Dynamics in Coupled Quantum Dots
SO NANOMATERIALS
AB Dynamical symmetries, time-dependent operators that almost commute with the Hamiltonian, extend the role of ordinary symmetries. Motivated by progress in quantum technologies, we illustrate a practical algebraic approach to computing such time-dependent operators. Explicitly we expand them as a linear combination of time-independent operators with time-dependent coefficients. There are possible applications to the dynamics of systems of coupled coherent two-state systems, such as qubits, pumped by optical excitation and other addressing inputs. Thereby, the interaction of the system with the excitation is bilinear in the coherence between the two states and in the strength of the time-dependent excitation. The total Hamiltonian is a sum of such bilinear terms and of terms linear in the populations. The terms in the Hamiltonian form a basis for Lie algebra, which can be represented as coupled individual two-state systems, each using the population and the coherence between two states. Using the factorization approach of Wei and Norman, we construct a unitary quantum mechanical evolution operator that is a factored contribution of individual two-state systems. By that one can accurately propagate both the wave function and the density matrix with special relevance to quantum computing based on qubit architecture. Explicit examples are derived for the electronic dynamics in coupled semi-conducting nanoparticles that can be used as hardware for quantum technologies.

TI Deterministic one-way logic gates on a cloud quantum computer
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB One-way quantum computing is a promising candidate for fault-tolerant quantum computing. Here, we propose protocols to realize a deterministic one-way controlled-NOT (CNOT) gate and one-way X rotations on current quantum-computing platforms. By applying a delayed-choice scheme, we overcome a limit of most currently available quantum computers, which are unable to implement further operations on measured qubits or operations conditioned on measurement results from other qubits. Moreover, we decrease the error rate of the one-way logic gates, compared to the original protocol using local operations and classical communication. In addition, we apply our deterministic one-way CNOT gate in the Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm to show the feasibility of our proposal. We demonstrate all these one-way gates and algorithms by running experiments on the cloud quantum-computing platform IBM Quantum Experience.

TI Nonlocality activation in a photonic quantum network
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Bell nonlocality refers to correlations between two distant, entangled particles that challenge classical notions of local causality. Beyond its foundational significance, nonlocality is crucial for device-independent technologies like quantum key distribution and randomness generation. Nonlocality quickly deteriorates in the presence of noise, and restoring nonlocal correlations requires additional resources. These often come in the form of many instances of the input state and joint measurements, incurring a significant resource overhead. Here, we experimentally demonstrate that single copies of Bell-local states, incapable of violating any standard Bell inequality, can give rise to nonlocality after being embedded into a quantum network of multiple parties. We subject the initial entangled state to a quantum channel that broadcasts part of the state to two independent receivers and certify the nonlocality in the resulting network by violating a tailored Bell-like inequality. We obtain these results without making any assumptions about the prepared states, the quantum channel, or the validity of quantum theory. Our findings have fundamental implications for nonlocality and enable the practical use of nonlocal correlations in real-world applications, even in scenarios dominated by noise.
   Entangled local states can be made capable of violating Bell inequalities via nonlocality activation. Typical theoretical approaches require processing many copies of the original state and performing joint measurements on the ensemble. Here, instead, the authors experimentally demonstrate how to do so using a single copy of the state, broadcasting it to two spatially separated parties within a three-node network.

TI A dual-species Rydberg array
SO NATURE PHYSICS
AB Large-scale Rydberg atom arrays are used for highly coherent analogue quantum simulations and for digital quantum computations. However, advanced quantum protocols, such as quantum error correction, require midcircuit qubit operations, including the replenishment, reset and read-out of a subset of qubits. A compelling strategy for unlocking these capabilities is a dual-species architecture in which a second atomic species is controlled independently and entangled with the first through Rydberg interactions. Here, we realize a dual-species Rydberg array consisting of rubidium and caesium atoms and explore regimes of interactions and dynamics not accessible in single-species architectures. We achieve enhanced interspecies interactions by electrically tuning the Rydberg states close to a F & ouml;rster resonance. In this regime, we demonstrate an interspecies Rydberg blockade and implement a quantum state transfer from one species to another. We then generate a Bell state between Rb and Cs hyperfine qubits through an interspecies controlled-phase gate. Finally, we combine interspecies entanglement with a native midcircuit read-out to achieve quantum non-demolition measurements.

TI Quantum Annealing Initialization of the Quantum Approximate Optimization
   Algorithm
SO QUANTUM
AB The quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) is a prospective near-term quantum algorithm due to its modest circuit depth and promising benchmarks. However, an external parameter optimization required in the QAOA could become a performance bottleneck. This motivates studies of the optimization land-scape and search for heuristic ways of parameter initialization. In this work we visualize the optimization landscape of the QAOA applied to the MaxCut problem on random graphs, demonstrating that random initialization of the QAOA is prone to converging to local minima with sub-optimal performance. We introduce the initialization of QAOA parameters based on the Trotterized quantum annealing (TQA) protocol, parameterized by the Trotter time step. We find that the TQA initialization allows to circumvent the issue of false minima for a broad range of time steps, yielding the same performance as the best result out of an exponentially scaling number of random initializations. Moreover, we demonstrate that the optimal value of the time step coincides with the point of proliferation of Trotter errors in quantum annealing. Our results suggest practical ways of initializing QAOA protocols on near-term quantum devices and reveal new connections between QAOA and quantum annealing.

TI QUDA: quantum distributed adder algorithm

AB While adders are required for many classical and quantum algorithms, nowadays' single quantum computer implementations cannot handle the large qubit counts required in practical applications. Implementing a distributed approach is currently the only solution, but it poses the challenge of communication latency. This paper introduces a quantum distributed adder algorithm (QUDA) as a solution for many applications that require large qubit counts. QUDA offers a logarithmic number of instances of quantum data transfer for the addition of two numbers in comparison with existing solutions which are generally either based on ripple carry adders with a linear number of transmission rounds or attempt to distribute an existing monolithic circuit without specializing their techniques to adders. We include implementation details and the used testing methodology, showcasing the correctness and efficiency of the proposed algorithm.

TI Scaling advantage over path-integral Monte Carlo in quantum simulation
   of geometrically frustrated magnets
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB The promise of quantum computing lies in harnessing programmable quantum devices for practical applications such as efficient simulation of quantum materials and condensed matter systems. One important task is the simulation of geometrically frustrated magnets in which topological phenomena can emerge from competition between quantum and thermal fluctuations. Here we report on experimental observations of equilibration in such simulations, measured on up to 1440 qubits with microsecond resolution. By initializing the system in a state with topological obstruction, we observe quantum annealing (QA) equilibration timescales in excess of one microsecond. Measurements indicate a dynamical advantage in the quantum simulation compared with spatially local update dynamics of path-integral Monte Carlo (PIMC). The advantage increases with both system size and inverse temperature, exceeding a million-fold speedup over an efficient CPU implementation. PIMC is a leading classical method for such simulations, and a scaling advantage of this type was recently shown to be impossible in certain restricted settings. This is therefore an important piece of experimental evidence that PIMC does not simulate QA dynamics even for sign-problem-free Hamiltonians, and that near-term quantum devices can be used to accelerate computational tasks of practical relevance. Experimental demonstration of quantum speedup that scales with the system size is the goal of near-term quantum computing. Here, the authors demonstrate such scaling advantage for a D-Wave quantum annealer over analogous classical algorithms in simulations of frustrated quantum magnets.

TI Error mitigation on a near-term quantum photonic device
SO QUANTUM
AB Photon loss is destructive to the performance of quantum photonic devices and therefore suppressing the effects of photon loss is paramount to photonic quantum technologies. We present two schemes to mitigate the effects of photon loss for a Gaussian Boson Sampling device, in particular, to improve the estimation of the sampling probabilities. Instead of using error correction codes which are expensive in terms of their hardware resource overhead, our schemes require only a small amount of hardware modifications or even no modification. Our loss-suppression techniques rely either on collecting additional measurement data or on classical post-processing once the measurement data is obtained. We show that with a moderate cost of classical post processing, the effects of photon loss can be significantly suppressed for a certain amount of loss. The proposed schemes are thus a key enabler for applications of near-term photonic quantum devices.

TI Unitary k-Designs from Random Number-Conserving Quantum Circuits
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW X
AB Local random circuits scramble efficiently and, accordingly, have a range of applications in quantum information and quantum dynamics. With a global U(1) charge, however, the scrambling ability is reduced; for example, such random circuits do not generate the entire group of number-conserving unitaries. We establish two results using the statistical mechanics of k-fold replicated circuits. First, we show that finite moments cannot distinguish the ensemble that local random circuits generate from the Haar ensemble on the entire group of number-conserving unitaries. Specifically, the circuits form a k(c)-design with k(c) = O(L-d) for a system in d spatial dimensions with linear dimension L. Second, for k < k(c), we derive bounds on the depth tau required for the circuit to converge to an approximate k-design. The depth is lower bounded by diffusion kL(2)ln(L) less than or similar to tau. In contrast, without number conservation tau similar to poly(k)L. The convergence of the circuit ensemble is controlled by the low-energy properties of a frustration-free quantum statistical model which spontaneously breaks k U(1) symmetries. We conjecture that the associated Goldstone modes set the spectral gap for arbitrary spatial and qudit dimensions, leading to an upper bound tau less than or similar to kL(d+2).

TI Electrical two-qubit gates within a pair of clock-qubit magnetic
   molecules
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Enhanced coherence in HoW10 molecular spin qubits has been demonstrated by use of clock-transitions (CTs). More recently it was shown that, while operating at the CTs, it was possible to use an electrical field to selectively address HoW10 molecules pointing in a given direction, within a crystal that contains two kinds of identical but inversion-related molecules. Herein we theoretically explore the possibility of employing the electric field to effect entangling two-qubit quantum gates within a 2-qubit Hilbert space resulting from dipolar coupling of two CT-protected HoW10 molecules in a diluted crystal. We estimate the thermal evolution of T-1, T-2, find that CTs are also optimal operating points from the point of view of phonons, and lay out how to combine a sequence of microwave and electric field pulses to achieve coherent control within a switchable two-qubit operating space between symmetric and asymmetric qubit states that are protected both from spin-bath and from phonon-bath decoherence. This two-qubit gate approach presents an elegant correspondence between physical stimuli and logical operations, meanwhile avoiding any spontaneous unitary evolution of the qubit states. Finally, we found a highly protected 1-qubit subspace resulting from the interaction between two clock molecules.

TI Quantum sensing with topological-paired bound states
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB We present an efficient and robust protocol for quantum-enhanced sensing using a single qubit in the topological waveguide system. Our method relies on the topological-paired bound states, which are localized near the qubit and can be effectively regarded as a two-level system. Through the lens of Bayesian inference theory, we show that the sensitivity can reach the Heisenberg limit across a large field range. Inheriting from the topological robustness of the waveguide, our sensing protocol is robust against local perturbations. Besides, our sensing protocol utilizes a product state as the initial state, which can be easily prepared in experiments. We expect this approach would pave the way toward robust topological quantum sensors based on near-term quantum platforms such as superconducting qubits and Rydberg arrays.

TI Power of Sequential Protocols in Hidden Quantum Channel Discrimination
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB In many natural and engineered systems, unknown quantum channels act on a subsystem that cannot be directly controlled and measured, but is instead learned through a controllable subsystem that weakly interacts with it. We study quantum channel discrimination (QCD) under these restrictions, which we call hidden system QCD. We find sequential protocols achieve perfect discrimination and saturate the Heisenberg limit. In contrast, depth-1 parallel and multishot protocols cannot solve hidden system QCD. This suggests sequential protocols are superior in experimentally realistic situations.

TI Experimental Demonstration of Instrument-Specific Quantum Memory Effects
   and Non-Markovian Process Recovery for Common-Cause Processes
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB The duration, strength, and structure of memory effects are crucial properties of physical evolution. Because of the invasive nature of quantum measurement, such properties must be defined with respect to the probing instruments employed. Here, using a photonic platform, we experimentally demonstrate this necessity via two paradigmatic processes: future-history correlations in the first process can be erased by an intermediate quantum measurement; for the second process, a noisy classical measurement blocks the effect of history. We then apply memory truncation techniques to recover an efficient description that approximates expectation values for multitime observables. Our proof-of-principle analysis paves the way for experiments concerning more general non-Markovian quantum processes and highlights where standard open systems techniques break down.

TI Improved autonomous error correction using variable dissipation in small
   logical qubit architectures
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Coherence times for superconducting qubits have greatly improved over time. Moreover, small logical qubit architectures using engineered dissipation have shown great promise for further improvements in the coherence of a logical qubit manifold comprised of few physical qubits. Nevertheless, optimal working parameters for small logical qubits are generally not well understood. This work presents several approaches to finding preferential parameter configurations by looking at three different cases of increasing complexity. We begin by looking at state stabilization of a single qubit using dissipation via coupling to a lossy object. We look at the limiting factors in this approach to error correction, and how we address those by numerically optimizing the parametric coupling strength with the lossy object having an effective time-varying dissipation rate-we call this a pulse-reset cycle. We then translate this approach to more efficient state stabilization to an abstracted three-qubit flip code, and end by looking at the very small logical qubit (VSLQ). By using these techniques, we can further increase logical state lifetimes for different architectures. We show significant advantages in using a pulse-reset cycle over numerically optimized, fixed parameter spaces.

TI Quantum Algorithm for Solving the Continuous Hidden Symmetry Subgroup
   Problem
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Quantum computers are expected to be able to outperform classical computers. In fact, some computational problems such as integer factorization can be solved on quantum computers substantially faster than classical computers. Interestingly, these problems can be cast in a framework of the hidden symmetry subgroup problem. However, only a few of quantum algorithms for effciently solving this problem have been known, and the approaches used in all previous results can be applied to particular groups with specific group actions. In this paper, we introduce new technique for solving the hidden symmetry subgroup problem which can be applicable for any groups and any group actions with a certain condition. In addition, we define the continuous hidden symmetry subgroup problem on a group by employing a continuous oracle function, and prove that if the group is a metric space and the group action satisfies some condition, then the continuous hidden symmetry subgroup problem can be efficiently reduced to the continuous hidden subgroup problem. In particular, we show that there exists an efficient quantum algorithm to solve the continuous hidden symmetry subgroup problem on R-n, while it has not yet been shown that the original hidden symmetry subgroup problem on R-n can be efficiently solved by a quantum computer.

TI Quantum Zeno blockade in optomechanical systems
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB We investigate the application of the quantum Zeno effect (QZE) for the preparation of non-Gaussian states in optomechanical systems. By frequently monitoring the system, the QZE can suppress transitions away from desired subspaces of states. We show that this enables the preparation of states in qubit subspaces even in the presence of noise and decoherence. Through analytical and numerical analysis, we demonstrate that QZE-based protocols can achieve robust state preparation of qubit states in continuous variable architectures. Our results extend the utility of the QZE beyond discrete systems, highlighting its potential for enhancing quantum control in more complex quantum information processing environments. These findings offer a promising approach for achieving reliable non-Gaussian states in optomechanical systems, with implications for the development of photonic quantum computing and quantum sensing.

TI Microsatellite-based real-time quantum key distribution
SO NATURE
AB A quantum network1, 2-3 provides an infrastructure that connects quantum devices with revolutionary computing, sensing and communication capabilities. A quantum satellite constellation offers a solution to facilitate the quantum network on a global scale4,5. The Micius satellite has verified the feasibility of satellite quantum communications6, 7, 8-9; however, scaling up quantum satellite constellations is challenging, requiring small lightweight satellites, portable ground stations and real-time secure key exchange. Here we tackle these challenges and report the development of a quantum microsatellite capable of performing space-to-ground quantum key distribution using portable ground stations. The microsatellite payload weighs approximately 23 kilograms, and the portable ground station weighs about 100 kilograms, representing reductions by more than 1 and 2 orders of magnitude, respectively. Using this set-up, we demonstrate satellite-based quantum key distribution with multiple ground stations and achieve the sharing of up to 1.07 million bits of secure keys during a single satellite pass. In addition, we multiplex bidirectional satellite-ground optical communication with quantum communication, enabling key distillation and secure communication in real time. Also, a secret key, enabling one-time pad encryption of images, is created between China and South Africa at locations separated by over 12,900 kilometres on Earth. The compact quantum payload can be readily assembled on existing space stations10,11 or small satellites12, paving the way for a satellite-constellation-based quantum and classical network for widespread real-life applications.

TI Cavity-Enhanced Optical Lattices for Scaling Neutral Atom Quantum
   Technologies to Higher Qubit Numbers
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB We demonstrate a cavity-based solution to scale up experiments with ultracold atoms in optical lattices by an order of magnitude over state-of-the-art free-space lattices. Our two-dimensional (2D) optical lat-tices are created by power-enhancement cavities with large mode waists of 489(8) mu m and allow us to trap ultracold strontium atoms at a lattice depth of 60 mu K by using only 80 mW of input light per cavity axis. We characterize these lattices using high-resolution clock spectroscopy and resolve carrier transitions between different vibrational levels. With these spectral features, we locally measure the lattice potential envelope and the sample temperature with a spatial resolution limited only by the optical resolution of the imaging system. The measured ground-band and trap lifetimes are 18(3) s and 59(2) s, respectively, and the lattice frequency (depth) is long-term stable on the megahertz (0.1%) level. Our results show that large, deep, and stable 2D cavity-enhanced lattices can be created at any wavelength and can significantly increase the qubit number for neutral-atom-based quantum simulators, quantum computers, sensors, and optical-lattice clocks.

TI Gutzwiller wave function on a digital quantum computer
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB The determination of the ground state of quantum many-body systems via digital quantum computers rests upon the initialization of a sufficiently educated guess. This requirement becomes more stringent the greater the system. Preparing physically motivated Ansatze on quantum hardware is therefore important to achieve a quantum advantage in the simulation of correlated electrons. In this spirit, we introduce the Gutzwiller wave function (GWF) within the context of the digital quantum simulation of the Fermi-Hubbard model. We present a quantum routine to initialize the GWF that comprises two parts. In the first, the noninteracting state associated with the U = 0 limit of the model is prepared. In the second, the nonunitary Gutzwiller operator that selectively removes states with doubly occupied sites from the wave function is performed by adding to every lattice site an ancilla qubit, the measurement of which in the vertical bar 0 > state confirms the operator was applied. Due to its nondeterministic nature, we estimate the success rate of the algorithm in generating the GWF as a function of the lattice size and the interaction strength U/t. The scaling of the quantum circuit metrics and its integration in general quantum simulation algorithms are also discussed.

TI A Practical Performance Benchmark of Post-Quantum Cryptography Across
   Heterogeneous Computing Environments
SO CRYPTOGRAPHY
AB The emergence of large-scale quantum computing presents an imminent threat to contemporary public-key cryptosystems, with quantum algorithms such as Shor's algorithm capable of efficiently breaking RSA and elliptic curve cryptography (ECC). This vulnerability has catalyzed accelerated standardization efforts for post-quantum cryptography (PQC) by the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and global security stakeholders. While theoretical security analysis of these quantum-resistant algorithms has advanced considerably, comprehensive real-world performance benchmarks spanning diverse computing environments-from high-performance cloud infrastructure to severely resource-constrained IoT devices-remain insufficient for informed deployment planning. This paper presents the most extensive cross-platform empirical evaluation to date of NIST-selected PQC algorithms, including CRYSTALS-Kyber and NTRU for key encapsulation mechanisms (KEMs), alongside BIKE as a code-based alternative, and CRYSTALS-Dilithium and Falcon for digital signatures. Our systematic benchmarking framework measures computational latency, memory utilization, key sizes, and protocol overhead across multiple security levels (NIST Levels 1, 3, and 5) in three distinct hardware environments and various network conditions. Results demonstrate that contemporary server architectures can implement these algorithms with negligible performance impact (<5% additional latency), making immediate adoption feasible for cloud services. In contrast, resource-constrained devices experience more significant overhead, with computational demands varying by up to 12x between algorithms at equivalent security levels, highlighting the importance of algorithm selection for edge deployments. Beyond standalone algorithm performance, we analyze integration challenges within existing security protocols, revealing that naive implementation of PQC in TLS 1.3 can increase handshake size by up to 7x compared to classical approaches. To address this, we propose and evaluate three optimization strategies that reduce bandwidth requirements by 40-60% without compromising security guarantees. Our investigation further encompasses memory-constrained implementation techniques, side-channel resistance measures, and hybrid classical-quantum approaches for transitional deployments. Based on these comprehensive findings, we present a risk-based migration framework and algorithm selection guidelines tailored to specific use cases, including financial transactions, secure firmware updates, vehicle-to-infrastructure communications, and IoT fleet management. This practical roadmap enables organizations to strategically prioritize systems for quantum-resistant upgrades based on data sensitivity, resource constraints, and technical feasibility. Our results conclusively demonstrate that PQC is deployment-ready for most applications, provided that implementations are carefully optimized for the specific performance characteristics and security requirements of target environments. We also identify several remaining research challenges for the community, including further optimization for ultra-constrained devices, standardization of hybrid schemes, and hardware acceleration opportunities.

TI Mode pairing quantum key distribution with light source monitoring
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB Mode pairing quantum key distribution (MP-QKD) overcomes the repeaterless bound without requiring phase locking and phase tracking. However, MP-QKD still assumes that the light source is trusted, which can present challenges in practical deployments and potentially introduce security vulnerabilities. In this paper, we propose a light source monitoring (LSM) scheme that guarantees the security of MP-QKD with the untrusted light sources. The simulation results demonstrate that, when considering untrusted light sources, the performance of MP-QKD with the LSM scheme remains nearly identical to that of ideal MP-QKD, even in the presence of the source fluctuations. Furthermore, we simplify some of the complex integration calculations involved in simulating the observed quantities of MP-QKD, which reduces the running time of the parameter optimization procedure.

TI A multi-party verifiable quantum proxy signature scheme based on quantum
   teleportation
SO JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS
AB With the development of science and technology and the appearance of various special conditions that cause signers to be unable to sign, proxy signature is gradually becoming a hot spot in cryptography research. This paper combines proxy signature, quantum teleportation, and multi-party verification and proposes a multi-party verifiable quantum proxy signature scheme based on quantum teleportation. This scheme has the following characteristics: The authentication method based on the Hash function can effectively solve the problem of identity identification among members; in order for the proxy signer to be able to verify the correctness of the proxy authorization, a form of proxy signature authorization that concatenates the identity information of the original signer is used. The security analysis shows that our scheme is unforgeable and undeniable and can resist intercept-resend attacks and cheating attacks.

TI Self-attention U-Net decoder for toric codes
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB In the noisy intermediate-scale quantum era, one of the most crucial bottlenecks for the realization of universal quantum computation is error correction. Stabilizer code is the most recognizable type of quantum error-correction code. A scalable efficient decoder is most desired for the application of the quantum error-correction codes. In this work, we propose a self-attention U-Net quantum decoder (SU-NetQD) for toric code, which outperforms the minimum-weight perfect-matching decoder, especially in the circuit-level noise environments. Specifically, with our SU-NetQD, we achieve lower logical error rates compared with MWPM and discover an increased trend of code threshold as the increase of noise bias. We obtain a high threshold of 0.231 for the extremely biased noise environment. The combination of low-level decoder and high-level decoder is the key innovation for the high accuracy of our decoder. With transfer learning mechanics, our decoder is scalable for cases with different code distances. Our decoder provides a practical tool for quantum noise analysis and promotes the practicality of quantum error-correction codes and quantum computing.

TI No graph state is preparable in quantum networks with bipartite sources
   and no classical communication
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB In research concerning quantum networks, it is often assumed that the parties can classically communicate with each other. However, classical communication might introduce a substantial delay to the network, especially if it is large. As the latency of a network is one of its most important characteristics, it is interesting to consider quantum networks in which parties cannot communicate classically and ask what limitations this assumption imposes on the possibility of preparing multipartite states in such networks. We show that graph states of an arbitrary prime local dimension known for their numerous applications in quantum information cannot be generated in a quantum network in which parties are connected via sources of bipartite quantum states and the classical communication is replaced by some pre-shared classical correlations. We then generalise our result to arbitrary quantum states that are sufficiently close to graph states.

TI Random coordinate descent: A simple alternative for optimizing
   parameterized quantum circuits
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Variational quantum algorithms rely on the optimization of parameterized quantum circuits in noisy settings. The commonly used back-propagation procedure in classical machine learning is not directly applicable in this setting due to the collapse of quantum states after measurements. Thus, gradient estimations constitute a significant overhead in a gradient-based optimization of such quantum circuits. This paper introduces a random coordinate descent algorithm as a practical and easy-to-implement alternative to the full gradient descent algorithm. This algorithm only requires one partial derivative at each iteration. Motivated by the behavior of measurement noise in the practical optimization of parameterized quantum circuits, this paper presents an optimization problem setting that is amenable to analysis. Under this setting, the random coordinate descent algorithm exhibits the same level of stochastic stability as the full gradient approach, making it as resilient to noise. The complexity of the random coordinate descent method is generally no worse than that of the gradient descent and can be much better for various quantum optimization problems with anisotropic Lipschitz constants. Theoretical analysis and extensive numerical experiments validate our findings.

TI Classical and quantum machine learning applications in spintronics
SO DIGITAL DISCOVERY
AB In this article we demonstrate the applications of classical and quantum machine learning in quantum transport and spintronics. With the help of a two-terminal device with magnetic impurities we show how machine learning algorithms can predict the highly non-linear nature of conductance as well as the non-equilibrium spin response function for any random magnetic configuration. By mapping this quantum mechanical problem onto a classification problem, we are able to obtain much higher accuracy beyond the linear response regime compared to the prediction obtained with conventional regression methods. We finally describe the applicability of quantum machine learning which has the capability to handle a significantly large configuration space. Our approach is applicable for solid state devices as well as for molecular systems. These outcomes are crucial in predicting the behavior of large-scale systems where a quantum mechanical calculation is computationally challenging and therefore would play a crucial role in designing nanodevices.

TI A quantum annealing-sequential quadratic programming assisted finite
   element simulation for non-linear and history-dependent mechanical
   problems
SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF MECHANICS A-SOLIDS
AB We propose a framework to solve non-linear and history -dependent mechanical problems based on a hybrid classical computer-quantum annealer approach. Quantum Computers are anticipated to solve particular operations exponentially faster. The available possible operations are however not as versatile as with a classical computer. Nevertheless, quantum annealers (QAs) are well suited to evaluate the minimum state of a Hamiltonian quadratic potential. Therefore, we reformulate the elasto-plastic finite element problem as a double -minimisation process framed at the structural scale using the variational updates formulation. In order to comply with the expected quadratic nature of the Hamiltonian, the resulting non-linear minimisation problems are iteratively solved with the suggested Quantum Annealing -assisted Sequential Quadratic Programming (QA-SQP): a sequence of minimising quadratic problems is performed by approximating the objective function by a quadratic Taylor's series. Each quadratic minimisation problem of continuous variables is then transformed into a binary quadratic problem. This binary quadratic minimisation problem can be solved on quantum annealing hardware such as the D-Wave2 system. The applicability of the proposed framework is demonstrated with one- and two-dimensional elasto-plastic numerical benchmarks. The current work provides a pathway of performing general non-linear finite element simulations assisted by quantum computing.

TI Flying-qubit control via a three-level atom with tunable waveguide
   couplings
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB The control of flying qubits is at the core of quantum networks. When the flying qubits are carried by single -photon fields, the control involves not only their logical states but also their shapes. In this paper we explore a variety of flying-qubit control problems using a three-level atom with time-varying tunable couplings to two input-output channels. It is shown that one can tune the couplings of a A-type atom to distribute a single photon into the two channels with arbitrary shapes, or use a A-type atom or a V-type atom to catch an arbitrary-shape distributed single photon. The A-type atom can also be designed to transfer a flying qubit from one channel to the other, with both the central frequency and the photon shape being converted. With a s-type atom, one can shape a pair of correlated photons via cascaded emission. In all cases, analytical formulas are derived for the coupling functions to fulfill these control tasks. Their correlation properties and physical limitations are discussed as well. These results provide useful control protocols for high-fidelity quantum information transmission over complex quantum networks.

TI Multipartite quantum correlations in a two-mode Dicke model
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We analyze multipartite correlations in a generalized Dicke model involving two optical modes interacting with an ensemble of two-level atoms. In particular, we examine correlations beyond the standard bipartite entanglement and derive exact results in the thermodynamic limit. The model presents two superradiant phases involving the spontaneous breaking of either a Z2 or a U(1) symmetry. The latter is characterized by the emergence of a Goldstone excitation, found to significantly affect the correlation profiles. Focusing on the correlations between macroscopic subsystems, we analyze both the mutual information and the entanglement of formation for all possible bipartitions among the optical and matter degrees of freedom. It is found that while each mode entangles with the atoms, the bipartite entanglement between the modes is zero, and they share only classical correlations and quantum discord. We also study the monogamy of multipartite entanglement and show that there exists genuine tripartite entanglement, i.e., quantum correlations that the atoms share with the two modes but that are not shared with them individually, only in the vicinity of the critical lines. Our results elucidate the intricate correlation structures underlying superradiant phase transitions in multimode systems.

TI Tailoring dynamical codes for biased noise: the
   X3Z3 Floquet code
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB We propose the X3Z3 Floquet code, a dynamical code with improved performance under biased noise compared to other Floquet codes. The enhanced performance is attributed to a simplified decoding problem resulting from a persistent stabiliser-product symmetry, which surprisingly exists in a code without constant stabilisers. Even if such a symmetry is allowed, we prove that general dynamical codes with two-qubit parity measurements cannot admit one-dimensional decoding graphs, a key feature responsible for the high performance of bias-tailored stabiliser codes. Despite this, our comprehensive simulations show that the symmetry of the X3Z3 Floquet code renders its performance under biased noise far better than several leading Floquet codes. To maintain high-performance implementation in hardware without native two-qubit parity measurements, we introduce ancilla-assisted bias-preserving parity measurement circuits. Our work establishes the X3Z3 code as a prime quantum error-correcting code, particularly for devices with reduced connectivity, such as the honeycomb and heavy-hexagonal architectures.

TI Probing topological spin liquids on a programmable quantum simulator
SO SCIENCE
AB Quantum spin liquids, exotic phases of matter with topological order, have been a major focus in physics for the past several decades. Such phases feature long-range quantum entanglement that can potentially be exploited to realize robust quantum computation. We used a 219-atom programmable quantum simulator to probe quantum spin liquid states. In our approach, arrays of atoms were placed on the links of a kagome lattice, and evolution under Rydberg blockade created frustrated quantum states with no local order. The onset of a quantum spin liquid phase of the paradigmatic toric code type was detected by using topological string operators that provide direct signatures of topological order and quantum correlations. Our observations enable the controlled experimental exploration of topological matter and protected quantum information processing.

AB Earlier reports have described a quantum computing architecture, in which key elements are derived from control functions in biology. In this further continuing research, focus is on the signaling and control of a flow of qubits in that architecture, mimicking synapse signals and neurological controls. After a short description of that architecture, and of quantum sensing elements, it is first shown how the coloring of quantum particle flows, implemented as in mathematical colored algebras, can reduce decoherence and enhance the decidability of quantum processing elements. Next, after reviewing specific human biology functions, and exploiting experimental results on excitation modes in live animals, it is shown how to achieve separation of the quantum control & signaling signals. Technologies and designs from particle physics are discussed as well as open research issues towards a realization of a quantum computing architecture with decidable signaling.

TI A fully passive transmitter for decoy-state quantum key distribution
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB A passive quantum key distribution (QKD) transmitter generates the quantum states prescribed by a QKD protocol at random, combining a fixed quantum mechanism and a post-selection step. By circumventing the use of active optical modulators externally driven by random number generators, passive QKD transmitters offer immunity to modulator side channels and potentially enable higher frequencies of operation. Recently, the first linear optics setup suitable for passive decoy-state QKD has been proposed. In this work, we simplify the prototype and adopt sharply different approaches for BB84 polarization encoding and decoy-state parameter estimation. In particular, our scheme avoids a probabilistic post-selection step that is central to the former proposal. On top of it, we elaborate a simple and tight custom-made security analysis.

TI Light in quantum computing and simulation: perspective
SO OPTICA QUANTUM
AB A summary is given of recent progress in photonic quantum simulation and computation. Non-error-corrected machines performing specialised tasks have already demonstrated a quantum advantage over the best algorithms running on conventional computers, and practical applications for such machines are being explored. Meanwhile, designs for error-corrected fault-tolerant quantum computers based on light are reducing the performance requirements for individual components and systems, although the engineering challenges are severe. Light also plays a central role in other platforms for quantum computing and simulation, from control of individual atomic qubits to remote entanglement of separate processing nodes, along with an important role in communications and other long-distance networks.

TI First-order crosstalk mitigation in parallel quantum gates driven with
   multi-photon transitions
SO APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS
AB We demonstrate an order of magnitude reduction in the sensitivity to optical crosstalk for neighboring trapped-ion qubits during simultaneous single-qubit gates driven with individual addressing beams. Gates are implemented via two-photon Raman transitions, where crosstalk is mitigated by offsetting the drive frequencies for each qubit to avoid first-order crosstalk effects from inter-beam two-photon resonance. The technique is simple to implement, and we find that phase-dependent crosstalk due to optical interference is reduced on the most impacted neighbor from a maximal fractional rotation error of 0.185(4) without crosstalk mitigation to <= 0.006 with the mitigation strategy. Furthermore, we characterize first-order crosstalk in the two-qubit gate and avoid the resulting rotation errors for the arbitrary-axis Molmer-Sorensen gate via a phase-agnostic composite gate. Finally, we demonstrate holistic system performance by constructing a composite CNOT gate using the improved single-qubit gates and phase-agnostic two-qubit gate. This work is done on the Quantum Scientific Computing Open User Testbed; however, our methods are widely applicable for individual addressing Raman gates and impose no significant overhead, enabling immediate improvement for quantum processors that incorporate this technique.

TI A quantum annealing protocol to solve the nuclear shell model
SO SCIPOST PHYSICS
AB The nuclear shell model accurately describes the structure and dynamics of atomic nuclei. However, the exponential scaling of the basis size with the number of degrees freedom hampers a direct numerical solution for heavy nuclei. In this work, we present a quantum annealing protocol to obtain nuclear ground states. We propose a tailored driver Hamiltonian that preserves a large gap and validate our approach in a dozen nuclei with basis sizes up to 105 using classical simulations of the annealing evolution. We explore the relation between the spectral gap and the total time of the annealing protocol, assessing its accuracy by comparing the fidelity and energy relative error to classical benchmarks. While the nuclear Hamiltonian is non-local and thus challenging to implement in current setups, the estimated computational cost of our annealing protocol quantum circuits is polynomial in the single-particle basis size, paving the way to study heavier nuclei.

We implement this protocol on two different systems, a transmon qubit and a lambda/4 resonator. We demonstrate that this two-tone Josephson spectroscopy operates well into the millimeter-wave band, reaching frequencies larger than 80 GHz, and is well suited for probing highly coherent quantum systems.

TI Comparing Shor and Steane error correction using the Bacon-Shor code
SO SCIENCE ADVANCES
AB Quantum states decohere through interaction with the environment. Quantum error correction can preserve coherence through active feedback wherein quantum information is encoded into a logical state with a high degree of symmetry. Perturbations are detected by measuring the symmetries of the state and corrected by applying gates based on these measurements. To measure the symmetries without perturbing the data, ancillary quantum states are required. Shor error correction uses a separate quantum state for the measurement of each symmetry. Steane error correction maps the perturbations onto a logical ancilla qubit, which is then measured to check several symmetries simultaneously. We experimentally compare Shor and Steane correction of bit flip errors using the Bacon-Shor code implemented in a chain of 23 trapped atomic ions. We find that the Steane method produces fewer errors after a single round of error correction and less disturbance to the data qubits without error correction.

TI Limitations in Quantum Computing from Resource Constraints
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Fault-tolerant schemes can use error correction to make a quantum computation arbitrarily accurate, provided that errors per physical component are smaller than a certain threshold and independent of the computer size. However, in current experiments, physical-resource limitations such as energy, volume, or available bandwidth induce error rates that typically grow as the computer grows. We analyse how error correction performs under such constraints and show that the amount of error correction can be optimized, leading to a maximum attainable computational accuracy. We find this maximum for generic situations where noise is scale dependent. By inverting the logic, we provide experimenters with a tool for finding the minimum resources required to run an algorithm with a given computational accuracy. When combined with a full-stack quantum computing model, this provides the basis for energetic estimates of future large-scale quantum computers.

TI Geometric quantification of multiparty entanglement through
   orthogonality of vectors
SO EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL PLUS
AB The wedge product of vectors has been shown to yield the generalised entanglement measure I-concurrence, wherein the separability of the multiparty qubit system arises from the parallelism of vectors in the underlying Hilbert space of the subsystems. Here, we demonstrate the geometrical conditions of the post-measurement vectors which maximise the entanglement corresponding to the bi-partitions and can yield non-identical set of maximally entangled states. The Bell states for the two-qubit case, GHZ and GHZ like states with superposition of four constituents for three qubits, naturally arise as the maximally entangled states. The geometric conditions for maximally entangled two-qudit systems are derived, leading to the generalised Bell states, where the reduced density matrices are maximally mixed. We further show that the reduced density matrix for an arbitrary finite dimensional subsystem of a general qudit state can be constructed from the overlap of the post-measurement vectors. Using this approach, we discuss the trade-off between the local properties, namely predictability and coherence with the global property, entanglement for the non-maximally entangled two-qubit state.

TI Distribution of controlled unitary quantum gates towards factoring large
   numbers on today's small-register devices
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Factoring a 2048-bit number using Shor's algorithm, when accounting for error correction, reportedly requires 400,000 qubits. However, it is well known that there is yet much time before we will have this many qubits in the same local system. This is why we propose a protocol for distributed quantum computation applicable to small register devices, specifically for the distribution of controlled unitary gates, the key element in the construction of every quantum computation algorithm. We leverage quantum sharing of partial results to obtain a parallel processing scheme, allowing for the first time the quantum distribution of very large gates with thousands of inputs using only small register devices with tens of qubits. In this way, we improve all previous controlled unitary gate distribution approaches, obtaining surprising results. The impact is quantified for recent milestone hardware realizations of quantum processors.

While the original proposalused PauliXor PauliZoperators in a square structure, thesecodes can be improved by rotating the lattice or incorporating amix of generators in the XZZX variant. However, a comprehen-sive theoretical analysis of the logical error rate for these variantshas been lacking. To address this gap, we present theoreticalformulas based on recent advancements in understanding theweight distribution of stabilizer codes. For example, over anasymmetric channel with asymmetryA= 10and a physicalerror rate p -> 0, we observe that the logical error rateasymptotically approaches pL -> 10p(2 ) for the rotated[[9,1,3]]XZZX code and pL -> 18.3p2for the[[13,1,3]] surfacecode. Additionally, we observe a particular behavior regardingrectangular lattices in the presence of asymmetric channels.Our findings demonstrate that implementing both rotation andXZZX modifications simultaneously can lead to suboptimal performance. Thus, in scenarios involving a rectangular lattice,it is advisable to avoid using both modifications simultaneously

TI Quantum Algorithm for the Direct Calculations of Vertical Ionization

AB Recently, a quantum algorithm that is capable of directly calculating the energy gap between two electronic states having different spin quantum numbers without inspecting the total energy of the individual electronic states was proposed. This quantum algorithm guarantees an exponential speedup, like quantum phase estimation (QPE)-based full-CI, with much lower costs. In this work, we propose a modified quantum circuit for the direct calculations of spin state energy gaps to reduce the number of qubits and quantum gates, extending the quantum algorithm to the direct calculation of vertical ionization energies. Numerical quantum circuit simulations for the ionization of light atoms (He, Li, Be, B, C, and N) and small molecules (HF, BF, CF, CO, O-2, NO, CN, F-2, H2O, and NH3) revealed that the proposed quantum algorithm affords the vertical ionization energies within 0.1 eV of precision.

TI Qubit Recycling Revisited

CT ACM SIGPLAN Conference on Programming Languages Design and
   Implementation (PLDI)
CY JUN 24-28, 2024
CL Copenhagen, DENMARK
AB Reducing the width of quantum circuits is crucial due to limited number of qubits in quantum devices. This paper revisit an optimization strategy known as qubit recycling (alternatively wire-recycling or measurement-and-reset), which leverages gate commutativity to reuse discarded qubits, thereby reducing circuit width. We introduce qubit dependency graphs (QDGs) as a key abstraction for this optimization. With QDG, we isolate the computationally demanding components, and observe that qubit recycling is essentially a matrix triangularization problem. Based on QDG and this observation, we study qubit recycling with a focus on complexity, algorithmic, and verification aspects. Firstly, we establish qubit recycling's NP-hardness through reduction from Wilf's question, another matrix triangularization problem. Secondly, we propose a QDG-guided solver featuring multiple heuristic options for effective qubit recycling. Benchmark tests conducted on RevLib illustrate our solver's superior or comparable performance to existing alternatives. Notably, it achieves optimal solutions for the majority of circuits. Finally, we develop a certified qubit recycler that integrates verification and validation techniques, with its correctness proof mechanized in Coq.

TI Percolation thresholds and connectivity in quantum networks
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB We study entanglement percolation in qubit-based planar quantum network models of arbitrary topology, where neighboring nodes are initially connected by pure states with quenched disorder in their entanglement. To address this, we develop a physics-informed heuristic algorithm designed to find a sequence of entanglement swapping and distillation operations to connect any pair of distant nodes. The algorithm combines locally optimal percolation strategies between nodes at a maximum distance of one swapping operation. If this fails to produce a maximally entangled state, it looks for alternative paths surrounding intermediate states within the process. We analytically find and numerically verify thresholds in quantum percolation, which depend on the initial network configuration and entanglement, and are associated with specific percolation strategies. We classify these strategies based on the connectivity, a quantity that relates the entanglement in the final state and the level of integrity of the network at the end of the process. We find distinct regimes of quantum percolation, which are clearly separated by the percolation thresholds of the employed strategies and vastly vary according to the network topology.

TI Extending the reach of quantum computing for materials science with
   machine learning potentials
SO AIP ADVANCES
AB Solving electronic structure problems represents a promising field of application for quantum computers. Currently, much effort has been spent in devising and optimizing quantum algorithms for quantum chemistry problems featuring up to hundreds of electrons. While quantum algorithms can in principle outperform their classical equivalents, the polynomially scaling runtime, with the number of constituents, can still prevent quantum simulations of large scale systems. We propose a strategy to extend the scope of quantum computational methods to large scale simulations using a machine learning potential, trained on quantum simulation data. The challenge of applying machine learning potentials in today's quantum setting arises from the several sources of noise affecting the quantum computations of electronic energies and forces. We investigate the trainability of a machine learning potential selecting various sources of noise: statistical, optimization and hardware noise. Finally, we construct the first machine learning potential from data computed on actual IBM Quantum processors for a hydrogen molecule. This already would allow us to perform arbitrarily long and stable molecular dynamics simulations, outperforming all current quantum approaches to molecular dynamics and structure optimization.

TI Engineering Reflective Metasurfaces With Ising Hamiltonian and Quantum
   Annealing
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ANTENNAS AND PROPAGATION
AB We present a novel and flexible method to optimize the phase response of reflective metasurfaces (MSs) toward the desired scattering profile. The scattering power is expressed as a spin-chain Hamiltonian using the radar cross section (RCS) formalism. For MSs reflecting an oblique plane wave, an Ising Hamiltonian is obtained. Thereby, the problem of achieving the scattering profile is recast into finding the ground-state solution of the associated Ising Hamiltonian. To rapidly explore the configuration states, we encode the Ising coefficients with quantum annealing (QA) algorithms, taking advantage of the fact that the adiabatic evolution efficiently performs energy minimization in the Ising model. Finally, the optimization problem is solved on the D-Wave 2048-qubit quantum adiabatic optimizer machine for binary phase as well as quadriphase reflective MSs. Even though the work is focused on the phase modulation of MSs, we believe this approach paves the way to fast optimization of reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) that are modulated in both amplitude and phase for multi-beam generation in and beyond 5G/6G mobile networks.

TI Effects of ocean turbulence on photon orbital angular momentum quantum
   communication
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB The effect of the turbulent motion of ocean on the quantum communication based on the orbital angular momentum in an underwater quantum channel is studied in this work. Based on the power spectrum model of ocean turbulence proposed by Elamassie, the quantitative relationships of different ocean turbulence parameters with the single photon detection probability of orbital angular momentum photons, the channel capacity, the key generation rate, the concurrence of two entangled photons are proposed. The maximum entanglement distance of the orbital angular momentum entangled photon-pairs in the ocean turbulence is further studied by the universal entanglement decay of the concurrence of entangled photon-pairs in the ocean turbulence. The results show that the detection probability of single photon, the channel capacity, the key generation rate, and the concurrence of entangled photon-pairs decrease with the increase of the dissipation rate of turbulent kinetic energy and the decrease of the rate of dissipation of mean-squared temperature. The influence of the temperature and salinity balance parameter of ocean turbulence on the performance of underwater quantum communication are significantly different under the condition of whether the stable stratification of seawater is assumed or not. In the ocean turbulent environment, the increasing of the initial orbital angular momentum quantum number of signal photons can improve the key generation rate of quantum key distribution and the resistance of entangled photons to entanglement decay.

TI Quantum entanglement of ions for light dark matter detection
SO JOURNAL OF HIGH ENERGY PHYSICS
AB A detection scheme is explored for light dark matter, such as axion dark matter or dark photon dark matter, using a Paul ion trap system. We first demonstrate that a qubit, constructed from the ground and first excited states of vibrational modes of ions in a Paul trap, can serve as an effective sensor for weak electric fields due to its resonant excitation. As a consequence, a Paul ion trap allows us to search for weak electric fields induced by light dark matter with masses around the neV range. Furthermore, we illustrate that an entangled qubit system involving N ions can enhance the excitation rate by a factor of N2. The sensitivities of the Paul ion trap system to axion-photon coupling and gauge kinetic mixing can reach previously unexplored parameter space.

TI Does anti-Unruh effect assist quantum entanglement and coherence?
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB In this paper, we use the concepts of quantum entanglement and coherence to analyze the Unruh and anti-Unruh effects based on the model of Unruh-DeWitt detector. For the first time, we find that (i) the Unruh effect reduces quantum entanglement but enhances quantum coherence; (ii) the anti-Unruh effect enhances quantum entanglement but reduces quantum coherence. This surprising result refutes the notion that the Unruh effect can only destroy quantum entanglement and coherence simultaneously, and that the anti-Unruh can only protect quantum resources. Consequently, it opens up a new source for discovering experimental evidence supporting the existence of the Unruh and anti-Unruh effects.

TI Visualizing entanglement in multiqubit systems
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB In the field of quantum information science and technology, the representation and visualization of quantum states and related processes are essential for both research and education. In this context, a focus lies especially on ensembles of few qubits. There exist many powerful representations for single-qubit and multiqubit systems, such as the famous Bloch sphere and generalizations. Here, we utilize the dimensional circle notation as a representation of such ensembles, adapting the so-called circle notation of qubits and the idea of representing the n-particle system in an n-dimensional space. We show that the mathematical conditions for separability lead to symmetry conditions of the quantum state visualized, offering a new perspective on entanglement in few-qubit systems and therefore on various quantum algorithms. In this way, dimensional notations promise significant potential for conveying nontrivial quantum entanglement properties and processes in few-qubit systems to a broader audience, and could enhance understanding of these concepts as a bridge between intuitive quantum insight and formal mathematical descriptions.

TI Fast universal two-qubit gate for neutral fermionic atoms in optical
   tweezers
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB An array of ultracold neutral atoms held in optical microtraps is a promising platform for quantum computation. One of the major bottlenecks of this platform is the weak coupling strength between adjacent atoms, which limits the speed of two-qubit gates. Here, we present a method to perform a fast universal root SWAP gate with fermionic atoms that interact through a short-range potential. The basic idea of the gate is to release the atoms into a harmonic potential positioned in between the two atoms. By properly tailoring the interaction parameter, the collision process between the atoms generates entanglement and yields the desired gate. We prove analytically that in the limit of broad atomic wave packets, the fidelity of the gate approaches unity. We demonstrate numerically that with typical experimental parameters, our gate can operate on a microsecond timescale and achieves a fidelity higher than 0.998. Moreover, the gate duration is independent of the initial distance between the atoms. A gate with such features is an important milestone towards all-to-all connectivity and fault tolerance in quantum computation with neutral atoms.

TI Implementation of Quantum Fourier Transform and Quantum Hashing for
   Quantum Devices with Arbitrary Qubit Connectivity Graphs
SO QUANTUM INFORMATION & COMPUTATION
AB In the paper, we consider quantum circuits for quantum fingerprinting (quantum hashing) and quantum Fourier transform (QFT) algorithms. Quantum fingerprinting (quantum hashing) is a well-known technique for comparing large objects using small images. The QFT algorithm is a very popular technique used in many algorithms. We present a generic method for constructing quantum circuits for these algorithms for quantum devices with restrictions. Many quantum devices (e.g., based on superconductors) have restrictions on applying two-qubit gates. The restrictions are presented by a qubit connectivity graph. Typically, researchers consider only the linear nearest neighbor (LNN) architecture, but current devices have more complex graphs. We present a method for arbitrary connected graphs that minimizes the number of CNOT gates in the circuit. The heuristic version of the method is fast enough and works with O(n6) time complexity, where n is the number of qubits. The certain version of the algorithm has an exponential time complexity that is O(n22n). We compare quantum circuits built by our algorithm with quantum circuits optimized for specific graphs that are Linear-nearest-neighbor (LNN) architecture, "sun" (a cycle with tails, presented by the 16-qubit IBMQ device) and "two joint suns" (two joint cycles with tails, presented by the 27-qubit IBMQ device). Our generic method gives similar results with a few more CNOT gates. At the same time, our method allows us to construct a circuit for arbitrary connected graphs.

TI Quantum Machine-Learning for Eigenstate Filtration in Two-Dimensional
   Materials
SO JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY
AB Quantum machine-learning algorithms have emerged to be a promising alternative to their classical counterparts as they leverage the power of quantum computers. Such algorithms have been developed to solve problems like electronic structure calculations of molecular systems and spin models in magnetic systems. However, the discussion in all these recipes focuses specifically on targeting the ground state. Herein we demonstrate a quantum algorithm that can filter any energy eigenstate of the system based on either symmetry properties or a predefined choice of the user. The workhorse of our technique is a shallow neural network encoding the desired state of the system with the amplitude computed by sampling the Gibbs-Boltzmann distribution using a quantum circuit and the phase information obtained classically from the nonlinear activation of a separate set of neurons. We show that the resource requirements of our algorithm are strictly quadratic. To demonstrate its efficacy, we use state filtration in monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides which are hitherto unexplored in any flavor of quantum simulations. We implement our algorithm not only on quantum simulators but also on actual IBM-Q quantum devices and show good agreement with the results procured from conventional electronic structure calculations. We thus expect our protocol to provide a new alternative in exploring the band structures of exquisite materials to usual electronic structure methods or machine-learning techniques that are implementable solely on a classical computer.

TI Design of an integrated model using deep reinforcement learning and
   Variational Autoencoders for enhanced quantum security
SO METHODSX
AB The need for secure communication systems has driven extensive research into quantum-based security mechanisms, particularly Quantum Key Distribution (QKD). However, traditional QKD systems, within dynamic environments incorporating network fluctuation and attacks, have been relatively limited because static protocols cannot support high key generation rates and security. This work addresses these challenges by proposing the integration of AI and machine learning optimization techniques into quantum communication protocols to enhance both security and efficiency. We here propose three advanced models: first, Deep Reinforcement Learning is applied to adaptively optimize QKD protocols by dynamically adjusting the key generation parameters with respect to environmental conditions. In the state-of-the-art method, the DRL-based approach enlarges the secure key generation rate by 15-20 % and suppresses QBER 30-40 % under noisy conditions. A VAE is used for the detection of anomalies in quantum networks that effectively detects eavesdropping. By incorporating quantum-specific feature extraction and latent variable disentanglement, the VAE model detects attack detection accuracy of 85-90 % with a reduction of 25 % in false positives. Finally, it considers the optimization of cryptographic protocols in a distributed quantum network using Multi-Agent Deep Q-Networks. This multi-agent system strengthens both the security and computational efficiency by reducing attack vulnerabilities by 15-18 % and lowering the computational complexity by 20-25 %. In all, the integration of AI with machine learning methods brings far better enhancements in the field of quantum communication system security and efficiency, addressing critical limitations of conventional QKD systems and pointing to the way to more resilient adaptive quantum security solutions.

TI Universal signature of quantum entanglement across cosmological
   distances
SO CLASSICAL AND QUANTUM GRAVITY
AB Although the paradigm of inflation has been extensively studied to demonstrate how macroscopic inhomogeneities in our Universe originate from quantum fluctuations, most of the established literature ignores the crucial role that entanglement between the modes of the fluctuating field plays in its observable predictions. In this paper, we import techniques from quantum information theory to reveal hitherto undiscovered predictions for inflation which, in turn, signals how quantum entanglement across cosmological scales can affect large scale structure. Our key insight is that observable long-wavelength modes must be part of an open quantum system, so that the quantum fluctuations can decohere in the presence of an environment of short-wavelength modes. By assuming the simplest model of single-field inflation, and considering the leading order interaction term from the gravitational action, we derive a universal lower bound on the observable effect of such inescapable entanglement. Although this signal is too weak for direct detection in the foreseeable future, we discuss the importance of its theoretical implications.

TI Software-based remote memory attestation using quantum entanglement
SO QUANTUM INFORMATION PROCESSING
AB Software-based remote memory attestation is a method for determining the state of a remote device without relying on secure hardware. In classical computing devices, the method is vulnerable to proxy and authentication attacks, because an infected device has no means of preventing the leak of its cryptographic secrets. In this paper, we demonstrate how these attacks can be mitigated by making use of quantum effects, while remaining within the class of software-based methods. In particular, we make use of entanglement and the inability of an attacker to clone qubits. Our proposed protocol is lightweight and can be implemented by near-term Quantum Computing techniques. The resulting protocol has the unique feature of resisting collusion between two dishonest devices, one of which has unbounded computational resources.

TI Optimized Quantum Circuit for Quantum Security Strength Analysis of
   Argon2
SO ELECTRONICS
AB This paper explores the optimization of quantum circuits for Argon2, a memory-hard function used in password hashing applications. With the rise of quantum computers, the security of classical cryptographic systems is at risk. This paper emphasizes the need to accurately measure the quantum security strength of cryptographic schemes through highly optimized quantum circuits for the target cryptography algorithm. The proposed method focuses on two perspectives: qubit reduction (qubit-optimized quantum circuit) and depth reduction (depth-optimized quantum circuit). The qubit-optimized quantum circuit was designed to find a point where an appropriate inverse is possible and reuses the qubit through the inverse to minimize the number of qubits. The start and end points of the inverse are determined by identifying a point where qubits can be reused with minimal computation. The depth-optimized quantum circuit reduces the depth of the quantum circuit by using the minimum number of qubits necessary without performing an inverse operation. The trade-off between qubit and depth is confirmed by modifying the internal structure of the circuits and the quantum adders. The qubit optimization achieved up to a 12,229 qubit reduction, while the depth optimization resulted in an approximately 196,741 (approximately 69.02%) depth reduction. In conclusion, this research demonstrates the importance of implementing and analyzing quantum circuits from multiple optimization perspectives. The results contribute to the post-quantum strength analysis of Argon2 and provide valuable insights for future research on optimized quantum circuit design, considering the appropriate trade-offs of quantum resources in response to advancements in quantum computing technology.

TI Quantum Bayesian computation
SO APPLIED STOCHASTIC MODELS IN BUSINESS AND INDUSTRY
AB Quantum Bayesian computation is an emerging field that levers the computational gains available from quantum computers. They promise to provide an exponential speed-up in Bayesian computation. Our article adds to the literature in three ways. First, we describe how quantum von Neumann measurement provides quantum versions of popular machine learning algorithms such as Markov chain Monte Carlo and deep learning that are fundamental to Bayesian learning. Second, we describe quantum data encoding methods needed to implement quantum machine learning including the counterparts to traditional feature extraction and kernel embeddings methods. Third, we show how quantum algorithms naturally calculate Bayesian quantities of interest such as posterior distributions and marginal likelihoods. Our goal then is to show how quantum algorithms solve statistical machine learning problems. On the theoretical side, we provide quantum versions of high dimensional regression, Gaussian processes and stochastic gradient descent. On the empirical side, we apply a quantum FFT algorithm to Chicago house price data. Finally, we conclude with directions for future research.

AB Calibration of a quantum computer is the process of optimizing its control parameters to ensure the accurate implementation of quantum gates. It remains a critical challenge in scaling quantum computers. Existing calibration methods take a generalized approach that focuses on the trade-off between calibration time and fidelity. However, these methods lack the awareness of hardware differences among physical qubits and an elaborate design of parallel calibration. In this paper, we introduce a fine-grained calibration protocol that contains three calibration policies for hardware differences and a method to enable parallel calibration. We begin by profiling qubit pairs to evaluate their responses to different waveform candidates. Based on profiling results, we determine the best calibration policy for the quantum computer, which is the first part of the calibration protocol. The second part of our protocol is to use graph traverse to enable parallel calibration by identifying compatible calibration operations. We validate our protocol through intensive experiments on real quantum machines with up to 127 qubits. Our experimental results demonstrate a 1.84x reduction in terms of the medium of the two-qubit gate error rate, 1.26x reduction in pulse duration, an 8x to 25x reduction in total calibration overhead compared with sequential calibration, an average of 2.12x further reduction in total calibration overhead owing to profiling policy, double of the quantum volume, and a 2.0x to 2.3x reduction in error per layered gate. The proposed protocol emphasizes the importance of hardware-aware and parallel calibration and advances current quantum computers towards fault-tolerant quantum computing.

TI A squeezed mechanical oscillator with millisecond quantum decoherence
SO NATURE PHYSICS
AB An enduring challenge in constructing mechanical-oscillator-based hybrid quantum systems is to ensure engineered coupling to an auxiliary degree of freedom and maintain good mechanical isolation from the environment, that is, low quantum decoherence, consisting of thermal decoherence and dephasing. Here we overcome this challenge by introducing a superconducting-circuit-based optomechanical platform that exhibits low quantum decoherence and has a large optomechanical coupling, which allows us to prepare the quantum ground and squeezed states of motion with high fidelity. We directly measure a thermal decoherence rate of 20.5 Hz (corresponding to T-1 = 7.7 ms) as well as a pure dephasing rate of 0.09 Hz, yielding a 100-fold improvement in the quantum state lifetime compared with prior optomechanical systems. This enables us to reach a motional ground-state occupation of 0.07 quanta (93% fidelity) and realize mechanical squeezing of -2.7 dB below the zero-point fluctuation. Furthermore, we observe the free evolution of the mechanical squeezed state, preserving its non-classical nature over millisecond timescales. Such ultralow quantum decoherence not only increases the fidelity of quantum control and measurement of macroscopic mechanical systems but may also benefit interfacing with qubits, and places the system in a parameter regime suitable for tests of quantum gravity.
   Achieving low decoherence is challenging in hybrid quantum systems. A superconducting-circuit-based optomechanical platform realizes millisecond-scale quantum state lifetime, which allows tracking of the free evolution of a squeezed mechanical state.

TI Nonlocal correlations in quantum networks distributed with different
   entangled states
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB We initiate the study of the nonlocal correlations in generic asymmetric quantum networks in a star configuration. Therein, the diverse unrelated sources can emit either partially or maximally entangled states, while the observers employ varying numbers of measurement settings. We propose nonlinear Bell inequalities tailored to the distributed entangled states. Specifically, we demonstrate that the algebraic maximal violations of the proposed nonlinear Bell inequalities are physically achievable within the quantum region. To achieve this, we construct the segmented Bell operators through the cut-graft-mix method applied to the Bell operators in the standard Bell tests. Furthermore, we devise the fitting Bell operators using the sum-of-square approach.

TI Continuous-Time Quantum Walk in Glued Trees: Localized State-Mediated
   Almost Perfect Quantum-State Transfer
SO ENTROPY
AB In this work, the dynamics of a quantum walker on glued trees is revisited to understand the influence of the architecture of the graph on the efficiency of the transfer between the two roots. Instead of considering regular binary trees, we focus our attention on leafier structures where each parent node could give rise to a larger number of children. Through extensive numerical simulations, we uncover a significant dependence of the transfer on the underlying graph architecture, particularly influenced by the branching rate (M) relative to the root degree (N). Our study reveals that the behavior of the walker is isomorphic to that of a particle moving on a finite-size chain. This chain exhibits defects that originate in the specific nature of both the roots and the leaves. Therefore, the energy spectrum of the chain showcases rich features, which lead to diverse regimes for the quantum-state transfer. Notably, the formation of quasi-degenerate localized states due to significant disparities between M and N triggers a localization process on the roots. Through analytical development, we demonstrate that these states play a crucial role in facilitating almost perfect quantum beats between the roots, thereby enhancing the transfer efficiency. Our findings offer valuable insights into the mechanisms governing quantum-state transfer on trees, with potential applications for the transfer of quantum information.

TI Spin squeezing enhanced quantum magnetometry with nitrogen-vacancy
   center qutrits
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB We explore the utility of quantum spin squeezing in quantum magnetometry, focusing on three-level (qutrit) Nitrogen-Vacancy (NV) centers within diamond, utilizing a standard Ramsey interferometry pulse protocol. Our investigation incorporates the effects of dephasing and relaxation on NV centers' dynamics during Ramsey measurements, modeled via the Lindblad quantum master equation. We conduct a comparative analysis between the metrological capabilities of a single NV center and a pair of NV centers, considering quantum Fisher information both with and without spin squeezing. The quantum correlations between NV centers are assessed through the evaluation of the Kitagawa-Ueda spin squeezing parameter within a two-level manifold. Additionally, parallel calculations are conducted using a two-level model (qubit) for NV centers. Our findings reveal that leveraging qutrits and spin squeezing yields enhanced magnetometric precision, albeit constrained by dephasing effects. Nevertheless, even in the absence of dynamical decoupling methods to mitigate environmental dissipation, strategic timing of squeezing and free evolution can sustain the advantages of qutrit-based magnetometry.

TI Achieving Computational Gains with Quantum Error-Correction Primitives:
   Generation of Long-Range Entanglement Enhanced by Error Detection
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB The resource overhead required to achieve net computational benefits from quantum error correction (QEC) limits its utility while current systems remain constrained in size, despite exceptional progress in experimental demonstrations. In this paper, we demonstrate that the strategic application of QEC primitives without logical encoding can yield significant advantages on superconducting processors-relative to any alternative error-reduction strategy-while only requiring a modest overhead. We first present a novel protocol for implementing long-range CNOT gates that relies on a unitarily prepared GreenbergerHorne-Zeilinger (GHZ) state as well as a unitary disentangling step; the protocol natively introduces an error-detection process using the disentangled qubits as flags. We demonstrate that it achieves state-of-theart gate fidelities of over 85% across up to 40 lattice sites, significantly and consistently outperforming the best alternative measurement-based protocol without introducing any additional ancilla qubits. We then apply sparse stabilizer measurements to generate large GHZ states by detecting bit-flip and amplitudedamping errors. Employing this technique in combination with deterministic error suppression, we generate a 75-qubit GHZ state exhibiting genuine multipartite entanglement, the largest reported to date. The generation requires no more than 9 ancilla qubits and the fraction of samples discarded due to errors grows no higher than 78%, far lower than previous discard fractions required for tests using comparable numbers of fully encoded qubits. This work in total represents compelling evidence that adopting QEC primitives on current-generation devices can deliver substantial net benefits.

TI Digital-analog quantum computing of fermion-boson models in
   superconducting circuits
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB High-fidelity quantum simulations demand hardware-software co-design architectures, which are crucial for adapting to complex problems such as strongly correlated dynamics in condensed matter. By leveraging co-design strategies, we can enhance the performance of state-of-the-art quantum devices in the noisy intermediate quantum (NISQ) and early error-correction regimes. In this direction, we propose a digital-analog quantum algorithm for simulating the Hubbard-Holstein model, describing strongly correlated fermion-boson interactions, in a suitable architecture with superconducting circuits. It comprises a linear chain of qubits connected by resonators, emulating electron-electron (e-e) and electron-phonon (e-p) interactions, as well as fermion tunneling. Our approach is adequate for digital-analog quantum computing (DAQC) of fermion-boson models, including those described by the Hubbard-Holstein model. We show the reduction in the circuit depth of the DAQC algorithm, a sequence of digital steps and analog blocks, outperforming the purely digital approach. We exemplify the quantum simulation of a half-filled two-site Hubbard-Holstein model. In this example, we obtain time-dependent state fidelities larger than 0.98, showing that our proposal is suitable for studying the dynamical behavior of solid-state systems. Our proposal opens the door to computing complex systems for chemistry, materials, and high-energy physics.

TI Monogamy of Quantum Entanglement
SO FRONTIERS IN PHYSICS
AB Unlike classical correlation, quantum entanglement cannot be freely shared among many parties. This restricted shareability of entanglement among multi-party systems is known as monogamy of entanglement, which is one of the most fundamental properties of entanglement. Here, we summarize recent theoretical progress in the field of monogamy of entanglement. We firstly review the standard CKW-type monogamy inequalities in terms of various entanglement measures. In particular, the squashed entanglement and one-way distillable entanglement are monogamous for arbitrary dimensional systems. We then introduce some generalized version of monogamy inequalities which extend and sharpen the traditional ones. We also consider the dual polygamy inequalities for multi-party systems. Moreover, we present two new definitions to define monogamy of entanglement. Finally, some challenges and future directions for monogamy of entanglement are highlighted.

TI An optimization of traditional CPU emulation techniques for execution on
   a quantum computer
SO QUANTUM INFORMATION PROCESSING
AB The use and adoption of quantum computers by the wider computing community is diminished by the need to adopt new programming techniques. These techniques involve moving from a high-level language where the programmer can define and manipulate objects, to a quantum model where the programmer defines and configures the circuits at a gate level. Previous work by the authors aimed to ease this transition through the use of a software development kit (Qx86 SDK) that emulates a traditional CPU for execution on a quantum computer, but only delivered a raw capability. The current work now presents a number of new methods that extends and improves the SDK's capability. These methods include optimizing traditional logic gate emulation, multiple gate simplification methods, reducing the number of required qubits and alternative optimized techniques for many CPU instructions. A quantum machine code mapping method is described that enhances the emulation of a traditional/quantum hybrid CPU prototype. While still orders of magnitude slower than the performance of a traditional CPU in terms of arithmetic, logic and bitwise operations, execution speed is shown to be markedly improved (in some cases by more than 1,000%) and without introducing any unrealistic requirements (that is, all execution can be performed utilizing less than 32 qubits). The usefulness of the SDK has now been enhanced as a reference guide, where the programmer/researcher can contrast traditional methods versus multiple quantum methods of execution.

TI Surface-electrode ion trap design for near-field microwave quantum gates
SO APPLIED PHYSICS B-LASERS AND OPTICS
AB We present a design study into an ion trap electrode geometry for applying near-field microwave two-qubit gates. This design features an 'S'-shaped meander electrode to passively null the microwave field. It has ground planes separating the meander electrode from all of the DC and single-qubit microwave electrodes, which should reduce the sensitivity of the microwave field distribution to the boundary conditions of these electrodes. We show that it is possible to design a single-layer trap with this geometry such that the simulated microwave field null overlaps with the RF field null, and that the positions of these nulls can be simulated to a precision of 100 nm with moderate computing resources. We also show that such a trap can be designed such that ion chains can be trapped, transported and split with feasible DC and RF voltages. While this particular design is optimized for Ca-43(+) ions, our approach could be applied to other ions by changing the microwave frequency to match the corresponding qubit transition frequency.

AB We give a direct product theorem for the entanglement-assisted interactive quantum communication complexity in terms of the quantum partition bound for product distributions. The quantum partition or efficiency bound is a lower bound on communication complexity, a non-distributional version of which was introduced by Laplante, Lerays and Roland (2012). For a two-input boolean function, the best result for interactive quantum communication complexity known previously was due to Sherstov (2018), who showed a direct product theorem in terms of the generalized discrepancy. While there is no direct relationship between the maximum distributional quantum partition bound for product distributions, and the generalized discrepancy method, unlike Sherstov's result, our result works for two-input functions or relations whose outputs are non-boolean as well.
   As an application of our result, we show that it is possible to do device-independent quantum key distribution (DIQKD) without the assumption that devices do not leak any information after inputs are provided to them. We analyze the DIQKD protocol given by Jain, Miller and Shi (2020), and show that when the protocol is carried out with devices that are compatible with several copies of the Magic Square game, it is possible to extract a linear (in the number of copies of the game) amount of key from it, even in the presence of a linear amount of leakage. Our security proof is parallel, i.e., the honest parties can enter all their inputs into their devices at once, and works for a leakage model that is arbitrarily interactive, i.e., the devices of the honest parties Alice and Bob can exchange information with each other and with the eavesdropper Eve in any number of rounds, as long as the total number of bits or qubits communicated is bounded.

TI Quantum-based wireless sensor networks: A review and open questions
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISTRIBUTED SENSOR NETWORKS
AB Applications of quantum computing are growing at a very fast pace, for example, from quantum computers to quantum algorithms and even to the development of the quantum Internet. However, the use of quantum technology in wireless sensor networks has not been thoroughly investigated just yet. This is in part due to the complexity of using big, costly, and highly energy-consuming machines that are quantum computers to this date, compared to the nodes used in wireless sensor networks which are small, inexpensive, and operate with very low energy consumption requirements. However, we can expect that in the future (possibly in the next decade) quantum computers will be commercial and reduced in size, and hence, they can be used for sensor network applications which are the basis of the Internet of Things. In this review, we study the road from quantum computing to quantum wireless sensor networks and how the analysis and design of these systems have to change to accommodate quantum capabilities in sensors, processors, communication links, and overall performance of these monitoring networks.

CY AUG 18-22, 2025

AB We consider classical-quantum (cq-)channels with memory, and establish that Arikan-constructed polar codes achieve the classical capacity for two key noise models, namely for (i) qubit erasures and (ii) unital qubit noise with channel state information at the receiver. The memory in the channel is assumed to be governed by a discrete-time, countable-state, aperiodic, irreducible, and positive recurrent Markov process. We establish this result by leveraging classical polar coding guarantees established for finite-state, aperiodic, and irreducible Markov processes [FAIM] in [1], alongside the finding that no entanglement is required to achieve the capacity of Markovian unital and erasure quantum channels when transmitting classical information [2], [3]. More broadly, our work illustrates that for cq-channels with memory, where an optimal coding strategy is essentially classical, polar codes can be shown to approach the capacity.

AB Using discrete and continuous variable subsystems, hybrid approaches to quantum information could enable more quantum computational power for the same physical resources. Here, we propose a hybrid scheme that can be used to generate the necessary Gaussian and non-Gaussian operations for universal continuous variable quantum computing in trapped ions. This scheme utilizes two linear spin-motion interactions to generate a broad set of nonlinear effective spin-motion interactions including one- and two-mode squeezing, beam splitter, and trisqueezing operations in trapped ion systems. We discuss possible experimental implementations using laser-based and laser-free approaches.

TI Entangled measurement for W states
SO SCIENCE ADVANCES
AB Entangled measurements are an indispensable tool for quantum information processing, such as Bell-state measurements in quantum teleportation and entanglement swapping. However, to date, the realization of entangled measurements has mainly focused on bipartite systems or Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) states. Here, we demonstrate a practical scheme to realize entangled measurements for W states. Thanks to the cyclic shift symmetry in the discrete Fourier transformation (DFT) of bosonic modes, the DFT measurement outcomes can be used to deterministically project multiqubit states onto W states. Experimentally, we show that three-qubit W state discrimination can be achieved by detecting the cyclic shift symmetry with a three-mode DFT optical circuit, yielding a measurement discrimination fidelity of 0.871 +/- 0.039. Our experimental demonstration opens the door for the development of new quantum network protocols between multipartite systems.

AB Quantum compilation, critical for bridging high-level quantum programming and physical hardware, faces unique challenges distinct from classical compilation. As quantum computing advances, scalable and efficient quantum compilation methods become necessary. This paper surveys the landscape of quantum compilation, detailing the processes of qubit mapping and circuit optimization, and emphasizing the need for integration with classical computing to harness quantum advantages. Techniques such as Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) exemplify hybrid approaches, highlighting the potential synergy between quantum and classical systems. It is concluded that, while quantum compilation retains many classic methodologies, it introduces novel complexities and opportunities for optimization and verification, essential for the evolving field of quantum computing.

TI Quantum Algorithm for Position Weight Matrix Matching
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM ENGINEERING
AB In this article, we propose two quantum algorithms for a problem in bioinformatics, position weight matrix (PWM) matching, which aims to find segments (sequence motifs) in a biological sequence, such as DNA and protein that have high scores defined by the PWM and are, thus, of informational importance related to biological function. The two proposed algorithms, the naive iteration method and the Monte-Carlo-based method, output matched segments, given the oracular accesses to the entries in the biological sequence and the PWM. The former uses quantum amplitude amplification (QAA) for sequence motif search, resulting in the query complexity scaling on the sequence length n, the sequence motif length m, and the number of the PWMs K as O(m root Kn), which means speedup over existing classical algorithms with respect to n and K. The latter also uses QAA and, further, quantum Monte Carlo integration for segment score calculation, instead of iteratively operating quantum circuits for arithmetic in the naive iteration method; then, it provides the additional speedup with respect to m in some situation. As a drawback, these algorithms use quantum random access memories, and their initialization takes O(n) time. Nevertheless, our algorithms keep the advantage especially when we search matches in a sequence for many PWMs in parallel

TI Rapid transform optimization strategy for decoherence-protected quantum
   register in diamond
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Decoherence-protected spins associated with nitrogen-vacancy color centers in diamond possess remarkably long coherence time, which makes them one of the most promising and robust quantum registers. The current demand is to explore practical rapid control strategies for preparing and manipulating such registers. Our work provides all-microwave control strategies optimized using multiple optimization methods to significantly reduce the processing time by 80% with a set of smooth near-zero-end-point control fields that are shown to be experimentally realizable. Furthermore, we optimize and analyze the robustness of these strategies under frequency and amplitude imperfections of the control fields, during which process we use only 16 samples to give a fair estimation of the robustness map with 2500 pixels. Overall, we provide a ready-to-implement recipe to facilitate high-performance information processing via a decoherence-protected quantum register for future quantum technology applications.

TI Recycling the resource: Sequential usage of shared state in quantum
   teleportation with weak measurements
SO PHYSICS LETTERS A
AB Complete measurements, while providing maximal information gain, result in destruction of the shared entanglement. In the standard teleportation scheme, the sender's measurement on the shared entangled state between the sender and the receiver has that consequence. We propose here a teleportation scheme involving weak measurements which can sustain entanglement up to a certain level so that the reusability of the shared resource state for reattempting teleportation is possible. The measurements are chosen in such a way that it is weak enough to retain entanglement and hence can be reused for quantum tasks, yet adequately strong to ensure quantum advantage in the protocol. In this scenario, we report that at most six sender-receiver duos can reuse the state for reattempting teleportation, when the initial shared state is entangled in a finite neighborhood of the maximally entangled state and for a suitable choice of weak measurements. However, we observe that the reattempt number decreases with the decrease in the entanglement of the initial shared state. Among the weakening strategies studied, Bell measurement admixed with white noise performs better than any other low-rank weak measurements in this situation. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

TI Scalable and High-Fidelity Quantum Random Access Memory in Spin-Photon
   Networks
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB A quantum random access memory (qRAM) is considered an essential computing unit to enable polynomial speedups in quantum information processing. Proposed implementations include the use of neutral atoms and superconducting circuits to construct a binary tree but these systems still require demonstrations of the elementary components. Here, we propose a photonic-integrated-circuit (PIC) architecture integrated with solid-state memories as a viable platform for constructing a qRAM. We also present an alternative scheme based on quantum teleportation and extend it to the context of quantum networks. Both implementations realize the two key qRAM operations, (1) quantum state transfer and (2) quantum routing, with already demonstrated components: electro-optic modulators, a Mach-Zehnder interferometer (MZI) network, and nanocavities coupled to artificial atoms for spin-based memory writing and retrieval. Our approaches furthermore benefit from built-in error detection based on photon heralding. Detailed theoretical analysis of the qRAM efficiency and query fidelity shows that our proposal presents viable near-term designs for a general qRAM.

TI Towards fully passive time-bin quantum key distribution over moving
   free-space channels
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Encoding quantum information in photonic time-bin states is typically considered impractical for moving free-space quantum communication due to the difficulties with phase stabilization of distant quantum time-bin interferometers and turbulence of free-space channels. We demonstrate a novel approach using reference frame independent time-bin quantum key distribution that completely avoids the need for active relative phase stabilization while simultaneously overcoming a highly multi-mode channel without any active mode filtering. This scheme enables passive, self-compensating time-bin quantum communication without any mode filtering, mode sorting, adaptive optics, active basis selection, or active phase alignment. We realize a proof-of-concept demonstration using hybrid polarization and time-bin entangled photons that demonstrates a sustained asymptotic secure key rate greater than 0.07 bits/coincidence over a 15 m multi-mode fiber optical channel and showing entanglement correlations over a moving 38.5 dB loss free-space channel, including system losses. The scheme simplifies the use of time-bin encoding and can be readily applied over various spatially multi-mode and fluctuating channels involving rapidly moving platforms, including airborne and satellite systems.

TI Quantum communication through a partially reflecting accelerating mirror
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
AB Motivated by the fact that the null shell of a collapsing black hole can be described by a perfectly reflecting accelerating mirror, we investigate an extension of this model to mirror semitransparency and derive a general implicit expression for the corresponding Bogolyubov coefficients. Then, we turn this into an explicit analytical form by focusing on mirrors that are accelerated via an impulsive force. From the so-obtained Bogolyubov coefficients we derive the particle production. Finally, we realize the field coming from the left past spacetime region, passing through the semitransparent moving mirror and ending up to the right-future spacetime region as undergoing the action of a Gaussian quantum channel. We study the transmission and noisy generation properties of this channel, relating them to the Bogolyubov coefficients of the mirror's motion, through which we evaluate capacities in transmitting classical and quantum information.

TI Benchmarking of quantum fidelity kernels for Gaussian process regression
SO MACHINE LEARNING-SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Quantum computing algorithms have been shown to produce performant quantum kernels for machine-learning classification problems. Here, we examine the performance of quantum kernels for regression problems of practical interest. For an unbiased benchmarking of quantum kernels, it is necessary to construct the most optimal functional form of the classical kernels and the most optimal quantum kernels for each given data set. We develop an algorithm that uses an analog of the Bayesian information criterion to optimize the sequence of quantum gates used to estimate quantum kernels for Gaussian process models. The algorithm increases the complexity of the quantum circuits incrementally, while improving the performance of the resulting kernels, and is shown to yield much higher model accuracy with fewer quantum gates than a fixed quantum circuit ansatz. We demonstrate that quantum kernels thus obtained can be used to build accurate models of global potential energy surfaces (PES) for polyatomic molecules. The average interpolation error of the six-dimensional PES obtained with a random distribution of 2000 energy points is 16 cm-1 for H3O+, 15 cm-1 for H2CO and 88 cm-1 for HNO2. We show that a compositional optimization of classical kernels for Gaussian process regression converges to the same errors. This indicates that quantum kernels can achieve the same, though not better, expressivity as classical kernels for regression problems.

TI On the Fidelity Distribution of Purified Link-level Entanglements

CT 59th Annual IEEE International Conference on Communications (IEEE ICC)
CY JUN 09-13, 2024

SP IEEE, IEEE Commun Soc
AB The first step for entanglement distribution among quantum communication nodes is to generate link-level Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) pairs between adjacent communication nodes. EPR pairs may be continuously generated and stored in a few quantum memories to be ready for utilization by quantum applications. A major challenge is that qubits suffer from unavoidable noise due to their interaction with the environment, which is called decoherence. This decoherence results in the known exponential decay model of the fidelity of the qubits with time, thus, limiting the lifetime of a qubit in a quantum memory and the performance of quantum applications.
   In this paper, we evaluate the fidelity of the stored EPR pairs under two opposite dynamical and probabilistic phenomena, first, the aforementioned decoherence and second purification, i.e. an operation to improve the fidelity of an EPR pair at the expense of sacrificing another EPR pair. Instead of applying the purification as soon as two EPR pairs are generated, we introduce a Purification scheme Beyond the Generation time (PBG) of two EPR pairs. We use discrete time Markov chain (DTMC) approach to analytically show the probability distribution of the fidelity of stored link-level EPR pairs in a system with two quantum memories at each node allowing a maximum of two stored EPR pairs. In addition, we apply a PBG scheme that purifies the two stored EPR pairs upon the generation of an additional one. We finally provide numerical evaluations of the analytical approach and show the fidelity-rate trade-off of the considered purification scheme.

TI Sampling-based quasiprobability simulation for fault-tolerant quantum
   error correction on the surface codes under coherent noise
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB We propose a sampling-based simulation for fault-tolerant quantum error correction under coherent noise. A mixture of incoherent and coherent noise, possibly due to over-rotation, is decomposed into Clifford channels with a quasiprobability distribution. Then, an unbiased estimator of the logical error probability is constructed by sampling Clifford channels with an appropriate postprocessing. We characterize the sampling cost via the channel robustness and find that the proposed sampling-based method is feasible even for planar surface codes with relatively large code distances intractable for full state-vector simulations. As a demonstration, we simulate repetitive faulty syndrome measurements on the planar surface code of distance 5 with 81 qubits. We find that the coherent error increases the logical error rate. This is a practical application of the quasiprobability simulation for a meaningful task and would be useful to explore experimental quantum error correction on the near-term quantum devices.

TI Quantum Algorithm for Approximating Maximum Independent Sets

For both sparse and dense random graphs G, numerical simulation suggests that our algorithm on average finds an independent set of size close to the maximum size alpha(G) in low polynomial time. The best classical algorithms, by contrast, produce independent sets of size about half of alpha(G) in polynomial time.

TI Tight Lieb-Robinson Bound for approximation ratio in quantum annealing
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Quantum annealing (QA) holds promise for optimization problems in quantum computing, especially for combinatorial optimization. This analog framework attracts attention for its potential to address complex problems. Its gate-based homologous, QAOA with proven performance, has attracted a lot of attention to the NISQ era. Several numerical benchmarks try to compare these two metaheuristics, however, classical computational power highly limits the performance insights. In this work, we introduce a parametrized version of QA enabling a precise 1-local analysis of the algorithm. We develop a tight Lieb-Robinson bound for regular graphs, achieving the best-known numerical value to analyze QA locally. Studying MaxCut over cubic graph as a benchmark optimization problem, we show that a linear-schedule QA with a 1-local analysis achieves an approximation ratio over 0.7020, outperforming any known 1-local algorithms.

TI Classical Shadow Tomography for Continuous Variables Quantum Systems
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION THEORY
AB In this article we develop a continuous variable (CV) shadow tomography scheme with wide ranging applications in quantum optics. Our work is motivated by the increasing experimental and technological relevance of CV systems in quantum information, quantum communication, quantum sensing, quantum simulations, quantum computing and error correction. We introduce two experimentally realisable schemes for obtaining classical shadows of CV (possibly non-Gaussian) quantum states using only randomised Gaussian unitaries and easily implementable Gaussian measurements such as homodyne and heterodyne detection. For both schemes, we show that $N=\mathcal {O}\left({\mathrm {poly}\left({\frac {1}{\epsilon },\log \left({\frac {1}{\delta }}\right),M_{n}<^>{r+\alpha },\log (m)}\right)}\right)$ samples of an unknown $m$ -mode state $\rho $ suffice to learn the expected value of any $r$ -local polynomial in the canonical observables of degree $\alpha $ , both with high probability $1-\delta $ and accuracy $\epsilon $ , as long as the state $\rho $ has moments of order $n>\alpha $ bounded by $M_{n}$ . By simultaneously truncating states and operators in energy and phase space, we are able to overcome new mathematical challenges that arise due to the infinite dimensionality of CV systems. We also provide a scheme to learn nonlinear functionals of the state, such as entropies over any small number of modes, by leveraging recent energy-constrained entropic continuity bounds. Finally, we provide numerical evidence of the efficiency of our protocols in the case of CV states of relevance in quantum information theory, including ground states of quadratic Hamiltonians of many-body systems and cat qubit states. We expect our scheme to provide good recovery in learning relevant states of 2D materials and photonic crystals.

Our simulations make use of a recent quantum algorithm that maps the dynamics of a singly excited open Tavis-Cummings model containing N atoms coupled to a lossy cavity. We report the results of executing this algorithm on two noisy intermediate-scale quantum computers: a superconducting processor and a trapped ion processor, to simulate the population dynamics of an open CQED system featuring N = 3 atoms. By applying technology-specific transpilation and error mitigation techniques, we minimize the impact of gate errors, noise, and decoherence in each hardware platform, obtaining results which agree closely with the exact solution of the system. These results can be used as a recipe for efficient and platform-specific quantum simulation of cavity-emitter systems on contemporary and future quantum computers.

TI Classical simulation of quantum circuits using fewer Gaussian
   eliminations
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB A compelling way to quantify the separation between classical and quantum computing is to determine how many T-gate magic states, t, a classical computer must simulate to calculate the probability of a universal quantum circuit's output. Unfortunately, efforts to determine the minimum number of stabilizer state inner products necessary to decompose T-gate magic states (chi(t)) have proven intractable past t = 7. By using a phase space formalism based on Wootters' discrete Weyl operator basis over a finite field, we develop an algebraic approach to determining chi(t) for single-Pauli measurements. This allows us to extend the bounds on chi(t) to t = 14 for qutrits, effectively increasing the space searched by >10(1)(04). Our results show that by using such phase space methods it is possible to validate noisy intermediate-scale quantum circuits of larger size than previously thought possible.

TI In situ characterization of qubit-drive phase distortions
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB Reducing errors in quantum gates is critical to the development of quantum computers. To do so, any distortions in the control signals should be identified; however, conventional tools are not always applicable when part of the system is under high vacuum, cryogenic, or microscopic. Here, we demonstrate a method to detect and compensate for amplitude-dependent phase changes, using the qubit itself as a probe. The technique is implemented using a microwave-driven trapped-ion qubit, where correcting phase distortions leads to a threefold improvement in the error of single-qubit gates implemented with pulses of different amplitudes, to attain state-of-the-art performance benchmarked at 1.6(4) x 10-6 - 6 error per Clifford gate.

TI Quantum sensing protocol for motionally chiral Rydberg atoms
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB A quantum sensing protocol is proposed for demonstrating the motion-induced chirality of circularly polarised Rydberg atoms. To this end, a cloud of Rydberg atoms is dressed by a bichromatic light field. This allows to exploit the long-lived ground states for implementing a Ramsey interferometer in conjunction with a spin echo pulse sequence for refocussing achiral interactions. Optimal parameters for the dressing lasers are identified. Combining a circularly polarised dipole transition in the Rydberg atom with atomic centre-of-mass motion, the system becomes chiral. The resulting discriminatory chiral energy shifts induced by a chiral mirror are estimated using a macroscopic quantum electrodynamics approach. The presented quantum sensing protocol will also provide an indirect proof for Casimir-Polder quantum friction.

TI Distillation of multipartite entangled states for arbitrary subsets of
   parties in noisy quantum networks of increasing size
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Quantum network states are multipartite states built from distributing pairwise entanglement among parties and underpin the paradigm of quantum networks for quantum information processing. In this work we introduce the problem of partial distillability in noisy quantum networks. This corresponds to the possibility of distilling by local operations and classical communication an arbitrary pure state for an arbitrary subset of parties starting from a single copy of a quantum network state of an increasing number of parties that share noisy (i.e., mixed) bipartite entangled states. Here, distillation means that the target state is obtained with fidelity as close to 1 as desired, as the size of the network increases when the pairwise entangled links support a constant amount of noise. While we prove an obstruction to multipartite distillation protocols after teleportation with channels with constant noise, we show that partial distillability is indeed possible if certain well-established graph-theoretic parameters that measure the connectivity in the network grow fast enough with its size. We give necessary as well as sufficient conditions for partial distillability in terms of these parameters and we, moreover, provide explicit constructions of networks with partial distillability and a relatively slow connectivity growth.

TI Near-threshold qudit stabilizer codes with efficient encoding circuits
   for magic-state distillation
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Magic-state distillation is a protocol to purify noisy quantum states using quantum stabilizer codes. In this paper, we provide conditions for identifying magic states along with analytical expressions for computing the noise threshold. Through quantum entropic results, we prove the convergence of the magic-state distillation procedure. We derive analytical results to show how the noise threshold scales as a function of the minimum distance and the number of physical qudits of the underlying quantum stabilizer code. We distill |T ) and |S) states with thresholds 0.498 (theoretical limit is 0.5) and 0.71 (theoretical limit is 0.75) over the depolarizing channel using [[31, 1, 16]]2 quantum Bose-Chaudhuri-Hocquenghem code and [[29, 1, 15]]3 quantum qutrit code, respectively. Finally, encoding algorithms based on quantum Calderbank-Shor-Steane (CSS) and non-CSS qudit stabilizer codes along with circuits are proposed for magic-state distillation.

TI Perturbative tomography of small errors in quantum gates
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We propose an efficient protocol to fully reconstruct a set of high-fidelity quantum gates. Usually, the efficiency of reconstructing high-fidelity quantum gates is limited by the sampling noise. Our protocol is based on a perturbative approach and has two stages. In the first stage, the unital part of noisy quantum gates is reconstructed by measuring traces of maps, and the trace can be measured by amplifying the noise in a way similar to randomized benchmarking and quantum spectral tomography. In the second stage, by amplifying the nonunital part using the unital part, we can efficiently reconstruct the nonunital part. We show that the number of measurements needed in our protocol scales logarithmically with the error rate of gates.

AB Beam Placement (BP) is a well-known problem in Low-Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite communication (SatCom) systems, which can be modelled as an NP-hard clique cover problem. Recently, quantum computing has emerged as a novel technology which revolutionizes how to solve challenging optimization problems by formulating Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO), then preparing Hamiltonians as inputs for quantum computers. In this paper, we study how to use quantum computing to solve BP problems. However, due to limited hardware resources, existing quantum computers are unable to tackle large optimization spaces. Therefore, we propose an efficient Hamiltonian Reduction method that allows quantum processors to solve large BP instances encountered in LEO systems. We conduct our simulations on real quantum computers (D-Wave Advantage) using a real dataset of vessel locations in the US. Numerical results show that our algorithm outperforms commercialized solutions of D-Wave by allowing existing quantum annealers to solve 17.5 times larger BP instances while maintaining high solution quality. Although quantum computing cannot theoretically overcome the hardness of BP problems, this work contributes early efforts to applying quantum computing in satellite optimization problems, especially applications formulated as clique cover/graph coloring problems.

SO EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL PLUS
AB By analyzing the reduced density matrices derived from a generalized W-class state under any partition, we present new analytical monogamy inequalities satisfied by the alpha-th (alpha >= gamma,gamma >= 2) power and beta-th (0 <= beta <= gamma/ 2,gamma >= 2) power of the concurrence of assistance for multi-qudit generalized W-class states, which are demonstrated to be tighter than previous studies through detailed examples. Furthermore, using the Tsallis-q entanglement of assistance, we also establish new monogamy and polygamy relations, which are shown to be valid even for multipartite higher-dimensional states that the CKW inequality is violated.

The chief features of the model include explicit unitarity and (most notably) causality which is understood as the impossibility of the transfer of information from the interior of the black hole through its horizon.

TI Acoustic Radiation From a Superconducting Qubit: From Spontaneous
   Emission to Rabi Oscillations
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB Hybrid quantum systems that utilize controllable coupling between phonons and superconducting qubits could pave the way for a new generation of compact quantum memories and sensor technologies. However, the same electromechanical interaction mechanisms that enable coherent qubit-phonon coupling can also lead to decoherence due to the spontaneous phonon emission. In this paper we study the dynamics of a qubit coupled to an acoustic resonator by a piezoelectric film. By varying the surface topography of the resonator from rough to flat to shaped, we explore the crossover from fast decay of an excited qubit to quantum-coherent coupling between the qubit and an isolated phonon mode. The developed theoretical model allows us to establish and check quantitative links between the results obtained for the rough and shaped topographies. Discrepancy between the theory and the data for the flat resonator points to the imperfections of the studied device. Our experimental approach may be used for precision measurements of crystalline vibrations, the design of quantum memories, and the study of electromechanical contributions to dielectric loss.

TI Topological Photonics on Superconducting Quantum Circuits with
   Parametric Couplings
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB Topological phases of matter are an exotic phenomenon in modern condensed matter physics, which has attracted much attention due to the unique boundary states and transport properties. Recently, this topological concept in electronic materials has been exploited in many other fields of physics. Motivated by designing and controlling the behavior of electromagnetic waves in optical, microwave, and sound frequencies, topological photonics emerges as a rapid growing research field. Due to the flexibility and diversity of superconducting quantum circuits system, it is a promising platform to realize exotic topological phases of matter and to probe and explore topologically-protected effects in new ways. Here, theoretical and experimental advances of topological photonics on superconducting quantum circuits-via the experimentally demonstrated parametric tunable coupling techniques, including using of the superconducting transmission line resonator, superconducting qubits, and their coupled system-are reviewed. On superconducting circuits, the flexible interactions and intrinsic nonlinearity make topological photonics in this system not only a simple photonic analog of topological effects for novel devices, but also a realm of exotic but less-explored fundamental physics.

TI Quantum Machine Learning for Security Assessment in the Internet of
   Medical Things (IoMT)
SO FUTURE INTERNET
AB Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) is an ecosystem composed of connected electronic items such as small sensors/actuators and other cyber-physical devices (CPDs) in medical services. When these devices are linked together, they can support patients through medical monitoring, analysis, and reporting in more autonomous and intelligent ways. The IoMT devices; however, often do not have sufficient computing resources onboard for service and security assurance while the medical services handle large quantities of sensitive and private health-related data. This leads to several research problems on how to improve security in IoMT systems. This paper focuses on quantum machine learning to assess security vulnerabilities in IoMT systems. This paper provides a comprehensive review of both traditional and quantum machine learning techniques in IoMT vulnerability assessment. This paper also proposes an innovative fused semi-supervised learning model, which is compared to the state-of-the-art traditional and quantum machine learning in an extensive experiment. The experiment shows the competitive performance of the proposed model against the state-of-the-art models and also highlights the usefulness of quantum machine learning in IoMT security assessments and its future applications.

AB With the advent of the Post-Moore era, the scientific community is faced with the challenge of addressing the demands of current data-intensive machine learning applications, which are the cornerstone of urgent analytics in distributed computing. Quantum machine learning could be a solution for the increasing demand of urgent analytics, providing potential theoretical speedups and increased space efficiency. However, challenges such as (1) the encoding of data from the classical to the quantum domain, (2) hyperparameter tuning, and (3) the integration of quantum hardware into a distributed computing continuum limit the adoption of quantum machine learning for urgent analytics. In this work, we investigate the use of Edge computing for the integration of quantum machine learning into a distributed computing continuum, identifying the main challenges and possible solutions. Furthermore, exploring the data encoding and hyperparameter tuning challenges, we present preliminary results for quantum machine learning analytics on an IoT scenario.

TI Research on Intraparticle to Interparticle Entanglement Swapping
   Protocols
SO APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
AB Entanglement is one of the most striking features of quantum systems, whereby its non-classical correlation is an essential resource in numerous quantum protocols. Entanglement can be divided into two categories: interparticle and intraparticle entanglement. There are both distinctions and similarities between these two kinds of entangled states. This work delves into these distinctions and similarities from the following aspects: correlation and non-locality, robustness, the mechanisms of generation and separation, and practical applications. Entanglement swapping is a technique based on quantum entanglement. As entanglement has different categories, entanglement swapping also has various types, including interparticle to interparticle and intraparticle to interparticle. Swapping protocols from intraparticle entanglement to interparticle entanglement can be applied to super quantum dense encoding, quantum information transmission, quantum teleportation, etc. Thus, this work proposes three swapping protocols, from spin-orbit intraparticle entanglement to spin-spin interparticle entanglement, based on Bell state joint measurement, the cross-Kerr medium, and linear optical elements. This work can help us better understand entanglement by analyzing the differences and similarities between the two types of entangled states. It can also enhance entanglement swapping protocols, from spin-orbit intraparticle to spin-spin interparticle entanglement, for use in quantum information transfer.

TI Shell-model study of 58Ni using quantum computing algorithm
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB This study presents a simulated quantum computing approach for the investigation into the shell-model energy levels of Ni-58 through the application of the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) method in combination with a problem-specific ansatz. The primary objective is to achieve a fully accurate low-lying energy spectrum of Ni-58. The chosen isotope, Ni-58 is particularly interesting in nuclear physics through its role in astrophysical reactions while also being a simple but non-trivial nucleus for shell-model study, it being two particles outside a closed shell. Our ansatz, along with the VQE method are shown to be able to reproduce exact energy values for the ground state and first and second excited states. We compare a classical shell model code, the values obtained by diagonalization of the Hamiltonian after qubit mapping, and a noiseless simulated ansatz+VQE simulation. The exact agreement between classical and qubit-mapped diagonalization shows the correctness of our method, and the high accuracy of the simulation means that the ansatz is suitable to allow a full reconstruction of the full nuclear wave function.

TI Resilience of Post-Quantum Cryptography in Lightweight IoT Protocols: A
   Systematic Review
SO ENG
AB The rapid advancement of quantum computing poses significant threats to classical cryptographic methods, such as Rivest-Shamir-Adleman (RSA) and Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC), which currently secure Internet of Things (IoT) and cloud communications. Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC), particularly lattice-based schemes, has emerged as a promising alternative. CRYSTALS-Kyber, standardized by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) as ML-KEM, has shown efficiency and practicality for constrained IoT devices. Most existing research has focused on PQC within the Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol. Consequently, a critical gap exists in understanding PQC's performance in lightweight IoT protocols. These are Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) and Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP), particularly under adverse network conditions. To address this gap, this paper provides a systematic review of the literature on the network resilience and performance of CRYSTALS-Kyber when integrated into these protocols operating over lossy and high-latency networks. Additional challenges include non-standardized integration, resource limitations, and side-channel vulnerabilities. This review provides a structured synthesis of current knowledge, highlights unresolved trade-offs between security and efficiency, and outlines future research directions, including protocol-level optimization, lightweight signature schemes, and resilience testing of PQC-secured IoT protocols under realistic conditions.

TI Bounding first-order quantum phase transitions in adiabatic quantum
   computing
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB In the context of adiabatic quantum computation (AQC), it has been argued that first-order quantum phase transitions (QPTs) due to localization phenomena cause AQC to fail by exponentially decreasing the minimal spectral gap of the Hamiltonian along the annealing path as a function of the qubit number. The vanishing of the spectral gap is often linked to the localization of the ground state in a local minimum, requiring the system to tunnel into the global minimum at a later stage of the annealing. Recent methods have been proposed to avoid this phenomenon by carefully designing the involved Hamiltonians. However, it remains a challenge to formulate a comprehensive theory of the effect of the various parameters and the conditions under which QPTs make the AQC algorithm fail. Equipped with concepts from graph theory, in this work we link graph quantities associated with the Hamiltonians along the annealing path with the occurrence of QPTs. These links allow us to derive bounds on the location of the minimal spectral gap along the annealing path, augmenting the toolbox for the analysis of strategies to improve the runtime of AQC algorithms.

Phys. 18, 1053 (2022)]. We employ a qudit encoding fulfilling gauge invariance, an SU(2) Gauss's law. We discuss the experimental feasibility of generalized M & oslash;lmer-S & oslash;rensen gates used to efficiently simulate the dynamics. We illustrate how a shallow circuit with these resources is sufficient to implement scalable digital quantum simulation of the model. We also numerically show that this model, albeit simple, can dynamically manifest physically relevant properties specific to non-Abelian field theories, such as baryon excitations.

We distinguish between different subclasses of paint shop problems, and show how to formulate the basic MCPS problem as an Ising model. The problem instances used in this study are generated using real-world data from a factory in Wolfsburg, Germany. We compare the performance of the D-Wave 2000Q and Advantage quantum processors to other classical solvers and a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm offered by D-Wave Systems. We observe that the quantum processors are well-suited for smaller problems, and the hybrid algorithm for intermediate sizes. However, we find that the performance of these algorithms quickly approaches that of a simple greedy algorithm in the large size limit.

TI Device-Independent Certification of Maximal Randomness from Pure
   Entangled Two-Qutrit States Using Non-Projective Measurements
SO ENTROPY
AB While it has recently been demonstrated how to certify the maximal amount of randomness from any pure two-qubit entangled state in a device-independent way, the problem of optimal randomness certification from entangled states of higher local dimension remains open. Here we introduce a method for device-independent certification of the maximal possible amount of 2 log(2) 3 random bits using pure bipartite entangled two-qutrit states and extremal nine-outcome general non-projective measurements. To this aim, we exploit a device-independent method for certification of the full Weyl-Heisenberg basis in three-dimensional Hilbert spaces together with a one-sided device-independent method for certification of two-qutrit partially entangled states.

TI Experimental Robust Self-Testing of the State Generated by a Quantum
   Network
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Self-testing is a method of quantum state and measurement estimation that does not rely on assumptions about the inner working of the devices used. Its experimental realization has been limited to sources producing single quantum states so far. In this work, we experimentally implement two significant building blocks of a quantum network involving two independent sources: namely, a parallel configuration, in which two parties share two copies of a state, and a tripartite configuration, where a central node shares two independent states with peripheral nodes. Then, by extending previous self-testing techniques, we provide device-independent lower bounds on the fidelity between the generated states and an ideal target made by the tensor product of two maximally entangled two-qubit states. Given its scalability and versatility, this technique can find application in the certification of larger networks of different topologies for quantum communication and cryptography tasks and randomness generation protocols.

TI Exploring the Limitations of Hybrid Adiabatic Quantum Computing for
   Emission Tomography Reconstruction
SO JOURNAL OF IMAGING
AB Our study explores the feasibility of quantum computing in emission tomography reconstruction, addressing a noisy ill-conditioned inverse problem. In current clinical practice, this is typically solved by iterative methods minimizing a L2 norm. After reviewing quantum computing principles, we propose the use of a commercially available quantum annealer and employ corresponding hybrid solvers, which combine quantum and classical computing to handle more significant problems. We demonstrate how to frame image reconstruction as a combinatorial optimization problem suited for these quantum annealers and hybrid systems. Using a toy problem, we analyze reconstructions of binary and integer-valued images with respect to their image size and compare them to conventional methods. Additionally, we test our method's performance under noise and data underdetermination. In summary, our method demonstrates competitive performance with traditional algorithms for binary images up to an image size of 32x32 on the toy problem, even under noisy and underdetermined conditions. However, scalability challenges emerge as image size and pixel bit range increase, restricting hybrid quantum computing as a practical tool for emission tomography reconstruction until significant advancements are made to address this issue.

TI Scaling silicon-based quantum computing using CMOS technology
SO NATURE ELECTRONICS
AB As quantum processors grow in complexity, attention is moving to the scaling prospects of the entire quantum computing system, including the classical support hardware. Recent results in high-fidelity control of individual spins in silicon, combined with demonstrations that these qubits can be manufactured in a similar fashion to field-effect transistors, create an opportunity to leverage the know-how of the complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) industry to address the scaling challenge at a system level. Here we review the prospects of scaling silicon-based quantum computing using CMOS technology. We consider the concept of a quantum computing system, which we decompose into three distinct layers-the quantum layer, the quantum-classical interface and the classical layer-and explore the challenges involved in their development, as well their assembly into an architecture. Silicon offers the enticing possibility that all layers can, in principle, be manufactured using CMOS technology, creating an opportunity to move from distributed quantum-classical systems to integrated quantum computing solutions.
   This Review examines the scaling prospects of quantum computing systems based on silicon spin technology and how the different layers of such a computer could benefit from using complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) technology.

TI Explainable Heart Disease Prediction Using Ensemble-Quantum Machine
   Learning Approach
SO INTELLIGENT AUTOMATION AND SOFT COMPUTING
AB Nowadays, quantum machine learning is attracting great interest in a wide range of fields due to its potential superior performance and capabilities. The massive increase in computational capacity and speed of quantum computers can lead to a quantum leap in the healthcare field. Heart disease seriously threa-tens human health since it is the leading cause of death worldwide. Quantum machine learning methods can propose effective solutions to predict heart disease and aid in early diagnosis. In this study, an ensemble machine learning model based on quantum machine learning classifiers is proposed to predict the risk of heart disease. The proposed model is a bagging ensemble learning model where a quantum support vector classifier was used as a base classifier. Further-more, in order to make the model's outcomes more explainable, the importance of every single feature in the prediction is computed and visualized using SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) framework. In the experimental study, other stand-alone quantum classifiers, namely, Quantum Support Vector Classifier (QSVC), Quantum Neural Network (QNN), and Variational Quantum Classifier (VQC) are applied and compared with classical machine learning classifiers such as Sup-port Vector Machine (SVM), and Artificial Neural Network (ANN). The experi-mental results on the Cleveland dataset reveal the superiority of QSVC compared to the others, which explains its use in the proposed bagging model. The Bagging-QSVC model outperforms all aforementioned classifiers with an accuracy of 90.16% while showing great competitiveness compared to some state-of-the-art models using the same dataset. The results of the study indicate that quantum machine learning classifiers perform better than classical machine learning classi-fiers in predicting heart disease. In addition, the study reveals that the bagging ensemble learning technique is effective in improving the prediction accuracy of quantum classifiers.

TI Intrinsic mechanisms for drive-dependent Purcell decay in
   superconducting quantum circuits
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB We develop an approach to understanding intrinsic mechanisms that cause the T-1-decay rate of a multilevel superconducting qubit to depend on the photonic population of a coupled, detuned cavity. Our method yields simple analytic expressions for both the coherently driven or thermally excited cases, which are in good agreement with full master equation numerics, and also facilitates direct physical intuition. It also predicts several interesting phenomena. In particular, we find that in a wide range of settings, the cavity-qubit detuning controls whether a nonzero photonic population increases or decreases qubit Purcell decay. Our method combines insights from a Keldysh treatment of the system, and Lindblad perturbation theory.

TI Quantum computer-assisted global optimization in geophysics illustrated
   with stack-power maximization for refraction residual statics estimation
SO GEOPHYSICS
AB Much of recent progress in geophysics can be attributed to the adaptation of heterogeneous high-performance computing architectures. It is projected that the next major leap in many areas of science, and hence hopefully in geophysics too, will be due to the emergence of quantum computers. Finding a right combination of hardware, algorithms, and a use case, however, proves to be a very challenging task - especially when look-ing for a relevant application that scales efficiently on a quantum computer and is difficult to solve using classical means. We find that maximizing stack power for residual statics correction, an NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem, appears to nat-urally fit a particular type of quantum computing known as quantum annealing. We express the underlying objective func-tion as a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization, which is a quantum-native formulation of the problem. We choose some solution space and define a proper encoding to translate the problem variables into qubit states. We find that these choices can have a significant impact on the maximum problem size that can fit on the quantum annealer and on the fidelity of the final result. To improve the latter, we embed the quantum optimiza-tion step in a hybrid classical-quantum workflow, which aims to increase the frequency of finding the global, rather than some local, optimum of the objective function. Finally, we find that a generic, black-box, hybrid classical-quantum solver also could be used to solve stack-power maximization problems proximal to industrial relevance and capable of surpassing deterministic solvers prone to cycle skipping. A custom-built workflow capable of solving larger problems with an even higher robust-ness and greater control of the user appears to be within reach in the very near future.

TI Distributed Quantum Sensing with Multimode N00N States
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Distributed quantum sensing, which estimates a global parameter across distant nodes, has attracted significant interest for applications such as quantum imaging, sensor networks, and global-scale clock synchronization. N00N states are regarded as one of the optimal quantum resources for quantum metrology, enabling the Heisenberg scaling. Recently, the concept of N00N states has been extended to multimode N00N states for quantum-enhanced multiple-parameter estimation. However, the application of multimode N00N states in distributed quantum sensing remains unexplored. Here, we propose a distributed quantum sensing scheme that achieves the Heisenberg scaling using multimode N00N states. We theoretically show that multimode N00N states can reach the Heisenberg scaling by examining both the Crame<acute accent>r-Rao bound and the quantum Crame<acute accent>r-Rao bound. For experimental demonstration, we employ a four-mode 2002 state to estimate the average of two spatially distributed phases, achieving a 2.74 dB sensitivity enhancement over the standard quantum limit. We believe that utilizing multimode N00N states for distributed quantum sensing offers a promising approach for developing entanglement-enhanced sensor networks.

TI Mitigating Quantum Decoherence in Force Sensors by Internal Squeezing
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB The most efficient approach to laser interferometric force sensing to date uses monochromatic carrier light with its signal sideband spectrum in a squeezed vacuum state. Quantum decoherence, i.e., mixing with an ordinary vacuum state due to optical losses, is the main sensitivity limit. In this Letter, we present both theoretical and experimental evidence that quantum decoherence in high-precision laser interferometric force sensors enhanced with optical cavities and squeezed light injection can be mitigated by a quantum squeeze operation inside the sensor's cavity. Our experiment shows an enhanced measurement sensitivity that is independent of the optical readout loss in a wide range. Our results pave the way for quantum improvements in scenarios where high decoherence previously precluded the use of squeezed light. Our results hold significant potential for advancing the field of quantum sensors and enabling new experimental approaches in high-precision measurement technology.

TI The basics of quantum computing for chemists
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF QUANTUM CHEMISTRY
AB The rapid and successful strides in quantum chemistry in the past decades can be largely credited to a conspicuous synergy between theoretical and computational advancements. However, the architectural computer archetype that enabled such a progress is approaching a state of more stagnant development. One of the most promising technological avenues for the continuing progress of quantum chemistry is the emerging quantum computing paradigm. This revolutionary proposal comes with several challenges, which span a wide array of disciplines. In chemistry, it implies, among other things, a need to reformulate some of its long established cornerstones in order to adjust to the operational demands and constraints of quantum computers. Due to its relatively recent emergence, much of quantum computing may still seem fairly nebulous and largely unknown to most chemists. It is in this context that here we review and illustrate the basic aspects of quantum information and their relation to quantum computing insofar as enabling simulations of quantum chemistry. We consider some of the most relevant developments in light of these aspects and discuss the current landscape when of relevance to quantum chemical simulations in quantum computers.

TI Classically simulating quantum circuits with local depolarizing noise
SO THEORETICAL COMPUTER SCIENCE
AB We study the effect of noise on the classical simulatability of quantum circuits defined by computationally tractable (CT) states and efficiently computable sparse (ECS) operations. Examples of such circuits, which we call CT-ECS circuits, are IQP, Clifford Magic, and conjugated Clifford circuits. This means that there exist various CT-ECS circuits such that their output probability distributions are anti-concentrated and not classically simulatable in the noise-free setting (under plausible assumptions). First, we consider a noise model where a depolarizing channel with an arbitrarily small constant rate is applied to each qubit at the end of computation. We show that, under this noise model, if an approximate value of the noise rate is known, any CT-ECS circuit with an anti-concentrated output probability distribution is classically simulatable. This indicates that the presence of small noise drastically affects the classical simulatability of CT-ECS circuits. Then, we consider an extension of the noise model where the noise rate can vary with each qubit, and provide a similar sufficient condition for classically simulating CT-ECS circuits with anti-concentrated output probability distributions.

TI A Novel and Ultra-Efficient Design of Reversible Quantum Vedic
   Multiplier
SO QUANTUM INFORMATION & COMPUTATION
AB Quantum computing has attracted increased attention in recent years owing to substantial advancements in quantum algorithms and system architecture. Quantum algorithms are implemented using quantum circuits. These circuits include an intrinsic reversibility and often have a substantial Boolean component that requires synthesis. A crucial characteristic of reversible circuits is the preservation of parity. Parity-preserving logic is a category that maintains the parity of both inputs and outputs, facilitating the detection of permanent and transient errors. Multiplier circuits are essential components in digital computing systems, playing a crucial role in the development of various hardware, including arithmetic circuits. This paper first introduces a novel block based on a transformationbased synthesis technique from the elementary quantum gates. Then it proposes a distinctive 2x2 parity-preserving reversible quantum Vedic multiplier based on the recommended block and prior gates. In addition, further designs of Vedic multipliers are provided, encompassing 4-bit, 8-bit, and 16-bit configurations. We illustrate that our design brings superior outcomes regarding quantum cost (QC), constant inputs (CI) count, CNOT-V/V+ count, garbage outputs (GO) count, and gate count (GC) in comparison to earlier designs. This study achieves an average decrease of 23.09%, 37.51%, 37.51%, 54.89%, and 19.38% in QC, CI, GO, GC, and CNOT-V/V+ count, respectively. Furthermore, all suggested circuits undergo appraisal and validation within the IBM quantum laboratory.

TI A quantum algorithm for computing dispersal of submarine volcanic tephra
SO PHYSICS OF FLUIDS
AB In this paper, we develop a quantum computing algorithm for solving the partial differential equation (PDE) for tephra dispersal through advection in the semi-infinite horizontal buoyant region of a submarine volcanic eruption. The concentration of pyroclastic particles in the fluid domain of a hydrothermal megaplume provides important information about the rate of volcanic energy release, mechanism of formation of the megaplume, and submarine depositional patterns. This work leveraging on previous works [F. Gaitan, NPJ Quantum Inf. 6, 61 (2020); F. Gaitan, Adv. Quantum Tech. 4, 2100055 (2021)] further opens up opportunities to solve wider classes of PDEs with different applications of interest. Some additional specific contributions of this work are transforming the semi-infinite spatial domain problem into a problem on a finite spatial domain for applying the quantum algorithm, and the investigation into the effect of spatial and temporal resolution on the solution of PDEs for the quantum algorithm. Furthermore, possible modification of the algorithm with different spatial discretization schemes has been presented and their influence and implications on the solution of the PDE have been discussed. Also, studies are conducted to examine the effect of regularity conditions in time and the presence of statistical noise in the spatial domain, on the solutions obtained using quantum algorithms. The study in this paper paves an important pathway to venture into other types of advection-diffusion problems.

However, many believe that it is difficult, if possible at all, to achieve the microsecond latency requirement posed by superconducting qubits. This work presents the first publicly known MWPM decoder, called Micro Blossom, that achieves sub-microsecond decoding latency. Micro Blossom employs a heterogeneous architecture that carefully partitions a state-of-the-art MWPM decoder between software and a programmable accelerator with parallel processing units, one of each vertex/edge of the decoding graph. On a surface code with code distance.. and a circuit-level noise model with physical error rate p, Micro Blossom's accelerator employs O (d(3)) parallel processing units to reduce the worst-case latency from O(d(12)) to O( d(9)) and reduce the average latency from O(pd(3) + 1) to O(p(2) d(2) + 1) when p << 1.
   We report a prototype implementation of Micro Blossom using FPGA. Measured at d = 13 and p = 0.1%, the prototype achieves an average decoding latency of 0.8 mu s at a moderate clock frequency of 62 MHz. Micro Blossom is the first publicly known hardware-accelerated exact MWPM decoder, and the decoding latency of 0.8 mu s is 8 times shorter than the best latency of MWPM decoder implementations reported in the literature.

TI Metropolitan-scale heralded entanglement of solid-state qubits
SO SCIENCE ADVANCES
AB A key challenge toward future quantum internet technology is connecting quantum processors at metropolitan scale. Here, we report on heralded entanglement between two independently operated quantum network nodes separated by 10 kilometers. The two nodes hosting diamond spin qubits are linked with a midpoint station via 25 kilometers of deployed optical fiber. We minimize the effects of fiber photon loss by quantum frequency conversion of the qubit-native photons to the telecom L-band and by embedding the link in an extensible phase-stabilized architecture enabling the use of the loss-resilient single-click entangling protocol. By capitalizing on the full heralding capabilities of the network link in combination with real-time feedback logic on the long-lived qubits, we demonstrate the delivery of a predefined entangled state on the nodes irrespective of the heralding detection pattern. Addressing key scaling challenges and being compatible with different qubit systems, our architecture establishes a generic platform for exploring metropolitan-scale quantum networks.

TI Continuous-Variable Quantum Teleportation Using a Microwave-Enabled
   Plasmonic Graphene Waveguide
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB We present a scheme to generate continuous-variable bipartite entanglement between two optical modes in a hybrid optical-microwave-plasmonic graphene waveguide system. In this scheme, we exploit the interaction of two light fields coupled to the same microwave mode via plasmonic graphene waveguide to generate two-mode squeezing, which can be used for continuous-variable quantum teleportation of the light signals over large distances. Furthermore, we study the teleportation fidelity of an unknown coherent state. The teleportation protocol is robust against the thermal noise associated with the microwave degree of freedom.

TI Semiquantum proxy blind signature based on quantum teleportation
SO SCIENTIA SINICA-PHYSICA MECHANICA & ASTRONOMICA
AB In this paper, we propose a novel semiquantum proxy blind signature scheme with quantum teleportation based on X states, where the original message owner, the proxy signer and the third party are quantum participants with complete quantum capabilities, while the original signer and the signature verifier are semiquantum participants with limited quantum capabilities. Our protocol not only has complete blindness, unforgeability, and nonrepudiation, but it also resists the attack behavior of an eavesdropper. Because of the limited quantum capabilities of the original signer and signature verifier, our protocol does not require them to prepare and measure the quantum superposition and quantum entangled states when used in practical applications. Hence, our protocol can reduce the burden of quantum state preparation and measurement for the original signer and signature verifier.

TI Quantum programs debug using quantum probabilistic cloning
SO SCIENTIA SINICA-PHYSICA MECHANICA & ASTRONOMICA
AB The development of quantum computing has attracted considerable attention to quantum programming. However, debugging quantum programs remains a complex challenge. Due to the arbitrary quantum state not being cloned perfectly and the observation of the quantum will lead to the state's collapse, we cannot debug quantum programs like classical environments. This study introduces QDebug, a novel quantum debugging scheme that leverages probabilistic quantum cloning to set breakpoints and inspect variables in quantum programs. By probabilistic cloning a qubit within a quantum program and measuring the duplicate, QDebug enables indirect observation of the qubit's state when the program halts at a breakpoint and does not affect the normal execution of quantum programs. We provide a theoretical analysis of QDebug's feasibility and demonstrate its effectiveness through applications in quantum programs.

TI Medium induced jet broadening in a quantum computer
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
AB QCD jets provide one of the best avenues to extract information about the quark-gluon plasma produced in the aftermath of ultrarelativistic heavy-ion collisions. The structure of jets, determined by multiparticle quantum interference, is hard to tackle using perturbative methods. When jets evolve in a QCD medium this interference pattern is modified, adding another layer of complexity. By taking advantage of recent developments in quantum technologies, such effects might be better understood via direct quantum simulation of jet evolution. In this work, we introduce a precursor to such simulations. Based on the light-front Hamiltonian formalism, we construct a digital quantum circuit that tracks the evolution of a single hard probe in the presence of a stochastic color background. In terms of the jet quenching parameter (q) over cap, the results obtained using classical simulators of ideal quantum computers agree with known analytical results. With this study, we hope to provide a baseline for future in-medium jet physics studies using quantum computers.

TI Revealing symmetries in quantum computing for many-body systems
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB We develop a method to deduce the symmetry properties of many-body Hamiltonians when they are prepared in Jordan-Wigner form in which they can act on multi-qubit states. Symmetries, such as point-group symmetries in molecules, are apparent in the standard second quantized form of the Hamiltonian. They are, however, masked when the Hamiltonian is translated into a Pauli matrix representation required for its operation on qubits. To reveal these symmetries we prove a general theorem that provides a straightforward method to calculate the transformation of Pauli tensor strings under symmetry operations. They are a subgroup of the Clifford group transformations and induce a corresponding group representation inside the symplectic matrices. We finally give a simplified derivation of an affine qubit encoding scheme which allows for the removal of qubits due to Boolean symmetries and thus reduces effort in quantum computations for many-body systems.

Here we present a crucial step in the implementation of a hybrid superconducting qubit that employs a carbon nanotube as a Josephson junction. We realize the junction by contacting a carbon nanotube with a superconducting Pd/Al bilayer, and implement voltage tunability of the quantum circuit's frequency using a local electrostatic gate. We demonstrate a strong dispersive coupling to a coplanar waveguide resonator by investigating the gate-tunable resonator frequency. We extract qubit parameters from spectroscopy using dispersive readout and find qubit relaxation and coherence times in the range of 10-200 ns.

TI Superconducting microwave cavities and qubits for quantum information

SO APPLIED PHYSICS REVIEWS
AB Superconducting microwave cavities featuring ultrahigh Q-factors, which measure the efficiency of energy storage in relation to energy loss in a system, are revolutionizing quantum computing by providing long coherence times exceeding 1 ms, crucial for the development of scalable multi-qubit quantum systems with low error rates. In this work, we provide an in-depth analysis of recent advances in ultrahigh Q-factor cavities, integration of Josephson junction-based qubits, and bosonic-encoded qubits in 3D cavities. We examine the sources of quantum state dephasing caused by damping and noise mechanisms in cavities and qubits, highlighting the critical challenges that need to be addressed to achieve even higher coherence times. We critically survey the latest progress made in implementing single 3D qubits using superconducting materials, normal metals, and multi-qubit and multi-state quantum systems. Our work sheds light on the promising future of this research area, including novel materials for cavities and qubits, modes with nontrivial topological properties, error correction techniques for bosonic qubits, and new light-matter interaction effects.

TI Trailhead for quantum simulation of SU(3) Yang-Mills lattice gauge
   theory in the local multiplet basis
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
AB Maintaining local interactions in the quantum simulation of gauge field theories relegates most states in the Hilbert space to be unphysical-theoretically benign, but experimentally difficult to avoid. Reformulations of the gauge fields can modify the ratio of physical to gauge-variant states often through classically preprocessing the Hilbert space and modifying the representation of the field on qubit degrees of freedom. This paper considers the implications of representing SU(3) Yang-Mills gauge theory on a lattice of irreducible representations in both a global basis of projected global quantum numbers and a local basis in which controlled-plaquette operators support efficient time evolution. Classically integrating over the internal gauge space at each vertex (e.g., color isospin and color hypercharge) significantly reduces both the qubit requirements and the dimensionality of the unphysical Hilbert space. Initiating tuning procedures that may inform future calculations at scale, the time evolution of one and two plaquettes are implemented on one of IBM's superconducting quantum devices, and early benchmark quantities are identified. The potential advantages of qudit environments, with either constrained two-dimensional hexagonal or one-dimensional nearest-neighbor internal state connectivity, are discussed for future large-scale calculations.

AB Studies on conservation of quantum symmetries have been initiated by recent papers (Brannan et al. in Commun Math Phys 376(2):795-839, 2020; Lee et al. in Quantum channels with quantum group symmetry, 2020). We, in this paper, investigate how quantum symmetries can be applied to study additivity questions for covariant quantum channels, particularly for the so-called O-N(+)-Temperley-Lieb channels. Their information-theoretic properties were analyzed in Brannan et al. (Commun Math Phys 376(2):795-839, 2020), but the associated additivity questions remained open due to highly nontrivial structures. We present a new approach to analyze O-N(+)-Temperley-Lieb channels with small perturbations in terms of Bures distance within the asymptotic regime N -> infinity and apply continuity bounds of classical capacity, private classical capacity and quantum capacity to study strong additivity questions.

TI Calculating the many-body density of states on a digital quantum
   computer
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Quantum statistical mechanics allows us to extract thermodynamic information from a microscopic description of a many-body system. A key step is the calculation of the density of states, from which the partition function and all finite-temperature equilibrium thermodynamic quantities can be calculated. In this work, we devise and implement a quantum algorithm to perform an estimation of the density of states on a digital quantum computer which is inspired by the kernel polynomial method. Classically, the kernel polynomial method allows us to sample spectral functions via a Chebyshev polynomial expansion. Our algorithm computes moments of the expansion on quantum hardware using a combination of random-state preparation for stochastic trace evaluation and a controlled unitary operator. We use our algorithm to estimate the density of states of a nonintegrable Hamiltonian on the Quantinuum H1-1 trapped ion chip for a controlled register of 18 qubits. This not only represents a state-of-the-art calculation of thermal properties of a many-body system on quantum hardware, but also exploits the controlled unitary evolution of a many-qubit register on an unprecedented scale.

TI Optimization of connection patterns between mobile phones and base
   stations using quantum annealing
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB In current mobile networks, optimizing which base station a mobile phone in a particular area connects to is crucial for ensuring good communication quality for each mobile phone but presents a challenging combinatorial optimization problem. In this study, we optimize the connection patterns to base stations using quantum annealing which is a heuristic optimization algorithm using quantum fluctuations. However, since the number of qubits on a quantum annealer is limited, it is necessary to consider a formulation that efficiently utilizes qubits. By adopting a variable reduction formulation, we significantly reduce the qubit requirements compared to the naive formulation that is typically used when considering pattern-matching problems. Furthermore, experiments using quantum annealing revealed that the accuracy of the approximate solution obtained by the new formulation is superior to that of the conventional formulation. In addition, we demonstrate that the new formulation provides better solutions than the conventional formulation as the problem size increases, even when using simulated annealing, the classical counterpart of quantum annealing.

Capitalizing on the custom firmware and software of the QICK platform, which is built on Xilinx radiofrequency system-on-chip field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), we aim to leverage machine learning (ML) to address critical challenges in qubit readout accuracy and scalability. The workflow utilizes the hls4ml package and employs quantization-aware training to translate ML models into hardware-efficient FPGA implementations via user-friendly Python application programming interfaces. We experimentally demonstrate the design, optimization, and integration of an ML algorithm for single transmon qubit readout, achieving 96% single-shot fidelity with a latency of 32.25 ns and less than 16% FPGA lookup table resource utilization. Our results offer the community an accessible workflow to advance ML-driven readout and adaptive control in quantum information processing applications.

AB Fault-tolerant quantum computing relies on Quantum Error Correction (QEC), which encodes logical qubits into data and parity qubits. Error decoding is the process of translating the measured parity bits into types and locations of errors. To prevent a backlog of errors, error decoding must be performed in real-time (i.e., within 1 mu s on superconducting machines). Minimum Weight Perfect Matching (MWPM) is an accurate decoding algorithm for surface code, and recent research has demonstrated real-time implementations of MWPM (RT-MWPM) for a distance of up to 9. Unfortunately, beyond d=9, the number of flipped parity bits in the syndrome, referred to as the Hamming weight of the syndrome, exceeds the capabilities of existing RT-MWPM decoders. In this work, our goal is to enable larger distance RT-MWPM decoders by using adaptive predecoding that converts high Hamming weight syndromes into low Hamming weight syndromes, which are accurately decoded by the RT-MWPM decoder.
   An effective predecoder must balance both accuracy (as any erroneous decoding by the predecoder contributes to the overall Logical Error Rate, termed as LER) and coverage (as the predecoder must ensure that the hamming weight of the syndrome is within the capability of the final decoder). In this paper, we propose Promatch, a real-time adaptive predecoder that predecodes both simple and complex patterns using a locality-aware, greedy approach. Our approach ensures two crucial factors: 1) high accuracy in prematching flipped bits, ensuring that the decoding accuracy is not hampered by the predecoder, and 2) enough coverage adjusted based on the main decoder's capability given the time constraints. Promatch represents the first real-time decoding framework capable of decoding surface codes of distances 11 and 13, achieving an LER of 2.6 x 10(-14) for distance 13. Moreover, we demonstrate that running Promatch concurrently with the recently proposed Astrea-G achieves LER equivalent to MWPM LER, 3.4 x 10(-15), for distance 13, representing the first real-time accurate decoder for up-to a distance of 13.

TI Optimizing resource allocation in precision farming using quantum
   enhanced algorithms and quantum sensor networks
SO JOURNAL OF CLOUD COMPUTING-ADVANCES SYSTEMS AND APPLICATIONS
AB This study proposes QYieldOpt, a hybrid quantum-classical framework for real-time resource optimization in precision farming, integrating a Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA-R), Quantum Gradient Allocation Optimizer (QGAO), and quantum algorithm for Sensor Feedback Calibration (QSFC). All results presented in this study are based on simulation experiments using realistic agricultural data sets and quantum circuit emulators. Addressing the classical limitations in dynamic, multi-constraint agricultural environments, the system leverages quantum computing parallelism and ultra-sensitive environmental monitoring using quantum sensor networks (QSNs). QAOA-R solves discrete resource allocation (irrigation valve on/off decisions) via cost Hamiltonian optimization, achieving 89% water utilization and 8492 kg yield in the simulations. QGAO refines continuous variables (fertilizer dosage) using quantum-enhanced gradient descent, reducing resource waste by 30% using penalty-augmented utility functions. QSFC dynamically calibrates utility parameters a(i), b(i) via quantum sensor data, encoding variables like soil moisture into rotation gates R-y (pi s(ij)) with < 2% spectral error. The closed-loop architecture of the framework enables adaptive adjustments every 15-30 min using real-time QSN feedback. Empirical validation conducted entirely through simulation against classical models (LP, GA, PSO, RL) demonstrated superior performance with 12-18% yield improvements, 22% resource savings, and 4.3 s convergence for 100-zone farms. Under 20% sensor noise, QYieldOpt maintained robustness (R-2 = 0.919), outperforming classical baselines in terms of accuracy (MAE: 5.41 kg/zone) and scalability (10.6 s for 250 zones). By unifying quantum optimization with high-precision sensing, this study advances sustainable agriculture through energy-efficient resource management, which was validated in simulated and hybrid emulated cloud-edge environments. The modular design ensures theoretical compatibility with existing IoT systems, whereas field trials are essential to establish the practical feasibility of climate-resilient farming. As quantum hardware matures, QYieldOpt paves the way for autonomous and scalable solutions to global food security challenges in the future.

TI Looped Pipelines Enabling Effective 3D Qubit Lattices in a Strictly 2D
   Device
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Many quantum computing platforms are based on a two-dimensional (2D) physical layout. Here we explore a concept called looped pipelines, which permits one to obtain many of the advantages of a threedimensional (3D) lattice while operating a strictly 2D device. The concept leverages qubit shuttling, a well-established feature in platforms like semiconductor spin qubits and trapped-ion qubits. The loopedpipeline architecture has similar hardware requirements to other shuttling approaches, but can process a stack of qubit arrays instead of just one. Even a stack of limited height is enabling for diverse schemes ranging from NISQ-era error mitigation through to fault-tolerant codes. For the former, protocols involving multiple states can be implemented with a space-time resource cost comparable to preparing one noisy copy. For the latter, one can realize a far broader variety of code structures; as an example we consider layered 2D codes within which transversal CNOTs are available. Under reasonable assumptions this approach can reduce the space-time cost of magic state distillation by 2 orders of magnitude. Numerical modeling using experimentally motivated noise models verifies that the architecture provides this benefit without significant reduction to the code's threshold.

TI A Hybrid Quantum Computing Method for UV-Vis Spectroscopy of Solvated
   Molecules at Room Temperature
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY A
AB We developed a method to include solvent effects on electronic transition calculations using quantum computing, employing the subspace-search variational quantum eigensolver (SSVQE) algorithm and the average solvent electrostatic configuration (ASEC) model. The SSVQE algorithm is used to calculate the energy of ground and excited states of organic molecules, and the ASEC model is used to describe the electrostatic contribution of the solvent effect at room temperature. By comparing the results with complete active space configuration interaction calculations, we demonstrate that the solvent effect is properly accounted for in the calculation of each state energy value performed by the quantum algorithm. Furthermore, the gas-liquid shift of the electronic transitions is also correctly described, with values that present semiquantitative agreement with results obtained through more sophisticated treatment using classical computers and experimental values, demonstrating that the solvation model is robust even when paired with quantum algorithms. The ASEC-SSVQE method opens the possibility of using noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices to study the spectroscopy properties of solvated molecules, with the inclusion of thermodynamic effects.

TI Optical payload design for downlink quantum key distribution and keyless
   communication using CubeSats
SO EPJ QUANTUM TECHNOLOGY
AB Quantum key distribution is costly and, at the moment, offers low performance in space applications. Other more recent protocols could offer a potential practical solution to this problem. In this work, a preliminary optical payload design using commercial off-the-shelf elements for a quantum communication downlink in a 3U CubeSat is proposed. It is shown that this quantum state emitter allows the establishment of two types of quantum communication between the satellite and the ground station: quantum key distribution and quantum keyless private communication. Numerical simulations are provided that show the feasibility of the scheme for both protocols as well as their performance. For the simplified BB84, a maximum secret key rate of about 80 kHz and minimum QBER of slightly more than 0.07% is found, at the zenith, while for quantum private keyless communication, a 700 MHz private rate is achieved. This design serves as a platform for the implementation of novel quantum communication protocols that can improve the performance of quantum communications in space.

TI Sensing Out-of-Equilibrium and Quantum Non-Gaussian Environments via
   Induced Time-Reversal Symmetry Breaking on the Quantum-Probe Dynamics
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Advancing quantum sensing tools for investigating atomic and nanoscale systems is crucial for the progress of quantum technologies. While many protocols use quantum probes to extract information from stationary or weakly coupled environments, challenges intensify at the atomic scale and the nanoscale, where the environment is inherently out of equilibrium and/or strongly coupled with the sensor. In this work, we demonstrate that time-reversal symmetry in the control dynamics of a quantum sensor is broken when the qubit sensor interacts with environments that are out of equilibrium (with nonstationary fluctuations), contain quantum non-Gaussian correlations, or exhibit intrinsic time-reversal symmetry breaking. Leveraging this phenomenon, we introduce a quantum sensing paradigm based on time-asymmetric dynamical control sequences, enabling the probing of the distance of an environment from equilibrium, its time-reversal symmetry-breaking behavior, or its quantum non-Gaussian nature. Additionally, we propose sensing strategies to distinguish between these different sources of symmetry breaking. We validate our approach through proof-of-principle experimental quantum simulations using solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance, where we drive the environment of a qubit sensor out of equilibrium and use our protocol to quantify the nonstationary characteristics of the generated states. Our findings highlight the potential of this framework for quantifying nonstationary behavior, designing tailored pump-probe experiments (including measurements of quantum information scrambling), and detecting quantum states that exhibit this work constitutes a step forward in designing quantum devices for atomic scale and nanoscale sensing, broadening their applicability to complex and dynamic quantum environments.

TI Robust projective measurements through measuring code-inspired
   observables
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Quantum measurements are ubiquitous in quantum information processing tasks, but errors can render their outputs unreliable. Here, we present a scheme that implements a robust projective measurement through measuring code-inspired observables. Namely, given a projective POVM, a classical code, and a constraint on the number of measurement outcomes each observable can have, we construct commuting observables whose measurement is equivalent to the projective measurement in the noiseless setting. Moreover, we can correct t errors on the classical outcomes of the observables' measurement if the classical code corrects t errors. Since our scheme does not require the encoding of quantum data onto a quantum error correction code, it can help construct robust measurements for near-term quantum algorithms that do not use quantum error correction. Moreover, our scheme works for any projective POVM, and hence can allow robust syndrome extraction procedures in non-stabilizer quantum error correction codes.

TI Exponential-Time Quantum Algorithms for Graph Coloring Problems
SO ALGORITHMICA
AB The fastest known classical algorithm deciding the k-colorability of n-vertex graph requires running time Omega(2(n)) for k >= 5. In this work, we present an exponential-space quantum algorithm computing the chromatic number with running time O(1.9140(n)) using quantum random access memory (QRAM). Our approach is based on Ambainis et al's quantum dynamic programming with applications of Grover's search to branching algorithms. We also present a polynomial-space quantum algorithm not using QRAM for the graph 20-coloring problem with running time O(1.9575(n)). For the polynomial-space quantum algorithm, we essentially develop (4 - epsilon)(n)-time classical algorithms that can be improved quadratically by Grover's search.

TI Operating semiconductor quantum processors with hopping spins
SO SCIENCE
AB Qubits that can be efficiently controlled are essential for the development of scalable quantum hardware. Although resonant control is used to execute high-fidelity quantum gates, the scalability is challenged by the integration of high-frequency oscillating signals, qubit cross-talk, and heating. Here, we show that by engineering the hopping of spins between quantum dots with a site-dependent spin quantization axis, quantum control can be established with discrete signals. We demonstrate hopping-based quantum logic and obtain single-qubit gate fidelities of 99.97%, coherent shuttling fidelities of 99.992% per hop, and a two-qubit gate fidelity of 99.3%, corresponding to error rates that have been predicted to allow for quantum error correction. We also show that hopping spins constitute a tuning method by statistically mapping the coherence of a 10-quantum dot system. Our results show that dense quantum dot arrays with sparse occupation could be developed for efficient and high-connectivity qubit registers.

TI Quantum Machine Learning for Identifying Transient Events in X-Ray Light
   Curves
SO ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL
AB We investigate whether a novel method of quantum machine learning can identify anomalous events in X-ray light curves as transient events and apply it to detect such events from the XMM-Newton 4XMM-DR14 catalog. The architecture we adopt is a quantum version of long short-term memory (LSTM) where some fully connected layers are replaced with quantum circuits. LSTM, making predictions based on preceding data, allows for the identification of anomalies by comparing predicted and actual time-series data. The necessary training data are generated by simulating active-galactic-nucleus-like light curves as these events would be a significant population in the XMM-Newton catalog. Additional anomaly data used to assess trained quantum LSTM (QLSTM) models are produced by adding flare-like quasiperiodic eruptions to the training data. Comparing various aspects of the performances of the quantum and classical LSTM (CLSTM) models, we find that QLSTM models incorporating quantum superposition and entanglement slightly outperform the CLSTM model in expressive power, accuracy, and true-positive rate. The highest-performance QLSTM model is then used to identify transient events in 4XMM-DR14. Out of 40,154 light curves in the 0.2-12 keV band, we detect 113 light curves with anomalies, or transient event candidates. This number is approximate to 1.3 times that of anomalies detectable with the CLSTM model. By utilizing SIMBAD and four wide-field survey catalogs made by ROSAT, SkyMapper, Pan-STARRS, and the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer, no possible counterparts are found for 12 detected anomalies.

TI MIMO With 1-b Pre/Postcoding Resolution: A Quantum Annealing Approach
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM ENGINEERING
AB In this article, we study the problem of digital pre/postcoding design in multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems with 1-b resolution per complex dimension. The optimal solution that maximizes the received signal-to-noise ratio relies on an NP-hard combinatorial problem that requires exhaustive searching with exponential complexity. By using the principles of alternating optimization and quantum annealing (QA), an iterative QA-based algorithm is proposed that achieves near-optimal performance with polynomial complexity. The algorithm is associated with a rigorous mathematical framework that casts the pre/postcoding vector design to appropriate real-valued quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) problems. Experimental results in a state-of-the-art D-WAVE QA device validate the efficiency of the proposed algorithm. To further improve the efficiency of the D-WAVE quantum device, a new preprocessing technique, which preserves the quadratic QUBO matrix from the detrimental effects of the Hamiltonian noise through nonlinear companding, is proposed. The proposed preprocessing technique significantly improves the quality of the D-WAVE solutions as well as the occurrence probability of the optimal solution.

TI Two-level system loss characterization of NbTi superconducting

SO CURRENT APPLIED PHYSICS
AB Superconducting coplanar waveguide (SCPW) resonators, key components for quantum computing and sensing applications, require a high internal quality factor (Qi) for effective qubit readout and quantum sensing applications. Minimizing two-level system (TLS) losses, particularly at material interfaces, is critical for gatemon and topological qubits operating at low temperatures and in high magnetic fields. NbTi, a superconducting alloy with a high upper critical field, enables SCPW resonators resilient to such conditions. We fabricated NbTi SCPW resonators on Si/SiO2 substrates and systematically characterized their TLS-limited quality factors as functions of temperature and microwave photon number. Our results demonstrate that NbTi-based SCPWs on Si/SiO2 substrates provide a promising platform for developing next-generation quantum circuits.

TI Direct Quantum Process Tomography for Arbitrary Qubit Systems Without
   Auxiliary States
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB Quantum process tomography is an effective method for measuring the quantum channel parameters in the field of quantum information. However, standard quantum process tomography (SQPT) cannot obtain arbitrarily specific process-matrix elements because it requires a global reconstruction algorithm. Direct quantum tomography can be used to obtain specific matrix elements of interest without the need for a global reconstruction algorithm. Therefore, direct process quantum tomography (DQPT) has attracted widespread attention. DQPT based on weak measurements has been recently proposed. However, additional auxiliary states and post-selection processes are necessary in these schemes, which increases the complexity of practical experiments and reduces the utilization of measurement resources. In this study, a DQPT protocol without the assistance of pointer states is proposed, which reduces the complexity of practical experiments. Subsequently, the scheme is generalized to arbitrary qubit systems and experimentally perform the protocol on a nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) system provided by a quantum cloud platform. Finally, considering that when the qubit resources are insufficient, a superimposed coherent state is used as the pointer state to complete the direct characterization of a quantum process. The measurement protocol is easily scalable and integrated, laying the foundation for direct tomography on a chip.

TI Attosecond quantum uncertainty dynamics and ultrafast squeezed light for
   quantum communication
SO LIGHT-SCIENCE & APPLICATIONS
AB Advancements in quantum optics and squeezed light generation have revolutionized various fields of quantum science over the past three decades, with notable applications such as gravitational wave detection. Here, we extend the use of squeezed light to the realm of ultrafast quantum science. We demonstrate the generation of the shortest ultrafast synthesized quantum light pulses spanning 0.33 to 0.73 PHz by a degenerate four-wave mixing nonlinear process. Experimental metrology results confirm that these pulses exhibit amplitude squeezing, which is consistent with theoretical predictions. Moreover, we observe the temporal dynamics of amplitude uncertainty of the squeezed light, demonstrating that quantum uncertainty of light is controllable and tunable in real time. Additionally, we demonstrate control over the quantum state of light by switching between amplitude and phase squeezing. Our ability to generate and manipulate ultrafast, squeezed, synthesized light waveforms with attosecond resolution unlocks exciting possibilities for quantum technologies, including petahertz-scale secure quantum communication, quantum computing, and ultrafast spectroscopy. As an example, we introduce an attosecond quantum encryption protocol leveraging squeezed synthesized light for secure digital communication at unprecedented speeds. This work paves the way for exploring quantum uncertainty dynamics and establishes the foundation for the emerging ultrafast and attosecond quantum science fields.

Unlike more stable fiber channels, one challenge faced in free-space quantum channels is the complex transmittance characterized by varying atmospheric turbulence. This complexity poses difficulties in achieving high transmission rates and long-distance communication. In this article, we thoroughly evaluate the performance of the CV-QKD/GMCS system under the effect of individual attacks, considering homodyne detection with both direct and reverse reconciliation techniques. To address the issue of limited detector efficiency, we incorporate the phase-sensitive amplifier (PSA) as a compensating measure. The results show that the CV-QKD/GMCS system with PSA achieves a longer secure distance and a higher key rate compared to the system without PSA, considering both direct and reverse reconciliation algorithms. With an amplifier gain of 10, the reverse reconciliation algorithm achieves a secure distance of 5 km with a secret key rate of 10-1 bits/pulse. On the other hand, direct reconciliation reaches a secure distance of 2.82 km.

TI Simulating Finite-Time Isothermal Processes with Superconducting Quantum
   Circuits
SO ENTROPY
AB Finite-time isothermal processes are ubiquitous in quantum-heat-engine cycles, yet complicated due to the coexistence of the changing Hamiltonian and the interaction with the thermal bath. Such complexity prevents classical thermodynamic measurements of a performed work. In this paper, the isothermal process is decomposed into piecewise adiabatic and isochoric processes to measure the performed work as the internal energy change in adiabatic processes. The piecewise control scheme allows the direct simulation of the whole process on a universal quantum computer, which provides a new experimental platform to study quantum thermodynamics. We implement the simulation on ibmqx2 to show the 1/tau scaling of the extra work in finite-time isothermal processes.

TI Implementing efficient selective quantum process tomography of
   superconducting quantum gates on IBM quantum experience
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB The experimental implementation of selective quantum process tomography (SQPT) involves computing individual elements of the process matrix with the help of a special set of states called quantum 2-design states. However, the number of experimental settings required to prepare input states from quantum 2-design states to selectively and precisely compute a desired element of the process matrix is still high, and hence constructing the corresponding unitary operations in the lab is a daunting task. In order to reduce the experimental complexity, we mathematically reformulated the standard SQPT problem, which we term the modified SQPT (MSQPT) method. We designed the generalized quantum circuit to prepare the required set of input states and formulated an efficient measurement strategy aimed at minimizing the experimental cost of SQPT. We experimentally demonstrated the MSQPT protocol on the IBM QX2 cloud quantum processor and selectively characterized various two- and three-qubit quantum gates.

TI Experimental composable key distribution using discrete-modulated
   continuous variable quantum cryptography
SO LIGHT-SCIENCE & APPLICATIONS
AB Establishing secure data communication necessitates secure key exchange over a public channel. Quantum key distribution (QKD), which leverages the principles of quantum physics, can achieve this with information-theoretic security. The discrete modulated (DM) continuous variable (CV) QKD protocol, in particular, is a suitable candidate for large-scale deployment of quantum-safe communication due to its simplicity and compatibility with standard high-speed telecommunication technology. Here, we present the first experimental demonstration of a four-state DM CVQKD system, successfully generating composable finite-size keys, secure against collective attacks over a 20 km fiber channel with 2.3 x 109 coherent quantum states, achieving a positive composable key rate of 11.04 x 10-3 bits/symbol. This accomplishment is enabled by using an advanced security proof, meticulously selecting its parameters, and the fast, stable operation of the system. Our results mark a significant step toward the large-scale deployment of practical, high-performance, cost-effective, and highly secure quantum key distribution networks using standard telecommunication components.

TI Inexact Quantum Square Root Circuit for NISQ Devices
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) computers face significant reliability challenges because they are vulnerable to quantum noise, which severely limits their fidelity in quantum applications. In particular, deep circuits with a large number of quantum gates are susceptible to errors as they are more likely to lose their states in a deep circuit. In this paper, we propose a quantum circuit for square root operation that generates correct results on NISQ devices. The square root operation is used in many applications such as complex number computations, computer graphics, etc. While there have been limited studies on quantum square root circuits, none of them can be implemented on NISQ devices. In this work, we simplify the structure of an exact quantum square root circuit and reduce the number of quantum gates. The proposed design reduces the complexity of the square root circuit while maintaining the same level of precision in outputs. In addition, we exploit approximate computing to simplify the circuit further and run it on a real quantum computer. Approximate computing is used in classical computers to enhance the power and/or performance in exchange for accuracy. We exploit approximate computing for a different purpose, which is reducing the depth as well as the number of quantum gates in the square root circuit. To validate the effectiveness of our approach, we conduct experiments on an IBM quantum computer, where our circuit produces meaningful results. Furthermore, we present examples of error-resilient applications to demonstrate the validity of our approximate circuit.

TI Statistical intrusion detection and eavesdropping in quantum channels
   with coupling: multiple-preparation and single-preparation methods
SO QUANTUM INFORMATION PROCESSING
AB Classical, i.e., non-quantum, communications include configurations with multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) channels. Some associated signal processing tasks consider these channels in a symmetric way, i.e., by assigning the same role to all channel inputs, and similarly to all channel outputs. These tasks especially include channel identification/estimation and channel equalization, tightly connected with source separation. Their most challenging version is the blind one, i.e., when the receivers have (almost) no prior knowledge about the emitted signals. Other signal processing tasks consider classical communication channels in an asymmetric way. This especially includes the situation when data are sent by Emitter 1 to Receiver 1 through a main channel, and an "intruder" (including Receiver 2) interferes with that channel so as to extract information, thus performing so-called eavesdropping, while Receiver 1 may aim at detecting that intrusion, which leads to a decision problem (existence of intrusion/no intrusion). Part of the above processing tasks have been extended to quantum channels, including those that have several quantum bits (qubits) at their input and output. For such quantum channels, beyond previously reported work for symmetric scenarios, we here address asymmetric (blind and non-blind) ones, with emphasis on intrusion detection and additional comments about eavesdropping. To develop fundamental concepts, we first consider channels with exchange coupling as a toy model. We especially use the general quantum information processing framework that we recently developed, to derive new attractive intrusion detection methods based on a single preparation of each state. Finally, we discuss how the proposed methods might be extended, beyond the specific class of channels analyzed here.

TI Dissipation and dephasing of interacting photons in transmon arrays
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Transmon arrays are one of the most promising platforms for quantum information science. Despite being often considered simply as qubits, transmons are inherently quantum mechanical multilevel systems. Being experimentally controllable with high fidelity, the higher excited states beyond the qubit subspace provide an important resource for hardware-efficient many-body quantum simulations, quantum error correction, and quantum information protocols. Alas, dissipation and dephasing phenomena generated by couplings to various uncontrollable environments yield a practical limiting factor to their utilization. To quantify this in detail, we present here the primary consequences of single-transmon dissipation and dephasing to the many-body dynamics of transmon arrays. We use analytical methods from perturbation theory and quantum trajectory approach together with numerical simulations, and deliberately consider the full Hilbert space, including the higher excited states. The three main nonunitary processes are many-body decoherence, many-body dissi-pation, and heating/cooling transitions between different anharmonicity manifolds. Of these, the many-body decoherence-being proportional to the squared distance between the many-body Fock states-gives the strictest limit for observing effective unitary dynamics. Considering experimentally relevant parameters, including also the inevitable site-to-site disorder, our results show that the state-of-the-art transmon arrays should be ready for the task of demonstrating coherent many-body dynamics using the higher excited states. However, the wider utilization of transmons for ternary-and-beyond quantum computing calls for improving their coherence properties.

AB Quantum error correction (QEC) is the central building block of fault-tolerant quantum computation but the design of QEC codes may not always match the underlying hardware. To tackle the discrepancy between the quantum hardware and QEC codes, we propose a synthesis framework that can implement and optimize the surface code onto superconducting quantum architectures. In particular, we divide the surface code synthesis into three key subroutines. The first two optimize the mapping of data qubits and ancillary qubits including syndrome qubits on the connectivity-constrained superconducting architecture, while the last subroutine optimizes the surface code execution by rescheduling syndrome measurements. Our experiments on mainstream superconducting architectures demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed synthesis framework. Especially, the surface codes synthesized by the proposed automatic synthesis framework can achieve comparable or even better error correction capability than manually designed QEC codes.

TI Quantum entanglement and Bell inequality violation at colliders
SO PROGRESS IN PARTICLE AND NUCLEAR PHYSICS
AB The study of entanglement in particle physics has been gathering pace in the past few years. It is a new field that is providing important results about the possibility of detecting entanglement and testing Bell inequality at colliders for final states as diverse as top-quark, tau-lepton pairs and Lambda-baryons, massive gauge bosons and vector mesons. In this review, after presenting definitions, tools and basic results that are necessary for understanding these developments, we summarize the main findings-as published by the beginning of year 2024-including analyses of experimental data in B meson decays and top-quark pair production. We include a detailed discussion of the results for both qubit and qutrits systems, that is, final states containing spin one-half and spin one particles. Entanglement has also been proposed as a new tool to constrain new particles and fields beyond the Standard Model and we introduce the reader to this promising feature as well.

TI Precision channel loss estimation for quantum networks
SO OPTICA
AB Quantum metrology plays a crucial role in characterizing and stabilizing optical channels in a quantum network, where precise estimation of loss is critical for loss-sensitive quantum protocols. Optical fiber channels are the primary medium for linking quantum nodes, where loss estimation with optical quantum states may enhance the precision compared to classical probes. In this study, we investigate the use of two-mode squeezed vacuum (TMSV) states, an optical quantum state generated via parametric down-conversion, and their detection with photon-number-resolving detectors for characterization of transmission loss. Theoretical analysis indicates that TMSV states exhibit higher Fisher information for transmission parameter estimation than coherent states, suggesting they are superior probes that can significantly enhance measurement precision. Our experimental results confirm that these TMSV states outperform coherent states in the context of loss estimation in an optical channel, achieving up to 3.9 dB higher Fisher information for transmissivity estimation without relying on post-selection measurements. This source can effectively probe transmission losses in optical fibers up to 35 km, maintaining a measurement precision advantage over coherent probe states. These findings underscore the potential of TMSV states to advance quantum metrology and improve the robustness of quantum network applications.

TI Hidden qubit cluster states
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Continuous-variable cluster states (CVCSs) can be supplemented with Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) states to form a hybrid cluster state with the power to execute universal, fault-tolerant quantum computing in a measurement-based fashion. As the resource states that comprise a hybrid cluster state are of a very different nature, a natural question arises: Why do GKP states interface so well with CVCSs? To answer this question, we apply the recently introduced subsystem decomposition of a bosonic mode, which divides a mode into logical and gauge-mode subsystems, to three types of cluster state: CVCSs, GKP cluster states, and hybrid continuous-variable (CV)-GKP cluster states. We find that each of these contains a "hidden" qubit cluster state across their logical subsystems, which lies at the heart of their utility for measurement-based quantum computing. To complement the analytical approach, we introduce a simple graphical description of these CV-mode cluster states that depicts precisely how the hidden qubit cluster states are entangled with the gauge modes, and we outline how these results would extend to the case of finitely squeezed states. This work provides important insight that is both conceptually satisfying and helps to address important practical issues like when a simpler resource (such as a Gaussian state) can stand in for a more complex one (like a GKP state), leading to more efficient use of the resources available for CV quantum computing.

TI How coherence measurements of a qubit steer its quantum environment
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB A qubit suffers decoherence when coupled to a classical or quantum environment, and characterizing the qubit decoherence process is vital in quantum technologies. Repetitive Ramsey interferometry measurements (RIMs) are often used to measure qubit coherence, assuming that the environment remains unaffected after each measurement and the outcomes of all measurements are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.). While this assumption is valid for a classical environment, it may not hold for a quantum environment due to the non-negligible backaction from qubit to environment, especially when the environment has a memory time much longer than the duration of each RIM cycle. Here, we present a general theoretical framework to incorporate the measurement backaction from qubit to environment in sequential RIMs. We show that a RIM of a qubit induces a quantum channel on the quantum environment, and sequential RIMs gradually steer the quantum environment to the fixed points of the channel. We reveal three distinct environment steering effects-polarization, depolarization, and metastable polarization, depending on the commutativity of the noise operator B and the free environment Hamiltonian H e : (1) If B commutes with H e , i.e., [ B , H e ] = 0, the quantum environment is gradually polarized to different eigenstates of B as the number m of repetitive RIMs increases; (2) when [ B , H e ] not equal 0, the quantum environment is gradually depolarized to a maximally mixed state of its whole Hilbert space or a Hilbert subspace; (3) when [ B , H e ] not equal 0 but one of H e and B is a small perturbation on the other, metastable polarization can happen, such that the quantum environment is first polarized for a finite range of m but becomes gradually depolarized as m increases further. The environment steering also makes the measurement statistics of sequential RIMs develop non-i.i.d. features, such that the measurement result distribution can display multiple peaks for a small quantum environment, corresponding to different fixed points of the quantum channel. Realistic examples of central spin models are presented to demonstrate the measurement statistics and environment steering effects. Our paper not only elucidates the measurement backaction and statistics of repetitive qubit coherence measurements, but is also useful for designing protocols to engineer the state or dynamics of a quantum environment with a qubit ancilla.

In this work, we prove a general VC dimension upper bound for quantum circuit learning including 'data re-uploading' circuits, where the input gates can be single qubit rotations anywhere in the circuit. A linear lower bound is also constructed. The properties of the bounds and approximation-estimation trade-off considerations are discussed.

TI Fast generation of Schrödinger cat states using a Kerr-tunable
   superconducting resonator
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Schrodinger cat states, quantum superpositions of macroscopically distinct classical states, are an important resource for quantum communication, quantum metrology and quantum computation. Especially, cat states in a phase space protected against phase-flip errors can be used as a logical qubit. However, cat states, normally generated in three-dimensional cavities and/or strong multi-photon drives, are facing the challenges of scalability and controllability. Here, we present a strategy to generate and preserve cat states in a coplanar superconducting circuit by the fast modulation of Kerr nonlinearity. At the Kerr-free work point, our cat states are passively preserved due to the vanishing Kerr effect. We are able to prepare a 2-component cat state in our chip-based device with a fidelity reaching 89.1% under a 96 ns gate time. Our scheme shows an excellent route to constructing a chip-based bosonic quantum processor.
   Schrodinger's cat states constitute an important resource for quantum information processing, but present challenges in terms of scalabilty and controllability. Here, the authors exploit fast Kerr nonlinearity modulation to generate and store cat states in superconducting circuits in a more scalable way.

TI Towards a quantum computing algorithm for helicity amplitudes and parton
   showers
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
AB The interpretation of measurements of high-energy particle collisions relies heavily on the performance of full event generators, which include the calculation of the hard process and the subsequent parton shower step. With the continuous improvement of quantum devices, dedicated algorithms are needed to exploit the potential quantum that computers can provide. We propose general and extendable algorithms for quantum gate computers to facilitate calculations of helicity amplitudes and the parton shower process. The helicity amplitude calculation exploits the equivalence between spinors and qubits and the unique features of a quantum computer to compute the helicities of each particle involved simultaneously, thus fully utilizing the quantum nature of the computation. This advantage over classical computers is further exploited by the simultaneous computation of s- and t-channel amplitudes for a 2 -> 2 process. The parton shower algorithm simulates collinear emission for a two-step, discrete parton shower. In contrast to classical implementations, the quantum algorithm constructs a wave function with a superposition of all shower histories for the whole parton shower process, thus removing the need to explicitly keep track of individual shower histories. Both algorithms utilize the quantum computers ability to remain in a quantum state throughout the computation and represent a first step towards a quantum computing algorithm describing the full collision event at the LHC.

TI A quantum algorithm for Toeplitz matrix-vector multiplication
SO CHINESE PHYSICS B
AB Toeplitz matrix-vector multiplication is widely used in various fields, including optimal control, systolic finite field multipliers, multidimensional convolution, etc. In this paper, we first present a non-asymptotic quantum algorithm for Toeplitz matrix-vector multiplication with time complexity O(kappa polylogn) , where kappa and 2n are the condition number and the dimension of the circulant matrix extended from the Toeplitz matrix, respectively. For the case with an unknown generating function, we also give a corresponding non-asymptotic quantum version that eliminates the dependency on the L 1-norm rho of the displacement of the structured matrices. Due to the good use of the special properties of Toeplitz matrices, the proposed quantum algorithms are sufficiently accurate and efficient compared to the existing quantum algorithms under certain circumstances.

TI Quantum security and theory of decoherence
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB We sketch a relation between two crucial, yet independent, fields in quantum information research, viz. quantum decoherence and quantum cryptography. We investigate here how the standard cryptographic assumption of shielded laboratory, stating that data generated by a secure quantum device remain private unless explicitly published, is disturbed by the einselection mechanism of quantum Darwinism explaining the measurement process by interaction with the external environment. We illustrate the idea with a paradigmatic example of a quantum random number generator compromised by a quantum analog of the Van Eck phreaking. In particular, we derive a trade-off relation between the eavesdropper's guessing probability P(guess )and the collective decoherence factor gamma of the simple form P-guess + gamma ? 1.

TI Measurement-invisible quantum correlations in scrambling dynamics
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB Scrambling unitary dynamics in a quantum system transmutes local quantum information into a nonlocal web of correlations which manifests itself in a complex spatiotemporal pattern of entanglement. In such a context, we show there can exist three distinct dynamical phases characterized by qualitatively different forms of quantum correlations between two disjoint subsystems of the system. Transitions between these phases are driven by the relative sizes of the subsystems and the degree scrambling that the dynamics effects. Besides a phase which has no quantum correlations as manifested by vanishing entanglement between the parts and a phase which has nontrivial quantum correlations quantified by a finite entanglement monotone, we reveal a new phase transition within the entangled phase which separates phases wherein the quantum correlations are invisible or visible to measurements on one of the subsystems. This is encoded in the qualitatively different properties of the ensemble of states on one of the subsystems conditioned on the various measurement outcomes on the other subsystem. This provides a new characterization of entanglement phases in terms of their response to measurements instead of the more ubiquitous measurement-induced entanglement transitions. Our results have implications for the kind of tasks that can be performed using measurement feedback within the framework of quantum interactive dynamics.

TI Exploration of Design Alternatives for Reducing Idle Time in Shor's
   Algorithm: A Study on Monolithic and Distributed Quantum Systems
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM ENGINEERING
AB Shor's algorithm is one of the most prominent quantum algorithms, yet finding efficient implementations remains an active research challenge. While many approaches focus on low-level modular arithmetic optimizations, a broader perspective can provide additional opportunities for improvement. By adopting a midlevel abstraction, we analyze the algorithm as a sequence of computational tasks, enabling systematic identification of idle time and optimization of execution flow. Building on this perspective, we first introduce an alternating design approach to minimize idle time while preserving qubit efficiency in Shor's algorithm. By strategically reordering tasks for simultaneous execution, we achieve a substantial reduction in overall execution time. Extending this approach to distributed implementations, we demonstrate how task rearrangement enhances execution efficiency in the presence of multiple distribution channels. Furthermore, to effectively evaluate the impact of design choices, we employ static timing analysis-a technique from classical circuit design-to analyze circuit delays while accounting for hardware-specific execution characteristics, such as measurement and reset delays in monolithic architectures and ebit generation time in distributed settings. Finally, we validate our approach by integrating modular exponentiation circuits from QRISP and constructing circuits for factoring numbers up to 64 bits. Through an extensive study across neutral atom, superconducting, and ion trap quantum computing platforms, we analyze circuit delays, highlighting tradeoffs between qubit efficiency and execution time. Our findings provide a structured framework for optimizing compiled quantum circuits for Shor's algorithm, tailored to specific hardware constraints.

AB We comparatively study three of the most useful quantum information tools to detect quantum critical points (QCPs) when only finite temperature data are available. We investigate quantitatively how the quantum discord, the quantum-teleportation-based QCP detectors, and the quantum coherence spectrum pinpoint the QCPs of several spin -1 / 2 chains. We work in the thermodynamic limit (infinite number of spins) and with the spin chains in equilibrium with a thermal reservoir at temperature T . The models here studied are the XXZ model with and without an external longitudinal magnetic field, the Ising transverse model, and the XY model subjected to an external transverse magnetic field.

TI Quantum Optical Experiments Modeled by Long Short-Term Memory
SO PHOTONICS
AB We demonstrate how machine learning is able to model experiments in quantum physics. Quantum entanglement is a cornerstone for upcoming quantum technologies, such as quantum computation and quantum cryptography. Of particular interest are complex quantum states with more than two particles and a large number of entangled quantum levels. Given such a multiparticle high-dimensional quantum state, it is usually impossible to reconstruct an experimental setup that produces it. To search for interesting experiments, one thus has to randomly create millions of setups on a computer and calculate the respective output states. In this work, we show that machine learning models can provide significant improvement over random search. We demonstrate that a long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network can successfully learn to model quantum experiments by correctly predicting output state characteristics for given setups without the necessity of computing the states themselves. This approach not only allows for faster search, but is also an essential step towards the automated design of multiparticle high-dimensional quantum experiments using generative machine learning models.

TI Generalized quantum circuit differentiation rules
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Variational quantum algorithms that are used for quantum machine learning rely on the ability to automatically differentiate parametrized quantum circuits with respect to underlying parameters. Here we propose the rules for differentiating quantum circuits (unitaries) with arbitrary generators. Unlike the standard parameter-shift rule valid for unitaries generated by operators with spectra limited to at most two unique eigenvalues (represented by involutory and idempotent operators), our approach also works for generators with a generic nondegenerate spectrum. Based on a spectral decomposition, we derive a simple recipe that allows explicit derivative evaluation. The derivative corresponds to the weighted sum of measured expectations for circuits with shifted parameters. The number of function evaluations is equal to the number of unique positive nonzero spectral gaps (eigenvalue differences) for the generator. We apply the approach to relevant examples of two-qubit gates, among others showing that the so-called fermionic simulation (fSim) gate can be differentiated using four measurements. Additionally, we present generalized differentiation rules for the case of Pauli-string generators, based on distinct shifts (here referred to as the triangulation approach), and analyze the variance for derivative measurements in different scenarios. Our work offers a toolbox for the efficient hardware-oriented differentiation needed for circuit optimization and operator-based derivative representation.

TI Classical and quantum orbital correlations in molecular electronic
   states
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB The quantum superposition principle has been extensively utilized in the quantum mechanical description of bonding phenomenon. It explains the emergence of delocalized molecular orbitals and provides a recipe for the construction of near-exact electronic wavefunctions. On the other hand, its existence in composite systems may give rise to nonclassical correlations that are regarded as a resource in quantum technologies. Here, we approach the electronic ground states of three prototypical molecules in the light of the framework set by fermionic information theory. By introducing the notion of orbital discord, we additively decompose the pairwise orbital correlations into their classical and quantum parts in the presence of superselection rules. We observe that quantum orbital correlations can be stronger than classical orbital correlations though not often. Moreover, quantum orbital correlations can survive even in the absence of orbital entanglement depending on the symmetries of the constituent orbitals. Finally, we demonstrate that orbital entanglement would be underestimated if the orbital density matrices were treated as qubit states.

TI Robust error accumulation suppression for quantum circuits
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB We present a robust error accumulation suppression (REAS) technique to manage errors in quantum computers. Our method reduces the accumulation of errors in any quantum circuit composed of single- or two-qubit gates expressed as e-i sigma theta for Pauli operators sigma and theta is an element of [0, pi), which forms a universal gate set. For coherent errors, which include gate overrotation and crosstalk, we demonstrate a reduction of the error scaling in an L-depth circuit from O(L) to O(root L). This asymptotic error suppression behavior can be proven in a regime where all gates, including those constituting the error-suppressing protocol itself, are noisy. Going beyond coherent errors, we derive the general form of decoherence noise that can be suppressed by REAS. Lastly, we experimentally demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach regarding realistic errors using 100-qubit circuits with up to 64 two-qubit gate layers on IBM Quantum processors.

AB The swarms of robots are examples of artificial collective intelligence, with simple individual autonomous behavior and emerging swarm effect to accomplish even complex tasks. Modeling approaches for robotic swarm development is one of the main challenges in this field of research. Here, we present a robot-instantiated theoretical framework and a quantitative worked-out example. Aiming to build up a general model, we first sketch a diagrammatic classification of swarms relating ideal swarms to existing implementations, inspired by category theory. Then, we propose a matrix representation to relate local and global behaviors in a swarm, with diagonal sub-matrices describing individual features and off-diagonal sub-matrices as pairwise interaction terms. Thus, we attempt to shape the structure of such an interaction term, using language and tools of quantum computing for a quantitative simulation of a toy model. We choose quantum computing because of its computational efficiency. This case study can shed light on potentialities of quantum computing in the realm of swarm robotics, leaving room for progressive enrichment and refinement.

TI Hybrid Atom Tweezer Array of Nuclear Spin and Optical Clock Qubits
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW X
AB While data qubits with a long coherence time are essential for the storage of quantum information, ancilla qubits are pivotal in quantum error correction (QEC) for fault-tolerant quantum computing. The recent development of optical tweezer arrays, such as the preparation of large-scale qubit arrays and high-fidelity gate operations, offers the potential for realizing QEC protocols, and one of the important next challenges is to control and detect ancilla qubits while minimizing atom loss and crosstalk. Here, we present the realization of a hybrid system consisting of a dual-isotope ytterbium (Yb) atom array, in which we can utilize a nuclear spin qubit of fermionic 171 Yb as a data qubit and an optical clock qubit of bosonic 174 Yb as an ancilla qubit with a capacity of nondestructive qubit readout. We evaluate the crosstalk between qubits regarding the impact on the coherence of the nuclear spin qubits from the imaging light for 174 Yb. For the Hahn-echo sequence with a 399 nm probe and 556 nm cooling beams for 174 Yb, we observe 99.1 (1.8)% coherence retained under 20 ms exposure, yielding a discrimination fidelity of 0.9992 and a survival probability of 0.988. The Ramsey sequence with a 556 nm probe beam shows negligible influence on the coherence, suggesting the potential future improvement of low crosstalk measurements. This result highlights the potential of the hybrid-Yb atom array for midcircuit measurements for ancilla-qubit-based QEC protocols.

TI Investigating the exchange of Ising chains on a digital quantum computer
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB The ferromagnetic state of an Ising chain can represent a twofold degenerate subspace or equivalently a logical qubit that is protected from excitations by an energy gap. Here, we study a braiding-like exchange operation through the movement of the ferromagnetic state in the qubit subspace, which resembles that of the localized edge modes in a Kitaev chain. The system consists of two Ising chains in a one-dimensional geometry where the operation is simulated through the adiabatic time evolution of the ground state. The time evolution is implemented via the Suzuki-Trotter expansion on basic single- and two-qubit quantum gates using IBM's Aer QASM simulator. The fidelity of the system is investigated as a function of the evolution and system parameters to obtain optimum efficiency and accuracy for different system sizes. Various aspects of the implementation, including the circuit depth, Trotterization error, and quantum gate errors pertaining to noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) hardware, are discussed as well. We demonstrate that the quantum gate errors, i.e., bit-flip, phase errors, are the dominating factor in determining the fidelity of the system as the Trotter error and the adiabatic condition are less restrictive even for modest values of Trotter time steps. We reach an optimum fidelity >99% on systems of up to 11 sites per Ising chain. We show that running such simulations is far beyond the reach of current NISQ hardware with the most efficient implementation of a single braiding-like operation for a fidelity above 90% requiring a circuit depth of the order of similar to 10(3) restricting the individual gate errors to be less than similar to 10(-6).

TI Effects of Kaplan-Shekhtman-Entin-Wohlman-Aharony interaction on quantum
   discord of non-markovian dynamics under different magnetic fields
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB Since the discovery of symmetric helical interactions in the spin-orbit coupled single-band Hubbard model by Moriya and Kaplan, Shekhtman, Entin, Aharony et al. have successfully used this non-negligible symmetric helical exchange interaction to explain the weak ferromagnetism of La2CuO4. By using the non-Markovian quantum state diffusion method, the quantum discord of non-Markovian dynamics in the spin chain system that has Kaplan -Shekhtman -Entin-Wohlman -Aharony interactions and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions is studied. The effects of Kaplan-Shekhtman-Entin-Wohlman-Aharony interaction on the quantum discord under different external magnetic fields at zero and finite temperatures are discussed. The results show that the quantum discord in the system can be increased via the increasing of Kaplan -Shekhtman -Entin-Wohlman Aharony interaction in the case of zero or uniform magnetic field, while the case is opposite under the nonuniform magnetic field. More importantly, the ideal discord state can be obtained by modulating the uniform magnetic field and Kaplan-Shekhtman-Entin-Wohlman-Aharony interaction. Moreover, the Markovian case and the effect of temperature on the quantum discord are also discussed, respectively.

TI Quantum self-supervised learning
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB The resurgence of self-supervised learning, whereby a deep learning model generates its own supervisory signal from the data, promises a scalable way to tackle the dramatically increasing size of real-world data sets without human annotation. However, the staggering computational complexity of these methods is such that for state-of-the-art performance, classical hardware requirements represent a significant bottleneck to further progress. Here we take the first steps to understanding whether quantum neural networks (QNNs) could meet the demand for more powerful architectures and test its effectiveness in proof-of-principle hybrid experiments. Interestingly, we observe a numerical advantage for the learning of visual representations using small-scale QNN over equivalently structured classical networks, even when the quantum circuits are sampled with only 100 shots. Furthermore, we apply our best quantum model to classify unseen images on the ibmq_paris quantum computer and find that current noisy devices can already achieve equal accuracy to the equivalent classical model on downstream tasks.

TI Analysis of the one-decoy-state SARG04 quantum cryptography protocol in
   the presence of afterpulse effects
SO COMMUNICATIONS IN THEORETICAL PHYSICS
AB The SARG04 quantum key distribution protocol can offer greater robustness against photon number splitting attacks than the BB84 protocol that is implemented with weak pulses. In this paper, we propose a tight key analysis for the SARG04 protocol, by considering the one-decoy method and investigating its performance under the influence of a detector afterpulse. Our results demonstrate that an increase in block size leads to a slight increase in both the secure key rate and the maximum transmission distance. Importantly, the detector afterpulse plays a crucial role in practical applications and has a more pronounced effect on the SARG04 protocol compared to the BB84 protocol.

TI Generation of continuous variable quantum correlation via an
   optomechanical nanobeam crystal composed of dielectric material layers
SO AIP ADVANCES
AB In this paper, we explore the generation of continuous-variable quantum correlations in an optomechanical nanobeam crystal, which consists of two dielectric mirrors designed as Bragg reflectors. These mirrors are constructed from alternating layers, with varying refractive indices, and their transmissive and reflective properties are analyzed using the transfer matrix method. The system is driven by a laser field tuned to the blue-detuned sideband, enabling coupling between the cavity and mechanical modes through radiation pressure. We explore various forms of quantum correlations, including entanglement, quantum steering, and quantum discord. Logarithmic negativity is employed to quantify entanglement, while quantum steering is assessed to evaluate the steerability between subsystems. Quantum discord is employed to measure non-classical correlations that extend beyond entanglement. Our findings emphasize that the strength of quantum correlation is affected by several factors, including laser power, single-photon coupling strength, and the refractive index of the mirror layers. Notably, all forms of correlations diminished with increasing temperature. These results underline the potential of the proposed system for advancing continuous-variable quantum information processing, offering versatile platforms for studying and harnessing quantum correlations in practical applications.

TI Deterministic generation of multiqubit entangled states among distant
   parties using indefinite causal order
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB Quantum entanglement plays an irreplaceable role in various remote quantum information-processing tasks. Here, we present protocols for generating deterministic and heralded N-qubit entangled states across multiple network nodes. By utilizing a preshared maximally entangled state and single-qubit operations within an indefinite-causal-order framework, the multiqubit entangled state between distant parties can be generated deterministically. The complex entangled-state measurements and multiple preshared entangled states, are essential in conventional entanglement-swapping techniques but are not required in our approach. This greatly reduces the complexity of the quantum circuit and makes it more experimentally feasible. Furthermore, we develop optical architectures to implement these protocols by encoding qubits in polarization degrees of freedom. The results indicate that our protocols significantly improve the efficiency of long-distance entanglement generation and provide a practical framework for establishing large-scale quantum networks.

TI Optimally preserving quantum correlations and coherence with eternally
   non-Markovian dynamics
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB We demonstrate, both analytically and experimentally, the usefulness of non-Markovianity for preserving correlations and coherence in quantum systems. For this, we consider a broad class of qubit evolutions, having a decoherence matrix separated from zero for large times. While any such Markovian evolution leads to an exponential loss of correlations, non-Markovianity can help to preserve correlations even in the limit t -> infinity. In fact, under general assumptions, eternally non-Markovian evolution naturally emerges as the one that allows for optimal preservation of quantum correlations. For covariant qubit evolutions, we also show that non-Markovianity can be used to preserve quantum coherence at all times, which is an important resource for quantum metrology. We explicitly demonstrate this effect experimentally with linear optics, by implementing the optimal non-Markovian quantum evolution.

TI A quantum algorithm for the lattice-Boltzmann method advection-diffusion
   equation
SO COMPUTER PHYSICS COMMUNICATIONS
AB We present a versatile and efficient quantum algorithm based on the Lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) approximate solution of the linear advection-diffusion equation (ADE). We emphasize that the LBM approximation modifies the diffusion term of the underlying exact ADE and leads to a modified equation (mADE). Due to its versatility in terms of operator splitting, the proposed quantum LBM algorithm for the mADE provides a building block for future quantum algorithms to solve the linearized Navier-Stokes equation on quantum computers. We split the algorithm into four operations: initialization, collision, streaming, and calculation of the macroscopic quantities. We propose general quantum building blocks for each operator, which adapt intrinsically from the general three-dimensional case to smaller dimensions and apply to arbitrary lattice-velocity sets. Based on (sub-linear) amplitude data encoding, we propose improved initialization and collision operations with reduced complexity and efficient sampling-based simulation. Quantum streaming algorithms are based on previous developments. The proposed quantum algorithm allows for the computation of successive time steps, requiring full state measurement and reinitialization after every time step. It is validated by comparison with a digital implementation and based on analytical solutions in one and two dimensions. Furthermore, we demonstrate the versatility of the quantum algorithm for two cases with non-uniform advection velocities in two and three dimensions. Various velocity sets are considered to further highlight the flexibility of the algorithm. We benchmark our optimized quantum algorithm against previous methods employed in sampling-based quantum simulators. We demonstrate sampling efficiency, with sampling accelerated convergence requiring fewer shots.

TI Quantum Interfaces to the Nanoscale
SO ACS NANO
AB Scalable quantum information systems would store, manipulate, and transmit quantum information locally and across a quantum network, but no single qubit technology is currently robust enough to perform all necessary tasks. Defect centers in solid-state materials have emerged as potential intermediaries between other physical manifestations of qubits, such as superconducting qubits and photonic qubits, to leverage their complementary advantages. It remains an open question, however, how to design and to control quantum interfaces to defect centers. Such interfaces would enable quantum information to be moved seamlessly between different physical systems. Understanding and constructing the required interfaces would, therefore, unlock the next big steps in quantum computing, sensing, and communications. In this Perspective, we highlight promising coupling mechanisms, including dipole-, phonon-, and magnon-mediated interactions, and discuss how contributions from nanotechnologists will be paramount in realizing quantum information processors in the near-term.

TI Modeling phonon-mediated quasiparticle poisoning in superconducting
   qubit arrays
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB Correlated errors caused by ionizing radiation impacting superconducting qubit chips are problematic for quantum error correction. Such impacts generate quasiparticle (QP) excitations in the qubit electrodes, which temporarily reduce qubit coherence significantly. The many energetic phonons produced by a particle impact travel efficiently throughout the device substrate and generate quasiparticles with high probability, thus causing errors on a large fraction of the qubits in an array simultaneously. We describe a comprehensive strategy for the numerical simulation of the phonon and quasiparticle dynamics in the aftermath of an impact. We compare the simulations with experimental measurements of phonon-mediated QP poisoning and demonstrate that our modeling captures the spatial and temporal footprint of the QP poisoning for various configurations of phonon down-conversion structures. We thus present a path forward for the operation of superconducting quantum processors in the presence of ionizing radiation.

TI Comparative Study of Sampling-Based Simulation Costs of Noisy Quantum
   Circuits
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB Noise in quantum operations often negates the advantage of quantum computation. However, most classical simulations of quantum computers calculate the ideal probability amplitudes by either storing full state vectors or using sophisticated tensor-network contractions. Here we investigate sampling-based classical simulation methods for noisy quantum circuits. Specifically, we characterize the simulation costs of two major schemes, stabilizer-state sampling of magic states and Heisenberg propagation, for quantum circuits subject to stochastic Pauli noise, such as depolarizing and dephasing noise. To this end, we introduce several techniques for the stabilizer-state sampling to reduce the simulation costs under such noise. It is revealed that in the low-noise regime, stabilizer-state sampling results in a smaller sampling cost, while Heisenberg propagation is better in the high-noise regime. Furthermore, for a high depolarizing noise rate of approximately 10%, these methods provide better scaling than that given by the low-rank stabilizer decomposition. We believe that this knowledge of classical simulation costs is useful to achieve possible quantum advantage on near-term noisy quantum devices as well as efficient classical simulation methods.

TI Exploring Quantum Machine Learning and Feature Reduction Techniques for
   Wind Turbine Pitch Fault Detection
SO ENERGIES
AB Driven by the development of machine learning (ML) and deep learning techniques, prognostics and health management (PHM) has become a key aspect of reliability engineering research. With the recent rise in popularity of quantum computing algorithms and public availability of first-generation quantum hardware, it is of interest to assess their potential for efficiently handling large quantities of operational data for PHM purposes. This paper addresses the application of quantum kernel classification models for fault detection in wind turbine systems (WTSs). The analyzed data correspond to low-frequency SCADA sensor measurements and recorded SCADA alarm logs, focused on the early detection of pitch fault failures. This work aims to explore potential advantages of quantum kernel methods, such as quantum support vector machines (Q-SVMs), over traditional ML approaches and compare principal component analysis (PCA) and autoencoders (AE) as feature reduction tools. Results show that the proposed quantum approach is comparable to conventional ML models in terms of performance and can outperform traditional models (random forest, k-nearest neighbors) for the selected reduced dimensionality of 19 features for both PCA and AE. The overall highest mean accuracies obtained are 0.945 for Gaussian SVM and 0.925 for Q-SVM models.

TI Compact multi-threshold quantum information driven ansatz for strongly
   interactive lattice spin models
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS A-MATHEMATICAL AND THEORETICAL
AB Quantum algorithms based on the variational principle have found applications in diverse areas with a huge flexibility. But as the circuit size increases the variational landscapes become flattened, causing the so-called Barren plateau phenomena. This will lead to an increased difficulty in the optimization phase, due to the reduction of the cost function parameters gradient. One of the possible solutions is to employ shallower circuits or adaptive ans & auml;tze. We introduce a systematic procedure for ansatz building based on approximate Quantum Mutual Information (QMI) with improvement on each layer obtained by repeated applications of the previously defined Quantum Information Driven Ansatz (QIDA) approach. The objective is to recover the correlation that is discarded by the standalone QIDA method, including it in additional layers. Our approach generates a layered-structured ansatz, where each layer entangler map is defined on the qubit couples selected based on their QMI values. Following the rationale that shallower circuits may mitigate the phenomenon of barren plateaus, the Multi-QIDA ansatz partitions the optimization landscape into smaller steps. The method employs an iterative construction and optimization strategy, progressively extending the circuit depth to guide the optimization towards the appropriate potential well. We benchmarked our approach on various configurations of the Heisenberg model Hamiltonian, ranging between 9 and 12 qubits, demonstrating significant improvements in the accuracy of the ground state energy calculations, in terms of deviation from the best results and convergence, compared to traditional heuristic ansatz methods. Our results show that the Multi-QIDA method reduces the computational complexity while maintaining high precision, making it a promising tool for quantum simulations in lattice spin models.

TI Training-efficient density quantum machine learning
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Quantum machine learning (QML) requires powerful, flexible and efficiently trainable models to be successful in solving challenging problems. We introduce density quantum neural networks, a model family that prepares mixtures of trainable unitaries, with a distributional constraint over coefficients. This framework balances expressivity and efficient trainability, especially on quantum hardware. For expressivity, the Hastings-Campbell Mixing lemma converts benefits from linear combination of unitaries into density models with similar performance guarantees but shallower circuits. For trainability, commuting-generator circuits enable density model construction with efficiently extractable gradients. The framework connects to various facets of QML including post-variational and measurement-based learning. In classical settings, density models naturally integrate the mixture of experts formalism and offer natural overfitting mitigation. The framework is versatile-we uplift several quantum models into density versions to improve model performance, or trainability, or both. These include Hamming weight-preserving and equivariant models, among others. Extensive numerical experiments validate our findings.

TI Proof-of-principle experimental demonstration of twin-field quantum key
   distribution over optical channels with asymmetric losses
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Twin-field (TF) quantum key distribution (QKD) is highly attractive because it can beat the fundamental limit of secret key rate for point-to-point QKD without quantum repeaters. Many theoretical and experimental studies have shown the superiority of TFQKD in long-distance communication. All previous experimental implementations of TFQKD have been done over optical channels with symmetric losses. But in reality, especially in a network setting, the distances between users and the middle node could be very different. In this paper, we perform a proof-of-principle experimental demonstration of TFQKD over optical channels with asymmetric losses. We compare two compensation strategies, that are (1) applying asymmetric signal intensities and (2) adding extra losses, and verify that strategy (1) provides much better key rate. Moreover, the higher the loss, the more key rate enhancement it can achieve. By applying asymmetric signal intensities, TFQKD with asymmetric channel losses not only surpasses the fundamental limit of key rate of point-to-point QKD for 50 dB overall loss, but also has key rate as high as 2.918 x 10(-6) for 56 dB overall loss. Whereas no keys are obtained with strategy (2) for 56 dB loss. The increased key rate and enlarged distance coverage of TFQKD with asymmetric channel losses guarantee its superiority in long-distance quantum networks.

TI A quantum computing method for multidimensional cycle shift
   transformations for quantum image processing
SO PHYSICA SCRIPTA
AB Quantum image processing in qubit-based image representations for more than two dimensions seems to offer great opportunities for advanced data analysis and processing in quantum computers. Of fundamental importance is cycle shifting an image along an arbitrary direction, as various operations are based on it. In this work, a widely used image representation scheme is generalized into a single, multidimensional encoding. Within this framework, we define a cycle shifting method capable of translating a representation along any linear combination of its dimensional axes. The algorithmic procedure is appropriately redefined to accommodate arbitrary shifts in the Hilbert space. The corresponding computational complexity is optimized, achieving an exponential reduction in quantum resource requirements with respect to the shift-step magnitude. A comparative complexity analysis substantiates the efficiency gain, while simulation results validate the proposed multidimensional framework for two- and three-dimensional representations.

TI Universal hardware-efficient topological measurement-based quantum
   computation via color-code-based cluster states
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Topological measurement-based quantum computation (MBQC) enables one to carry out universal faulttolerant quantum computation via single-qubit measurements with a family of large entangled states called cluster states as resources. Raussendorf's three-dimensional cluster states (RTCSs) based on the surface codes are mainly considered for topological MBQC. In such schemes, however, the logical Hadamard, phase (Z(1/2)), and T (Z(1/4)) gates which are essential for building up arbitrary logical gates are not implemented natively without using state distillation or lattice dislocations, to the best of our knowledge. In particular, state distillation generally consumes many ancillary logical qubits; thus it is a severe obstacle against practical quantum computing. To solve this problem, we suggest an MBQC scheme via a family of cluster states called color-code-based cluster states (CCCSs) based on the two-dimensional color codes instead of the surface codes. We define logical qubits, construct elementary logical gates, and describe error correction schemes. We show that all logical Clifford gates generated by the CNOT, Hadamard, and phase gates can be implemented natively in a fault-tolerant manner, although the T gate still requires state distillation to be fault-tolerant. The error thresholds of MBQC via CCCSs for logical-Z errors are calculated to be 2.7%-2.8%, which are comparable to the values for RTCSs, assuming a simple error model where physical qubits have nontrivial errors independently with the same probability. We analyze and compare the resource overheads of both the schemes. In particular, we show that the number of physical qubits required for implementing a phase gate with CCCSs is at least about 26 times smaller than with RTCSs using state distillation, for the same code distance.

AB This paper introduces Fermihedral, a compiler framework focusing on discovering the optimal Fermion-to-qubit encoding for targeted Fermionic Hamiltonians. Fermion-to-qubit encoding is a crucial step in harnessing quantum computing for efficient simulation of Fermionic quantum systems. Utilizing Pauli algebra, Fermihedral redefines complex constraints and objectives of Fermion-to-qubit encoding into a Boolean Satisfiability problem which can then be solved with high-performance solvers. To accommodate larger-scale scenarios, this paper proposed two new strategies that yield approximate optimal solutions mitigating the overhead from the exponentially large number of clauses. Evaluation across diverse Fermionic systems highlights the superiority of Fermihedral, showcasing substantial reductions in implementation costs, gate counts, and circuit depth in the compiled circuits. Real-system experiments on IonQ's device affirm its effectiveness, notably enhancing simulation accuracy.

TI A High-Efficiency Modular Multiplication Digital Signal Processing for
   Lattice-Based Post-Quantum Cryptography
SO CRYPTOGRAPHY
AB The Number Theoretic Transform (NTT) has been widely used to speed up polynomial multiplication in lattice-based post-quantum algorithms. All NTT operands use modular arithmetic, especially modular multiplication, which significantly influences NTT hardware implementation efficiency. Until now, most hardware implementations used Digital Signal Processing (DSP) to multiply two integers and optimally perform modulo computations from the multiplication product. This paper presents a customized Lattice-DSP (L-DSP) for modular multiplication based on the Karatsuba algorithm, Vedic multiplier, and modular reduction methods. The proposed L-DSP performs both integer multiplication and modular reduction simultaneously for lattice-based cryptography. As a result, the speed and area efficiency of the L-DSPs are 283 MHz for 77 SLICEs, 272 MHz for 87 SLICEs, and 256 MHz for 101 SLICEs with the parameters q of 3329, 7681, and 12,289, respectively. In addition, the N-1 multiplier in the Inverse-NTT (INTT) calculation is also eliminated, reducing the size of the Butterfly Unit (BU) in CRYSTAL-Kyber to about 104 SLICEs, equivalent to a conventional multiplication in the other studies. Based on the proposed DSP, a Point-Wise Matrix Multiplication (PWMM) architecture for CRYSTAL-Kyber is designed on a hardware footprint equivalent to 386 SLICEs. Furthermore, this research is the first DSP designed for lattice-based Post-quantum Cryptography (PQC) modular multiplication.

TI Application of quantum machine learning using the quantum kernel
   algorithm on high energy physics analysis at the LHC
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Quantum machine learning could possibly become a valuable alternative to classical machine learning for applications in high energy physics by offering computational speedups. In this study, we employ a support vector machine with a quantum kernel estimator (QSVM-Kernel method) to a recent LHC flagship physics analysis: t (t) over barH (Higgs boson production in association with a top quark pair). In our quantum simulation study using up to 20 qubits and up to 50 000 events, the QSVM-Kernel method performs as well as its classical counterparts in three different platforms from Google Tensorflow Quantum, IBM Quantum, and Amazon Braket. Additionally, using 15 qubits and 100 events, the application of the QSVM-Kernel method on the IBM superconducting quantum hardware approaches the performance of a noiseless quantum simulator. Our study confirms that the QSVM-Kernel method can use the large dimensionality of the quantum Hilbert space to replace the classical feature space in realistic physics data sets.

TI The Quantum Condition Space
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB The fundamental properties of quantum physics are exploited to evaluate event probabilities with projection measurements. Next, to study what events can be specified by quantum methods, the concept of the condition space is introduced, which is found to be the dual space of the classical outcome space of bit strings. Like the classical outcome space generates the quantum state space, the condition space generates the quantum condition space being the central idea of this work. The quantum condition space permits the existence of entangled conditions having no classical equivalent. In addition, the quantum condition space is related to the quantum state space by a Fourier transform guaranteed by the Pontryagin duality, and therefore an entropic uncertainty principle can be defined. The quantum condition space offers a novel perspective of understanding quantum states with the duality picture. Furthermore, the quantum conditions have physical meanings and realizations of their own and thus may be studied for purposes beyond the original motivation of characterizing events for probability evaluation. Finally, the relation between the condition space and quantum circuits provides insights into how quantum states are collectively modified by quantum gates, which may lead to deeper understanding of the complexity of quantum circuits.

They claimed that the proposed protocol can help all the involved participants have equal influence on the final shared key. However, this study points out a loophole that makes Li et al.'s protocol suffer from a collusion attack, i.e. several dishonest participants can conspire to manipulate the final shared key without being detected by others. To avoid this loophole, an improvement is proposed here.

TI Enhancing Cannabis Extraction Efficiency and Sustainability through
   Quantum Computing: (A-Review)
SO ORIENTAL JOURNAL OF CHEMISTRY
AB The plant is also known as hemp, although this term is often used only to refer to varieties of Cannabis cultivated for non-drug use. Cannabis has long been used as hemp fiber, hemp seeds and their oil, hemp leaves as vegetable and juice, for medicinal purposes and as a recreational drug. It has been widely used specifically in incense, peaceful sleep for cancer affected patients and traditional medicine. Its common uses include treating knee joint pain, inflammatory-related complaints, diarrhea, and a tonic, sedative, and cardio caring agent. Cannabis sativa is the hemp plant from which marijuana and cannabinoids (leaves, stems, seeds) are derived. The most potent form of this plant's extracts is hash oil, a liquid. Quantum computing, on the other hand, offers unprecedented computational power and can revolutionize various scientific fields. The study's goal is to explore the potential of quantum computing to enhance the extraction process. By employing quantum algorithms, the project aims to optimize critical parameters such as pressure, temperature, and extraction time, leading to improved efficiency and higher yields. Quantum simulations will model the behavior of CO2 as a supercritical fluid within the cannabis matrix, supplying insights into the complex dynamics of the extraction process. Finally, the use of quantum algorithms promises to ease the development of more efficient and sustainable extraction methods, resulting in the production of high-quality Cannabis-derived products with enhanced medicinal and industrial applications.

AB Hybrid matter-photon entanglement is the building block for quantum networks. It is very favorable if the entanglement can be prepared with a high probability. In this Letter, we report the deterministic creation of entanglement between an atomic ensemble and a single photon by harnessing the Rydberg blockade. We design a scheme that creates entanglement between a single photon's temporal modes and the Rydberg levels that host a collective excitation, using a process of cyclical retrieving and patching. The hybrid entanglement is tested via retrieving the atomic excitation as a second photon and performing correlation measurements, which suggest an entanglement fidelity of 87.8%. Our source of matter-photon entanglement will enable the entangling of remote quantum memories with much higher efficiency.

However, finding biomarkers that provide very early indicators of a change in health status, for example, for multifactorial diseases, has been challenging. The discovery of such biomarkers stands to benefit significantly from advanced information processing and means to detect complex correlations, which quantum computing offers. In this perspective, quantum algorithms, particularly in machine learning, are mapped to key applications in biomarker discovery. The opportunities and challenges associated with the algorithms and applications are discussed. The analysis is structured according to different data types-multidimensional, time series, and erroneous data-and covers key data modalities in healthcare-electronic health records, omics, and medical images.

SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Over the last few decades, technology has been improving dramatically and consequently transformed the standard of living and socio-economic conditions. The entire process will revolutionize when the next advanced technologies will be fully functional. Advanced technologies like the metaverse, Web 3.0, and others necessitate high computing power, invincible security, and ultra-fast internet. Despite increasing demand, traditional computing methods have limitations and are not capable of satisfying the requirements. To solve these tribulations, quantum computing is shining a light of hope. This survey aims to analyze the methodology, constraints, and potential of integrating quantum computing with the metaverse. We begin with an overview of quantum computing and related terms. We then investigate the feasibility of applying quantum-enabled technologies to enhance the metaverse. Furthermore, this survey also considers middleware for seamless conversion between traditional and quantum computing with the metaverse. In the subsequent phase of this survey, our objective is to discern and delineate the prospective application domains for the quantum-enabled metaverse. In essence, the difficulties of integrating quantum computing with the metaverse, present research approaches, and open research issues with consequences for additional in-depth investigations are highlighted.

TI Why adiabatic quantum annealing is unlikely to yield speed-up
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS A-MATHEMATICAL AND THEORETICAL
AB We study quantum annealing for combinatorial optimization with Hamiltonian H=H0+zHf where Hf is diagonal, H0=-|phi⟩⟨phi| is the equal superposition state projector and z the annealing parameter. We analytically compute the minimal spectral gap, which is O1/N with N the total number of states, and its location z* . We show that quantum speed-up requires an annealing schedule which demands a precise knowledge of z* , which can be computed only if the density of states of the optimization problem is known. However, in general the density of states is intractable to compute, making quadratic speed-up unfeasible for any practical combinatorial optimization problems. We conjecture that it is likely that this negative result also applies for any other instance independent transverse Hamiltonians such as H0=- n-ary sumation i=1n sigma ix .

AB In a recent paper, Hu et al. defined the complete weight distributions of quantum codes and proved the MacWilliams identities, and as applications they showed how such weight distributions may be used to obtain the singleton-type and hamming-type bounds for asymmetric quantum codes. In this paper we extend their study much further and obtain several new results concerning the complete weight distributions of quantum codes and applications. In particular, we provide a new proof of the MacWilliams identities of the complete weight distributions of quantum codes. We obtain new information about the weight distributions of quantum MDS codes and the double weight distribution of asymmetric quantum MDS codes. We get new identities involving the complete weight distributions of two different quantum codes. We estimate the complete weight distributions of quantum codes under special conditions and show that quantum BCH codes by the Hermitian construction from primitive, narrow-sense BCH codes satisfy these conditions and hence these estimate applies.

TI Harnessing many-body spin environment for long coherence storage and
   high-fidelity single-shot qubit readout
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Hybrid quantum devices based on coupled nuclear and electron spins offer promising applications, but require long nuclear spin coherence times. Here the authors demonstrate millisecond coherence times for a nuclear spin ensemble coupled to a single electron spin qubit in a semiconductor quantum dot.
   There is a growing interest in hybrid solid-state quantum systems where nuclear spins, interfaced to the electron spin qubit, are used as quantum memory or qubit register. These approaches require long nuclear spin coherence, which until now seemed impossible owing to the disruptive effect of the electron spin. Here we study InGaAs semiconductor quantum dots, demonstrating millisecond-long collective nuclear spin coherence even under inhomogeneous coupling to the electron central spin. We show that the underlying decoherence mechanism is spectral diffusion induced by a fluctuating electron spin. These results provide new understanding of the many-body coherence in central spin systems, required for development of electron-nuclear spin qubits. As a demonstration, we implement a conditional gate that encodes electron spin state onto collective nuclear spin coherence, and use it for a single-shot readout of the electron spin qubit with >99% fidelity.

TI Solving quantum circuit compilation problem variants through genetic
   algorithms
SO NATURAL COMPUTING
AB The gate-based model is one of the leading quantum computing paradigms for representing quantum circuits. Within this paradigm, a quantum algorithm is expressed in terms of a set of quantum gates that are executed on the quantum hardware over time, subject to a number of constraints whose satisfaction must be guaranteed before running the circuit, to allow for feasible execution. The need to guarantee the previous feasibility condition gives rise to the Quantum Circuit Compilation Problem (QCCP). The QCCP has been demonstrated to be NP-Complete, and can be considered as a Planning and Scheduling problem. In this paper, we consider quantum compilation instances deriving from the general Quantum Approximation Optimization Algorithm (QAOA), applied to the MaxCut problem, devised to be executed on Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ) hardware architectures. More specifically, in addition to the basic QCCP version, we also tackle other variants of the same problem such as the QCCP-X (QCCP with crosstalk constraints), the QCCP-V (QCCP with variable qubit state initialization), as well as the QCCP-VX that includes both previous variants. All problem variants are solved using genetic algorithms. We perform an experimental study across a conventional set of instances taken from the literature, and show that the proposed genetic algorithm, termed GAVX, outperforms previous approaches in the literature.

TI Quantum sensing of intermittent stochastic signals
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Realistic quantum sensors face a trade-off between the number of sensors measured in parallel and the control and readout fidelity (F) across the ensemble. We investigate how the number of sensors and fidelity affect sensitivity to continuous and intermittent signals. For continuous signals, we find that increasing the number of sensors by 1/F-2 for F < 1 always recovers the sensitivity achieved when F = 1. However, when the signal is intermittent, more sensors are needed to recover the sensitivity achievable with one perfect quantum sensor. We also demonstrate the importance of near-unity control fidelity and readout at the quantum projection noise limit by estimating the frequency components of a stochastic, intermittent signal with a single trapped ion sensor. Quantum sensing has historically focused on large ensembles of sensors operated far from the standard quantum limit. The results presented in this paper show that this is insufficient for quantum sensing of intermittent signals and reemphasizes the importance of the unique scaling of quantum projection noise near an eigenstate.

TI Measurement-based quantum computation utilizing the graph states of
   Bose-Einstein condensates and continuous variables
SO PHYSICA SCRIPTA
AB Measurement-based quantum computation (MBQC) is a protocol for quantum computation that represents a model distinct from the circuit-based approach. MBQC has been proposed not only for qubits but also for qudits, continuous-variable (CV) qubits, and Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) qubits. In qubit-based MBQC, arbitrary rotations on the Bloch sphere can be performed by measuring a graph state. This naturally raises the question of whether arbitrary rotations on the Bloch sphere can similarly be achieved through measurements in other types of quantum bits. We have demonstrated that this can indeed be realized for BECs qubits by considering composite graph states involving CV qubits and BECs qubits.

TI Engineering entangled coherent states of magnons and phonons via a
   transmon qubit
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB We propose a scheme for generating and controlling entangled coherent states (ECSs) of magnons, i.e., the quanta of the collective spin excitations in magnetic systems, or phonons in mechanical resonators. The proposed hybrid circuit architecture comprises a superconducting transmon qubit coupled to a pair of magnonic yttrium iron garnet spherical resonators or mechanical beam resonators via flux-mediated interactions. Specifically, the coupling results from the magnetic/mechanical quantum fluctuations modulating the qubit inductor, formed by a superconducting quantum interference device. We show that the resulting radiation-pressure interaction of the qubit with each mode can be employed to generate maximally entangled states of magnons or phonons. In addition, we numerically demonstrate a protocol for the preparation of magnonic and mechanical Bell states with high fidelity including realistic dissipation mechanisms. Furthermore, we have devised a scheme for reading out the prepared states using standard qubit control and resonator field displacements. In this paper, we demonstrate an alternative platform for quantum information using ECSs in hybrid magnonic and mechanical quantum networks.

TI Random Quantum Circuits Anticoncentrate in Log Depth
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB We consider quantum circuits consisting of randomly chosen two-local gates and study the number of gates needed for the distribution over measurement outcomes for typical circuit instances to be anticoncentrated, roughly meaning that the probability mass is not too concentrated on a small number of measurement outcomes. An understanding of the conditions for anticoncentration is important for determining which quantum circuits are difficult to simulate classically, as anticoncentration has been in some cases an ingredient of mathematical arguments that simulation is hard and in other cases a necessary condition for easy simulation. Our definition of anticoncentration is that the expected collision probability of the distribution-that is, the probability that two independently drawn outcomes will agree is only a constant factor larger than the collision probability for the uniform distribution. We show that when the two-local gates are each drawn from the Haar measure (or any 2-design), at least Omega(n log (n)) gates (and thus Omega (log(n)) circuit depth) are needed for this condition to be met on an n-qudit circuit. In both the case where the gates are nearest neighbor on a one-dimensional ring and the case where gates are long range, we show that O(n log(n)) gates are also sufficient and we precisely compute the optimal constant prefactor for the n log(n). The technique we employ relies upon a mapping from the expected collision probability to the partition function of an Ising-like classical statistical-mechanical model, which we manage to bound using stochastic and combinatorial techniques.

TI Entanglement entropy scaling of noisy random quantum circuits in two
   dimensions
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Whether noisy quantum devices without error correction can provide quantum advantage over classical computers is a critical issue of current quantum computation. In this work, the random quantum circuits, which are used as the paradigm model to demonstrate quantum advantage, are simulated with depolarizing noise on experiment-relevant two-dimensional architecture. With comprehensive numerical simulation and theoretical analysis, we find that the maximum achievable operator entanglement entropy, which indicates maximal simula-tion cost, has area law scaling with the system size for constant noise rate. On the other hand, we also find that the maximum achievable operator entanglement entropy has power-law scaling with the noise rate for fixed system size, and the volume law scaling can be obtained only if the noise rate decreases when system size increase.

TI Synergic quantum generative machine learning
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB We introduce a new approach towards generative quantum machine learning significantly reducing the number of hyperparameters and report on a proof-of-principle experiment demonstrating our approach. Our proposal depends on collaboration between the generators and discriminator, thus, we call it quantum synergic generative learning. We present numerical evidence that the synergic approach, in some cases, compares favorably to recently proposed quantum generative adversarial learning. In addition to the results obtained with quantum simulators, we also present experimental results obtained with an actual programmable quantum computer. We investigate how a quantum computer implementing generative learning algorithm could learn the concept of a maximally-entangled state. After completing the learning process, the network is able both to recognize and to generate an entangled state. Our approach can be treated as one possible preliminary step to understanding how the concept of quantum entanglement can be learned and demonstrated by a quantum computer.

SO MATHEMATICS
AB In this paper, we use a simplified quantum counter to implement Grover's algorithm-based quantum circuits to tackle the NP-hard exact cover problem (ECP). The ECP seeks a subcollection of sets such that every element is covered by exactly one set. Leveraging Grover's algorithm, our quantum circuits achieve a quadratic speedup, querying the oracle O(N) times, compared to O(N) for classical methods, where N=2n is the total number of unstructured input instances and n is the number of input (quantum) bits. For the whole quantum circuit, the simplified quantum counter saves (4mb-4m)& LeftFloor;pi/4N/M & RightFloor; quantum gates and reduces the quantum circuit depth by (2mb)& LeftFloor;pi/4N/M & RightFloor; compared to Heidari et al.'s design, where b=& LeftFloor;logn & RightFloor;+1 is the number of counting qubits used in a counter. Experimental results obtained using IBM Qiskit packages confirm the effectiveness of our quantum circuits.

IBM Quantum has led significant advancements in both hardware and software, providing access to quantum hardware via IBM Cloud (R) since 2016 and achieving a milestone with the world's first accessible quantum computer. This paper explores IBM's journey in quantum computing, focusing on its contributions to both hardware and software, as well as the development of practical quantum computers. We trace the evolution of IBM Quantum's processors, from the early canary processors to the milestone of surpassing the 1000-qubit barrier. In addition to these technological strides, we delve into the practical applications of quantum computing, particularly within nine key industries: airlines, banking, healthcare, electronics, life sciences, and more. We also explore IBM Quantum's case studies and strategic partnerships with organizations such as Boeing, CERN, ExxonMobil, and Cleveland Clinic, which are helping to bridge the gap between theoretical research and real-world applications. Further, we examine the key challenges and solutions in scaling quantum systems and achieving fault tolerance, highlighting IBM's efforts toward building practical, fault-tolerant quantum systems capable of addressing real-world problems.

TI A new quantum key distribution protocol to reduce afterpulse and dark
   counts effects
SO RESULTS IN OPTICS
AB The most important goal of quantum communication is to distribute the encryption key between the transmitter and the receiver. The optimal situation in Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) between transmitter and receiver is to increase the key distribution rate per second, increase the transmission distance, and reduce the error in key distribution. Several protocols used for QKD. The most important of QKD protocols is the BB84. One of the challenges leading to errors in quantum protocols is generating error pulses in single-photon detectors. These pulses caused by the inherent effects of quantum devices. They can cause wrong detection in the receiver. Many measures have been taken in the design and construction of single-photon detectors to reduce this error pulses, but it is not possible to eliminate all of them. Afterpulse and dark counts are two types of unwanted pulses that occur with single-photon detectors. In this paper, a new QKD protocol is proposed. It is an upgrade of the BB84 protocol and can reduce the effects of unwanted pulses such as afterpulse and dark counts in QKD avalanche detectors.

TI Criticality-Enhanced Quantum Sensing with a Parametric Superconducting
   Resonator
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Quantum metrology, a cornerstone of quantum technologies, exploits entanglement and superposition to achieve higher precision than classical protocols in parameter-estimation tasks. When combined with critical phenomena such as phase transitions, the divergence of quantum fluctuations is predicted to enhance the performance of quantum sensors. Here, we implement a critical quantum sensor using a superconducting parametric (i.e., two-photon driven) Kerr resonator. The sensor, a linear resonator terminated by a superconducting quantum interference device, operates near the critical point of a finite-component second-order dissipative phase transition obtained by scaling the system parameters. We analyze the performance of a frequency-estimation protocol and show that quadratic precision scaling with respect to the system size can be achieved with finite values of the Kerr nonlinearity. Since each photon emitted from the cavity carries more information about the parameter to be estimated compared to its classical counterpart, our protocol opens up perspectives for faster or more precise metrological protocols. Our results demonstrate that quantum advantage in a sensing protocol can be achieved by exploiting afinite-component phase transition.

Furthermore, we describe the procedure through which a typical resource assignment problem, which has NP-hard complexity, can be transformed into a formulation that can be tackled by QAOA, a renowned hybrid quantum algorithm, and we present some preliminary results obtained for a simple instance, a knapsack problem where an Edge node needs to select and retrieve a set of processes from the Cloud.

TI Analyzing the effectiveness of quantum annealing with meta-learning
SO QUANTUM MACHINE INTELLIGENCE
AB The field of Quantum Computing has gathered significant popularity in recent years and a large number of papers have studied its effectiveness in tackling many tasks. We focus in particular on Quantum Annealing (QA), a meta-heuristic solver for Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problems. It is known that the effectiveness of QA is dependent on the task itself, as is the case for classical solvers, but there is not yet a clear understanding of which are the characteristics of a problem that make it difficult to solve with QA. In this work, we propose a new methodology to study the effectiveness of QA based on meta-learning models. To do so, we first build a dataset composed of more than five thousand instances of ten different optimization problems. We define a set of more than a hundred features to describe their characteristics and solve them with both QA and three classical solvers. We publish this dataset online for future research. Then, we train multiple meta-models to predict whether QA would solve that instance effectively and use them to probe which features with the strongest impact on the effectiveness of QA. Our results indicate that it is possible to accurately predict the effectiveness of QA, validating our methodology. Furthermore, we observe that the distribution of the problem coefficients representing the bias and coupling terms is very informative in identifying the probability of finding good solutions, while the density of these coefficients alone is not enough. The methodology we propose allows to open new research directions to further our understanding of the effectiveness of QA, by probing specific dimensions or by developing new QUBO formulations that are better suited for the particular nature of QA. Furthermore, the proposed methodology is flexible and can be extended or used to study other quantum or classical solvers.

TI Can shallow quantum circuits scramble local noise into global white
   noise?
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS A-MATHEMATICAL AND THEORETICAL
AB Shallow quantum circuits are believed to be the most promising candidates for achieving early practical quantum advantage-this has motivated the development of a broad range of error mitigation techniques whose performance generally improves when the quantum state is well approximated by a global depolarising (white) noise model. While it has been crucial for demonstrating quantum supremacy that random circuits scramble local noise into global white noise-a property that has been proved rigorously-we investigate to what degree practical shallow quantum circuits scramble local noise into global white noise. We define two key metrics as (a) density matrix eigenvalue uniformity and (b) commutator norm that quantifies stability of the dominant eigenvector. While the former determines the distance from white noise, the latter determines the performance of purification based error mitigation. We derive analytical approximate bounds on their scaling and find in most cases they nicely match numerical results. On the other hand, we simulate a broad class of practical quantum circuits and find that white noise is in certain cases a bad approximation posing significant limitations on the performance of some of the simpler error mitigation schemes. On a positive note, we find in all cases that the commutator norm is sufficiently small guaranteeing a very good performance of purification-based error mitigation. Lastly, we identify techniques that may decrease both metrics, such as increasing the dimensionality of the dynamical Lie algebra by gate insertions or randomised compiling.

TI Robust Quantum State Tomography Method for Quantum Sensing
SO SENSORS
AB Reliable and efficient reconstruction of pure quantum states under the processing of noisy measurement data is a vital tool in fundamental and applied quantum information sciences owing to communication, sensing, and computing. Specifically, the purity of such reconstructed quantum systems is crucial in surpassing the classical shot-noise limit and achieving the Heisenberg limit, regarding the achievable precision in quantum sensing. However, the noisy reconstruction of such resourceful sensing probes limits the quantum advantage in precise quantum sensing. For this, we formulate a pure quantum state reconstruction method through eigenvalue decomposition. We show that the proposed method is robust against the depolarizing noise; it remains unaffected under high strength white noise and achieves quantum state reconstruction accuracy similar to the noiseless case.

TI Benchmarking regularisation methods for quantum process tomography on
   NISQ devices
SO EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL-SPECIAL TOPICS
AB Quantum process tomography (QPT) is a crucial tool for characterizing and validating quantum devices and quantum algorithms. However, the problem of finite sampling leads to an estimated process matrix which is non-positive semi-definite (non-PSD), which can yield a reconstructed quantum channel that is non-physical. To address this problem, various methods have been proposed to correct the issue of finite sampling in the estimation of the process matrix. In this work, we perform a comparison of regularisation methods that will be used to tackle the problem of finite sampling in QPT. For this comparison we simulate some common single qubit quantum channels. We use two metrics, the minimum eigenvalue of the Choi matrix and the fidelity, to compare the effectiveness of these methods. Our results show that the spectral transformations perform the best overall in dealing with finite sampling present in reconstructing the quantum channel in the NISQ era.

TI A 1-GS/s 6-8-b Cryo-CMOS SAR ADC for Quantum Computing
SO IEEE JOURNAL OF SOLID-STATE CIRCUITS
AB This article presents a two-times interleaved, loop-unrolled SAR analog-to-digital converter (ADC) operational from 300 down to 4.2 K. The 6-8-bit resolution and the sampling speed up to 1 GS/s are targeted at digitizing the multi-channel frequency-multiplexed input in a spin-qubit reflectometry readout for quantum computing. To optimize the circuit for the altered device behavior at cryogenic temperatures, a modified common-mode switching scheme is adopted as well as a flexible calibration. The design is implemented in 40-nm CMOS technology and achieves 36.2-dB signal to noise and distortion ratio (SNDR) for Nyquist input at 4.2 K while maintaining a Walden figure of merit (FOMW) of 200 pJ/conv-step (for a 10.8-mW power consumption), including the clock receiver, and 15 pJ/conv-step (for a 0.8-mW power consumption) for just the core ADC. With these specifications, the ADC can support the simultaneous readout of 20 qubit channels with a power consumption of 0.5 mW/qubit, thus advancing toward the full integration of the cryogenic readout for future large-scale quantum processors.

TI Quantum Lego: Building Quantum Error Correction Codes from Tensor
   Networks
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB We introduce a flexible and graphically intuitive framework that constructs complex quantum error correction codes from simple codes or states, generalizing code concatenation. More specifically, we represent the complex code constructions as tensor networks built from the tensors of simple codes or states in a modular fashion. Using a set of local moves known as operator pushing, one can derive properties of the more complex codes, such as transversal non-Clifford gates, by tracing the flow of operators in the network. The framework endows a network geometry to any code it builds and is valid for constructing stabilizer codes as well as nonstabilizer codes over qubits and qudits. For a contractible tensor network, the sequence of contractions also constructs a decoding or encoding circuit. To highlight the framework's range of capabilities and to provide a tutorial, we lay out some examples where we glue together simple stabilizer codes to construct nontrivial codes. These examples include the toric code and its variants, a holographic code with transversal non-Clifford operators, a three-dimensional stabilizer code, and other stabilizer codes with interesting properties. Surprisingly, we find that the surface code is equivalent to the two-dimensional Bacon-Shor code after "dualizing" its tensor-network encoding map.

AB Masking is a well-known and provably secure countermeasure against side-channel attacks. However, due to additional redundant computations, integrating masking schemes is expensive in terms of performance. The performance overhead of integrating masking countermeasures is heavily influenced by the design choices of a cryptographic algorithm and is often not considered during the design phase.
   In this work, we deliberate on the effect of design choices on integrating masking techniques into lattice-based cryptography. We select Scabbard, a suite of three lattice-based post-quantum key-encapsulation mechanisms (KEM), namely Florete, Espada, and Sable. We provide arbitrary-order masked implementations of all the constituent KEMs of the Scabbard suite by exploiting their specific design elements. We show that the masked implementations of Florete, Espada, and Sable outperform the masked implementations of Kyber in terms of speed for any order masking. Masked Florete exhibits a 73%, 71%, and 70% performance improvement over masked Kyber corresponding to the first-, second-, and third-order. Similarly, Espada exhibits 56%, 59%, and 60% and Sable exhibits 75%, 74%, and 73% enhanced performance for first-, second-, and third-order masking compared to Kyber respectively. Our results show that the design decisions have a significant impact on the efficiency of integrating masking countermeasures into lattice-based cryptography.

TI Optimal quantum channels
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB A method to optimize the cost of a quantum channel is developed. The goal is to determine the cheapest channel that produces prescribed output states for a given set of input states. This is essentially a quantum version of optimal transport. To attach a clear conceptual meaning to the cost, channels are viewed in terms of what we call elementary transitions, which are analogous to point-to-point transitions between classical systems. The role of entanglement in optimization of cost is emphasized. We also show how our approach can be applied to theoretically search for channels performing a prescribed set of tasks on the states of a system, while otherwise disturbing the state as little as possible.

TI Machine Learning of Noise-Resilient Quantum Circuits
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Noise mitigation and reduction will be crucial for obtaining useful answers from near-term quantum computers. In this work, we present a general framework based on machine learning for reducing the impact of quantum hardware noise on quantum circuits. Our method, called noise-aware circuit learning (NACL), applies to circuits designed to compute a unitary transformation, prepare a set of quantum states, or estimate an observable of a many-qubit state. Given a task and a device model that captures information about the noise and connectivity of qubits in a device, NACL outputs an optimized circuit to accomplish this task in the presence of noise. It does so by minimizing a task-specific cost function over circuit depths and circuit structures. To demonstrate NACL, we construct circuits resilient to a fine-grained noise model derived from gate set tomography on a superconducting-circuit quantum device, for applications including quantum state overlap, quantum Fourier transform, and W-state preparation.

SO MAGNETIC RESONANCE IN SOLIDS
AB We present the results of the quantum calculation of the ground state energies and magnetic g-factors of two rare earth (RE) ions: Yb3+ in Y2Ti2O7 crystal and Er3+ in YPO4 crystal. The Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) algorithm has been performed on 5-qubit IBM super-conducting quantum computers via IBM Quantum Experience cloud access. The Hamiltonian of the lowest spectroscopic multiplet of each RE ion, containing crystal field and Zeeman inter-action, has been projected onto the collective states of three (Yb3+) and four (Er3+) coupled transmon qubits. The lowest-energy states of RE ions have been found by minimizing the mean energy in similar to 250 - 350 iterations of the algorithm: the first part was performed on a quantum simulator, and the last 25 iterations were conducted on the real quantum computing hardware. All the calculated ground-state energies and magnetic g-factors agree well with their exact val-ues, while the estimated error of 2 divided by 15% is mostly attributed to the decoherence associated with the two-qubit operations.

AB Deep Learning approaches have become pervasive in recent years due to their ability to solve complex tasks. However, these models need huge datasets for proper training and good generalization. This translates into high training and fine-tuning time, even several days for the most complex models and large datasets. In this work, we present a novel quantum Instance Selection (IS) approach that allows to significantly reduce the size of the training datasets (by up to 28%) while maintaining the model's effectiveness, thus promoting (training) speedups and scalability. Our solution is innovative in the sense that it exploits a different computing paradigm - Quantum Annealing (QA) - a specific Quantum Computing paradigm that can be used to tackle optimization problems. To the best of our knowledge, there have been no prior attempts to tackle the IS problem using QA. Furthermore, we propose a new Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization formulation specific for the IS problem, which is a contribution in itself. Through an extensive set of experiments with several Text Classification benchmarks, we empirically demonstrate our quantum solution's feasibility and competitiveness with the current state-of-the-art IS solutions.

TI (3+1)-dimensional Schwinger pair production with quantum computers
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
AB Real-time quantum simulation of quantum field theory in (3 + 1)D requires large quantum computing resources. With a few-qubit quantum computer, we develop a novel algorithm and experimentally study the Schwinger effect, the electron-positron pair production in a strong electric field, in (3 + 1)D. The resource reduction is achieved by treating the electric field as a background field, working in Fourier space transverse to the electric field direction, and considering parity symmetry, such that we successfully map the three spatial dimension problems into one spatial dimension problems. We observe that the rate of pair production of electrons and positrons is consistent with the theoretical predication of the Schwinger effect. Our work paves the way towards exploring quantum simulation of quantum field theory beyond one spatial dimension.

AB The negatively charged nitrogen vacancy (NV) color center in diamond is a type of point defect, which is extensively studied as a promising high-sensitivity solid-state magnetic field sensor. However, its transition from research to application is still limited due to the technical challenges of an integrated physical package. Here, an integrated diamond sensor is demonstrated with the essential component on the order of mm3, which is realized by a standard microfabrication process. A microfabrication-compatible light guiding structure is constructed, providing photon detection efficiency of 66% and thus enabling a magnetic field detection sensitivity reaching 203 pT & BULL;Hz1/2. Incorporation of the sensor device with a magnetic yoke enables high-precision wide-range direct-current sensing with current isolation. A current measuring range of 0-400 A with a minimum detection limit of 2 mA is achieved. By utilizing dual spin resonance modulation, the temperature drift is suppressed from 219 to 1.92 ppm & BULL;& DEG;C-1. This configuration provides new possibilities as a robust and scalable platform for current quantum sensing technologies.
   The development of current sensors has gained momentum due to strong demand in many industrial applications. Using diamond nitrogen vacancy (NV) centers and wafer-level microfabrication processes, a portable current sensor with a compact architecture is developed. This opens new possibilities for current quantum sensing technologies, providing a robust and scalable platform for practical use.image

TI Interaction graph-based characterization of quantum benchmarks for

SO QUANTUM MACHINE INTELLIGENCE
AB To execute quantum circuits on a quantum processor, they must be modified to meet the physical constraints of the quantum device. This process, called quantum circuit mapping, results in a gate/circuit depth overhead that depends on both the circuit properties and the hardware constraints, being the limited qubit connectivity a crucial restriction. In this paper, we propose to extend the characterization of quantum circuits by including qubit interaction graph properties using graph theory-based metrics in addition to previously used circuit-describing parameters. This approach allows for an in-depth analysis and clustering of quantum circuits and a comparison of performance when run on different quantum processors, aiding in developing better mapping techniques. Our study reveals a correlation between interaction graph-based parameters and mapping performance metrics for various existing configurations of quantum devices. We also provide a comprehensive collection of quantum circuits and algorithms for benchmarking future compilation techniques and quantum devices.

AB Interfacing semiconductor with photonic qubits plays an important role in quantum networks. We model a photon to spin qubit interface based on an optically active gate-defined quantum dot embedded in a two-dimensional photonic crystal cavity constraining its emission profile with a low enough quality factor for emission wavelength tuning. By matching the cavity-mode k-vector and reciprocal lattice of the crystal, vertical emission is obtained. A reflector below the cavity increases not only the light extraction efficiency, but also tailors the extracted beam profile to match that of a single mode fiber, into which photons emitted by the quantum dot are coupled with a probability above 50%. The efficiency is primarily limited by metal electrode absorption. In addition to trapping the exciton, the electrode system embedded inside the cavity allows trapping, manipulation and readout of a pair of electrons encoding a spin qubit in a singlet-triplet configuration, whose quantum state can be transferred to and from the exciton by utilizing an existing protocol. Experimental realization of these devices is currently in progress with first results in regard to fabrication also reported.

TI Fault-Tolerant Quantum Algorithm for Symmetry-Adapted Perturbation
   Theory
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB The efficient computation of observables beyond the total energy is a key challenge and opportunity for fault-tolerant quantum computing approaches in quantum chemistry. Here, we consider the symmetryadapted perturbation-theory (SAPT) components of the interaction energy as a prototypical example of such an observable. We provide a guide for calculating this observable on a fault-tolerant quantum computer while optimizing the required computational resources. Specifically, we present a quantum algorithm that estimates interaction energies at the first-order SAPT level with a Heisenberg-limited scaling. To this end, we exploit a high-order tensor-factorization and block-encoding technique that efficiently represents each SAPT observable. To quantify the computational cost of our methodology, we provide resource estimates in terms of the required number of logical qubits and Toffoli gates to execute our algorithm for a range of benchmark molecules, also taking into account the cost of the eigenstate preparation and the cost of block encoding the SAPT observables. Finally, we perform the resource estimation for a heme and artemisinin complex as a representative large-scale system encountered in drug design, highlighting the performance of our algorithm in this new benchmark study and discussing possible bottlenecks that may be improved in future work.

TI Fundamental causal bounds of quantum random access memories
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Our study evaluates the limitations and potentials of Quantum Random Access Memory (QRAM) within the principles of quantum physics and relativity. QRAM is crucial for advancing quantum algorithms in fields like linear algebra and machine learning, purported to efficiently manage large data sets with O(log N) circuit depth. However, its scalability is questioned when considering the relativistic constraints on qubits interacting locally. Utilizing relativistic quantum field theory and Lieb-Robinson bounds, we delve into the causality-based limits of QRAM. Our investigation introduces a feasible QRAM model in hybrid quantum acoustic systems, capable of supporting a significant number of logical qubits across different dimensions-up to similar to 10(7) in 1D, similar to 10(15) to similar to 10(20) in 2D, and similar to 10(24) in 3D, within practical operation parameters. This analysis suggests that relativistic causality principles could universally influence quantum computing hardware, underscoring the need for innovative quantum memory solutions to navigate these foundational barriers, thereby enhancing future quantum computing endeavors in data science.

TI Enhancement of quantum sensing by noncanonical effects
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Equilibrium probes have been widely used in various schemes of sensing to quantum reservoirs. Many previous studies assumed that the probe-reservoir coupling is sufficiently weak such that the equilibrium state of the probe is approximately described by a canonical Gibbs state at the same temperature of the reservoir. Such a weak-coupling approximation severely restricts the range of application for an equilibrium-probe-based quantum sensing scenario. Going beyond the weak-coupling limitation, we here investigate the noncanonical effect, which is naturally induced by strong couplings, on the performance of a quantum sensing scheme. In this scheme, a quantum two-level system is used as the probe to estimate the parameters of a dissipative bosonic reservoir, by employing the polaron transformation approach. It is found that, compared with that of the canonical-equilibrium-state case, the noncanonical effect can effectively boost the sensing precision at both zero and finite temperatures. Paving the way toward realizing high-precision quantum sensing in practice, our result reveals the positive role of noncanonicality in the studies of quantum technologies.

TI Quantum key distribution implemented with d-level time-bin
   entangled photons
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB High-dimensional photon states (qudits) are pivotal to enhance the information capacity, noise robustness, and data rates of quantum communications. Time-bin entangled qudits are promising candidates for implementing high-dimensional quantum communications over optical fiber networks with processing rates approaching those of classical telecommunications. However, their use is hindered by phase instability, timing inaccuracy, and low scalability of interferometric schemes needed for time-bin processing. As well, increasing the number of time bins per photon state typically requires decreasing the repetition rate of the system, affecting in turn the effective qudit rates. Here, we demonstrate a fiber-pigtailed, integrated photonic platform enabling the generation and processing of picosecond-spaced time-bin entangled qudits in the telecommunication C band via an on-chip interferometry system. We experimentally demonstrate the Bennett-Brassard-Mermin 1992 quantum key distribution protocol with time-bin entangled qudits and extend it over a 60 km-long optical fiber link, by showing dimensionality scaling without sacrificing the repetition rate. Our approach enables the manipulation of time-bin entangled qudits at processing speeds typical of standard telecommunications (10 s of GHz) with high quantum information capacity per single frequency channel, representing an important step towards an efficient implementation of high-data rate quantum communications in standard, multi-user optical fiber networks.

TI Speed limits for two-qubit gates with weakly anharmonic qubits
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We consider the implementation of two-qubit gates when the physical systems used to realize the qubits possess additional quantum states in the accessible energy range. We use optimal control theory to determine the maximum achievable gate speed for two-qubit gates in the qubit subspace of the many-level Hilbert space, and we analyze the effect of the additional quantum states on the gate speed. We identify two competing mechanisms. On one hand, higher energy levels are generally more strongly coupled to each other. Under suitable conditions, this stronger coupling can be utilized to make two-qubit gates significantly faster than the reference value based on simple qubits. On the other hand, a weak anharmonicity constrains the speed at which the system can be adequately controlled: according to the intuitive picture, faster operations require stronger control fields, which are more likely to excite higher levels in a weakly anharmonic system, which in turn leads to faster decoherence and uncontrolled leakage outside the qubit space. To account for this constraint, we modify the pulse optimization algorithm to avoid pulses that lead to appreciable population of the higher levels. In this case, we find that the presence of the higher levels can lead to a significant reduction in the maximum achievable gate speed. We also compare the optimal-control gate speeds with those obtained using the cross-resonance or selectivedarkening gate protocol. We find that this protocol, with some parameter optimization, can be used to achieve a relatively fast implementation of the controlled-NOT gate. These results can help the search for optimized gate implementations in realistic quantum computing architectures, such as those based on superconducting circuits. They also provide guidelines for desirable conditions on anharmonicity that would allow optimal utilization of the higher levels to achieve fast quantum gates.

TI Environmental impact assessment of ocean energy converters using quantum
   machine learning
SO JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
AB The depletion of fossil energy reserves and the environmental pollution caused by these sources highlight the need to harness renewable energy sources from the oceans, such as waves and tides, due to their high potential. On the other hand, the large-scale deployment of ocean energy converters to meet future energy needs requires the use of large farms of these converters, which may have negative environmental impacts on the ocean ecosystem. In the meantime, a very important point is the volume of data produced by different methods of collecting data from the ocean for their analysis, which makes the use of advanced tools such as different machine learning algorithms even more colorful. In this article, some environmental impacts of ocean energy devices have been analyzed using machine learning and quantum machine learning. The results show that quantum machine learning performs better than its classical counterpart in terms of calculation accuracy. This approach offers a promising new method for environmental impact assessment, especially in a complex environment such as the ocean.

TI Improving Urban Traffic Mobility via a Versatile Quantum Annealing Model
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM ENGINEERING
AB The growth of cities and the resulting increase in vehicular traffic pose significant challenges to the environment and citizens' quality of life. To address these challenges, a new algorithm has been proposed that leverages the quantum annealing paradigm and D-wave's machines to optimize the control of traffic lights in cities. The algorithm considers traffic information collected from a wide urban road network to define activation patterns that holistically reduce congestion. An in-depth analysis of the model's behavior has been conducted by varying its main parameters. Robustness tests have been performed on different traffic scenarios, and a thorough discussion on how to configure D-wave's quantum annealers for optimal performance is presented. Comparative tests show that the proposed model outperforms traditional control techniques in several traffic conditions, effectively containing critical congestion situations, reducing their presence, and preventing their formation. The results obtained put in evidence the state of the art of these quantum machines, their actual capabilities in addressing the problem, and opportunities for future applications.

TI Rydberg excitons and quantum sensing
SO MRS BULLETIN
AB Within the last few years, Rydberg excitons, bound electron-hole pairs in highly excited states, have emerged as a promising technology platform for quantum nonlinear optics, quantum information processing, and quantum sensing. The advanced device designs and sensing concepts in these fields require strong nonlinearities at the few-photon or few-carrier level. Rydberg states offer the required strong nonlinearities as the relevant physical quantities at the heart of such nonlinear effects scale strongly with the principal quantum number, n, of the excited state: For example, their polarizability scales as n7\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$n<^>7$$\end{document}, resulting in an enormous sensitivity to external fields. We review recent experimental and theoretical results that pave the way toward quantum sensing of the electric fields originating from static charge carriers and strongly diluted electron-hole plasmas. We also discuss the strong nonlinear optical properties of Rydberg excitons and how they could be utilized in terms of sensing.

TI Quantum computing of the electronic structure of crystals by the
   Variational Quantum Deflation algorithm
SO PHYSICA SCRIPTA
AB Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) and its extension, Variational Quantum Deflation (VQD), have emerged as promising algorithms for computing ground and excited state energy eigenvalues of Hamiltonians, particularly in quantum physics, chemistry, and materials science. Recently, the VQE and VQD algorithms were implemented to calculate the electronic band structure described by the tight-binding Hamiltonian. Despite their success for simple models, scalability remains a challenge due to the need for a large number of circuit executions, limited qubit coherence times, and low gate fidelities. In this work, we implemented the VQE and VQD algorithms for tight-binding models of diamond and zincblende crystal structures (Sn, C, Si, Ge, AlP, AlAs, AlSb, and GaP) using a quantum computer simulator. We investigate the scalability challenges, focusing on the significant overhead caused by a large number of quantum circuit executions required to find the energy eigenvalues. Our analysis highlights the substantial amount of both measurement and optimization overheads in VQD, particularly as the number of excited states increases. Based on our findings, we critically discuss the implications of implementing VQD on current noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices.

TI A Comparison between Invariant and Equivariant Classical and Quantum
   Graph Neural Networks
SO AXIOMS
AB Machine learning algorithms are heavily relied on to understand the vast amounts of data from high-energy particle collisions at the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC). The data from such collision events can naturally be represented with graph structures. Therefore, deep geometric methods, such as graph neural networks (GNNs), have been leveraged for various data analysis tasks in high-energy physics. One typical task is jet tagging, where jets are viewed as point clouds with distinct features and edge connections between their constituent particles. The increasing size and complexity of the LHC particle datasets, as well as the computational models used for their analysis, have greatly motivated the development of alternative fast and efficient computational paradigms such as quantum computation. In addition, to enhance the validity and robustness of deep networks, we can leverage the fundamental symmetries present in the data through the use of invariant inputs and equivariant layers. In this paper, we provide a fair and comprehensive comparison of classical graph neural networks (GNNs) and equivariant graph neural networks (EGNNs) and their quantum counterparts: quantum graph neural networks (QGNNs) and equivariant quantum graph neural networks (EQGNN). The four architectures were benchmarked on a binary classification task to classify the parton-level particle initiating the jet. Based on their area under the curve (AUC) scores, the quantum networks were found to outperform the classical networks. However, seeing the computational advantage of quantum networks in practice may have to wait for the further development of quantum technology and its associated application programming interfaces (APIs).

TI Quantum Tunneling: From Theory to Error-Mitigated Quantum Simulation
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB Ever since the discussions about a possible quantum computer arised, quantum simulations have been at the forefront of possible utilities, with the task of quantum simulations being one that promises quantum advantage. Recently, advancements have made it feasible to simulate complex molecules using Variational Quantum Eigensolvers or study the dynamics of many-body spin Hamiltonians. These simulations have the potential to yield valuable outcomes through the application of error mitigation techniques. Simulating smaller models carries a great amount of importance as well and currently, in the Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum era, is more feasible since it is less prone to errors. The objective of this work is to examine the theoretical background and the circuit implementation of a quantum tunneling simulation, with an emphasis on hardware considerations. This study presents the theoretical background required for such implementation and highlights the main stages of its development. By building on classic approaches of quantum tunneling simulations, this study aims at improving the result of such simulations by employing error mitigation techniques, Zero Noise Extrapolation, and Readout Error Mitigation and uses them in conjunction with multiprogramming of the quantum chip, a technique used for solving the hardware under-utilization problem that arises in such contexts.
   Quantum simulations are regarded as a promising undertaking in the field of quantum computing. This study focuses on quantum tunneling and aims at simulating it on a quantum computer. With a focus on hardware run considerations for superconducting architectures, various circuit implementation alternatives are clarified. The role of the compiler, the need for hardware aware design, different error mitigation techniques and multiprogramming are discussed, giving a final workflow tailored for the Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum era. image

TI Software architecture for quantum computing systems - A systematic
   review
SO JOURNAL OF SYSTEMS AND SOFTWARE
AB Quantum computing systems rely on the principles of quantum mechanics to perform a multitude of computationally challenging tasks more efficiently than their classical counterparts. The architecture of software-intensive systems can empower architects who can leverage architecture-centric processes, practices, description languages to model, develop, and evolve quantum computing software (quantum software for short) at higher abstraction levels. We conducted a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) to investigate (i) architectural process, (ii) modelling notations, (iii) architecture design patterns, (iv) tool support, and (iv) challenging factors for quantum software architecture. Results of the SLR indicate that quantum software represents a new genre of software-intensive systems; however, existing processes and notations can be tailored to derive the architecting activities and develop modelling languages for quantum software. Quantum bits (Qubits) mapped to Quantum gates (Qugates) can be represented as architectural components and connectors that implement quantum software. Tool-chains can incorporate reusable knowledge and human roles (e.g., quantum domain engineers, quantum code developers) to automate and customise the architectural process. Results of this SLR can facilitate researchers and practitioners to develop new hypotheses to be tested, derive reference architectures, and leverage architecture-centric principles and practices to engineer emerging and next generations of quantum software.& COPY; 2023 The Authors.

TI Critical Schrodinger Cat Qubit
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Encoding quantum information onto bosonic systems is a promising route to quantum error correc-tion. In a cat code, this encoding relies on the confinement of the dynamics of the system onto the two-dimensional manifold spanned by Schrodinger cats of opposite parity. In dissipative cat qubits, an engineered dissipation scheme combining two-photon drive and two-photon loss has been used to autonomously stabilize this manifold, ensuring passive protection against, e.g., bit-flip errors regardless of their origin. Similarly, in Kerr-cat qubits, where highly performing gates can be engineered, two-photon drive and Kerr nonlinearity cooperate to confine the system to a twofold-degenerate ground-state manifold spanned by cat states of opposite parity. Dissipative, Hamiltonian, and hybrid confinement mechanisms have been investigated at resonance, i.e., for driving frequencies matching that of the cavity. Here, we pro-pose a critical cat code, where both two-photon loss and Kerr nonlinearity are present and the two-photon drive is allowed to be out of resonance. The performance of this code is assessed via the spectral theory of Liouvillians in all configurations ranging from the purely dissipative to the Kerr limit. We show that large detunings and small, but non-negligible, two-photon loss rates are fundamental to achieve optimal performance. We further demonstrate that the competition between nonlinearity and detuning results in a first-order dissipative phase transition, leading to a squeezed vacuum steady state. We show that to achieve the maximal suppression of the logical bit-flip rate requires initializing the system in the metastable state emerging from the first-order transition and we detail a protocol to do so. Efficiently operating over a broad range of detuning values, the critical cat code is particularly resistant to random frequency shifts charac-terizing multiple-qubit operations, opening avenues for the realization of reliable protocols for scalable and concatenated bosonic qubit architectures.

TI Quantum simulation of exact electron dynamics can be more efficient than
   classical mean-field methods
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Quantum algorithms for simulating electronic ground states are slower than popular classical mean-field algorithms such as Hartree-Fock and density functional theory but offer higher accuracy. Accordingly, quantum computers have been predominantly regarded as competitors to only the most accurate and costly classical methods for treating electron correlation. However, here we tighten bounds showing that certain first-quantized quantum algorithms enable exact time evolution of electronic systems with exponentially less space and polynomially fewer operations in basis set size than conventional real-time time-dependent Hartree-Fock and density functional theory. Although the need to sample observables in the quantum algorithm reduces the speedup, we show that one can estimate all elements of the k-particle reduced density matrix with a number of samples scaling only polylogarithmically in basis set size. We also introduce a more efficient quantum algorithm for first-quantized mean-field state preparation that is likely cheaper than the cost of time evolution. We conclude that quantum speedup is most pronounced for finite-temperature simulations and suggest several practically important electron dynamics problems with potential quantum advantage.
   It is often assumed that systems that can be analyzed accurately via mean-field theory would not be worth looking at using quantum algorithms, given entanglement plays no key role. Here, the authors show instead that a quantum advantage can be expected for simulating the exact time evolution of such electronic systems.

TI Solid-state quantum nodes based on color centers and rare-earth ions
   coupled with fiber Fabry-Pérot microcavities
SO CHIP
AB High-performance optical quantum memories serving as quantum nodes are crucial for the distribution of remote entanglement and the construction of large-scale quantum networks. Notably, quantum systems based on single emitters can achieve deterministic spin - photon entanglement, which greatly simplifies the difficulty of constructing quantum network nodes. Among them, optically interfaced spins embedded in solid-state systems, as atomic-like emitters, are important candidate systems for implementing long-lived quantum memory due to their stable physical properties and robustness to decoherence in scalable and compact hardware. To enhance the strength of light-matter interactions, optical microcavities can be exploited as an important tool to generate high-quality spin - photon entanglement for scalable quantum networks. They can enhance the photon collection probability and photon generation rate of speci fi c optical transitions and improve the coherence and spectral purity of emitted photons. For solid-state systems, open Fabry - P & eacute;rot cavities can couple single emitters that are not in proximity to the surface, avoiding signi fi cant spectral diffusion induced by the interfaces while maintaining the wide tunability, which enables addressing of multiple single emitters in the frequency and spatial domain within a single device. This review described the characteristics of single emitters as quantum memories with a comparison to atomic ensembles, the cavity-enhancement effect for single emitters and the advantages of different cavities, especially fi ber Fabry - P & eacute;rot microcavities. Finally, recent experimental progress on solid-state single emitters coupled with fi ber Fabry - P & eacute;rot microcavities was also reviewed, with a focus on color centers in diamond and silicon carbide, as well as rare-earth dopants.

TI Depth-Optimized Quantum Circuits for ASCON: AEAD and HASH
SO MATHEMATICS
AB Quantum computing advancements pose security challenges for cryptography. Specifically, Grover's search algorithm affects the reduction in the search complexity of symmetric-key encryption and hash functions. Recent efforts have been made to estimate the complexity of Grover's search and evaluate post-quantum security. In this paper, we propose a depth-optimized quantum circuit implementation for ASCON, including both symmetric-key encryption and hashing algorithms, as a part of the lightweight cryptography standardization by NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology). As far as we know, this is the first implementation of a quantum circuit for the ASCON AEAD (Authenticated Encryption with Associated Data) scheme, which is a symmetric-key algorithm. Also, our quantum circuit implementation of the ASCON-HASH achieves a reduction of more than 88.9% in the Toffoli depth and more than 80.5% in the full depth compared to the previous work. As per our understanding, the most effective strategy against Grover's search involves minimizing the depth of the quantum circuit for the target cipher. We showcase the optimal Grover's search cost for ASCON and introduce a proposed quantum circuit optimized for depth. Furthermore, we utilize the estimated cost to evaluate post-quantum security strength of ASCON, employing the relevant evaluation criteria and the latest advancements in research.

TI Achieving fault tolerance against amplitude-damping noise
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB With the intense interest in small, noisy quantum computing devices comes the push for larger, more accurate-and hence more useful-quantum computers. While fully fault-tolerant quantum computers are, in principle, capable of achieving arbitrarily accurate calculations using devices subjected to general noise, they require immense resources far beyond our current reach. An intermediate step would be to construct quantum computers of limited accuracy enhanced by lower-level, and hence lower-cost, noise-removal techniques. This is the motivation for our paper, which looks into fault-tolerant encoded quantum computation targeted at the dominant noise afflicting the quantum device. Specifically, we develop a protocol for fault-tolerant encoded quantum computing components in the presence of amplitude-damping noise, using a 4-qubit code and a recovery procedure tailored to such noise. We describe a universal set of fault-tolerant encoded gadgets and compute the pseudothreshold for the noise, below which our scheme leads to more accurate computation. Our paper demonstrates the possibility of applying the ideas of quantum fault tolerance to targeted noise models, generalizing the recent pursuit of biased-noise fault tolerance beyond the usual Pauli noise models. We also illustrate how certain aspects of the standard fault tolerance intuition, largely acquired through Pauli-noise considerations, can fail in the face of more general noise.

TI Post-quantum Techniques in Wireless Network Security: An Overview
SO MALAYSIAN JOURNAL OF FUNDAMENTAL AND APPLIED SCIENCES
AB Post quantum is a general name to all the techniques which are safe against the quantum computer attack. The wireless network is one of the most important means of communication. Wireless network security is a top priority. Wireless networks use conventional cryptography, which has various flaws, whereas quantum cryptography claims to be completely secure. It wasn't long after quantum computers became operational that people began to think about new ways to secure electronic communications. After considering all of the weaknesses in conventional cryptosystems, individuals began to look for new ways to secure electronic communications. Traditional cryptography has many problems, but quantum cryptography addresses nearly all of them.

TI Quantum simulation of dynamical response functions of equilibrium states
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB The computation of dynamical response functions is central to many problems in condensed matter physics. Owing to the rapid growth of quantum correlations following a quench, classical methods face significant challenges even if an efficient description of the equilibrium state is available. Quantum computing offers a promising alternative. However, existing approaches often assume access to the equilibrium state, which may be difficult to prepare in practice. In this work, we present a method that circumvents this by using energy filter techniques, enabling the computation of response functions and other dynamical properties in both microcanonical and canonical ensembles. Our approach only requires the preparation of states that have significant weight at the desired energy. The dynamical response functions are then reconstructed from measurements after quenches of varying duration by classical postprocessing. We illustrate the algorithm numerically by applying it to compute the dynamical conductivity of a free-fermion model, which unveils the energy-dependent localization properties of the model.

TI IMPROVED CLASSICAL AND QUANTUM ALGORITHMS FOR THE SHORTEST VECTOR
   PROBLEM VIA BOUNDED DISTANCE DECODING
SO SIAM JOURNAL ON COMPUTING
AB The most important computational problem on lattices is the shortest vector problem (SVP). In this paper, we present new algorithms that improve the state-of-the-art for provable classical/quantum algorithms for SVP. We present the following results: (1) A new algorithm for SVP that provides a smooth tradeoff between time complexity and memory requirement. For any positive integer 4 \leq q \leq root n, our algorithm takes q13n+o(n) time and requires poly(n) \cdot q16n/q2 memory. This tradeoff, which ranges from enumeration (q = root n) to sieving (q constant), is a consequence of a new time-memory tradeoff for discrete Gaussian sampling above the smoothing parameter. (2) A quantum algorithm for SVP that runs in time 20.950n+o(n) and requires 20.5n+o(n) classical memory and poly(n) qubits. In a quantum random access memory (QRAM) model, this algorithm takes only 20.835n+o(n) time and requires a QRAM of size 20.293n+o(n), poly(n) qubits and 20.5n classical space. This improves over the previously fastest classical (which is also the fastest quantum) algorithm due to [D. Aggarwal et al., Solving the shortest vector problem in 2n time using discrete Gaussian sampling: Extended abstract, in Proceedings of the Forty-Seventh Annual ACM on Symposium on Theory of Computing (STOC), 2015, pp. 733--742] that has a time and space complexity 2n+o(n). (3) A classical algorithm for SVP that runs in time 21.669n+o(n) time and 20.5n+o(n) space. This improves over an algorithm of [Y. Chen, K. Chung, and C. Lai, Quantum Inf. Comput., 18 (2018), pp. 285--306] that has the same space complexity. The time complexity of our classical and quantum algorithms are obtained using a known upper bound on a quantity related to the lattice kissing number, which is 20.402n. We conjecture that for most lattices this quantity is a 2o(n). Assuming that this is the case, our classical algorithm runs in time 21.292n+o(n), our quantum algorithm runs in time 20.750n+o(n), and our quantum algorithm in a QRAM model runs in time 20.667n+o(n). As a direct application of our result, using the reduction in [L. Ducas, Des. Codes. Cryptogr., 92 (2024), pp. 909--916], we obtain a provable quantum algorithm for the lattice isomorphism problem in the case of the trivial lattice Zn (ZLIP) that runs in time 20.417n+o(n). Our algorithm requires a QRAM of size 20.147n+o(n), poly(n) qubits and 20.25n classical space.

TI Multi-party semi-quantum key distribution protocol based on
   hyperentangled Bell states
SO FRONTIERS IN PHYSICS
AB Semi-quantum key distribution allows generating a raw key between two communication participants, in which the sender is a quantum participant and the receiver is a classical participant. This article presents an original semi-quantum key distribution protocol based on hyperentangled Bell states. The hyperentangled Bell states can be entangled simultaneously in polarization and spatial degrees of freedom, enhancing channel capacity. According to the characteristics of hyperentangled Bell states, the proposed protocol is more efficient than the protocol based on Bell states. Moreover, the measure-resend attack, the intercept-resend attack, and the entangle-measure attack are analyzed in detail. The security analysis demonstrates that the proposed protocol is secure. In addition, a multi-party semi-quantum key distribution scheme based on hyperentangled Bell states is proposed, which can realize key distribution between one quantum participant and multiple classical participants.

TI Frequency-bin photonic quantum information
SO OPTICA
AB Discrete frequency modes, or bins, present a blend of opportunities and challenges for photonic quantum information processing. Frequency-bin-encoded photons are readily generated by integrated quantum light sources, naturally highdimensional, stable in optical fiber, and massively parallelizable in a single spatial mode. Yet quantum operations on frequency-bin states require coherent and controllable multifrequency interference, making them significantly more challenging to manipulate than more traditional spatial degrees of freedom. In this mini-review, we describe recent developments that have transformed these challenges and propelled frequency bins forward. Focusing on sources, manipulation schemes, and detection approaches, we introduce the basics of frequency-bin encoding, summarize the state of the art, and speculate on the field's next phases. Given the combined progress in integrated photonics, highfidelity quantum gates, and proof-of-principle demonstrations, frequency-bin quantum information is poised to emerge from the lab and leave its mark on practical quantum information processing-particularly in networking where frequency bins offer unique tools for multiplexing, interconnects, and high-dimensional communications.

TI Quantum annealing-based computed tomography using variational approach
   for a real-number image reconstruction
SO PHYSICS IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY
AB Objective. Despite recent advancements in quantum computing, the limited number of available qubits has hindered progress in CT reconstruction. This study investigates the feasibility of utilizing quantum annealing-based computed tomography (QACT) with current quantum bit levels. Approach. The QACT algorithm aims to precisely solve quadratic unconstrained binary optimization problems. Furthermore, a novel approach is proposed to reconstruct images by approximating real numbers using the variational method. This approach allows for accurate CT image reconstruction using a small number of qubits. The study examines the impact of projection data quantity and noise on various image sizes ranging from 4 x 4 to 24 x 24 pixels. The reconstructed results are compared against conventional reconstruction algorithms, namely maximum likelihood expectation maximization (MLEM) and filtered back projection (FBP). Main result. By employing the variational approach and utilizing two qubits for each pixel of the image, accurate reconstruction was achieved with an adequate number of projections. Under conditions of abundant projections and lower noise levels, the image quality in QACT algorithm outperformed that of MLEM and FBP algorithms. However, in situations with limited projection data and in the presence of noise, the image quality in QACT was inferior to that in MLEM. Significance. This study developed the QACT reconstruction algorithm using the variational approach for real-number reconstruction. Remarkably, only 2 qubits were required for each pixel representation, demonstrating their sufficiency for accurate reconstruction.

Here, we propose a path to overcome this limitation by demonstrating that Penning traps can be used to realize remarkably clean bilayer crystals, wherein hundreds of ions self-organize into two welldefined layers. These bilayer crystals are made possible by the inclusion of an anharmonic trapping potential, which is readily implementable with current technology. We study the normal modes of this system and discover salient differences compared to the modes of single-plane crystals. The bilayer geometry and the unique properties of the normal modes open new opportunities-in particular, in quantum sensing and quantum simulation-that are not straightforward in single-plane crystals. Furthermore, we illustrate that it may be possible to extend the ideas presented here to realize multilayer crystals with more than two layers. Our work increases the dimensionality of trapped-ion systems by efficiently utilizing all three spatial dimensions, and it lays the foundation for a new generation of quantum information processing experiments with multilayer 3D crystals of trapped ions.

TI Mitigating Barren Plateaus of Variational Quantum Eigensolvers
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM ENGINEERING
AB Variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) are expected to establish valuable applications on near-term quantum computers. However, recent works have pointed out that the performance of VQAs greatly relies on the expressibility of the ansatzes and is seriously limited by optimization issues, such as barren plateaus (i.e., vanishing gradients). This article proposes the state-efficient ansatz (SEA) for accurate ground state preparation with improved trainability. We show that the SEA can generate an arbitrary pure state with much fewer parameters than a universal ansatz, making it efficient for tasks like ground state estimation. Then, we prove that barren plateaus can be efficiently mitigated by the SEA and the trainability can be further improved most quadratically by flexibly adjusting the entangling capability of the SEA. Finally, we investigate a plethora of examples in ground state estimation where we obtain significant improvements in the magnitude of the cost gradient and the convergence speed.

TI A clock synchronization method based on quantum entanglement
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB This study presents a clock synchronization method based on quantum entanglement which is simple and reliable and more efficient. The clock synchronization method based on quantum entanglement scheme can greatly improve the accuracy and precision of measurement. More importantly, the proposed method avoids synchronization error caused by traditional method due to the asymmetry of two-way delay. The probability of measuring the quantum state oscillates in cosine or sine fashion with propagation delay. The final experimental and simulation results are basically consistent with the theoretical results. The clock synchronization method based on quantum entanglement scheme can greatly imrprove the accuracy and precision of measurement.

TI High-dimensional quantum key distribution with focused structured
   photons
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB High-dimensional quantum key distribution (HD-QKD) provides notable advantages over qubit-based QKD, including higher key rates and greater noise resilience. Leveraging the orbital angular momentum states of structured photons to encode information has become a prominent method for implementing HD-QKD. However, practical challenges such as state-dependent diffraction, limited receiving aperture, and atmospheric turbulence impose constraints on the attainable performance and encoding dimension of QKD in free-space links. In this work, we address these challenges with focused, structured photons. Numerical simulations indicate that this method markedly enhances transmission efficiency and improves the robustness against turbulence, resulting in higher key rates and extended transmission distances in free-space HD-QKD. Additionally, focused, structured photons allow us to implement higher-dimensional QKD and enable QKD systems to achieve superior performance with smaller receiving apertures in a turbulent free-space link. This makes our approach particularly advantageous for applications of unmanned aerial vehicles and satellite platforms. Our work contributes to exploring the robust QKD schemes employing structured photons and may promote its application in quantum networks.

TI Symmetry enriched phases of quantum circuits
SO ANNALS OF PHYSICS
AB Quantum circuits consisting of random unitary gates and subject to local measurements have been shown to undergo a phase transition, tuned by the rate of measurement, from a state with volume-law entanglement to an area-law state. From a broader perspective, these circuits generate a novel ensemble of quantum many-body states at their output. In this paper, we characterize this ensemble and classify the phases that can be established as steady states. Symmetry plays a nonstandard role in that the physical symmetry imposed on the circuit elements does not on its own dictate the possible phases. Instead, it is extended by dynamical symmetries associated with this ensemble to form an enlarged symmetry. Thus, we predict phases that have no equilibrium counterpart and could not have been supported by the physical circuit symmetry alone. We give the following examples. First, we classify the phases of a circuit operating on qubit chains with Z(2) symmetry. One striking prediction, corroborated with numerical simulation, is the existence of distinct volume-law phases in one dimension, which nonetheless support true long-range order. We furthermore argue that owing to the enlarged symmetry, this system can in principle support a topological area-law phase, protected by the combination of the circuit symmetry and a dynamical permutation symmetry. Second, we consider a Gaussian fermionic circuit that only conserves fermion parity. Here the enlarged symmetry gives rise to a U(1) critical phase at moderate measurement rates and a Kosterlitz-Thouless transition to area-law phases. We comment on the interpretation of the different phases in terms of the capacity to encode quantum information. We discuss close analogies to the theory of spin glasses pioneered by Edwards and Anderson as well as crucial differences that stem from the quantum nature of the circuit ensemble.

TI Bounds to electron spin qubit variability for scalable CMOS
   architectures
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Spins of electrons in silicon MOS quantum dots combine exquisite quantum properties and scalable fabrication. In the age of quantum technology, however, the metrics that crowned Si/SiO2 as the microelectronics standard need to be reassessed with respect to their impact upon qubit performance. We chart spin qubit variability due to the unavoidable atomic-scale roughness of the Si/SiO2 interface, compiling experiments across 12 devices, and develop theoretical tools to analyse these results. Atomistic tight binding and path integral Monte Carlo methods are adapted to describe fluctuations in devices with millions of atoms by directly analysing their wavefunctions and electron paths instead of their energy spectra. We correlate the effect of roughness with the variability in qubit position, deformation, valley splitting, valley phase, spin-orbit coupling and exchange coupling. These variabilities are found to be bounded, and they lie within the tolerances for scalable architectures for quantum computing as long as robust control methods are incorporated.
   Understanding the microscopic variability of CMOS spin qubits is crucial for developing scalable quantum processors. Here the authors report a combined experimental and numerical study of the effect of interface roughness on variability of quantum dot spin qubits formed at the Si/SiO2 interface.

TI Simulation of quantum computing on classical supercomputers with
   tensor-network edge cutting
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Simulation of quantum computing on supercomputers is a significant research topic, which plays a vital role in quantum algorithm verification, error-tolerant verification, and other applications. Tensor-network contraction based on density matrix is an important single-amplitude simulation strategy, but it is hard to execute on the distributed computing systems. In this paper, we studied the problem in detail, and propose a scheme based on cutting edges of undirected graphs. This scheme cuts edges of undirected graphs with large tree width to obtain many undirected subgraphs with small tree width, and these subgraphs contracted on different computing cores. The contraction results of slave cores are summarized in the master node, which is consistent with the original tensor-network contraction. Thus, we can simulate the larger scale quantum circuit than single core. Moreover, it is an NP-hard problem to find the global optimum cutting edges, and we propose a search strategy based on a heuristic algorithm to approach it. In order to verify the effectiveness of our scheme, we conduct tests based on the quantum approximation optimization algorithm (QAOA) and Shor's algorithm, and it can simulate a 120-qubit three-regular QAOA algorithm on a 4096-core supercomputer, which greatly exceeds the simulation scale on a single core of 100 qubits.

TI Ytterbium Nuclear-Spin Qubits in an Optical Tweezer Array
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW X
AB We report on the realization of a fast, scalable, and high-fidelity qubit architecture, based on 171Yb atoms in an optical tweezer array. We demonstrate several attractive properties of this atom for its use as a building block of a quantum information processing platform. Its nuclear spin of 1/2 serves as a long-lived and coherent two-level system, while its rich, alkaline-earth-like electronic structure allows for low-entropy preparation, fast qubit control, and high-fidelity readout. We present a near-deterministic loading protocol, which allows us to fill a 10 ?? 10 tweezer array with 92.73(8)% efficiency and a single tweezer with 96.0(1.4)% efficiency. In the future, this loading protocol will enable efficient and uniform loading of target arrays with high probability, an essential step in quantum simulation and information applications. Employing a robust optical approach, we perform submicrosecond qubit rotations and characterize their fidelity through randomized benchmarking, yielding 5.2(5) ?? 10???3 error per Clifford gate. For quantum memory applications, we measure the coherence of our qubits with T???2 = 3.7(4) s and T2 = 7.9(4) s, many orders of magnitude longer than our qubit rotation pulses. We measure spin depolarization times on the order of tens of seconds and find that this can be increased to the 100 s scale through the application of a several-gauss magnetic field. Finally, we use 3D Raman-sideband cooling to bring the atoms near their motional ground state, which will be central to future implementations of two-qubit gates that benefit from low motional entropy.

TI Influence of Quantum Decoherence on Collective Neutrino Oscillations in
   the Model of Homogeneous Neutrino Gas
SO MOSCOW UNIVERSITY PHYSICS BULLETIN
AB Collective oscillations and quantum decoherence in neutrino physics are two rapidly developing lines of research that act as gateways to a potentially new physics. Moreover, they promise to shed light on still unresolved problems, particularly the neutrino mass hierarchy. In this paper we study the interplay of these two effects, namely we consider the possible suppression effect on the collective oscillations when neutrinos are viewed in the formalism of open quantum systems, i.e., when quantum decoherence is taken into account. We consider a model of a homogeneous neutrino gas to take into account angular asymmetries, which play a special role in the formation of collective unstable modes. Using numerical analyses of the emerging slow modes, we find that in the case of neutrino fluxes from supernovae there is a potential to differentiate between two hierarchies of neutrino masses by taking into account the dissipative effect of quantum decoherence on collective oscillations.

TI A note on quantum gates SWAP and iSWAP in higher dimensions
SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PURE AND APPLIED MATHEMATICS
AB We present explicit descriptions for the swap gate and the iswap gate in any arbitrary dimension d >= 2, in terms of permutation matrices. Moreover, we unify these gates by introducing a more general gate xSWAP which includes SWAP and iSWAP for x = 1 and x = i (i.e. root -1), respectively. The higher dimensional xSWAP e.g., the swap and iswap gates for d > 2 serve as quantum logic gates that operate on two d-level qudits. For d = 2, it is well known that iSWAP unlike SWAP is universal for quantum computing. We will prove this fact for xSWAP in any dimension d, when x not equal +/- 1. Our explicit representation of xSWAP by a permutation matrix facilitates the proof, greatly.

TI Quantum decoherence dynamics in stochastically fluctuating environments
SO JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS
AB We theoretically study the decoherence of a two-level quantum system coupled to noisy environments exhibiting linear and quadratic fluctuations within the framework of a stochastic Liouville equation. It is shown that the intrinsic energy levels of the quantum system renormalize under either the linear or quadratic influence of the environmental noise. In the case of quadratic dependence, the renormalization of the energy levels of the system emerges even if the environmental noise exhibits stationary statistical properties. This is in contrast to the case under linear influence, where the intrinsic energy levels of the system renormalize only if the environmental noise displays nonstationary statistics. We derive the analytical expressions of the decoherence function in the cases where the fluctuation of the frequency difference depends linearly and quadratically on the nonstationary Ornstein-Uhlenbeck noise (OUN) and random telegraph noise (RTN) processes, respectively. In the case of the linear dependence of the OUN, the environmental nonstationary statistical property can enhance the dynamical decoherence. However, the nonstationary statistics of the environmental noise can suppress the quantum decoherence in this case under the quadratic influence of the OUN. In the presence of the RTN, the quadratic influence of the environmental noise does not give rise to decoherence but only causes a determinate frequency renormalization in dynamical evolution. The environmental nonstationary statistical property can suppress the quantum decoherence of the case under the linear influence of the RTN.

TI Experimental Characterization of Fault-Tolerant Circuits in Small-Scale
   Quantum Processors
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Experiments conducted on open-access cloud-based IBM Quantum devices are presented for characterizing their fault tolerance using [4, 2, 2]-encoded gate sequences. Up to 100 logical gates are activated in the Ibmq_Bogota and Ibmq_Santiago devices and we found that a [4, 2, 2] code's logical gate set may be deemed fault-tolerant for gate sequences larger than 10 gates. However, certain circuits did not satisfy the fault tolerance criterion. In some cases the encoded-gate sequences show a high error rate that is lower bounded at approximate to 0.1, whereby the error inherent in these circuits cannot be mitigated by classical post-selection. A comparison of the experimental results to a simple error model reveal that the dominant gate errors cannot be readily represented by the popular Pauli error model. Finally, it is most accurate to assess the fault tolerance criterion when the circuits tested are restricted to those that give rise to an output state with a low dimension.

TI On barren plateaus and cost function locality in variational quantum
   algorithms
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS A-MATHEMATICAL AND THEORETICAL
AB Variational quantum algorithms rely on gradient based optimization to iteratively minimize a cost function evaluated by measuring output(s) of a quantum processor. A barren plateau is the phenomenon of exponentially vanishing gradients in sufficiently expressive parametrized quantum circuits. It has been established that the onset of a barren plateau regime depends on the cost function, although the particular behavior has been demonstrated only for certain classes of cost functions. Here we derive a lower bound on the variance of the gradient, which depends mainly on the width of the circuit causal cone of each term in the Pauli decomposition of the cost function. Our result further clarifies the conditions under which barren plateaus can occur.

We provide two comprehensive lists of stakeholders as starting points for VSD researchers and practitioners. These lists encompass a diverse range of organizations, including private companies, government agencies, NGOs, partnerships and professional/trade organizations. Our aim is to facilitate the recognition, legitimation and understanding of stakeholder interactions in the development of QT. These stakeholder lists lay a foundation for designing and implementing policies and strategies that promote the ethical and responsible development of QT, considering the values and interests of various stakeholders. Furthermore, these lists enable empirical and technical studies on specific QT innovations using an ethics-by-design approach like VSD.

Unlike conventional CNNs, which suffer from slow convergence and high complexity, and QINNs, which are limited to grayscale segmentation, our approach leverages qutrit encoding and tensor ring decomposition. These techniques improve segmentation accuracy, optimize memory usage, and accelerate model convergence. The proposed model demonstrates superior performance on the BRATS19 and Spleen datasets, outperforming state-of-the-art CNN and quantum models in terms of Dice similarity and segmentation precision.

TI Entanglement in bipartite quantum systems: Euclidean volume ratios and
   detectability by Bell inequalities
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS A-MATHEMATICAL AND THEORETICAL
AB Euclidean volume ratios between quantum states with positive partial transpose and all quantum states in bipartite systems are investigated. These ratios allow a quantitative exploration of the typicality of entanglement and of its detectability by Bell inequalities. For this purpose a new numerical approach is developed. It is based on the Peres-Horodecki criterion, on a characterization of the convex set of quantum states by inequalities resulting from Newton identities and from Descartes' rule of signs, and on a numerical approach involving the multiphase Monte Carlo method and the hit-and-run algorithm. This approach confirms not only recent analytical and numerical results on two-qubit, qubit-qutrit, and qubit-four-level qudit states but also allows for a numerically reliable numerical treatment of so far unexplored qutrit-qutrit states. Based on this numerical approach with the help of the Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt inequality and the Collins-Gisin inequality the degree of detectability of entanglement is investigated for two-qubit quantum states. It is investigated quantitatively to which extent a combined test of both Bell inequalities can increase the detectability of entanglement beyond what is achievable by each of these inequalities separately.

AB A foundational result in the theory of quantum computation, known as the "principle of safe storage," shows that it is always possible to take a quantum circuit and produce an equivalent circuit that makes all measurements at the end of the computation. While this procedure is time efficient, meaning that it does not introduce a large overhead in the number of gates, it uses extra ancillary qubits, and so is not generally space efficient. It is quite natural to ask whether it is possible to eliminate intermediate measurements without increasing the number of ancillary qubits.
   We give an affirmative answer to this question by exhibiting a procedure to eliminate all intermediate measurements that is simultaneously space efficient and time efficient. In particular, this shows that the definition of a space-bounded quantum complexity class is robust to allowing or forbidding intermediate measurements. A key component of our approach, which may be of independent interest, involves showing that the well-conditioned versions of many standard linear-algebraic problems may be solved by a quantum computer in less space than seems possible by a classical computer.

TI Coherent manipulation and quantum phase interference in a
   fullerene-based electron triplet molecular qutrit
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB High-spin magnetic molecules are promising candidates for quantum information processing because their intrinsic multiplicity facilitates information storage and computational operations. However, due to the absence of suitable sublevel splittings, their susceptibility to environmental disturbances and limitation from the selection rule, the arbitrary control of the quantum state of a molecular electron multiplet has not been realized. Here, we exploit the photoexcited triplet of C-70 as a molecular electron spin qutrit with pulsed electron paramagnetic resonance. We prepared the system into 3-level superposition states characteristic of a qutrit and validated them by the tomography of their density matrices. To further elucidate the coherence of the operation and the nature of the system as a qutrit, we demonstrated the quantum phase interference in the superposition. The interference pattern is further interpreted as a map of possible evolution paths in the space of phase factors, representing the quantum nature of the 3-level system.

TI The landscape of the quantum start-up ecosystem
SO EPJ QUANTUM TECHNOLOGY
AB The second quantum revolution has been producing groundbreaking scientific and technological outputs since the early 2000s; however, the scientific literature on the impact of this revolution on the industry, specifically on start-ups, is limited. In this paper, we present a landscaping study with a gathered dataset of 441 companies from 42 countries that we identify as quantum start-ups, meaning that they mainly focus on quantum technologies (QT) as their primary priority business. We answer the following questions: (1) What are the temporal and geographical distributions of the quantum start-ups? (2) How can we categorize them, and how are these categories populated? (3) Are there any patterns that we can derive from empirical data on trends? We found that more than 92% of these companies have been founded within the last 10 years, and more than 50% of them are located in the US, the UK, and Canada. We categorized the QT start-ups into six fields: (i) complementary technologies, (ii) quantum computing (hardware), (iii) quantum computing (software/application/simulation), (iv) quantum cryptography/communication, (v) quantum sensing and metrology, and (vi) supporting companies, and analyzed the population of each field both for countries, and temporally. Finally, we argue that low levels of quantum start-up activity in a country might be an indicator of a national initiative to be adopted afterwards, which later sees both an increase in the number of start-ups, and a diversification of activity in different QT fields.

TI Generalized phase estimation in noisy quantum gates
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We examine metrological scenarios where the parameter of interest is encoded onto a quantum state through the action of a noisy quantum gate and investigate the ultimate bound to precision by analyzing the behavior of the quantum Fisher information (QFI). We focus on qubit gates and consider the possibility of employing successive applications of the gate. We go beyond the trivial case of unitary gates and characterize the robustness of the metrological procedure introducing noise in the performed quantum operation, looking at how this affects the QFI at different steps (gate applications). We model the dephasing and tilting noise affecting qubit rotations as classical fluctuations governed by a von Mises-Fisher distribution. Compared to the noiseless case, in which the QFI grows quadratically with the number of steps, we observe a nonmonotonic behavior, and the appearance of a maximum in the QFI, which defines the ideal number of steps that should be performed in order to precisely characterize the action of the gate. Analyzing also the combination of different types of gate imperfections we defined a form of generic noise, finding also nontrivial regimes in which the combination of the two different noises leads to a more resilient QFI or, more remarkably, to an enhancement of the QFI with respect to the case in which only one type of noise is considered.

TI Encoding Qubits in Multimode Grid States
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Encoding logical quantum information in harmonic oscillator modes is a promising and hardware-efficient approach to the realization of a quantum computer. In this work, we propose to encode logical qubits in grid states of an ensemble of harmonic oscillator modes. We first discuss general results about these multimode bosonic codes; how to design them, how to practically implement them in different experimental platforms, and how lattice symmetries can be leveraged to perform logical non-Clifford operations. We then introduce in detail two two-mode grid codes based on the hypercubic and D-4 lattices, respectively, showing how to perform a universal set of logical operations. We demonstrate numerically that multimode grid codes have, compared to their single-mode counterpart, increased robustness against propagation of errors from ancillas used for error correction. Finally, we highlight some interesting links between multidimensional lattices and single-mode grid codes concatenated with qubit codes.

TI A Novel Architecture for Future Classical-Quantum Communication Networks
SO WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS & MOBILE COMPUTING
AB The standardisation of 5G is reaching its end, and the networks have started being deployed. Thus, 6G architecture is under study and design, to define the characteristics and the guidelines for its standardisation. In parallel, communications based on quantum-mechanical principles, named quantum communications, are under design and standardisation, leading to the so-called quantum internet. Nevertheless, these research and standardisation efforts are proceeding in parallel, without any significant interaction. Thus, it is essential to discuss an architecture and the possible protocol stack for classical-quantum communication networks, allowing for an effective integration between quantum and classical networks. The main scope of this paper is to provide a joint architecture for quantum-classical communication networks, considering the very recent advancements in the architectural design of 6G and the quantum internet, also defining guidelines and characteristics, which can be helpful for the ongoing standardisation efforts. For this purpose, the article discusses some of the existing main standardisation processes in classical communications and proposed protocol stacks for quantum communications. This aims at highlighting the potential points of connection and the differences that may imply future incompatible developments. The standardisation efforts on the quantum internet cannot overlook the experience gained and the existing standardisation, allowing the creation of frameworks in the classical communication context.

TI On quantum computing for artificial superintelligence
SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL FOR PHILOSOPHY OF SCIENCE
AB Artificial intelligence algorithms, fueled by continuous technological development and increased computing power, have proven effective across a variety of tasks. Concurrently, quantum computers have shown promise in solving problems beyond the reach of classical computers. These advancements have contributed to a misconception that quantum computers enable hypercomputation, sparking speculation about quantum supremacy leading to an intelligence explosion and the creation of superintelligent agents. We challenge this notion, arguing that current evidence does not support the idea that quantum technologies enable hypercomputation. Fundamental limitations on information storage within finite spaces and the accessibility of information from quantum states constrain quantum computers from surpassing the Turing computing barrier. While quantum technologies may offer exponential speed-ups in specific computing cases, there is insufficient evidence to suggest that focusing solely on quantum-related problems will lead to technological singularity and the emergence of superintelligence. Subsequently, there is no premise suggesting that general intelligence depends on quantum effects or that accelerating existing algorithms through quantum means will replicate true intelligence. We propose that if superintelligence is to be achieved, it will not be solely through quantum technologies. Instead, the attainment of superintelligence remains a conceptual challenge that humanity has yet to overcome, with quantum technologies showing no clear path toward its resolution.

TI Critical quantum sensing based on the Jaynes-Cummings model with a
   squeezing drive
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Quantum sensing improves the accuracy of measurements of relevant parameters by exploiting the unique properties of quantum systems. The divergent susceptibility of physical systems near a critical point for quantum phase transition enables criticality-enhanced quantum sensing. The quantum Rabi model (QRM), composed of a single qubit coupled to a single bosonic field, represents a good candidate for realizing such critical enhancement for its simplicity, but it is experimentally challenging to achieve the ultrastrong qubit-field coupling required to realize the critical phenomena. In this work, we explore an alternative to construct the analog of the QRM for the sensing, exploiting the criticality appearing in the Jaynes-Cummings (JC) model whose bosonic field is parametrically driven, not necessitating the ultrastrong coupling condition, thus to some extent relaxing the requirement for practical implementation.

AB Noise in quantum computers presents a challenge for the users of quantum computing despite the rapid progress we have seen in the past few years in building quantum computers. Existing works have addressed the noise in quantum computers using a variety of mitigation techniques since error correction requires a large number of qubits which is infeasible at present. One of the consequences of quantum computing noise is that users are unable to reproduce similar output from the same quantum computer at different times, let alone from various quantum computers. In this work, we have made initial attempts to visualize quantum basis states for all the circuits that were used in quantum machine learning from various quantum computers and noise-free quantum simulators. We have opened up a pathway for further research into this field where we will be able to isolate noisy states from non-noisy states leading to efficient error mitigation. This is where our work provides an important step in the direction of efficient error mitigation. Our work also provides a ground for quantum noise visualization in the case of large numbers of qubits.

TI Excluding false negative error in certification of quantum channels
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Certification of quantum channels is based on quantum hypothesis testing and involves also preparation of an input state and choosing the final measurement. This work primarily focuses on the scenario when the false negative error cannot occur, even if it leads to the growth of the probability of false positive error. We establish a condition when it is possible to exclude false negative error after a finite number of queries to the quantum channel in parallel, and we provide an upper bound on the number of queries. On top of that, we found a class of channels which allow for excluding false negative error after a finite number of queries in parallel, but cannot be distinguished unambiguously. Moreover, it will be proved that parallel certification scheme is always sufficient, however the number of steps may be decreased by the use of adaptive scheme. Finally, we consider examples of certification of various classes of quantum channels and measurements.

TI Fusing the single-excitation subspace with C2n
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB There is a tremendous interest in developing practical applications for noisy intermediate-scale quantum processors without the overhead required by full error correction. Near-term quantum information processing is especially challenging within the standard gate model, as algorithms quickly lose fidelity as the problem size and circuit depth grow. This has lead to a number of non-gate-model approaches such as analog quantum simulation and quantum annealing. These come with specific hardware requirements that are different than that of a universal gate-based quantum computer. We have previously proposed an approach called the single-excitation subspace (SES) method, which uses a complete graph of superconducting qubits with tunable coupling. Without error correction the SES method is not scalable, but it offers several algorithmic components with constant depth, which is highly desirable for near-term use. The challenge of the SES method is that it requires a physical qubit for every basis state in the computer's Hilbert space. This imposes exponentially large resource costs for algorithms using registers of ancillary qubits, as each ancilla would double the required graph size. Here we show how to circumvent this doubling by leaving the SES and fusing it with a multi-ancilla Hilbert space. Specifically, we implement the tensor product of an SES register holding "data" with one or more ancilla qubits, which are able to independently control arbitrary n x n unitary operations on the data in a constant number of steps. This enables a hybrid form of quantum computation where fast SES operations are performed on the data, traditional logic gates and measurements are performed on the ancillas, and controlled-unitaries act between. As example applications, we give ancilla-assisted SES implementations of quantum phase estimation and the quantum linear system solver of Harrow, Hassidim, and Lloyd.

TI Improving 2-5 Qubit Quantum Phase Estimation Circuits Using Machine
   Learning
SO ALGORITHMS
AB Quantum computing has the potential to solve problems that are currently intractable to classical computers with algorithms like Quantum Phase Estimation (QPE); however, noise significantly hinders the performance of today's quantum computers. Machine learning has the potential to improve the performance of QPE algorithms, especially in the presence of noise. In this work, QPE circuits were simulated with varying levels of depolarizing noise to generate datasets of QPE output. In each case, the phase being estimated was generated with a phase gate, and each circuit modeled was defined by a randomly selected phase. The model accuracy, prediction speed, overfitting level and variation in accuracy with noise level was determined for 5 machine learning algorithms. These attributes were compared to the traditional method of post-processing and a 6x-36 improvement in model performance was noted, depending on the dataset. No algorithm was a clear winner when considering these 4 criteria, as the lowest-error model (neural network) was also the slowest predictor; the algorithm with the lowest overfitting and fastest prediction time (linear regression) had the highest error level and a high degree of variation of error with noise. The XGBoost ensemble algorithm was judged to be the best tradeoff between these criteria due to its error level, prediction time and low variation of error with noise. For the first time, a machine learning model was validated using a 2-qubit datapoint obtained from an IBMQ quantum computer. The best 2-qubit model predicted within 2% of the actual phase, while the traditional method possessed a 25% error.

   coherent absorption of a single photon
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Advanced quantum information protocols rely on the operation of multinodal quantum networks where entan-glement is distributed across the nodes. Existing protocols of entanglement generation are probabilistic, with the efficiency dropping exponentially with the size of the system. We formulate an approach for the deterministic generation of entangled states of a multinodal quantum network of arbitrary size by coupling a single photon standing wave with the nodes of the network. We show experimentally how this can be implemented in a simple binodal system. Since this approach relies on collective excitation of the network???not on local interaction with individual nodes???it allows generation of entanglement with unitary efficiency, independent of the size and the nature of the network.

TI Quantum Dot Phase Transition Simulation with Hybrid Quantum Annealing
   via Metropolis-Adjusted Stochastic Gradient Langevin Dynamics
SO ADVANCES IN CONDENSED MATTER PHYSICS
AB We report a hybrid quantum-classical simulation approach for simulating the optical phase transition observed experimentally in the ultrahigh-density type-II InAs quantum dot array. A hybrid simulation scheme, which contains stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics (a well-known Bayesian machine learning algorithm for big data) along with adiabatic quantum annealing, is developed to reproduce the experimentally observed phase transition. By implementing the simulation scheme into a quantum circuit, we successfully verified the phase transition observed in the experiment. Our work demonstrates for the first time the feasibility of hybridizing quantum computation with classical Langevin dynamics for the analysis of carrier dynamics and quantum phase transition of the quantum dot.

TI Intrinsic Decoherence-Induced Generation of Quantum Information
   Resources in Coupled Semiconductor Charge Qubits
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF THEORETICAL PHYSICS
AB The preservation of non-classical correlation resources requires optimal procedures, strategies, and the proper design of the transmitting channels. In this scenario, we explore the dynamics of quantum correlations, namely local quantum Fisher information (LQFI) and concurrence, in a system of two strongly coupled semiconductor charge qubits confined in semiconductor pair quantum dots (SPQDs). The effects of tunneling, detuning, and dipole-dipole interactions are considered in both the absence and presence of intrinsic decoherence. Our results show that these interactions play a crucial role in transforming initially separable states into correlated states. Strengthening the tunneling coupling enhances the generation of semi-regular maximal two-qubit correlations. Increasing the detuning weakens both LQFI and concurrence, while strong dipole-dipole interactions mitigate decoherence-induced degradation and stabilize the quantum coherence. As decoherence increases, the amplitudes and frequencies of the correlations decrease, leading to sudden birth- death and sudden change phenomena. Notably, the robustness of LQFI against decoherence suggests its potential applications in quantum metrology. The two-qubit coherence induced by dipole interactions can be preserved against decoherence effects by increasing the tunneling coupling, providing an optimized framework for solid-state quantum information processing.

TI Optimal Multi-Bit Toffoli Gate Synthesis
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Multi-bit Toffoli gates form an essential quantum gate class for quantum algorithms. They should be efficiently decomposed into elementary single- or multi-qubit quantum gates, such as CNOT, T, and Hadarmard, for a scalable implementation of a quantum algorithm. We propose an engineering method for the practical synthesis of a multi-bit Toffoli gate. Two optimization models and their closed-form solutions are presented for optimal decomposition of the multi-bit Toffoli gate. These models are based on linearized multi-objective integer programming with parameters such as the number of target ancillae, ancillae states, and basis gates. The proposed method supports the systematic handling of quantum circuit constraints, including the total number of available qubits and maximum circuit depth, which depend on various quantum hardware specifications. Our approach exhibits promise in the noisy intermediate-scale quantum environment by providing a rapid and optimal method for synthesizing multi-bit Toffoli gates in diverse and unpredictable quantum hardware specifications.

TI Indoor-Outdoor Detection in Mobile Networks Using Quantum Machine
   Learning Approaches
SO COMPUTERS
AB Communication networks are managed more and more by using artificial intelligence. Anomaly detection, network monitoring and user behaviour are areas where machine learning offers advantages over more traditional methods. However, computer power is increasingly becoming a limiting factor in machine learning tasks. The rise of quantum computers may be helpful here, especially where machine learning is one of the areas where quantum computers are expected to bring an advantage. This paper proposes and evaluates three approaches for using quantum machine learning for a specific task in mobile networks: indoor-outdoor detection. Where current quantum computers are still limited in scale, we show the potential the approaches have when larger systems become available.

TI Tripartite Quantum Key Distribution Implemented with Imperfect Sources
SO OPTICS
AB Multipartite quantum key distribution (QKD) is a promising area of quantum networks that provides unconditional secret keys among multiple parties, enabling only legitimate users to decrypt the encrypted message. However, security proofs of existing multipartite QKD typically assume perfect state preparation devices of legitimate users and neglect the relative rotation of reference frames. These presumptions are, nevertheless, very difficult to meet in practice, and thus the security of current multipartite QKD implementations is not guaranteed. By combining the idea of a loss tolerant technique, introduced by Tamaki et al. (K. Tamaki et al., Phys. Rev. A, 90, 052314, 2014), and the concept of a reference frame-independent protocol, we propose a three-party QKD protocol that considers state preparation flaws and the slow drift of reference frames. Through a numerical simulation, the influence of misaliged reference frames on the protocol's stability was examined by drifting reference frames through angles beta=pi/5, beta=pi/6 and beta=pi/7. In addition, the performance of the proposed protocol was examined for the encoding flaws set at delta=0.35, delta=0.20, and delta=0.10. The results show that the protocol is robust against state preparation flaws, and is insignificantly impacted by misalignment of the reference frames because the achieved transmission distances and secret key rates are comparable to the perfect scenarios. This work dramatically contributes toward the realization of practical and secure multipartite QKD. The proposed protocol has direct applications in quantum communication network environments that involve unknown and slowly varying reference frames, web conferences, and online communications.

TI Circulating genuine multiparty entanglement in a quantum network
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We propose a deterministic scheme of generating genuine multiparty entangled states in quantum networks of arbitrary size having various geometric structures-we refer to it as entanglement circulation. The procedure involves optimization over a set of two-qubit arbitrary unitary operators and the entanglement of the initial resource state. We report that the set of unitary operators that maximize the genuine multipartite entanglement quantified via generalized geometric measure (GGM) is not unique. We prove that the GGM of the resulting state of arbitrary qubits coincides with the minimum GGM of the initial resource states. By fixing the output state as the six-qubit one, we find the optimal way to create such states according to the available resource. Moreover, we show that the method proposed here can be implemented by using logic gates, or by using the time dynamics of realizable spin Hamiltonians. In case of an ordered system, GGM varies periodically with time while the evolution via disordered models lead to a low but constant multipartite entanglement in outputs at a critical time, which decreases exponentially with the increase of the strength of the disorder.

TI A note on "new quantum key agreement protocols based on Bell states"
SO QUANTUM INFORMATION PROCESSING
AB We remark that the quantum key agreement protocol (Yang et al. in Quantum Inf Process 18(10):322, 2019) is flawed. It is unnecessary for Bob to prepare his secret key K-B, because it is finally announced and accessible to adversaries. We find, K-B has no relation to the confidentiality of the final agreed key K-AB = K-A circle plus K-B. It is just a key transfer scheme, not a general key agreement scheme. We also find there is short of a code for Bob to extract bits from the measured results.

TI Quantum Sensing of Fast Time-Varying Magnetic Field With Daubechies
   Wavelets
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB The waveform of the time-varying magnetic field can be reconstructed by combining the use of quantum sensing technology and orthogonal functions, such as Walsh and Haar wavelet functions, as the control sequences of qubits. However, the piecewise-constant nature of Walsh and Haar wavelet functions induces pulse-shaped artifacts in the reconstructed waveform. In this article, we propose a robust quantum sensing protocol by driving the qubits with control sequences based on high-smoothness Daubechies wavelets. The time-varying magnetic field waveform is reconstructed with negligible artifacts and higher accuracy. The essential mathematical relations between the qubit readout, the accumulated phase of the quantum state, and the wavelet coefficient are derived based on an intuitive model represented on the Bloch sphere. By controlling each qubit with a continuous microwave control sequence modulated by a Daubechies wavelet function, the yielded qubit readout can be related to a designated wavelet coefficient. These coefficients are then used to reconstruct the time-varying magnetic field waveform with higher smoothness and accuracy via an inverse wavelet transform. The reconstructions of single-tone, triple-tone, and noisy waveforms are simulated under various parameter designs of Daubechies wavelets to manifest the efficacy and accuracy of the proposed method. The waveform reconstruction method based on Daubechies wavelets can also be applied in magnetic resonance spectroscopy and measurements of gravity, electric fields, and temperature.

SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
AB We construct a primitive gate set for the digital quantum simulation of the binary tetrahedral (BT) group on two quantum architectures. This non-Abelian discrete group serves as a crude approximation to SU(2) lattice gauge theory while requiring five qubits or one quicosotetrit per gauge link. The necessary basic primitives are the inversion gate, the group multiplication gate, the trace gate, and the BT Fourier transform over BT. We experimentally benchmark the inversion and trace gates on ibm_nairobi, with estimated fidelities between 14%-55%, depending on the input state.

TI Quantum annealing for CAD-based disassembly sequence optimization
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVANCED MANUFACTURING TECHNOLOGY
AB Disassembly is the core of sustainable recovery processes, enabling the reuse, remanufacturing, and recycling of end-of-life products. Disassembly Sequence Optimization (DSO) is the key to achieving practical and efficient disassembly applications in industrial scenarios. This study presents a novel approach to DSO by leveraging Quantum Annealing (QA) through Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) and Constrained Quadratic Model (CQM) formulations integrated with CAD-based assembly designs. The proposed methods aim to address computational challenges in industrial disassembly applications. We evaluated these methods against classical heuristics using two distinct product designs. For a smaller, denser assembly, the hybrid CQM model demonstrated superior performance in terms of solution quality and computational time. Conversely, for a larger, sparser assembly, a classical heuristic achieved better results in solution quality when constraining computational time compared to the hybrid quantum approaches. The QUBO model, although did not overcome classical, showed promise in exploring solution spaces, obtaining better solution quality than CQM for the larger problem. These findings indicate that the current practical utility of quantum annealing for DSO is influenced by problem size, structure, and hybrid workflow efficiency. Future research should focus on optimizing the balance between classical and quantum resources to further enhance efficiency. As quantum hardware continues to advance, these formulations have the potential to revolutionize sustainable manufacturing by optimizing disassembly planning with greater efficiency and adaptability to large assemblies.

TI Variational quantum algorithm for experimental photonic multiparameter
   estimation
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Variational quantum metrology represents a powerful tool to optimize estimation strategies, resulting particularly beneficial for multiparameter estimation problems that often suffer from limitations due to the curse of dimensionality and computational complexity. To overcome these challenges, we develop a variational approach able to efficiently optimize a quantum multiphase sensor. Leveraging the reconfigurability of an integrated photonic device, we implement a hybrid quantum-classical feedback loop able to enhance the estimation performances. The quantum circuit evaluations are used to compute the system partial derivatives by applying the parameter-shift rule, and thus reconstruct experimentally the Fisher information matrix. This in turn is adopted as the cost function of a classical learning algorithm run to optimize the measurement settings. Our experimental results showcase significant improvements in estimation accuracy and noise robustness, highlighting the potential of variational techniques for practical applications in quantum sensing and more generally in quantum information processing using photonic circuits.

TI Quantum error correction from complexity in Brownian SYK
SO JOURNAL OF HIGH ENERGY PHYSICS
AB We study the robustness of quantum error correction in a one-parameter ensemble of codes generated by the Brownian SYK model, where the parameter quantifies the encoding complexity. The robustness of error correction by a quantum code is upper bounded by the "mutual purity" of a certain entangled state between the code subspace and environment in the isometric extension of the error channel, where the mutual purity of a density matrix rho(AB) is the difference F rho(A : B) equivalent to Tr rho(2)(AB) - Tr rho(2)(A) Tr rho(2)(B). We show that when the encoding complexity is small, the mutual purity is O (1) for the erasure of a small number of qubits (i.e., the encoding is fragile). However, this quantity decays exponentially, becoming O(1/N) for O(log N) encoding complexity. Further, at polynomial encoding complexity, the mutual purity saturates to a plateau of O(e(-N)). We also find a hierarchy of complexity scales associated to a tower of subleading contributions to the mutual purity that quantitatively, but not qualitatively, adjust our error correction bound as encoding complexity increases. In the AdS/CFT context, our results suggest that any portion of the entanglement wedge of a general boundary subregion A with sufficiently high encoding complexity is robustly protected against low-rank errors acting on A with no prior access to the encoding map. From the bulk point of view, we expect such bulk degrees of freedom to be causally inaccessible from the region A despite being encoded in it.

TI Quantum-Fourier-transform-based quantum arithmetic with qudits
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We present some basic integer arithmetic quantum circuits, such as adders and multiplier-accumulators of various forms, which operate on multilevel qudits. The integers to be processed are represented in an alternative basis after they have been Fourier transformed. Several arithmetic circuits operating on Fourier-transformed integers have appeared in the literature for two-level qubits. Here we extend these techniques to multilevel qudits, as they may offer some advantages relative to qubit implementations. The arithmetic circuits presented here can be used as basic building blocks for higher level algorithms such as quantum phase estimation, quantum simulation, quantum optimization, etc. Detailed decomposition is given down to elementary two-level singleand two-qudit gates as such gates are the most appropriate for physical implementation. A complexity analysis is given after this decomposition step and it is shown that the depth of the circuits is linear in the number of qudits employed and quadratic in the dimension of each qudit while their quantum cost is quadratic in the number of the qudits and quadratic in the dimension.

TI Parametrically controlled microwave-photonic interface for the fluxonium
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
AB Converting quantum information from stationary qubits to traveling photons enables both fast qubit initialization and efficient generation of flying qubits for redistribution of quantum information. This conversion can be performed using cavity-sideband transitions. In the fluxonium, however, direct cavitysideband transitions are forbidden due to parity symmetry. Here we circumvent this parity selection rule by using a three-wave mixing element to couple the fluxonium to a resonator. We experimentally demonstrate a scheme for interfacing the fluxonium with traveling photons through microwave-induced parametric conversion. We perform fast reset on the fluxonium qubit, initializing it with >95% ground-state population. We then implement controlled release and temporal shaping of a flying photon, useful for quantum state transfer and remote entanglement. The simplicity and flexibility of our demonstrated scheme enables fluxonium-based remote entanglement architectures.

TI Dephasing noise simulation for coherence-generating devices
SO PHYSICA SCRIPTA
AB Advancing quantum technologies necessitates an in-depth exploration of how operations generate quantum resources and respond to noise. Crucial are gates generating quantum coherence and the challenge of mitigating gate dephasing noise. Precisely, we study the dephasing noise that reduces the coherence-generating power of quantum gates, its simulation, and critical factors. Our primary contribution lies in a theorem characterizing the full set of dephasing noises in gates, adaptable to simulation by any predefined operation set. In particular, we apply our result to quantify the memory adaptability required for a dephasing noise to arise. Furthermore, we analytically calculate the quantifier for gates acting on qubit systems, thereby fully characterizing this scenario. Next, we show how our results reveal the structure of non-trivial dephasing noise affecting qubit gates and apply them to experimental data, conclusively demonstrating the existence of a gate's dephasing noise, which is irreducible to dephasing of either input or output states. Finally, we show how our study contributes to addressing an open question in the resource theory of coherence generation.

TI High-fidelity spin qubit operation and algorithmic initialization above
   1 K
SO NATURE
AB The encoding of qubits in semiconductor spin carriers has been recognized as a promising approach to a commercial quantum computer that can be lithographically produced and integrated at scale 1-10 . However, the operation of the large number of qubits required for advantageous quantum applications 11-13 will produce a thermal load exceeding the available cooling power of cryostats at millikelvin temperatures. As the scale-up accelerates, it becomes imperative to establish fault-tolerant operation above 1 K, at which the cooling power is orders of magnitude higher 14-18 . Here we tune up and operate spin qubits in silicon above 1 K, with fidelities in the range required for fault-tolerant operations at these temperatures 19-21 . We design an algorithmic initialization protocol to prepare a pure two-qubit state even when the thermal energy is substantially above the qubit energies and incorporate radiofrequency readout to achieve fidelities up to 99.34% for both readout and initialization. We also demonstrate single-qubit Clifford gate fidelities up to 99.85% and a two-qubit gate fidelity of 98.92%. These advances overcome the fundamental limitation that the thermal energy must be well below the qubit energies for the high-fidelity operation to be possible, surmounting a main obstacle in the pathway to scalable and fault-tolerant quantum computation.
   Initialization and operation of spin qubits in silicon above 1 K reach fidelities sufficient for fault-tolerant operations at these temperatures.

TI Algorithm for initializing a generalized fermionic Gaussian state on a
   quantum computer
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS A-MATHEMATICAL AND THEORETICAL
AB We present explicit expressions for the central piece of a variational method developed by Shi et al (2018 Ann. Phys. 390 245) which extends variational wave functions that are efficiently computable on classical computers beyond mean-field to generalized Gaussian states. In particular, we derive iterative analytical expressions for the evaluation of expectation values of products of fermionic creation and annihilation operators in a Grassmann variable-free representation. Using this result we find a closed expression for the energy functional and its gradient of a general fermionic quantum many-body Hamiltonian. We present a simple gradient-descent-based algorithm that can be used as an optimization subroutine in combination with imaginary time evolution, which by construction guarantees a monotonic decrease of the energy in each iteration step. Due to the simplicity of the quantum circuit implementing the variational state ansatz, the results of the algorithms discussed here and in Shi et al's work could serve as an improved, beyond mean-field initial state in quantum computation.

TI Scalable quantum simulations of scattering in scalar field theory on 120
   qubits
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
AB Simulations of collisions of fundamental particles on a quantum computer are expected to have an exponential advantage over classical methods and promise to enhance searches for new physics. Furthermore, scattering in scalar field theory has been shown to be bounded-error quantum polynomial time (BQP) complete, making it a representative problem for which quantum computation is efficient. As a step toward large-scale quantum simulations of collision processes, scattering of wave packets in one-dimensional scalar field theory is simulated using 120 qubits of IBM's Heron superconducting quantum computer ibm_ fez. Variational circuits compressing vacuum preparation, wave packet initialization, and time evolution are determined using classical resources. By leveraging physical properties of states in the theory, such as symmetries and locality, the variational quantum algorithm constructs scalable circuits that can be used to simulate arbitrarily large system sizes. A new strategy is introduced to mitigate errors in quantum simulations, which enables the extraction of meaningful results from circuits with up to 4924 two-qubit gates and two-qubit gate depths of 103. The effect of interactions is clearly seen, and is found to be in agreement with classical matrix product state simulations. The developments that will be necessary to simulate high-energy inelastic collisions on a quantum computer are discussed.

TI Quantum sensing of magnetic fields with molecular spins
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Spins are prototypical systems with the potential to probe magnetic fields down to the atomic scale limit. Exploiting their quantum nature through appropriate sensing protocols allows to enlarge their applicability to fields not always accessible by classical sensors. Here we first show that quantum sensing protocols for AC magnetic fields can be implemented with molecular spin ensembles embedded into hybrid quantum circuits. We then show that, using only echo detection at microwave frequency and no optical readout, Dynamical Decoupling protocols synchronized with the AC magnetic fields can enhance sensitivity up to S approximate to 10-10 - 10-9 T Hz-1/2 with a low (4-5) number of applied pulses. These results paves the way for the development of strategies to exploit molecular spins as quantum sensors.

TI Streaming quantum state purification
SO QUANTUM
AB Quantum state purification is the task of recovering a nearly pure copy of an unknown pure quantum state using multiple noisy copies of the state. This basic task has applications to quantum communication over noisy channels and quantum computation with imperfect devices, but has primarily been studied previously for the case of qubits. We derive an efficient purification procedure based on the swap test for qudits of any dimension, starting with any initial error parameter. Treating the initial error parameter and the dimension as constants, we show that our procedure has sample complexity asymptotically optimal in the final error parameter. Our protocol has a simple recursive structure that can be applied when the states are provided one at a time in a streaming fashion, requiring only a small quantum memory to implement.

TI Quantifying quantum entanglement via machine learning models
SO COMMUNICATIONS IN THEORETICAL PHYSICS
AB Quantifying entanglement measures for quantum states with unknown density matrices is a challenging task. Machine learning offers a new perspective to address this problem. By training machine learning models using experimentally measurable data, we can predict the target entanglement measures. In this study, we compare various machine learning models and find that the linear regression and stack models perform better than others. We investigate the model's impact on quantum states across different dimensions and find that higher-dimensional quantum states yield better results. Additionally, we investigate which measurable data has better predictive power for target entanglement measures. Using correlation analysis and principal component analysis, we demonstrate that quantum moments exhibit a stronger correlation with coherent information among these data features.

TI Quantum algorithm for neighborhood preserving embedding
SO CHINESE PHYSICS B
AB Neighborhood preserving embedding (NPE) is an important linear dimensionality reduction technique that aims at preserving the local manifold structure. NPE contains three steps, i.e., finding the nearest neighbors of each data point, constructing the weight matrix, and obtaining the transformation matrix. Liang et al. proposed a variational quantum algorithm (VQA) for NPE [Phys. Rev. A 101 032323 (2020)]. The algorithm consists of three quantum sub-algorithms, corresponding to the three steps of NPE, and was expected to have an exponential speedup on the dimensionality n. However, the algorithm has two disadvantages: (i) It is not known how to efficiently obtain the input of the third sub-algorithm from the output of the second one. (ii) Its complexity cannot be rigorously analyzed because the third sub-algorithm in it is a VQA. In this paper, we propose a complete quantum algorithm for NPE, in which we redesign the three sub-algorithms and give a rigorous complexity analysis. It is shown that our algorithm can achieve a polynomial speedup on the number of data points m and an exponential speedup on the dimensionality n under certain conditions over the classical NPE algorithm, and achieve a significant speedup compared to Liang et al.'s algorithm even without considering the complexity of the VQA.

   full TRI
SO REVISTA MEXICANA DE FISICA
AB In the present study, we determined quantum entanglement in a full trapped ion (TRI)-coherent system and its dependence on the Lamb-Dicke parameter (LDP). We investigated the entanglement in view of two elaborated measurements of the family: entropy and fidelity. We selected three values of the deep LDP to demonstrate the benefits of these two critical measures. The findings obtained in this study showed that the maximum value of fidelity for entangled states is quantified approximately to be 0.35, and the long lifetime is also observed with entropy measurement. The findings suggest that three coupling parameters play a significant role in developing quantum entanglement.

TI Drastic Circuit Depth Reductions with Preserved Adversarial Robustness
   by Approximate Encoding for Quantum Machine Learning
SO INTELLIGENT COMPUTING
AB Quantum machine learning (QML) is emerging as an application of quantum computing with the potential to deliver quantum advantage, but its realization for practical applications remains impeded by challenges. Among these, a key barrier is the computationally expensive task of encoding classical data into a quantum state, which could erase any prospective speedups over classical algorithms. In this study, we implement methods for the efficient preparation of quantum states representing encoded image data using variational, genetic, and matrix product state algorithms. Our results show that these methods can approximately prepare states to a level suitable for QML using circuits 2 orders of magnitude shallower than a standard state preparation implementation, thus drastically reducing circuit depth and gate count without unduly sacrificing classification accuracy. Additionally, the QML models trained and evaluated on approximately encoded data displayed an increased robustness to adversarially generated input data perturbations. This partial alleviation of adversarial vulnerability, made possible by the retention of the meaningful large-scale features of the data despite the "drowning out" of adversarial perturbations, constitutes a considerable benefit for approximate state preparation in addition to lessening the requirements of the quantum hardware. Our results, based on simulations and experiments on IBM quantum devices, highlight a promising pathway for the future implementation of accurate and robust QML models on complex datasets relevant for practical applications, bringing the possibility of NISQ-era QML advantage closer to reality.

TI Suppression of quantum correlations in a clean-disordered
   atom-nanophotonic interface
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Quantum correlations are essential to the emergent behaviors of quantum systems, supporting key phenomena such as localization or delocalization of particles, quantum avalanches in many-body localized systems, and quantum information transfer. In open atom-nanophotonic systems characterized by long-range spin-exchange interactions, we examine the influence of clean system size on high-order quantum correlations among a cleandisordered atomic array with multiple atomic excitations. By initializing the system far from equilibrium, we observe a suppression of quantum correlations for localized atomic excitations in the disordered zone as the clean system size increases, showcasing the delocalization behavior in the high-order spin-exchange processes. The calculation of the entanglement entropy at the interface further substantiates this thermalizing effect. Our results manifest distinct quantum correlations enabled by long-range interactions mediated by the waveguide, enhance the theoretical comprehension of clean-disordered systems, and provide insights to nonequilibrium quantum dynamics in an atom-nanophotonic platform.

TI Entangling quantum memories at channel capacity
SO OPTICA QUANTUM
AB Entangling quantum memories, mediated by optical-frequency or microwave channels, at high rates and fidelities is key for linking qubits across short and long ranges. All well-known protocols encode up to one qubit per optical mode, entangling one pair of memory qubits per transmitted mode over the channel, with probability q, the channel's transmissivity. The rate is proportional to q ideal Bell states (ebits) per mode. The quantum capacity, C(q) = - log2(1-q) ebits per mode, which approximate to 1.44q for high loss, thereby making these schemes near rate-optimal. However, C(q) -> c as q -> 1, making the known schemes highly rate-suboptimal for shorter ranges. We propose a cavity-assisted memory-photon interface that can be used to entangle matter memories with Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) photonic qudits, which, along with dual-homodyne entanglement swaps that retain analog information, enables entangling memories at capacity-approaching rates at low loss. We benefit from the loss resilience of GKP-encoded states and the ability to encode multiple qubits in one mode. Our memory-photon interface further supports the preparation of needed ancilla GKP qudits. We expect our result to spur research in low-loss, high-cooperativity cavity-coupled qubits with high-efficiency optical coupling and demonstrations of high-rate short-range quantum links.

TI QUBO Formulations and Characterization of Penalty Parameters for the
   Multi-Knapsack Problem
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB The Multi-Knapsack Problem (MKP) is a fundamental challenge in operations research and combinatorial optimization. Quantum computing introduces new possibilities for solving MKP using Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) models. However, a key challenge in QUBO formulations is the selection of penalty parameters, which directly influence solution feasibility and algorithm performance. In this work, we develop QUBO formulations for two MKP variants-the Multidimensional Knapsack Problem (MDKP) and the Multiple Knapsack Problem (MUKP)-and provide an algebraic characterization of their penalty parameters. We systematically evaluate their impact through quantum simulation experiments and compare the performance of the two leading quantum optimization approaches: Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) and quantum annealing, alongside a state-of-the-art classical solver. Our results indicate that while classical solvers remain superior, careful tuning of penalty parameters has a strong impact on quantum optimization outcomes. QAOA is highly sensitive to parameter choices, whereas quantum annealing produces more stable results on small to mid-sized instances. Further, our results reveal that MDKP instances can maintain feasibility at penalty values below theoretical bounds, while MUKP instances show greater sensitivity to penalty reductions. Finally, we outline directions for future research in solving MKP, including adaptive penalty parameter tuning, hybrid quantum-classical approaches, and practical optimization strategies for QAOA, as well as real-hardware evaluations.

AB Quantum computers promise to efficiently solve important problems classical computers never will. However, in order to capitalize on these prospects, a fully automated quantum software stack needs to be developed. This involves a multitude of complex tasks from the classical simulation of quantum circuits, over their compilation to specific devices, to the verification of the circuits to be executed as well as the obtained results. All of these tasks are highly non-trivial and necessitate efficient data structures to tackle the inherent complexity. Starting from rather straight-forward arrays over decision diagrams (inspired by the design automation community) to tensor networks and the ZX-calculus, various complementary approaches have been proposed. This work provides a look "under the hood" of today's tools and showcases how these means are utilized in them, e.g., for simulation, compilation, and verification of quantum circuits.

The purpose of this paper is to introduce two alternative implementations to the already assessed numerical resolution of Navier-Stokes equations or the resolution of analog quantum mechanical problem, highlighting how the use of quantum annealing and a classification algorithm (quantum walk search algorithm) can be implemented for the resolution of a lumped-characteristic analytical model of the heat transfer inside a compact heat exchanger, also in case of two-phase refrigerant fluid, for the use during design phase of environmental control system, e.g. provide the design engineers with a relatively simple and quick to use tool, which provides a reasonable result with an easily interpretable physical meaning. We start with a simple two-phase flow within a single-pass mini-channel heat exchanger, describing the mathematical formulation of the problem followed by a simplified implementation of the proposed quantum approaches, highlighting the main procedures of the calculation as well as the practical implications, advantages and disadvantages of the proposed method, e.g. a limited number of CFD simulations are required to evaluate air side heat transfer coefficient and pressure drop for particular designs within the defined design space, and the specific hardware required to implement the quantum process.

TI Purification of Single and Entangled Photons by Wavepacket Shaping
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB Single photons and entangled photons lie at the heart of photonic quantum technologies, whose optimal performances are normally reached when the purity of the single or entangled photons is high. However, the multiphoton emission, dissipation, and decoherence in practical realizations always lead to the degradation of the single- and entangled- photon quality. The purification of single or entangled photons is thus valuable to restore the quantum states and enhance the performance of quantum technologies. The applications of wavepacket shaping, an emerging quantum optics tool to manipulate the single- and entangled- photon wavefunctions, to purify single and entangled photons are reviewed. In particular, by modulating the single photons emitted from optically excited room-temperature quantum dots, it is shown that the fast-decaying multiphoton emission can be eliminated to obtain a low value of g((2))(0) that is independent of the excitation power. It is also shown that the two-photon interference and polarization entanglement of the non-degenerate biphotons from spontaneous parametric down-conversion can be restored after modulating the biphotons with a periodic function. The works have potential applications in long-distance quantum communication and linear optical quantum computation.

TI Generation of Bell and Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger states from a hybrid
   qubit-photon-magnon system
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We propose a level-resolved protocol in a hybrid architecture for connecting a superconducting qubit and a magnon mode contained within a microwave cavity (resonator) to generate local and global entangled states, enabling a wide range of applications in quantum communication, quantum metrology, and quantum information processing. Exploiting the high-degree controllability in such a hybrid qubit-photon-magnon system, we derive the effective Hamiltonians at the second-order resonant points by virtue of the strong general Rabi interactions between the resonator and the qubit and between the resonator and the magnon. Consequently, we can efficiently generate the Bell states of the photon-magnon and the qubit-magnon subsystems and the Greenberger-HorneZeilinger state of the whole hybrid system. The robustness of our protocol is checked against a nonvanishing tuning time of system frequency and the environmental noise by the Lindblad master equation. Our work makes this hybrid platform of high-degree controllability a high-fidelity candidate for preparing the multiple maximally entangled states.

TI Probing single electrons across 300-mm spin qubit wafers
SO NATURE
AB Building a fault-tolerant quantum computer will require vast numbers of physical qubits. For qubit technologies based on solid-state electronic devices 1-3 , integrating millions of qubits in a single processor will require device fabrication to reach a scale comparable to that of the modern complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) industry. Equally important, the scale of cryogenic device testing must keep pace to enable efficient device screening and to improve statistical metrics such as qubit yield and voltage variation. Spin qubits 1,4,5 based on electrons in Si have shown impressive control fidelities 6-9 but have historically been challenged by yield and process variation 10-12 . Here we present a testing process using a cryogenic 300-mm wafer prober 13 to collect high-volume data on the performance of hundreds of industry-manufactured spin qubit devices at 1.6 K. This testing method provides fast feedback to enable optimization of the CMOS-compatible fabrication process, leading to high yield and low process variation. Using this system, we automate measurements of the operating point of spin qubits and investigate the transitions of single electrons across full wafers. We analyse the random variation in single-electron operating voltages and find that the optimized fabrication process leads to low levels of disorder at the 300-mm scale. Together, these results demonstrate the advances that can be achieved through the application of CMOS-industry techniques to the fabrication and measurement of spin qubit devices.

TI Efficient Qubit Calibration by Binary-Search Hamiltonian Tracking
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB We present and experimentally implement a real-time protocol for calibrating the frequency of a resonantly driven qubit, achieving exponential scaling in calibration precision with the number of measurements, up to the limit imposed by decoherence. The real-time processing capabilities of a classical controller dynamically generate adaptive probing sequences for qubit-frequency estimation. Each probing evolution time and drive frequency are calculated to divide the prior probability distribution into two branches, following a locally optimal strategy that mimics a conventional binary search. The scheme does not require repeated measurements at the same setting, as it accounts for state preparation and measurement errors. Its use of a parametrized probability distribution favors numerical accuracy and computational speed. We show the efficacy of the algorithm by stabilizing a flux-tunable transmon qubit, leading to improved coherence and gate fidelity. As benchmarked by gate-set tomography, the field-programmable gate array (FPGA) powered control electronics partially mitigates non-Markovian noise, which is detrimental to quantum error correction. The mitigation is achieved by dynamically updating and feeding forward the qubit frequency. Our protocol highlights the importance of feedback in improving the calibration and stability of qubits subject to drift and can be readily applied to other qubit platforms.

AB Quantum photonic resources are critical for advanced applications such as quantum computation, communication, and information processing. Efficient generation and detection of quantum states, as well as reliable photon manipulation techniques, are essential for the development of practical quantum technologies. Integrated photonic platforms offer attractive solutions due to their stability, small device footprint, and improved power efficiencies. However, optical loss and environmental noise hinder their capability to transmit, measure, and detect quantum states with high accuracies. To tackle these limitations, we have developed robust solutions for quantum signal processing by leveraging infrastructures from telecommunications and integrated photonics. These approaches focus on the use of silicon-based photonic sources for entanglement generation in the time and frequency degrees of freedom, as well as chip- and fiber-based architectures for entanglement verification via quantum interference and tomography measurements. Our photonic schemes allow for highdimensional entanglement processing, demonstrating their versatility in developing scalable and cost-efficient quantum signal processing platforms.

TI Self-organized error correction in random unitary circuits with
   measurement
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB Random measurements have been shown to induce a phase transition in an extended quantum system evolving under chaotic unitary dynamics, when the strength of measurements exceeds a threshold value. Below this threshold, a steady state with a subthermal volume law entanglement emerges, which is resistant to the disentangling action of measurements, suggesting a connection to quantum error-correcting codes. We quantify these notions by identifying a power-law decay of the mutual information I ({x} : (A) over bar) alpha x(-3/2) in the volume-law-entangled phase, between a qudit located a distance x from the boundary of a region A, and the complement (A) over bar, which implies that a measurement of this qudit will retrieve very little information about (A) over bar. We also find a universal logarithmic contribution to the volume law entanglement entropy S-(2)(A) = kappa L-A + 3/2 log L-A which is intimately related to the first observation. We obtain these results by relating the entanglement dynamics to the imaginary time evolution of an Ising model, to which we apply field-theoretic and matrix-product-state techniques. Finally, exploiting the error-correction viewpoint, we assume that the volume-law state is an encoding of a Page state in a quantum error-correcting code to obtain a bound on the critical measurement strength pc as a function of the qudit dimension d: p(c) log[(d(2) - 1)(p(c)(-1)-1)] <= log[(1 - p(c))d]. The bound is saturated at p(c) (d ->infinity) = 1/2 and provides a reasonable estimate for the qubit transition: p(c) (d = 2) <= 0.1893.

TI A Blockchain-Enabled Decentralized Zero-Trust Architecture for Anomaly
   Detection in Satellite Networks via Post-Quantum Cryptography and
   Federated Learning
SO FUTURE INTERNET
AB The rapid expansion of satellite networks for advanced communication and space exploration has ensured that robust cybersecurity for inter-satellite links has become a critical challenge. Traditional security models rely on centralized trust authorities, and node-specific protections are no longer sufficient, particularly when system failures or attacks affect groups of satellites or agent clusters. To address this problem, we propose a blockchain-enabled decentralized zero-trust model based on post-quantum cryptography (BEDZTM-PQC) to improve the security of satellite communications via continuous authentication and anomaly detection. This model introduces a group-based security framework, where satellite teams operate under a zero-trust architecture (ZTA) enforced by blockchain smart contracts and threshold cryptographic mechanisms. Each group shares the responsibility for local anomaly detection and policy enforcement while maintaining decentralized coordination through hierarchical federated learning, allowing for collaborative model training without centralizing sensitive telemetry data. A post-quantum cryptography (PQC) algorithm is employed for future-proof communication and authentication protocols against quantum computing threats. Furthermore, the system enhances network reliability by incorporating redundant communication channels, consensus-based anomaly validation, and group trust scoring, thus eliminating single points of failure at both the node and team levels. The proposed BEDZTM-PQC is implemented in MATLAB, and its performance is evaluated using key metrics, including accuracy, latency, security robustness, trust management, anomaly detection accuracy, performance scalability, and security rate with respect to different numbers of input satellite users.

   Key Distribution with Single Photons
SO NONLINEAR PHENOMENA IN COMPLEX SYSTEMS
AB We consider an unambiguous state discrimination attack on the B92 protocol of quantum key distribution, realized on the basis of polarization encoding of photons produced by a single-photon source. We calculate the secure key rate and the maximal tolerable loss for various overlaps between two signal states employed in this protocol. We make also a comparison with a physically impossible attack of perfect quantum cloning, and show that the unambiguous state discrimination is much more dangerous for the B92 protocol, than this attack, demonstrating thus, that the security of quantum key distribution is not always based on the no-cloning theorem.

TI Perfect Reconciliation in Quantum Key Distribution with Order-Two Frames
SO SYMMETRY-BASEL
AB We present an error reconciliation method for Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) that corrects 100% of errors generated in regular binary frames transmitted over a noisy quantum channel regardless of the quantum channel error rate. In a previous investigation, we introduced a novel distillation QKD algorithm whose secret key rate descends linearly with respect to the channel error rate. Now, as the main achievement of this work, we demonstrate an improved algorithm capable of retaining almost all the secret information enclosed in the regular binary frames. Remarkably, this technique increases quadratically the secret key rate as a function of the double matching detection events and doubly quadratically in the number of the quantum pulses. Furthermore, this reconciliation method opens up the opportunity to use less attenuated quantum pulses, would allow greater QKD distances at drastically increased secret key rate. Since our method can be implemented as a software update, we hope that quantum key distribution technology would be fast deployed over global data networks in the quantum era.

In the current landscape, Information Retrieval (IR) and Recommender Systems (RS) need to perform computationally intensive operations on massive and heterogeneous datasets. Therefore, it could be possible to use QC and especially Quantum Annealing (QA) technologies to boost systems' performance both in terms of efficiency and effectiveness. The objective of this work is to present the first edition of the QuantumCLEF lab, which is composed of two tasks that aim at:
   - evaluating QA approaches compared to their traditional counterpart;
   - identifying new problem formulations to discover novel methods that leverage the capabilities of QA for improved solutions;
   - establishing collaborations among researchers from different fields to harness their knowledge and skills to solve the considered challenges and promote the usage of QA.
   This lab will employ the QC resources provided by CINECA, one of the most important computing centers worldwide. We also describe the design of our infrastructure which uses Docker and Kubernetes to ensure scalability, fault tolerance and replicability.

TI Direct observation of magnetoelastic coupling in a molecular spin qubit:
   new insights from crystal field neutron scattering data
SO CHEMICAL SCIENCE
AB Single-molecule magnets are promising candidates for data storage and quantum computing applications. A major barrier to their use is rapid magnetic relaxation and quantum decoherence due to thermal vibrations. Here we report a reanalysis of inelastic neutron scattering (INS) data of the candidate qubit Na-9[Ho(W5O18)(2)]center dot 35D(2)O, wherein we demonstrate for the first time that magnetic relaxation times and mechanisms can be directly observed as crystal field (CF) peak broadening in INS spectra of a lanthanoid molecular system. The magnetoelastic coupling between the lower energy CF states and phonons (lattice vibrations) is determined by the simultaneous measurement of CF excitations and the phonon density of states, encoded within the same INS experiment. This directly results in the determination of relaxation coupling pathways that occur in this molecule. Such information is invaluable for the further advancement of SMMs and to date has only been obtained from techniques performed in external magnetic fields. Additionally, we determine a relaxation rate of quantum-tunnelling of magnetisation that is consistent with previously measured EPR spectroscopy data.

TI Dynamics of quantum correlations and Fisher information of a
   multipartite system under the Stark effect
SO ALEXANDRIA ENGINEERING JOURNAL
AB In this paper, we explore the dynamics of the global quantum discord (GQD) and quantum Fisher information (QFI) of a multipartite two-level stationary and moving atomic system under the Stark shift effect. The system interacts with a thermal field with a different number of average thermal photons. For a fixed Stark parameter value, the GQD magnitudes increase as the system size (N) increases for both static and moving atomic systems. However, in the instance of a stationary atomic system and lower Stark parameter values, the QFI preserves a constant magnitude for different N values. When atomic motion is taken, the quantifier dynamics exhibit periodic oscillations. Additionally, increasing the Stark parameter led to a suppression in the magnitude of both GQD and QFI. With in the sight of intrinsic decoherence (ID), the quantifiers show a damping in their oscillations. Interestingly, the atomic motion assists to mitigate the damping effects caused by ID. Moreover, if the average thermal photons are increased, the magnitude of the GQD and QFI are decreased.

AB Lattice-based cryptography is one of the leading proposals for post-quantum cryptography. The Shortest Vector Problem (SVP) is arguably the most important problem for the cryptanalysis of latticebased cryptography, and many lattice-based schemes have security claims based on its hardness. The best quantum algorithm for the SVP is due to Laarhoven [Laa16] and runs in (heuristic) time 2(0.2653d+o(d).) In this article, we present an improvement over Laarhoven's result and present an algorithm that has a (heuristic) running time of 2(0.2570d+o(d)) where d is the lattice dimension. We also present time-memory trade-offs where we quantify the amount of quantum memory and quantum random access memory of our algorithm. The core idea is to replace Grover's algorithm used in [Laa16] in a key part of the sieving algorithm by a quantum random walk in which we add a layer of local sensitive filtering.

AB We develop a novel connection between discrepancy minimization and (quantum) communication complexity. As an application, we resolve a substantial special case of the Matrix Spencer conjecture. In particular, we show that for every collection of symmetric.. x.. matrices A(1),...,A(n) with ||A(i)|| <= 1 and ||A(i) || <= n(1/4) there exist signs x is an element of{+/- 1}(n) such that the maximum eigenvalue of Sigma(i <= n) x(i)Lambda(i) is at most O (root n). We give a polynomial-time algorithm based on partial coloring and semidefinite programming to find such x.
   Our techniques open a new avenue to use tools from communication complexity and information theory to study discrepancy. The proof of our main result combines a simple compression scheme for transcripts of repeated (quantum) communication protocols with quantum state purification, the Holevo bound from quantum information, and tools from sketching and dimensionality reduction. Our approach also offers a promising avenue to resolve the Matrix Spencer conjecture completely - we show it is implied by a natural conjecture in quantum communication complexity.

TI Berry phases of higher spins due to internal geometry of Majorana
   constellation and relation to quantum entanglement
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB Majorana stars, the antipodal directions associated with the coherent states that are orthogonal to a spin state, provide a visualization and a geometric understanding of the structures of general quantum states. For example, the Berry phase of a spin-1/2 is given by half the solid angle enclosed by the close path of its Majorana star. It is conceivable that the Berry phase of higher spins may also be related to the geometry of the Majorana constellation. We find that for a spin-1 state, besides the expected contributions from the solid angles enclosed by the close paths of the two Majorana stars, the Berry phase includes a term related to the twist of the relative position vector around the barycenter vector of the two Majorana stars, i.e., the self-rotation of the constellation. Interestingly, if the spin-1 state is taken as a symmetrized two-qubit state, the extra contribution to the Berry phase is given by the self-rotation of the Majorana constellation weighted by the quantum entanglement of the two qubits. This discovery alludes to the relevance of the Majorana stellar geometry in representing the deep structures of quantum states and of quantum entanglement.

TI Quantum dots synthesis within ternary III-V nanowire towards light
   emitters in quantum photonic circuits: a review
SO NANOTECHNOLOGY
AB The positioning of quantum dots (QDs) in nanowires (NWs) on-axis has emerged as a controllable method of QD fabrication that has given rise to structures with exciting potential in novel applications in the field of Si photonics. In particular, III-V NWQDs attract a great deal of interest owing to their vibrant optical properties, high carrier mobility, facilitation in integration with Si and bandgap tunability, which render them highly versatile. Moreover, unlike Stranski-Krastanov or self-assembled QDs, this configuration allows for deterministic position and size of the dots, enhancing the sample uniformity and enabling beneficial functions. Among these functions, single photon emission has presented significant interest due to its key role in quantum information processing. This has led to efforts for the integration of ternary III-V NWQD non-classical light emitters on-chip, which is promising for the commercial expansion of quantum photonic circuits. In the current review, we will describe the recent progress in the synthesis of ternary III-V NWQDs, including the growth methods and the material platforms in the available literature. Furthermore, we will present the results related to single photon emission and the integration of III-V NWQDs as single photon sources in quantum photonic circuits, highlighting their promising potential in quantum information processing. Our work demonstrates the up-to-date landscape in this field of research and pronounces the importance of ternary III-V NWQDs in quantum information and optoelectronic applications.

   quantum computing
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS COMMUNICATIONS
AB An algorithm and a system of quantum circuits are developed and applied to compute accurately the S matrix for the transitions between vibrational states of H-2 for collisions with H. The algorithm was applied to 100 eV laboratory collision energy at a quantum circuit simulator. The effects of the discretized dissociative continuum to the transition cross sections are carefully studied and accuracy and convergence of the results with the chosen parameters of the algorithm and the collision system are verified by comparison with a solution of the time-dependent Schrodinger equation using the classical algorithm as well as comparison with a few results from the literature.

TI A Cryo-CMOS DAC-Based 40-Gb/s PAM4 Wireline Transmitter for Quantum
   Computing
SO IEEE JOURNAL OF SOLID-STATE CIRCUITS
AB Addressing the advancement toward large-scale quantum computers, this article presents the first four-level pulse amplitude modulation (PAM4) wireline transmitter (TX) operating at cryogenic temperatures (CTs). With quantum computers scaling up toward thousands of quantum bits (qubits), but having too limited fidelity for robust operation, continuous rounds of quantum error correction (QEC) are necessary. However, QEC requires a large amount of data to be transferred from a cryogenic controller at 4 K to a classical processor at room temperature (RT). To bridge the gap, a high-speed data link between the quantum processor at CT and the classical counterpart at RT is needed. The proposed PAM4 TX architecture integrates a low-power 64:4 serializer structure, a high-speed 4:1 current-mode logic (CML) multiplexer, and a linear 6-bit digital-to-analog converter (DAC). Considering the challenges and benefits of CMOS operating at CTs, the TX architecture and circuitry are designed to exploit the maximum speed, while maintaining sufficient linearity. The fabricated 40-nm CMOS chip achieves a data rate of 40-Gb/s (36-Gb/s), an energy efficiency of 2.46 pJ/b (2.47 pJ/b), and 97.8% (96.6%) ratio of level mismatch (RLM) at CT (RT). While demonstrating an energy efficiency comparable to prior-art TXs in more advanced CMOS nodes at RT, the broad operating temperature of the proposed TX enables the required high-speed wireline link for large-scale quantum computers.

AB Post-quantum Cryptography (PQC) has reached the verge of standardization competition, with Kyber as a winning candidate. In this work, we demonstrate practical backdoor insertion in Kyber through kleptrography. The backdoor can be inserted using classical techniques like ECDH or post-quantum Classic Mceliece. The inserted backdoor targets the key generation procedure where generated output public keys subliminally leak information about the secret key to the owner of the backdoor. We demonstrate first practical instantiations of such attack at the protocol level by validating it on TLS 1.3.

TI Modernizing quantum annealing II: genetic algorithms with the inference
   primitive formalism
SO NATURAL COMPUTING
AB Quantum annealing, a method of computing where optimization and machine learning problems are mapped to physically implemented energy landscapes subject to quantum fluctuations, allows for these fluctuations to be used to assist in finding the solution to some of the world's most challenging computational problems. Recently, this field has attracted much interest because of the construction of large-scale flux-qubit based quantum annealing devices. These devices have since implemented a technique known as reverse annealing which allows the solution space to be searched locally, and algorithms based on these techniques have been tested. In this paper, I develop a formalism for algorithmic design in quantum annealers, which I call the 'inference primitive' formalism. This formalism naturally lends itself to expressing algorithms which are structurally similar to genetic algorithms, but where the annealing processor performs a combined crossover/mutation step. I demonstrate how these methods can be used to understand the algorithms which have already been implemented and the compatibility of such controls with a wide variety of other current efforts to improve the performance of quantum annealers.

TI Many-Body Singlet Prepared by a Central-Spin Qubit
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Controllable quantum many-body systems are platforms for fundamental investigations into the nature of entanglement and promise to deliver computational speed-up for a broad class of algorithms and simulations. In particular, engineering entanglement within a dense spin ensemble can turn it into a robust quantum memory or a computational platform. Recent experimental progress in dense central-spin systems motivates the design of algorithms that use a central-spin qubit as a convenient proxy for the ensemble. Here we propose a protocol that uses a central spin to initialize two dense spin ensembles into a pure antipolarized state and from there creates a many-body entangled state-a singlet-from the combined ensemble. We quantify the protocol performance for multiple material platforms and show that it can be implemented even in the presence of realistic levels of decoherence and diffusion. Our protocol introduces an algorithmic approach to the preparation of a known many-body state and to entanglement engineering in a dense spin ensemble, which can be extended towards a broad class of collective quantum states.

TI Quantum Multi-Round Resonant Transition Algorithm
SO ENTROPY
AB Solving the eigenproblems of Hermitian matrices is a significant problem in many fields. The quantum resonant transition (QRT) algorithm has been proposed and demonstrated to solve this problem using quantum devices. To better realize the capabilities of the QRT with recent quantum devices, we improve this algorithm and develop a new procedure to reduce the time complexity. Compared with the original algorithm, it saves one qubit and reduces the complexity with error epsilon from O(1/epsilon(2)) to O(1/epsilon). Thanks to these optimizations, we can obtain the energy spectrum and ground state of the effective Hamiltonian of the water molecule more accurately and in only 20 percent of the time in a four-qubit processor compared to previous work. More generally, for non-Hermitian matrices, a singular-value decomposition has essential applications in more areas, such as recommendation systems and principal component analysis. The QRT has also been used to prepare singular vectors corresponding to the largest singular values, demonstrating its potential for applications in quantum machine learning.

TI Simulating quantum circuits with ZX-calculus reduced stabiliser
   decompositions
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB We introduce an enhanced technique for strong classical simulation of quantum circuits which combines the 'sum-of-stabilisers' method with an automated simplification strategy based on the ZX-calculus. Recently it was shown that quantum circuits can be classically simulated by expressing the non-stabiliser gates in a circuit as magic state injections and decomposing them in chunks of 2-6 states at a time, obtaining sums of (efficiently-simulable) stabiliser states with many fewer terms than the naive approach. We adapt these techniques from the original setting of Clifford circuits with magic state injection to generic ZX-diagrams and show that, by interleaving this 'chunked' decomposition with a ZX-calculus-based simplification strategy, we can obtain stabiliser decompositions that are many orders of magnitude smaller than existing approaches. We illustrate this technique to perform exact norm calculations (and hence strong simulation) on the outputs of random 50- and 100-qubit Clifford + T circuits with up to 70 T-gates as well as a family of hidden shift circuits previously considered by Bravyi and Gosset with over 1000 T-gates.

TI High-entanglement capabilities for variational quantum algorithms: the
   Poisson equation case
SO QUANTUM INFORMATION PROCESSING
AB The discretized Poisson equation matrix (DPEM) in 1D has been shown to require an exponentially large number of terms when decomposed in the Pauli basis when solving numerical linear algebra problems on a quantum computer. Additionally, traditional ansatz for variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) that are used to heuristically solve linear systems (such as the DPEM) have many parameters, making them harder to train. This research attempts to resolve these problems by utilizing quantum computers that are capable of total connectivity between qubits. We propose a decomposition of the DPEM that is based on 2- or 3-qubit entanglement gates and is shown to have O(1) terms with respect to system size, with one term having an O(n2)\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$O(n<^>2)$$\end{document} circuit depth and the rest having only an O(1) circuit depth (where n is the number of qubits defining the system size). Additionally, we introduce the Globally-Entangling Ansatz which reduces the parameter space of the quantum ansatz while maintaining enough expressibility to find the solution. To test these new improvements, we ran numerical simulations to examine how well the VQAs performed with varying system sizes, showing that the new setup offers an improved scaling of the number of iterations required for convergence compared to Hardware-Efficient Ansatz.

AB Low loss and high-speed processing of photons is important to photonic quantum information technologies. The speed with which quantum light generation can be modulated impacts the clock rate of photonic quantum computers, the data rate of quantum communication and applications of quantum enhanced radio-frequency sensors. Here we use lossy carrier depletion modulators in a silicon waveguide nonlinear interferometer to modulate photon pair generation probability at 1 gigahertz (GHz) without exposing the generated photons to the phase dependent parasitic loss of the modulators. The super sensitivity of nonlinear interferometers reduces power consumption compared to modulating the driving laser. This can be used for high-speed programmable nonlinearity in waveguide networks for quantum technologies and for optical quantum sensors.

TI Benchmarking quantum computer simulation software packages: State vector

AB Rapid advances in quantum computing technology lead to an increasing need for software simulators that enable both algorithm design and the validation of results obtained from quantum hardware. This includes calculations that aim at probing regimes of quantum advantage, where a quantum computer outperforms a classical computer in the same task. High performance computing (HPC) platforms play a crucial role as today's quantum devices already reach beyond the limits of what powerful workstations can model, but a systematic evaluation of the individual performance of the many offered simulation packages is lacking so far. In this Technical Review, we benchmark several software packages capable of simulating quantum dynamics with a special focus on HPC capabilities. We develop a containerized toolchain for benchmarking a large set of simulation packages on a local HPC cluster using different parallelisation capabilities, and compare the performance and system size-scaling for three paradigmatic quantum computing tasks. Our results can help finding the right package for a given simulation task and lay the foundation for a systematic community effort to benchmark and validate upcoming versions of existing and also newly developed simulation packages.

TI EEG-Based Dementia Classification Using CS-EMD Synchrony Features and
   Quantum Machine Learning
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON CONSUMER ELECTRONICS
AB Dementia is a condition that affects a very large population, and an effective clinical diagnosis can lead to early intervention to delay progressive cognitive decline. A relatively low-cost, noninvasive, and highly accessible biomarker measurement, electroencephalography (EEG), may be used for this purpose. Many EEG processing and classification methods, which are based on classical techniques, have been explored by researchers over the years. On the other hand, quantum machine learning (QML), which combines the concepts of quantum computing and machine learning, has recently gained much attention with the rising anticipation that this emerging research field may provide significant advantages over classical methods. This paper presents a healthy-dementia classification framework using synchrony features of CS-EMD decomposed EEGs and QML. In this study, three QML models, a variable quantum classifier (VQC), a quantum support vector machine (QSVM), and a quantum neural network (QNN) were explored. Their performance was evaluated through classification experiments using real EEG data. The performances of these QML methods, along with two popular classical classifiers (support vector machine and neural network), were compared. In our experiments, the quantum neural network outperformed all the other tested classifiers, reaching 96.58% accuracy, 97.11% specificity, 96.83% precision, 96.34% sensitivity, 96.28% F1 score, 97.69% AUC, an MCC of 0.9320, and a Kappa of 0.9268. Compared to the runner-up, a classical neural network, the QNN classifier shows an improvement by 8.92% in accuracy, 12.03% in specificity, 13.49% in precision, 5.57% in sensitivity, 10.29% in F1, 3.75% in AUC, 17.83% in MCC, and 18.90% in Kappa. The proposed framework, utilizing a quantum neural network, demonstrates effective classification of healthy individuals and dementia patients with high accuracy, showing good potential as a screening tool for dementia. Similar techniques may also be adapted for other biosignal analyses.

TI A Novel Scheduling Framework for Multi-Programming Quantum Computing in
   Cloud Environment
SO CMC-COMPUTERS MATERIALS & CONTINUA
AB As cloud quantum computing gains broader acceptance, a growing quantity of researchers are directing their focus towards this domain. Nevertheless, the rapid surge in demand for cloud-based quantum computing resources has led to a scarcity, which in turn hampers users from achieving optimal satisfaction. Therefore, cloud quantum computing service providers require a unified analysis and scheduling framework for their quantum resources and user jobs to meet the ever-growing usage demands. This paper introduces a new multi-programming scheduling framework for quantum computing in a cloud environment. The framework addresses the issue of limited quantum computing resources in cloud environments and ensures a satisfactory user experience. It introduces three innovative designs: 1) Our framework automatically allocates tasks to different quantum backends while ensuring fairness among users by considering both the cloud-based quantum resources and the user-submitted tasks. 2) Multi-programming mechanism is employed across different quantum backends to enhance the overall throughput of the quantum cloud. In comparison to conventional task schedulers, our proposed framework achieves a throughput improvement of more than two-fold in the quantum cloud. 3) The framework can balance fidelity and user waiting time by adaptively adjusting scheduling parameters.

TI Expressiveness of Commutative Quantum Circuits: A Probabilistic Approach
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM ENGINEERING
AB This study investigates the frame potential and expressiveness of commutative quantum circuits. Based on the Fourier series representation of these circuits, we express quantum expectation and pairwise fidelity as characteristic functions of random variables, and we characterize expressiveness as the recurrence probability of a random walk on a lattice. A central outcome of our work includes formulas to approximate the frame potential and expressiveness for any commutative quantum circuit, underpinned by convergence theorems in the probability theory. We identify the lattice volume of the random walk as means to approximate expressiveness based on circuit architecture. In the specific case of commutative circuits involving Pauli-Z rotations, we provide theoretical results relating expressiveness and circuit structure. Our probabilistic representation also provides means for bounding and approximately calculating the frame potential of a circuit through sampling methods.

TI Simulating quantum backflow on a quantum computer
SO PHYSICA SCRIPTA
AB Quantum backflow is a counterintuitive effect in which the probability density of a free particle moves in the direction opposite to the particle's momentum. If the particle is electrically charged, then the effect can be viewed as the contrast between the direction of electric current and that of the momentum. To date, there has been no direct experimental observation of quantum backflow. However, the effect has been simulated numerically (using classical computers) and optically (using classical light). In this study, we present the first simulation of quantum backflow using a real quantum computer.

TI Energy transport and optimal design of noisy Platonic quantum networks
SO PHYSICA SCRIPTA
AB Optimal energy transport is one of the primary goals for designing efficient quantum networks. In this work, the maximum energy transport is investigated for three-dimensional quantum networks with Platonic geometries affected by dephasing and dissipative Markovian noise. The network and the environmental characteristics corresponding the optimal design are obtained and investigated for five Platonic networks with 4, 6, 8, 12, and 20 number of sites that one of the sites is connected to a sink site through a Markovian dissipative process. Such optimal designs could have various applications like switching and multiplexing in quantum circuits.

TI Quantum Implementation of S-Boxes Based on Polynomial Evaluation
SO ELECTRONICS LETTERS
AB Quantum computing environments make block ciphers susceptible to exhaustive key search attacks utilizing Grover's algorithm. However, such quantum-based attacks remain impractical unless the targeted cipher is directly implemented on a quantum platform. Moreover, their efficiency significantly depends on the quantum circuit design and optimization of the block cipher in question. The cost of a quantum circuit implementation is typically measured by two main metrics: the number of qubits and the circuit depth (T-depth). For most block ciphers, the S-box is the principal factor contributing to increased T-depth and additional qubit requirements. This paper presents a method for generating quantum circuits directly from lookup tables of S-boxes applicable to arbitrary block ciphers. We illustrate our approach using quantum circuit implementations of the PRESENT and DES ciphers as practical examples. Our proposed method is expected to efficiently implement arbitrary S-boxes by employing polynomial evaluation, thus balancing time-space complexity.

TI An efficient and secure quantum blind signature-based electronic cash
   transaction scheme
SO IET QUANTUM COMMUNICATION
AB The authors present a novel token exchange scheme with an example of an electronic cash (eCash) transaction scheme that ensures quantum security, addressing the vulnerabilities of existing models in the face of quantum computing threats. The authors' comprehensive analysis of various quantum blind signature mechanisms revealed significant shortcomings in their applicability to eCash transactions and their resilience against quantum adversaries. In response, the authors drew inspiration from D. Chaum's original classical eCash scheme and innovated a quantum-secure transaction framework. The authors detail the developed protocol and rigorously evaluate its security aspects. The protocol's adherence to critical security requirements such as blindness, non-forgeability, non-deniability, and prevention of double spending is analysed. Moreover, the scheme against Intercept and Resend, Denial of Service, Man-in-the-Middle, and Entangle-and-Measure attacks is rigorously tested. The authors' findings indicate a robust eCash transaction model capable of withstanding the challenges posed by quantum computing advancements.

TI NbN-based tunnel-type π-junctions for low-power half-flux-quantum
   circuits
SO SUPERCONDUCTOR SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY
AB We have developed half-flux-quantum (HFQ) circuits using all-pi-junctions formed from an NbN/AlN/PdNi/NbN (SIFS) structure. The circuits were fabricated using a novel process that incorporated a ground plane on top of the chip, enabling the epitaxial growth of NbN-based junctions from the substrate. The pi-state of the junctions was demonstrated through a HFQ shift. Notably, these pi-junctions exhibited self-overdamped current-voltage characteristics, enabling them to function as switching components without the need for shunt resistors. The elimination of shunt resistors and the high sheet inductance of NbN are expected to enhance the density of HFQ circuits. To evaluate the performance and power consumption of the all-pi-junctions HFQ circuits, we designed and fabricated an HFQ toggle flip-flop (HFQ-TFF) circuit utilizing pi-pi-pi SQUIDs as the fundamental components. Our findings reveal that the NbN-based HFQ-TFF circuit correctly operates as a frequency divider while consuming only around 30% of the power compared to single-flux-quantum TFF (SFQ-TFF) circuits. These results suggest that the HFQ circuit using SIFS-pi-junctions has promising potential for integrated circuits requiring low-power consumption at cryogenic temperatures, such as qubit control.

TI Almost synchronous quantum correlations
SO JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL PHYSICS
AB The study of quantum correlation sets initiated by Tsirelson in the 1980s and originally motivated by questions in the foundations of quantum mechanics has more recently been tied to questions in quantum cryptography, complexity theory, operator space theory, group theory, and more. Synchronous correlation sets introduced by Paulsen et al. [J. Funct. Anal. 270, 2188-2222 (2016)] are a subclass of correlations that has proven particularly useful to study and arises naturally in applications. We show that any correlation that is almost synchronous, in a natural l(1) sense, arises from a state and measurement operators that are well-approximated by a convex combination of projective measurements on a maximally entangled state. This extends a result of Paulsen et al. [J. Funct. Anal. 270, 2188-2222 (2016)] that applies to exactly synchronous correlations. Crucially, the quality of approximation is independent of the dimension of the Hilbert spaces or of the size of the correlation. Our result allows one to reduce the analysis of many classes of nonlocal games, including rigidity properties, to the case of strategies using maximally entangled states that are generally easier to manipulate.

TI A perspective on scaling up quantum computation with molecular spins
SO APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS
AB Artificial magnetic molecules can contribute to progressing toward large scale quantum computation by (a) integrating multiple quantum resources and (b) reducing the computational costs of some applications. Chemical design, guided by theoretical proposals, allows embedding nontrivial quantum functionalities in each molecular unit, which then acts as a microscopic quantum processor able to encode error protected logical qubits or to implement quantum simulations. Scaling up even further requires "wiring-up" multiple molecules. We discuss how to achieve this goal by the coupling to on-chip superconducting resonators. The potential advantages of this hybrid approach and the challenges that still lay ahead are critically reviewed.

TI Jellybean Quantum Dots in Silicon for Qubit Coupling and On-Chip Quantum
   Chemistry
SO ADVANCED MATERIALS
AB The small size and excellent integrability of silicon metal-oxide-semiconductor (SiMOS) quantum dot spin qubits make them an attractive system for mass-manufacturable, scaled-up quantum processors. Furthermore, classical control electronics can be integrated on-chip, in-between the qubits, if an architecture with sparse arrays of qubits is chosen. In such an architecture qubits are either transported across the chip via shuttling or coupled via mediating quantum systems over short-to-intermediate distances. This paper investigates the charge and spin characteristics of an elongated quantum dot-a so-called jellybean quantum dot-for the prospects of acting as a qubit-qubit coupler. Charge transport, charge sensing, and magneto-spectroscopy measurements are performed on a SiMOS quantum dot device at mK temperature and compared to Hartree-Fock multi-electron simulations. At low electron occupancies where disorder effects and strong electron-electron interaction dominate over the electrostatic confinement potential, the data reveals the formation of three coupled dots, akin to a tunable, artificial molecule. One dot is formed centrally under the gate and two are formed at the edges. At high electron occupancies, these dots merge into one large dot with well-defined spin states, verifying that jellybean dots have the potential to be used as qubit couplers in future quantum computing architectures.

TI Variations of QKD Protocols Based on Conventional System Measurements: A
   Literature Review
SO CRYPTOGRAPHY
AB Cryptography is an unexpected revolution in information security in the recent decades, where remarkable improvements have been created to provide confidentiality and integrity. Quantum cryptography is one such improvement that has grown rapidly since the first announced protocol. Quantum cryptography contains substantial elements that must be addressed to ensure secure communication between legitimate parties. Quantum key distribution (QKD), a technique for creating a secret key, is one of the most interesting areas in quantum cryptography. This paper reviews some well-known quantum key distribution techniques that have been demonstrated in the past three decades. Furthermore, this paper discusses the process of creating a secret key using quantum mechanics and cryptography methods. Moreover, it explains the relationships between many basic aspects of QKD protocols and suggests some improvements in the cryptosystem. An accurate quantitative comparison between the QKD protocols is presented, especially the runtime execution for each QKD protocol. In addition, the paper will demonstrate a general model of each considered QKD protocol based on security principles.

   Composable security under collective Gaussian attacks
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB We consider continuous-variable quantum key distribution with discrete-alphabet encodings. In particular, we study protocols where information is encoded in the phase of displaced coherent (or thermal) states, even though the results can be directly extended to any protocol based on finite constellations of displaced Gaussian states. In this setting, we study the composable security in the finite-size regime assuming the realistic but restrictive hypothesis of collective Gaussian attacks. Under this assumption, we can efficiently estimate the parameters of the channel via maximum likelihood estimators and bound the corresponding error in the final secret key rate.

TI Multiscale quantum algorithms for quantum chemistry
SO CHEMICAL SCIENCE
AB Exploring the potential applications of quantum computers in material design and drug discovery is attracting more and more attention after quantum advantage has been demonstrated using Gaussian boson sampling. However, quantum resource requirements in material and (bio)molecular simulations are far beyond the capacity of near-term quantum devices. In this work, multiscale quantum computing is proposed for quantum simulations of complex systems by integrating multiple computational methods at different scales of resolution. In this framework, most computational methods can be implemented in an efficient way on classical computers, leaving the critical portion of the computation to quantum computers. The simulation scale of quantum computing strongly depends on available quantum resources. As a near-term scheme, we integrate adaptive variational quantum eigensolver algorithms, second-order Moller-Plesset perturbation theory and Hartree-Fock theory within the framework of the many-body expansion fragmentation approach. This new algorithm is applied to model systems consisting of hundreds of orbitals with decent accuracy on the classical simulator. This work should encourage further studies on quantum computing for solving practical material and biochemistry problems.

This paper reviews several significant topics at the intersection of machine learning and quantum estimation and control. Specifically, we discuss neural network-based approaches for quantum state estimation, gradient-based methods for quantum optimal control, evolutionary computation for learning control of quantum systems, machine learning techniques for quantum robust control and reinforcement learning for adaptive quantum control.

TI Variational quantum reinforcement learning via evolutionary optimization
SO MACHINE LEARNING-SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Recent advances in classical reinforcement learning (RL) and quantum computation point to a promising direction for performing RL on a quantum computer. However, potential applications in quantum RL are limited by the number of qubits available in modern quantum devices. Here, we present two frameworks for deep quantum RL tasks using gradient-free evolutionary optimization. First, we apply the amplitude encoding scheme to the Cart-Pole problem, where we demonstrate the quantum advantage of parameter saving using amplitude encoding. Second, we propose a hybrid framework where the quantum RL agents are equipped with a hybrid tensor network-variational quantum circuit (TN-VQC) architecture to handle inputs of dimensions exceeding the number of qubits. This allows us to perform quantum RL in the MiniGrid environment with 147-dimensional inputs. The hybrid TN-VQC architecture provides a natural way to perform efficient compression of the input dimension, enabling further quantum RL applications on noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices.

TI Experimental Demonstrations of Native Implementation of Boolean Logic
   Hamiltonian in a Superconducting Quantum Annealer
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM ENGINEERING
AB Experimental demonstrations of quantum annealing with "native" implementation of Boolean logic Hamiltonians are reported. As a superconducting integrated circuit, a problem Hamiltonian whose set of ground states is consistent with a given truth table is implemented for quantum annealing with no redundant qubits. As examples of the truth table, nand and nor are successfully fabricated as an identical circuit. Similarly, a native implementation of a multiplier comprising six superconducting flux qubits is also demonstrated. These native implementations of Hamiltonians consistent with Boolean logic provide an efficient and scalable way of applying annealing computation to so-called circuit satisfiability problems that aim to find a set of inputs consistent with a given output over any Boolean logic functions, especially those like factorization through amultiplierHamiltonian. Aproof-of-concept demonstration of a hybrid computing architecture for domain-specific quantum computing is described.

TI Quantum Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory Based on Variational
   Quantum Algorithms in the Era of NISQ
SO INFORMATION
AB In the era of noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) computing, the synergistic collaboration between quantum and classical computing models has emerged as a promising solution for tackling complex computational challenges. Long short-term memory (LSTM), as a popular network for modeling sequential data, has been widely acknowledged for its effectiveness. However, with the increasing demand for data and spatial feature extraction, the training cost of LSTM exhibits exponential growth. In this study, we propose the quantum convolutional long short-term memory (QConvLSTM) model. By ingeniously integrating classical convolutional LSTM (ConvLSTM) networks and quantum variational algorithms, we leverage the variational quantum properties and the accelerating characteristics of quantum states to optimize the model training process. Experimental validation demonstrates that, compared to various LSTM variants, our proposed QConvLSTM model outperforms in terms of performance. Additionally, we adopt a hierarchical tree-like circuit design philosophy to enhance the model's parallel computing capabilities while reducing dependence on quantum bit counts and circuit depth. Moreover, the inherent noise resilience in variational quantum algorithms makes this model more suitable for spatiotemporal sequence modeling tasks on NISQ devices.

TI Backflash Attack on Coherent One-Way Quantum Key Distribution
SO IEEE PHOTONICS JOURNAL
AB In this article, we experimentally demonstrate an eavesdropper's (Eve's) information gain by exploiting the breakdown flash generated by the single photon avalanche detector (SPAD) used in coherent one-way quantum key distribution (COW-QKD) setup. Unlike prior studies focusing on the device-level characterization of backflash photons, this work quantifies Eve's learning with a QKD system that includes a key distillation engine (KDE). Eve's learning is quantified using the "Backflash" photons emitted by SPAD and the information available on the classical channel. Experimentally observed data are in good agreement with the theoretical simulations. Some mitigation strategies against the backflash attack are also discussed.

TI Tailoring Fusion-Based Photonic Quantum Computing Schemes to Quantum
   Emitters
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Fusion-based quantum computation is a promising quantum computing model where small-sized photonic resource states are simultaneously entangled and measured by fusion gates. Such operations can be readily implemented with scalable photonic hardware: resource states can be deterministically generated by quantum emitters and fusions require only shallow linear-optical circuits. Here, we propose fusion-based architectures tailored to the capabilities and noise models in quantum emitters. We show that high tolerance to dominant physical error mechanisms can be achieved, with fault-tolerance thresholds of 8% for photon loss, 4% for photon distinguishability between emitters, and spin noise thresholds well above memory-induced errors for typical spin-photon interfaces. Our construction and analysis provide guidelines for the development of photonic quantum hardware targeting fault-tolerant applications with quantum emitters.

TI Bayesian phase difference estimation algorithm for direct calculation of
   fine structure splitting: accelerated simulation of relativistic and
   quantum many-body effects
SO ELECTRONIC STRUCTURE
AB Despite rapid progress in the development of quantum algorithms in quantum computing as well as numerical simulation methods in classical computing for atomic and molecular applications, no systematic and comprehensive electronic structure study of atomic systems that covers almost all of the elements in the periodic table using a single quantum algorithm has been reported. In this work, we address this gap by implementing the recently-proposed quantum algorithm, the Bayesian phase difference estimation (BPDE) approach, to determine fine structure splittings of a wide range of boron-like atomic systems. Since accurate estimate of fine structure splittings strongly depend on the relativistic as well as quantum many-body effects, our study can test the potential of the BPDE approach to produce results close to the experimental values. Our numerical simulations reveal that the BPDE algorithm, in the Dirac-Coulomb-Breit framework, can predict fine structure splittings of ground states of the considered systems quite precisely. We performed our simulations of relativistic and electron correlation effects on Graphics Processing Unit by utilizing NVIDIA's cuQuantum, and observe a x42.7 speedup as compared to the Central Processing Unit-only simulations in an 18-qubit active space.

TI iQuantum: A toolkit for modeling and simulation of quantum computing
   environments
SO SOFTWARE-PRACTICE & EXPERIENCE
AB Quantum computing resources are predominantly accessible through cloud services, with a potential future shift to edge networks. This paradigm and the increasing global interest in quantum computing have amplified the need for efficient, adaptable resource management strategies and service models for quantum systems. However, many limitations in the quantum resources' quantity, quality, availability, and cost pose significant challenges for conducting research in practical environments. To address these challenges, we proposed iQuantum, a holistic and lightweight discrete-event simulation toolkit uniquely tailored to model hybrid quantum computing environments. We also present a detailed system model for prototyping and problem formulation in quantum resource management. Through rigorous empirical validation and evaluations using large-scale quantum workload datasets, we demonstrate the flexibility and applicability of our toolkit in various use cases. iQuantum provides a versatile environment for designing and evaluating quantum resource management policies such as quantum task scheduling, backend selection, hybrid task offloading, and orchestration in the quantum cloud-edge continuum. Our work endeavors to create substantial contributions to quantum computing modeling and simulation, empowering the creation of future resource management strategies and quantum computing's broader applications.

TI Atomic frequency comb optical memory in EuCl3•6H2O
   crystal
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB Quantum memory is a crucial component for the large-scale quantum networks. Rare-earth-ion doped crystals have been a promising candidate for the practical quantum memory because of its very long coherence time. However, doped ions cause unwanted lattice distortion, and consequently reduce the optical depth and the storage efficiency. The stoichiometric rare-earth crystals have low lattice distortion and high rare earth ion density, and thus are expected to enable high-efficiency storage. EuCl3 center dot 6H(2)O is a promising material for quantum memory applications because its optical inhomogeneous broadening can be smaller than its hyperfine splitting and the theoretically predicted spin coherence time is up to 1000 seconds. Despite the numerous efforts in solid-state quantum memory based on rare-earth ion doped crystals, optical memory and quantum memory have not been implemented with stoichiometric rare-earth crystals yet. Here, we report the atom frequency comb optical storage using a EuCl3 center dot 6H(2)O crystal. A coherence time of 55.7 mu s is obtained by photon echo measurements on F-7(0) -> D-5(0) transition. The two-level atomic frequency comb storage is demonstrated with a storage efficiency of 1.71% at a storage time of 1 mu s, showing the potential capability of optical quantum storage of this material. Based on the analysis of the line shift of F-7(0) -> D-5(0) depending on the sample temperature, we highlight the challenge of achieving high-efficiency optical pumping in this material, which imposes a limit on the achievable efficiency.

TI Learning a Quantum Computer's Capability
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM ENGINEERING
AB Accurately predicting a quantum computer's capability-which circuits it can run and how well it can run them-is a foundational goal of quantum characterization and benchmarking. As modern quantum computers become increasingly hard to simulate, we must develop accurate and scalable predictive capability models to help researchers and stakeholders decide which quantum computers to build and use. In this work, we propose a hardware-agnostic method to efficiently construct scalable predictive models of a quantum computer's capability for almost any class of circuits and demonstrate our method using convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Our CNN-based approach works by efficiently representing a circuit as a 3-D tensor and then using a CNN to predict its success rate. Our CNN capability models obtain approximately a 1% average absolute prediction error when modeling processors experiencing both Markovian and non-Markovian stochastic Pauli errors. We also apply our CNNs to model the capabilities of cloud-access quantum computing systems, obtaining moderate prediction accuracy (average absolute error around 2-5%), and we highlight the challenges to building better neural network capability models.

TI Quantum simulation of chiral phase transitions

AB The Nambu-Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model has been widely studied for investigating the chiral phase structure of strongly interacting matter. The study of the thermodynamics of field theories within the framework of Lattice Field Theory is limited by the sign problem, which prevents Monte Carlo evaluation of the functional integral at a finite chemical potential. Using the quantum imaginary time evolution (QITE) algorithm, we construct a quantum simulation for the (1 + 1) dimensional NJL model at finite temperature and finite chemical potential. We observe consistency among digital quantum simulation, exact diagonalization and analytical solution, indicating further applications of quantum computing in simulating QCD thermodynamics.

   entanglement
SO PHYSICA SCRIPTA
AB Based on the generalized Bloch representation, we study the separability and entanglement of arbitrary dimensional multipartite quantum states. Some sufficient and some necessary criteria are presented. For certain states, these criteria together are both sufficient and necessary. Detailed examples show that our criteria are better than some existing ones in identifying separability. Based on these criteria, the largest separable ball around the maximally mixed state for arbitrary multi-qubit systems is found, and it is proved that its radius defined via the l1-norm of the Bloch vector is the constant 1. Furthermore, the criteria in this paper can be implemented experimentally.

TI Re-pairing strategy for mode-pairing quantum key distribution
SO QUANTUM INFORMATION PROCESSING
AB Mode-pairing quantum key distribution (MP-QKD) leverages post-selection pairing strategy to achieve a balance between ease of implementation and high performance, establishing itself as a highly promising protocol in future QKD networks. However, the reliance on pairing strategies causes a considerable number of pulses to be excluded from parameter estimation and key generation, introducing inefficiencies and diminishing overall performance. In this study, we extend the original protocol by incorporating an active pairing strategy. This involves actively pairing clicking events that fall within the same phase slice, thereby generating new successful pairs and enabling the reutilization of previously discarded events. To validate the efficiency of our scheme, we conducted simulations of the three-intensity decoy-state MP-QKD protocol with the double-scanning method. The simulation results demonstrate significant advantages in both parameter estimation and final key generation. Therefore, this study provides valuable insights for advancing future MP-QKD experiments and applications.

TI Single-photon nonlocality in quantum networks
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB A single-photon maximally entangled state is obtained when a photon impinges on a balanced beamsplitter. Its nonlocal properties have been intensively debated in the quantum optics and foundations communities. It is however clear that a standard Bell test made only of passive optical elements cannot reveal the nonlocality of this state. We show that the nonlocality of single-photon entangled states can nevertheless be revealed in a quantum network made only of beamsplitters and photodetectors. In our protocol, three single-photon entangled states are distributed in a triangle network, introducing indeterminacy in the photons' paths and creating nonlocal correlations without the need for measurements choices. We discuss a concrete experimental realization and provide numerical evidence of the tolerance of our protocol to standard noise sources. Our results show that single-photon entanglement may constitute a promising solution to generate genuine network-nonlocal correlations useful for Bell-based quantum information protocols.

TI Tunable and Low-Noise WSe2 Quantum Emitters for Quantum Photonics
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Low-noise and tunable single-photon sources are essential components of photonic quantum technologies. However, in WSe2 quantum emitters, charge noise from fluctuations in their local electrostatic environment remains a major obstacle to achieving transform-limited single-photon emission and high photon indistinguishability. Here, we systematically investigate two noise mitigation strategies in hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN): encapsulation and electrostatic biasing. We demonstrate that h-BN encapsulation alone suppresses spectral wandering (from '-170 mu eV to '-40 mu eV) and narrows emission linewidths (from '-524 mu eV to '-120 mu eV), while applied bias enables stable Stark tuning over a 280 mu eV range and further linewidth narrowing down to '-100 mu eV, reaching the resolution-limited regime. Timeresolved and second-order correlation measurements confirm stable monoexponential decay and high single-photon purity [g(2)(0) '- 0.01] with no observable blinking. To quantify progress toward the transform limit, we define two figures of merit-the linewidth ratio R = Wexp/Wdec and total broadening OW = Wexp - Wdec-with both being reduced more than fivefold in optimized devices. These results provide a robust framework for developing and evaluating low-noise, tunable WSe2 quantum emitters, potentially realizing electrically controllable sources of indistinguishable single photons for future photonic quantum technologies.

The fundamental objective of general QRTs is to characterize these systems by precisely quantifying the level of control attainable to an experimenter. In this review article, we refrain from providing an exhaustive summary of the extensive literature on QRT. Rather, our focus centers on a specific subliterature founded upon the theory of majorization. The primary aim is to augment our comprehension of genuine quantum phenomena manifested across diverse technological applications and incite investigations into novel resource theories encompassing multiple types of resources. Consequently, we emphasize the underlying similarities shared by various resources, including bipartite quantum entanglement, quantum coherence, and superposition, alongside informational, thermal, and generalized nonequilibrium resources.

TI Origins and Mitigation of Scattering-Related Propagation Losses in
   Suspended GaAs Waveguides for Quantum Photonic Integrated Circuits
SO IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN QUANTUM ELECTRONICS
AB Quantum photonic integrated circuits (QPICs) offer a promising path toward scalable quantum technologies. QPICs rely on the integration of many quantum photonic components and interconnecting optical waveguides for generation, manipulation, and detection of single photons. A key challenge in QPICs is the management and minimization of optical losses, which is particularly critical for single-photon applications. In this paper, we investigate optical propagation losses in strip waveguides within suspended gallium arsenide (GaAs) platforms, which can directly host deterministic single-photon sources but suffer high scattering-related losses. We systematically analyze different scattering loss contributions by investigating four key waveguide perturbation types: sidewall roughness, top surface roughness, surface particles, and suspension tethers. Our approach combines rigorous 3D finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) simulations with experimental measurements to decouple and quantify individual contributions to the total propagation loss. We study two suspended GaAs platforms operating at different wavelengths: an established 930 nm platform and an emerging 1300 nm platform in the telecommunication O-band. Based on our findings, we identify the dominant scattering loss mechanisms and propose novel design-time guidelines and concrete strategies to reduce the main loss contributions by factors of 2.5-5. These improvements are crucial for enabling complex QPICs directly within the native platform of the single-photon source, supporting advances in integrated quantum technologies.

TI Quantum federated learning through blind quantum computing
SO SCIENCE CHINA-PHYSICS MECHANICS & ASTRONOMY
AB Private distributed learning studies the problem of how multiple distributed entities collaboratively train a shared deep network with their private data unrevealed. With the security provided by the protocols of blind quantum computation, the cooperation between quantum physics and machine learning may lead to unparalleled prospect for solving private distributed learning tasks. In this paper, we introduce a quantum protocol for distributed learning that is able to utilize the computational power of the remote quantum servers while keeping the private data safe. For concreteness, we first introduce a protocol for private single-party delegated training of variational quantum classifiers based on blind quantum computing and then extend this protocol to multiparty private distributed learning incorporated with differential privacy. We carry out extensive numerical simulations with different real-life datasets and encoding strategies to benchmark the effectiveness of our protocol. We find that our protocol is robust to experimental imperfections and is secure under the gradient attack after the incorporation of differential privacy. Our results show the potential for handling computationally expensive distributed learning tasks with privacy guarantees, thus providing a valuable guide for exploring quantum advantages from the security perspective in the field of machine learning with real-life applications.

TI Efficient measurement schemes for bosonic systems
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Boson is one of the most basic types of particles and preserves the commutation relation. An efficient way to measure a bosonic system is important not only for simulating complex physics phenomena of bosons (such as nuclei) on a qubit based quantum computer, but for extracting classical information from a quantum simulator/computer that itself is built with bosons (such as a continuous variable quantum computer). Extending the recently proposed measurement schemes for qubits, such as shadow tomography and other local measurement schemes, here we study efficient measurement approaches for bosonic systems. We consider truncated qudit and continuous variable systems, corresponding to simulated bosons on a discrete quantum computer and an inherent boson system, respectively, and propose different measurement schemes with theoretical analyses of the variances for these two cases. We numerically test the schemes for measuring nuclei vibrations simulated using a discrete quantum computer and a continuous variable Gaussian state, and the simulation results show great improvement of the performance of the proposed method compared to conventional ones.

TI Pairwise-Parallel Entangling Gates on Orthogonal Modes in a Trapped-Ion
   Chain
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB Parallel operations are important for both near-term quantum computers and larger-scale fault-tolerant machines because they reduce execution time and qubit idling. This study proposes and implements a pairwise-parallel gate scheme on a trapped-ion quantum computer. The gates are driven simultaneously on different sets of orthogonal motional modes of a trapped-ion chain. This work demonstrates the utility of this scheme by creating a Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) state in one step using parallel gates with one overlapping qubit. It also shows its advantage for circuits by implementing a digital quantum simulation of the dynamics of an interacting spin system, the transverse-field Ising model. This method effectively extends the available gate depth by up to two times with no overhead when no overlapping qubit is involved, apart from additional initial cooling. This scheme can be easily applied to different trapped-ion qubits and gate schemes, broadly enhancing the capabilities of trapped-ion quantum computers.

TI A Generative Neuro-Cognitive Architecture Using Quantum Algorithms for
   the Autonomous Behavior of a Smart Agent in a Simulation Environment
SO CMC-COMPUTERS MATERIALS & CONTINUA
AB This study aims to develop a quantum computing-based neurocognitive architecture that allows an agent to perform autonomous behaviors. Therefore, we present a brain-inspired cognitive architecture for autonomous agents that integrates a prefrontal cortex-inspired model with modern deep learning (a transformer-based reinforcement learning module) and quantum algorithms. In particular, our framework incorporates quantum computational routines (Deutsch-Jozsa, Bernstein-Vazirani, and Grover's search) to enhance decision-making efficiency. As a novelty of this research, this comprehensive computational structure is empowered by quantum computing operations so that superiority in speed and robustness of learning compared to classical methods can be demonstrated. Another main contribution is that the proposed architecture offers some features, such as meta-cognition and situation awareness. The meta-cognition aspect is responsible for hierarchically learning sub-tasks, enabling the agent to achieve the master goal. The situation-awareness property identifies how spatial-temporal reasoning activities related to the world model of the agent can be extracted in a dynamic simulation environment with unstructured uncertainties by quantum computation-based machine learning algorithms with the explainable artificial intelligence paradigm. In this research, the Minecraft game-based simulation environment is utilized for the experimental evaluation of performance and verification tests within complex, multi-objective tasks related to the autonomous behaviors of a smart agent. By implementing several interaction scenarios, the results of the system performance and comparative superiority over alternative solutions are presented, and it is discussed how these autonomous behaviors and cognitive skills of a smart agent can be improved in further studies. Results show that the quantum-enhanced agent achieves 2x faster convergence to an 80% task success rate in exploration tasks and approximately 15% higher cumulative rewards compared to a classical deep RL baseline. These findings demonstrate the potential of quantum algorithms to significantly improve learning and performance in cognitive agent architectures. However, advantages are task-specific and less pronounced under high-uncertainty, reactive scenarios. Limitations of the simulation environment are acknowledged, and a structured future research roadmap is proposed involving high-fidelity simulation validation, hardware-in-the-loop robotic testing, and integration of advanced hybrid quantum-classical architectures.

SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB Quantum communication networks enable applications ranging from highly secure communication to clock synchronization and distributed quantum computing. Miniaturized, flexible, and cost-efficient resources will be key elements for ensuring the scalability of such networks as they progress towards large-scale deployed infrastructures. Here, we bring these elements together by combining an on-chip, telecom-wavelength, broadband entangled photon source with industry-grade flexible-grid wavelength division multiplexing techniques, to demonstrate reconfigurable entanglement distribution between up to 8 users in a resource-optimized quantum network topology. As a benchmark application we use quantum key distribution, and show low error and high secret key generation rates across several frequency channels, over both symmetric and asymmetric metropolitan-distance optical fibered links and including finite-size effects. By adapting the bandwidth allocation to specific network constraints, we also illustrate the flexible networking capability of our configuration. Together with the potential of our semiconductor source for distributing secret keys over a 60 nm bandwidth with commercial multiplexing technology, these results offer a promising route to the deployment of scalable quantum network architectures.

SO APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS
AB Integrated quantum photonics, with potential applications in quantum information processing, relies on the integration of quantum emitters into on-chip photonic circuits. Hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) is recognized as a material that is compatible with such implementations, owing to its relatively high refractive index and low losses in the visible range, together with advantageous fabrication techniques. Here, we combine hBN waveguide nanofabrication with the recently demonstrated local generation of quantum emitters using electron irradiation to realize a fully top-down elementary quantum photonic circuit in this material, operating at room temperature. This proof of principle constitutes a first step toward deterministic quantum photonic circuits in hBN.

TI Early steps toward practical subsurface computations with quantum
   computing
SO FRONTIERS IN COMPUTER SCIENCE
AB Quantum computing exploits quantum mechanics to perform certain computations more efficiently than classical computers. Current quantum computers have performed carefully tailored computational tasks that would be difficult or impossible for even the fastest supercomputers in the world. This "quantum supremacy" result demonstrates that quantum computing is more powerful than classical computing in some computational regimes. At present, it is unknown if any computational problems related to the Earth's subsurface fall within these regimes. Here, we describe an approach to performing seismic inverse analysis that combines a type of quantum computer called a quantum annealer with classical computing. This approach improves upon past work on applying quantum computing to the subsurface (via subsurface hydrology) in two ways. First, the seismic inverse problem enables better performance from the quantum annealer because of the Earth's relatively narrow distribution of P-wave velocities compared to the broad distribution of hydraulic conductivities. Second, we develop an iterative approach to quantum-computational inverse analysis, which works with a realistic set of observations. By contrast, the previous method used an inverse method that depended on an impractically dense set of observations. In combination, these two advances significantly narrow the gap a quantum-computational advantage for a practical subsurface geoscience problem. Closing the gap completely requires more work, but has the potential to dramatically accelerate inverse analyses for subsurface geoscience.

AB Scientific applications are starting to explore the viability of quantum computing. This exploration typically begins with quantum simulations that can run on existing classical platforms, albeit without the performance advantages of real quantum resources. In the context of high-performance computing (HPC), the incorporation of simulation software can often take advantage of the powerful resources to help scale-up the simulation size. The configuration, installation and operation of these quantum simulation packages on HPC resources can often be rather daunting and increases friction for experimentation by scientific application developers. We describe a framework to help streamline access to quantum simulation software running on HPC resources. This includes an interface for circuit-based quantum computing tasks, as well as the necessary resource management infrastructure to make effective use of the underlying HPC resources. The primary contributions of this work include a classification of different usage models for quantum simulation in an HPC context, a review of the software architecture for our approach and a detailed description of the prototype implementation to experiment with these ideas using two different simulators (TNQVM & NWQ-Sim). We include initial experimental results running on the Frontier supercomputer at the Oak Ridge Leadership Computing Facility (OLCF) using a synthetic workload generated via the SupermarQ quantum benchmarking framework.

TI Jahn-Teller effect for controlling quantum correlations in hexanuclear

SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB We theoretically investigate the low-temperature magnetic and quantum properties of hexanuclear Fe-6(3+) complexes under an external magnetic field. We primarily study the impact of competing exchange interactions and their asymmetries induced by the Jahn-Teller distortion on the quantum properties of the complexes. The inequality in exchange interactions lifts the ground-state degeneracy that gives rise to complex quantum behavior. By constructing the ground-state phase diagram and analyzing magnetization, we identify key magnetic phases and critical phenomena. We further quantify quantum correlations using tripartite entanglement negativity and conditional von Neumann entropy to unveil how the Jahn-Teller effect enhances intra-triangle entanglement while modulating inter-triangle correlations. Our findings highlight the Fe-6(3+) complex as a promising molecular platform for tunable quantum correlations, with potential applications in quantum information processing and molecular qubits.

TI A chip-scale polarization-spatial-momentum quantum SWAP gate in silicon
   nanophotonics
SO NATURE PHOTONICS
AB A deterministic single-photon two-qubit SWAP gate between polarization and spatial-momentum is demonstrated on a silicon chip. A two-qubit swapping process fidelity of 94.9% is obtained. The coherence preservation of the SWAP gate process is verified by two-photon interference.
   Recent progress in quantum computing and networking has enabled high-performance, large-scale quantum processors by connecting different quantum modules. Optical quantum systems show advantages in both computing and communications, and integrated quantum photonics further increases the level of scaling and complexity. Here we demonstrate an efficient SWAP gate that deterministically swaps a photon's polarization qubit with its spatial-momentum qubit on a nanofabricated two-level silicon photonics chip containing three cascaded gates. The on-chip SWAP gate is comprehensively characterized by tomographic measurements with high fidelity for both single-qubit and two-qubit operation. The coherence preservation of the SWAP gate process is verified by single-photon and two-photon quantum interference. The coherent reversible conversion of our SWAP gate facilitates examinations of a quantum interconnect between two chip-scale photonic subsystems with different degrees of freedom, now demonstrated by distributing four Bell states between the two chips. We also elucidate the source of decoherence in the SWAP operation in pursuit of near-unity fidelity. Our deterministic SWAP gate in the silicon platform provides a pathway towards integrated quantum information processing for interconnected modular systems.

TI Compact Non-Degenerate Entangled-Photon Source and
   Near-Infrared-To-Telecom Quantum Teleportation
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB The polarization-entangled photon source (PEPS) at non-degenerated wavelengths is pivotal to connect quantum systems working at different wavelengths, with the assistance of quantum teleportation. Here, a compact Sagnac-type photon source is designed and demonstrated, in which two photons with wavelengths at 810 and 1550 nm are highly entangled in polarization degree of freedom. The two photons are generated from a periodically poled lithium niobate crystal pumped with a 532 nm continuous-wave laser, via type-0 nondegenerate spontaneous parametric down-conversion. The polarization of three lights is rotated by a single periscope, which makes the Sagnac interferometer compact and stable. The generated two photons are with high brightness of pairs/s/mW, which are highly entangled with fidelity of . The entanglement is verified by violating the Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt inequality with . Finally, teleportation is demonstrated with this nondegenerate source, in which photonic states at 810 nm is teleported to 1550 nm with fidelity of .

TI Advances and opportunities in materials science for scalable quantum
   computing
SO MRS BULLETIN
AB By harnessing unique quantum mechanical phenomena, such as superposition and entanglement, quantum computers offer the possibility to drastically outperform classical computers for certain classes of problems. The realization of this potential, however, presents a substantial challenge, because noise and imperfections associated with the materials used to fabricate devices can obscure the delicate quantum mechanical effects that enable quantum computing. Hence, progress in synthesis, characterization, and modeling of materials for quantum computing have driven many exciting advances in recent years and will become increasingly important in the years to come. As progressively more complex, multi-qubit systems come online, and as significant government and industrial investment drives research forward, new challenges and opportunities for materials science continue to emerge. The articles in this issue survey the current state of materials science progress and obstacles for some leading quantum computing platforms; opportunities for deeper involvement by materials scientists abound. Ultimate realization of the full potential of quantum computers will require a multidisciplinary effort spanning many traditional areas of expertise.

TI Gapless Single-Spin Qubit
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB All-electrical baseband control of qubits facilitates scaling up quantum processors by removing issues of crosstalk and heat generation. In semiconductor quantum dots, this is enabled by multispin qubit encodings, such as the exchange-only qubit. However, their performance is limited by unavoidable leakage states that are energetically close to the computational subspace. In this Letter, we introduce an alternative, scalable spin qubit architecture that leverages strong spin-orbit interactions of hole nanostructures for baseband qubit operations while completely eliminating leakage channels and reducing the overall gate overhead. This encoding is intrinsically robust to local variability in hole spin properties and operates with two degenerate states, removing the need for precise calibration and mitigating heat generation from fast signal sources. Finally, our architecture is fully compatible with current technology, utilizing the same initialization, readout, and multiqubit protocols of state-of-the-art spin-1/2 systems. By addressing critical scalability challenges, our design offers a robust and scalable pathway for semiconductor spin qubit technologies.

TI Transfer and teleportation of system-environment entanglement
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We study bidirectional teleportation while explicitly taking into account a mixed environment. This environment initially causes pure dephasing decoherence of the Bell state which assists teleportation. We find that when teleportation is performed in one direction it is accompanied by a transfer of correlations into the teleported qubit state. In the other direction, if no new decoherence process occurs then not only the state of the qubit, but also its correlations with the environment are teleported with unit fidelity. These processes do not depend on the measurement outcome during teleportation and do not differentiate between classical and quantum decoherence. If, on the other hand, the second teleportation step is preceded by decoherence of the Bell state then the situation is much more complicated. Teleportation and transfer of correlations occur simultaneously, yielding different teleported qubit-environment states for different measurement outcomes. These states can differ in the degree of coherence of the teleported qubit, but only for an entangling Bell-state-environment interaction in the first step can they have different amounts of qubit-environment entanglement. In the extreme case, one of the teleported qubit states can be entangled with the environment while the other is separable.

TI MIMO Terahertz Quantum Key Distribution
SO IEEE COMMUNICATIONS LETTERS
AB We propose a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) quantum key distribution (QKD) scheme for terahertz (THz) frequency applications operating at room temperature. Motivated by classical MIMO communications, a transmit-receive beamforming scheme is proposed that converts the rank-r MIMO channel between Alice and Bob into r parallel lossy quantum channels. Compared with existing single-antenna QKD schemes, we demonstrate that the MIMO QKD scheme leads to performance improvements by increasing the secret key rate and extending the transmission distance. Our simulation results show that multiple antennas are necessary to overcome the high free-space path loss at THz frequencies. We demonstrate a non-monotonic relation between performance and frequency, and reveal that positive key rates are achievable in the 10 - 30 THz frequency range. The proposed scheme can be used for both indoor and outdoor QKD applications for beyond fifth generation ultra-secure wireless communications systems.

TI Parametric controllable one-way quantum steering induced by four-wave
   mixing in cavity magnonics
SO EPJ QUANTUM TECHNOLOGY
AB Quantum steering plays a crucial role in quantum communication and one-way quantum computation. Here, we study quantum steering between two magnon modes in a cavity-magnonics system by applying a two-photon drive field to the microwave cavity. The two magnon modes are entangled and the one-way steering can be implemented when the four-wave mixing is triggered. Different from most schemes that use the dissipation of the system to control quantum steering, in our scheme the one-way steering can be modulated on demand by adjusting the coherent coupling ratio between the two magnons and the cavity, which provides a flexible and feasible way in experiments. We also reveal that the directionality of quantum steering is related to the mode populations, i.e., the mode with a larger population dominants the steering. Our study has high manipulability and may provide a promising platform for one-way quantum computing and communications based on macroscopic entanglement state.

TI A review on practical challenges of aerial quantum communication
SO PHYSICS OPEN
AB The increasing demand for the realization of global-scale quantum communication services necessitates critical investigation for a practical quantum secure communication network that relies on full-time all-location coverage. In this direction, the non-terrestrial quantum key distribution is expected to play an important role in providing agility, maneuverability, relay link, on-demand network, and last -mile coverage. In this work, we have summarized the research and development that has happened until now in the domain of quantum communication using non-terrestrial platforms with a specific focus on the associated challenges and the relevant models. Further, to extend the analysis beyond the existing know-how, a hybrid model involving the features of Vasylyev et al.'s model and Liorni et al.'s model is introduced here. The hybrid model entails us adapting a spherical beam to an elliptic beam approximation and effectively capturing the characteristics of transmittance in densely humid weather conditions and at low altitudes.

TI Quantum separability criteria based on realignment moments
SO QUANTUM INFORMATION PROCESSING
AB Quantum entanglement is the core resource in quantum information processing and quantum computing. It is a significant challenge to effectively characterize the entanglement of quantum states. Recently, elegant separability criterion is presented by Elben et al. (Phys Rev Lett 125:200501, 2020) based on the first three partially transposed (PT) moments of density matrices. Then, Yu et al. (Phys Rev Lett 127:060504, 2021) proposed two general powerful criteria based on the PT moments. In this paper, based on the realignment operations of matrices we propose entanglement detection criteria in terms of such realignment moments. We show by detailed example that the realignment moments can also be used to identify quantum entanglement.

TI A two-way photonic quantum entanglement transfer interface
SO NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB A quantum interface for two-way entanglement transfer, e.g., between orbital angular momentum degree of freedom in free space and time-energy degree of freedom in optical fibers, provides a way toward establishing entanglement between remote heterogeneous quantum nodes. Here, we experimentally demonstrate this kind of transfer interface by using two interferometric cyclic gates. By using this quantum interface, we perform two-way entanglement transfer for the two degrees of freedom. The results show that the quantum entangled state can be switched back and forth between orbital angular momentum and time-energy degrees of freedom, and the fidelity of the state before and after switching is higher than 90%. Our work demonstrates the feasibility and high performance of our proposed transfer interface, and paves a route toward building a large-scale quantum communication network.

AB With the increased real-world deployment of quantum computers, there is a security need to be able to fingerprint and track their equipment. This work proposes that cryogenic equipment used in superconducting qubit quantum computers could leverage inexpensive SRAM-based PUFs as fingerprints. This work is the first to perform a security evaluation of SRAM PUFs under cryogenic conditions using liquid nitrogen to rapidly freeze the memories to temperatures approaching -195. (-320 degrees F or 77K). This work demonstrates that SRAM PUFs can become more stable under cryogenic conditions. As a result, a possible novel application of the SRAM PUFs is to identify and track quantum computer cryogenic hardware. Other means of fingerprinting quantum computer equipment are also possible, for example, based on the frequency of qubits. The ability to fingerprint quantum computers can be on one hand beneficial, to track the equipment, but on the other detrimental as attackers with access to the fingerprints could identify specific machines. Understanding the benefits and dangers of fingerprinting quantum computers, and securely deploying fingerprinting mechanisms is necessary to protect these emerging computing platforms.

TI Finding Debt Cycles: QUBO Formulations for the Maximum Weighted Cycle
   Problem Solved Using Quantum Annealing
SO MATHEMATICS
AB The problem of finding the maximum weighted cycle in a directed graph map to solve optimization problems is NP-hard, implying that approaches in classical computing are inefficient. Here, Quantum computing might be a promising alternative. Many current approaches to the quantum computer are based on a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problem formulation. This paper develops four different QUBO approaches to this problem. The first two take the starting vertex and the number of vertices used in the cycle as given, while the latter two loosen the second assumption of knowing the size of the cycle. A QUBO formulation is derived for each approach. Further, the number of binary variables required to encode the maximum weighted cycle problem with one or both assumptions for the respective approach is made explicit. The problem is motivated by finding the maximum weighted debt cycle in a debt graph. This paper compares classical computing versus currently available (hybrid) quantum computing approaches for various debt graphs. For the classical part, it investigated the Depth-First-Search (DFS) method and Simulated Annealing. For the (hybrid) quantum approaches, a direct embedding on the quantum annealer and two types of quantum hybrid solvers were utilized. Simulated Annealing and the usage of the hybrid CQM (Constrained Quadratic Model) had promising functionality. The DFS method, direct QPU, and hybrid BQM (Binary Quadratic Model), on the other hand, performed less due to memory issues, surpassing the limit of decision variables and finding the right penalty values, respectively.

TI Single-Shot Readout and Weak Measurement of a Tin-Vacancy Qubit in
   Diamond
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW X
AB The negatively charged tin-vacancy center in diamond (SnV-) is an emerging platform for building the next generation of long-distance quantum networks. This is due to the SnV-'s favorable optical and spin properties including bright emission, insensitivity to electronic noise, and long spin coherence times at temperatures above 1 K. Here, we demonstrate measurement of a single SnV- electronic spin with a singleshot readout fidelity of 87.4%, which can be further improved to 98.5% by conditioning on multiple readouts. In the process, we develop understanding of the relationship between strain, magnetic field, spin readout, and microwave spin control. We show that high-fidelity readout is compatible with rapid microwave spin control, demonstrating a favorable parameter regime for use of the SnV- center as a highquality spin-photon interface. Finally, we use weak quantum measurement to study measurement-induced dephasing; this illuminates the fundamental interplay between measurement and decoherence in quantum mechanics, and provides a universal method to characterize the efficiency of color-center spin readout. Taken together, these results overcome an important hurdle in the development of the SnV--based quantum technologies and, in the process, develop techniques and understanding broadly applicable to the study of solid-state quantum emitters.

TI Emulating quantum computing with optical matrix multiplication
SO APL PHOTONICS
AB Optical computing harnesses the speed of light to perform vector-matrix operations efficiently. It leverages interference, a cornerstone of quantum computing algorithms, to enable parallel computations. In this work, we interweave quantum computing with classical structured light by formulating the process of photonic matrix multiplication using quantum mechanical principles such as state superposition and subsequently demonstrate a well-known algorithm, namely, Deutsch-Jozsa's algorithm. This is accomplished by elucidating the inherent tensor product structure within the Cartesian transverse degrees of freedom of light, which is the main resource for optical vector-matrix multiplication. To this end, we establish a discrete basis using localized Gaussian modes arranged in a lattice formation and demonstrate the operation of a Hadamard gate. Leveraging the reprogrammable and digital capabilities of spatial light modulators, coupled with Fourier transforms by lenses, our approach proves adaptable to various algorithms. Therefore, our work advances the use of structured light for quantum information processing. (c) 2024 Author(s).

TI VQE-generated quantum circuit dataset for machine learning
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Quantum machine learning has the potential to computationally outperform classical machine learning, but it is not yet clear whether it will actually be valuable for practical problems. While some artificial scenarios have shown that certain quantum machine learning techniques may be advantageous compared to their classical counterpart, evidence does not yet suggest that quantum machine learning has surpassed conventional approaches in dealing with standard classical datasets, such as the MNIST dataset. In contrast, dealing with quantum data, such as quantum states or circuits, may be the task where we can benefit from quantum methods. Therefore, it is important to develop practically meaningful quantum datasets for which we expect quantum methods to be superior. In this paper, we propose a machine learning task that is likely to soon arise in the real world: clustering and classification of quantum circuits. We provide a dataset of quantum circuits optimized by the variational quantum eigensolver. We utilized six common types of Hamiltonians in condensed matter physics, with a range of 4-20 qubits, and applied ten different ansatz with varying depths (ranging from 3 to 32) to generate a quantum circuit dataset of six distinct classes, each containing 300 samples. We show that this dataset can be easily learned using quantum methods. In particular, we demonstrate a successful classification of our dataset using real four-qubit devices available through IBMQ. By providing a setting and an elementary dataset where quantum machine learning is expected to be beneficial, we hope to encourage and ease the advancement of the field.

TI Proposal for a Lorenz qubit
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Nonlinear qubit master equations have recently been shown to exhibit rich dynamical phenomena such as period doubling, Hopf bifurcation, and strange attractors usually associated with classical nonlinear systems. Here we investigate nonlinear qubit models that support tunable Lorenz attractors. A Lorenz qubit could be realized experimentally by combining qubit torsion, generated by real or simulated mean field dynamics, with linear amplification and dissipation. This would extend engineered Lorenz systems to the quantum regime, allowing for their direct experimental study and possible application to quantum information processing.

Here, on the basis of the Gaussian Renyi-2 entropy, we analyze entanglement and quantum discord in a two-mode Gaussian state rho AB\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$\rho _{AB}$$\end{document}. The mode A(B) is generated within the first (second) transition of a nondegenerate three-level cascade laser. Using realistic experimental parameters, we show that both entanglement and discord could be generated and enhanced by inducing more quantum coherence. Under thermal noise, entanglement is found more fragile having a tendency to disappear rapidly, while quantum discord exhibits a freezing behavior, where it can be captured within a wide range of temperature. Surprisingly, we find that entanglement can exceed quantum discord in contrary to the expectation based on the assumption that the former is only a part of the later. Finally, we show numerically as well as analytically that optimal quantum discord can be captured by performing Gaussian measurements on mode B. The obtained results suggest that nondegenerate three-level lasers may be a valuable resource for some quantum information tasks, especially for those who do not require entanglement.

TI Sufficient Condition for Universal Quantum Computation Using Bosonic
   Circuits
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Continuous-variable bosonic systems stand as prominent candidates for implementing quantum computational tasks. While various necessary criteria have been established to assess their resourcefulness, sufficient conditions have remained elusive. We address this gap by focusing on promoting circuits that are otherwise simulatable to computational universality. The class of simulatable, albeit non-Gaussian, circuits that we consider is composed of Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) states, Gaussian operations, and homodyne measurements. Based on these circuits, we first introduce a general framework for mapping a continuous-variable state into a qubit state. Subsequently, we cast existing maps into this framework, including the modular and stabilizer subsystem decompositions. By combining these findings with established results for discrete-variable systems, we formulate a sufficient condition for achieving universal quantum computation. Leveraging this, we evaluate the computational resourcefulness of a variety of states, including Gaussian states, finite-squeezing GKP states, and cat states. Furthermore, our framework reveals that both the stabilizer subsystem decomposition and the modular subsystem decomposition (of position-symmetric states) can be constructed in terms of simulatable operations. This establishes a robust resource-theoretical foundation for employing these techniques to evaluate the logical content of a generic continuous-variable state, which can be of independent interest.

TI Simultaneous single-qubit driving of semiconductor spin qubits at the
   fault-tolerant threshold
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB As the size of quantum processors scales up, accurate characterization of errors due to various crosstalks between qubits becomes important. Here the authors use a novel benchmarking protocol to study single-gate fidelities in a 2x2 hole spin qubit array in germanium when qubits are driven simultaneously.
   Practical Quantum computing hinges on the ability to control large numbers of qubits with high fidelity. Quantum dots define a promising platform due to their compatibility with semiconductor manufacturing. Moreover, high-fidelity operations above 99.9% have been realized with individual qubits, though their performance has been limited to 98.67% when driving two qubits simultaneously. Here we present single-qubit randomized benchmarking in a two-dimensional array of spin qubits, finding native gate fidelities as high as 99.992(1)%. Furthermore, we benchmark single qubit gate performance while simultaneously driving two and four qubits, utilizing a novel benchmarking technique called N-copy randomized benchmarking, designed for simple experimental implementation and accurate simultaneous gate fidelity estimation. We find two- and four-copy randomized benchmarking fidelities of 99.905(8)% and 99.34(4)% respectively, and that next-nearest neighbor pairs are highly robust to cross-talk errors. These characterizations of single-qubit gate quality are crucial for scaling up quantum information technology.

AB Nowadays, employing deep learning for Structural Health Monitoring is a common practice. However, one of the main challenges here is the lack of data. Several methods have been developed to address this issue. Quantum machine learning is known to be trained faster and with less data, therefore, it could be a suitable option to be used for this purpose. However, since at the current stage limited numbers of qubits can remain stable at the same time, hybrid quantum-classical deep learning approaches can be a replacement. In this study, the benefit of incorporating a quantum layer into a classical deep learner for detecting damage is investigated. For this purpose, a deep learning model with and without a quantum layer is used to predict damage in a wind turbine blade by using ultrasonic inspection data. The results indicate the benefit of employing hybrid quantum-classical ML in detecting damage.

TI Haplotype-resolved assembly of diploid and polyploid genomes using

SO CELL REPORTS METHODS
AB Precision medicine's emphasis on individual genetic variants highlights the importance of haplotyperesolved assembly, a computational challenge in bioinformatics given its combinatorial nature. While classical algorithms have made strides in addressing this issue, the potential of quantum computing remains largely untapped. Here, we present the vehicle routing problem (VRP) assembler: an approach that transforms this task into a vehicle routing problem, an optimization formulation solvable on a quantum computer. We demonstrate its potential and feasibility through a proof of concept on short synthetic diploid and triploid genomes using a D-Wave quantum annealer. To tackle larger-scale assembly problems, we integrate the VRP assembler with Google's OR-Tools, achieving a haplotype-resolved local assembly across the human major histocompatibility complex (MHC) region. Our results show encouraging performance compared to Hifiasm with phasing accuracy approaching the theoretical limit, underscoring the promising future of quantum computing in bioinformatics.

TI An approach for automated generation of quantum computing models using
   deep learning
SO AIN SHAMS ENGINEERING JOURNAL
AB Quantum computing promises remarkable computational power with minimal energy consumption. However, the complexity of developing quantum circuits and codes hinders fully exploiting this potential. The study proposes an approach based on the automatic quantum circuit and code generation based on deep learning. It enables the resynthesis of existing circuits and the creation of new ones from undefined inputs. The system transforms inputs into reversible truth tables, generates a quantum unitary matrix, corrects errors, optimizes it, and converts it into a quantum code or circuit. This approach has been implemented on circuits and codes that involve up to five variables. Rigorous evaluations include both the Deep Neural Network and the overall approach. Although the DNN output does not guarantee absolute correctness, our approach compensates with supplementary processes, ensuring the precise generation of quantum codes and circuits. Comprehensive testing confirmed the approach's effectiveness in overcoming challenges in quantum circuit and code development.

TI Realization of high-fidelity and robust geometric gates with
   time-optimal control technique in superconducting quantum circuit
SO CHINESE PHYSICS B
AB One of the key features required to realize fault-tolerant quantum computation is the robustness of quantum gates against errors. Since geometric quantum gate is naturally insensitivity to noise, it appears to be a promising routine to achieve high-fidelity, robust quantum gates. The implementation of geometric quantum gate however faces some troubles such as its complex interaction among multiple energy levels. Moreover, traditional geometric schemes usually take more time than equivalent dynamical ones. Here, we experimentally demonstrate a geometric gate scheme with the time-optimal control (TOC) technique in a superconducting quantum circuit. With a transmon qubit and operations restricted to two computational levels, we implement a set of geometric gates which exhibit better robustness features against control errors than the dynamical counterparts. The measured fidelities of TOC X gate and X/2 gate are 99.81% and 99.79% respectively. Our work shows a promising routine toward scalable fault-tolerant quantum computation.

TI Logical quantum processor based on reconfigurable atom arrays
SO NATURE
AB Suppressing errors is the central challenge for useful quantum computing1, requiring quantum error correction (QEC)2-6 for large-scale processing. However, the overhead in the realization of error-corrected 'logical' qubits, in which information is encoded across many physical qubits for redundancy2-4, poses substantial challenges to large-scale logical quantum computing. Here we report the realization of a programmable quantum processor based on encoded logical qubits operating with up to 280 physical qubits. Using logical-level control and a zoned architecture in reconfigurable neutral-atom arrays7, our system combines high two-qubit gate fidelities8, arbitrary connectivity7,9, as well as fully programmable single-qubit rotations and mid-circuit readout10-15. Operating this logical processor with various types of encoding, we demonstrate improvement of a two-qubit logic gate by scaling surface-code6 distance from d = 3 to d = 7, preparation of colour-code qubits with break-even fidelities5, fault-tolerant creation of logical Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) states and feedforward entanglement teleportation, as well as operation of 40 colour-code qubits. Finally, using 3D [[8,3,2]] code blocks16,17, we realize computationally complex sampling circuits18 with up to 48 logical qubits entangled with hypercube connectivity19 with 228 logical two-qubit gates and 48 logical CCZ gates20. We find that this logical encoding substantially improves algorithmic performance with error detection, outperforming physical-qubit fidelities at both cross-entropy benchmarking and quantum simulations of fast scrambling21,22. These results herald the advent of early error-corrected quantum computation and chart a path towards large-scale logical processors.
   A programmable quantum processor based on encoded logical qubits operating with up to 280 physical qubits is described, in which improvement of algorithmic performance using a variety of error-correction codes is enabled.

TI High key rate continuous-variable quantum key distribution using telecom
   optical components
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB Quantum key distribution (QKD) is one quantum technology that can provide secure encryption keys for data transmission. The secret key rate (SKR) is a core performance indicator in QKD, which directly determines the transmission rate of enciphered data. Here, for the first time, we demonstrate a high-key-rate Gaussian-modulated continuous-variable QKD (CV-QKD) using telecom optical components. The framework of CV-QKD over these components is constructed. Specifically, the high-rate low-noise Gaussian modulation of coherent states is realized by a classical optical IQ modulator. High-baud low-intensity quantum signals are received by an integrated coherent receiver under the shot-noise limit. A series of digital signal processing algorithms are proposed to achieve accurate signal recovery and key distillation. The system can yield a high asymptotic SKR of 10.37 Mbps within 20 km standard telecom fiber, and the secure distance can exceed 100 km. This result confirms the feasibility of CV-QKD with state-of-the-art performance using telecom optical components. Besides, due to the ease of integrating these discrete components, it provides a high-performance and miniaturized QKD solution for the metropolitan quantum network.

TI A Scalable Emulator for Quantum Fourier Transform Using Multiple-FPGAs
   with High-Bandwidth-Memory
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Quantum computing is regarded as the future of computing that hopefully provides exponentially large processing power compared to the conventional digital computing. However, current quantum computers do not have the capability to correct errors caused by environmental noise, so that it is difficult to run useful algorithms that require deep quantum circuits. Therefore, emulation of quantum circuits in digital computers is essential. However, emulation of large quantum circuits requires enormous amount of computations, and leads to a very large processing time. To reduce the processing time, we propose an FPGA emulator with high-bandwidth-memory to emulate quantum Fourier transform (QFT), which is a major part of many quantum algorithms. The proposed FPGA emulator is scalable in terms of both processing speed and the number of qubits, and extendable to multiple FPGAs. We performed QFT emulations up to 30 qubits using two FPGAs. According to the measured results, we have achieved 23.6 similar to 24.5 times speed-up compared to a fully optimized 24-core CPU emulator.

TI A reconfigurable entanglement distribution network suitable for
   connecting multiple ground nodes with a satellite
SO EPJ QUANTUM TECHNOLOGY
AB Satellite-based quantum communication channels are important for ultra-long distances. Given the short duration of a satellite pass, it can be challenging to efficiently connect multiple users of a city-wide network while the satellite is passing over that area. We propose a network with dual-functionality: during a brief satellite pass, the ground network is configured as a multipoint-to-point topology where all ground nodes establish entanglement with a satellite receiver. During times when this satellite is not available, the satellite up-link is rerouted via a single optical switch to the ground nodes, and the network is configured as a pair-wise ground network. We numerically simulate a pulsed hyper-entangled photon source and study the performance of the proposed network configurations for quantum key distribution. We find favourable scaling in the case that the satellite receiver exploits time-multiplexing whereas the ground nodes utilize frequency-multiplexing. The scalability, simple reconfigurability, and easy integration with fibre networks make this architecture a promising candidate for quantum communication of many ground nodes and a satellite, an important step towards interconnection of ground nodes at a global scale.

In the pursuit of the tantalizing promises of a universal quantum computer, a multitude of new knowledge and expertise has been developed, enabling the construction of novel quantum algorithms as well as increasingly robust quantum hardware. In particular, we have witnessed rapid progress in the circuit quantum electrodynamics (cQED) technology, which has emerged as one of the most promising physical systems that is capable of addressing the key challenges in realizing full-stack quantum computing on a large scale. In this Tutorial, we present some of the most crucial building blocks developed by the cQED community in recent years and a precis of the latest achievements towards robust universal quantum computation. More importantly, we aim to provide a synoptic outline of the core techniques that underlie most cQED experiments and offer a practical guide for a novice experimentalist to design, construct, and characterize their first quantum device.

TI PegasosQSVM: A Quantum Machine Learning Approach for Accurate Fake News
   Detection
SO APPLIED ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE
AB The rapid spread of fake news on social media poses a significant threat to modern societies. Traditional machine learning approaches have limitations in handling the ever-increasing volume and complexity of data. This research explores quantum machine learning for fake news classification by proposing Pegasos Quantum Support Vector Machines, a novel algorithm combining Pegasos Support Vector Machines with quantum kernels, and advanced data encoding. Through experimentation on the IBM Qasm Simulator, Pegasos Quantum Support Vector Machines scored 90.67% in accuracy. This study is primarily focused on local simulation, where the proposed algorithm scored as high as 95.63%, with 95.44% precision, 99.52% recall, and 96.76% f1-score. The achieved results outperform other machine learning methods on the BUZZFEED dataset, including Quantum Neural Networks and Quantum K-Nearest Neighbors. Its successful implementation paves the way for further refinement of quantum machine learning techniques in fake news classification. The PegasosQSVM algorithm encounters, however, some implementation issues on real world Quantum Processing Units(QPU). Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum era QPU are prone to noise effects that affect the computations negatively, and by extension, the results of quantum machine learning algorithms. Further implementation on real QPU and use of error mitigation techniques, are needed for optimal results on quantum hardware.

TI Measurement Cost of Metric-Aware Variational Quantum Algorithms
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB We consider metric-aware quantum algorithms that use a quantum computer to efficiently estimate both a matrix and a vector object. For example, the recently introduced quantum natural gradient approach uses the Fisher matrix as a metric tensor to correct the gradient vector for the codependence of the circuit parameters. We rigorously characterize and upper bound the number of measurements required to determine an iteration step to a fixed precision, and propose a general approach for optimally distributing samples between matrix and vector entries. Finally, we establish that the number of circuit repetitions needed for estimating the quantum Fisher information matrix is asymptotically negligible for an increasing number of iterations and qubits.

TI On-demand provisioning strategy for inter-domain key services in
   multi-domain cross-protocol quantum networks
SO ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
AB Most of the existing metropolitan quantum networks are implemented based on a single quantum key distribution protocol, and interconnecting metropolitan quantum networks implemented by different protocols are the development trend of large-scale quantum networks, but there are still some problems in the provision of inter-domain key services, such as low possibility of success and mismatch between key supply and demand. To solve the above problems, this paper proposes two on-demand inter-domain key service provisioning strategies for multi-domain cross-protocol quantum networks, namely, on-demand provisioning strategy based on BB84 bypass first (BB84-BF) and on-demand provisioning strategy based on MDI bypass first (MDI-BF). Meanwhile, a service provisioning model for multi-domain cross-protocol quantum networks is constructed, and an on-demand inter-domain key service provisioning algorithm is designed. Moreover, numerical simulations and performance evaluation are carried out under two scenarios: high key rate demand and low key rate demand for two-domain and three-domain quantum network topologies. Simulation results verify that the proposed on-demand provisioning strategies have better applicability to different multi-domain quantum networks. In addition, for different key rate requirements, the MDI-BF strategy and BB84-BF strategys have different performance advantages under different performance indicators. For example, in terms of the success possibility of inter-domain key service requests, the MDI-BF strategy is more suitable for the low key rate requirements (similar to 30% higher than the traditional strategies in two domain topologies), while the BB84-BF strategy is more suitable for the high key rate requirements (similar to 19% higher than the traditional strategies under two domain topologies). In addition, compared with the traditional strategies, the proposed on-demand provisioning strategies can increase the balance degree between key supply and demand by more than one order of magnitude. Hence, the proposed strategies can reduce the cost of inter-domain key service provisioning and improve the realistic security level.

TI State Preparation on Quantum Computers via Quantum Steering
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM ENGINEERING
AB Quantum computers present a compelling platform for the study of open quantum systems, namely, the nonunitary dynamics of a system. Here, we investigate and report digital simulations of Markovian nonunitary dynamics that converge to a unique steady state. The steady state is programmed as a desired target state, yielding semblance to a quantum state preparation protocol. By delegating ancilla qubits and system qubits, the system state is driven to the target state by repeatedly performing the following steps: 1) executing a designated system-ancilla entangling circuit; 2) measuring the ancilla qubits; and 3) reinitializing ancilla qubits to known states through active reset. While the ancilla qubits are measured and reinitialized to known states, the system qubits undergo a nonunitary evolution and are steered from arbitrary initial states to desired target states. We show results of the method by preparing arbitrary qubit states and qutrit (three-level) states on contemporary quantum computers. We also demonstrate that the state convergence can be accelerated by utilizing the readouts of the ancilla qubits to guide the protocol in a nonblind manner. Our work serves as a nontrivial example that incorporates and characterizes essential operations, such as qubit reuse (qubit reset), entangling circuits, and measurement. These operations are not only vital for near-term noisy intermediate-scale quantum applications but are also crucial for realizing future error-correcting codes.

In actual adiabatic digital quantum simulation with finite time length and non-infinitesimal time steps, we can only obtain an approximate vacuum that is supposed to be a superposition of a true vacuum and excited states.

TI Virtual quantum resource distillation: General framework and
   applications
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We develop the general framework of virtual resource distillation, an alternative distillation strategy proposed in Phys. Rev. Lett. 132, 050203 (2024), which extends conventional quantum resource distillation by integrating the power of classical postprocessing. The framework presented here is applicable not only to quantum states, but also to dynamical quantum objects such as quantum channels and higher -order processes. We provide a general characterization and benchmarks for the performance of virtual resource distillation in the form of computable semidefinite programs as well as several operationally motivated quantities. We apply our general framework to various concrete settings of interest, including standard resource theories such as entanglement, coherence, and magic, as well as settings involving dynamical resources such as quantum memory, quantum communication, and non-Markovian dynamics. The framework of probabilistic distillation is also discussed.

AB Classical computing plays a critical role in the advancement of quantum frontiers in the NISQ era. In this spirit, this work uses classical simulation to bootstrap Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQAs). VQAs rely upon the iterative optimization of a parameterized unitary circuit (ansatz) with respect to an objective function. Since quantum machines are noisy and expensive resources, it is imperative to classically choose the VQA ansatz initial parameters to be as close to optimal as possible to improve VQA accuracy and accelerate their convergence on today's devices.
   This work tackles the problem of finding a good ansatz initialization, by proposing CAFQA, a Clifford Ansatz For Quantum Accuracy. The CAFQA ansatz is a hardware-efficient circuit built with only Clifford gates. In this ansatz, the parameters for the tunable gates are chosen by searching efficiently through the Clifford parameter space via classical simulation. The resulting initial states always equal or outperform traditional classical initialization (e.g., Hartree-Fock), and enable high-accuracy VQA estimations. CAFQA is well-suited to classical computation because: a) Clifford-only quantum circuits can be exactly simulated classically in polynomial time, and b) the discrete Clifford space is searched efficiently via Bayesian Optimization.
   For the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) task of molecular ground state energy estimation (up to 18 qubits), CAFQA's Clifford Ansatz achieves a mean accuracy of nearly 99% and recovers as much as 99.99% of the molecular correlation energy that is lost in Hartree-Fock initialization. CAFQA achieves mean accuracy improvements of 6.4x and 56.8x, over the state-of-the-art, on different metrics. The scalability of the approach allows for preliminary ground state energy estimation of the challenging chromium dimer (Cr2) molecule. With CAFQA's high-accuracy initialization, the convergence of VQAs is shown to accelerate by 2.5x, even for small molecules.
   Furthermore, preliminary exploration of allowing a limited number of non-Clifford (T) gates in the CAFQA framework, shows that as much as 99.9% of the correlation energy can be recovered at bond lengths for which Clifford-only CAFQA accuracy is relatively limited, while remaining classically simulable.

TI Quantum entanglement response to pulsed gate modulation
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We examine the impact of time-dependent gate voltages on entanglement generation in two capacitively coupled charge qubits, with single-electron injection triggered on demand. The gate voltage modulates the tunnel coupling between the qubits and electronic reservoirs, initiating charge transport into the system. The formation of entangled states arises from the competition between interqubit Coulomb interactions and electron-hopping processes. Particular attention is paid to the temporal structure of the gate pulse, which plays a pivotal role in shaping the entanglement dynamics. By exploring a variety of pulse profiles, we uncover regimes of enhanced entanglement and identify optimal driving conditions. Additionally, we investigate how environmental dephasing deteriorates entanglement formation. Within the framework of the density-matrix formalism, we calculate fidelity, linear entropy, and negativity to identify robust operational windows. These results provide insights into controlling quantum correlations in mesoscopic systems and underscore the importance of error-mitigation strategies in realizing high-performance electronic quantum devices.

TI Quasirandom estimations of two-qubit operator-monotone-based
   separability probabilities
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF QUANTUM INFORMATION
AB We conduct a pair of quasirandom estimations of the separability probabilities with respect to 10 measures on the 15-dimensional convex set of two-qubit states, using its Euler-angle parametrization. The measures include the (nonmonotone) Hilbert-Schmidt one, plus nine others based on operator monotone functions. Our results are supportive of previous assertions that the Hilbert-Schmidt and Bures (minimal monotone) separability probabilities are 8/33 approximate to 0.242424 and 25/341 approximate to 0.0733138, respectively, as well as suggestive of the Wigner-Yanase counterpart being 1/20. However, one result appears inconsistent (much too small) with an earlier claim of ours that the separability probability associated with the operator monotone (geometric-mean) function root x is 1 - 256/27 pi(2) approximate to 0.0393251. But a seeming explanation for this disparity is that the volume of states for the root x-based measure is infinite. So, the validity of the earlier conjecture - as well as an alternative one, 1/9(593 - 60 pi(2)) approximate to 0.0915262, we now introduce - cannot be examined through the numerical approach adopted, at least perhaps not without some truncation procedure for extreme values.

TI Classical algorithms for quantum mean values
SO NATURE PHYSICS
AB Quantum algorithms hold the promise of solving certain computational problems dramatically faster than their classical counterparts. The latest generation of quantum processors with similar to 50 qubits are expected to be at the brink of outperforming classical computers. However, due to the lack of fault tolerance, the qubits can be operated for only a few time steps, making the quantum circuits shallow in depth. Variational quantum algorithms are leading candidates in the effort to find shallow-depth quantum algorithms that outperform classical computers. Here we consider the task of computing the mean values of multi-qubit observables, which is a cornerstone of variational quantum algorithms for optimization, machine learning and the simulation of quantum many-body systems. We develop sub-exponential time classical algorithms for solving the quantum mean value problem for general classes of quantum observables and constant-depth quantum circuits. In the special case of geometrically local two-dimensional quantum circuits, the runtime of our algorithm scales linearly with the number of qubits. Our results demonstrate that appropriate choices of circuit parameters such as geometric locality and depth are essential to obtain quantum speed-ups based on variational quantum algorithms.

TI Realization and Calibration of Continuously Parameterized Two-Qubit
   Gates on a Trapped-Ion Quantum Processor
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM ENGINEERING
AB Continuously parameterized two-qubit gates are a key feature of state-of-the-art trapped-ion quantum processors, as they have favorable error scalings and show distinct improvements in circuit performance over more restricted maximally entangling gatesets. In this work, we provide a comprehensive and pedagogical discussion on how to practically implement these continuously parameterized Molmer-Sorensen gates on the Quantum Scientific Computing Open User Testbed, a low-level trapped-ion processor. To generate the arbitrary entangling angles, theta, we simply scale the amplitude of light used to generate the entanglement. However, doing so requires careful consideration of amplifier saturation as well as the variable light shifts that result. As such, we describe a method to calibrate and cancel the dominant fourth-order effects, followed by a dynamic virtual phase advance during the gate to cancel any residual light shifts, and find a linear scaling between theta and the residual light shift. Once we have considered and calibrated these effects, we demonstrate performance improvement with decreasing theta. Finally, we describe nuances of hardware control to transform the XX-type interaction of the arbitrary-angle Molmer-Sorensen gate into a phase-agnostic and crosstalk-mitigating ZZ interaction.

TI Quantum encryption with quantum permutation pad in IBMQ systems
SO EPJ QUANTUM TECHNOLOGY
AB Quantum permutation pad or QPP is a quantum-safe symmetric cryptographic algorithm proposed by Kuang and Bettenburg in 2020. The theoretical foundation of QPP leverages the linear algebraic representations of quantum gates which makes QPP realizable in both, quantum and classical systems. By applying the QPP with 64 of 8-bit permutation gates, holding respective entropy of over 100,000 bits, we accomplished quantum random number distributions digitally over today's classical internet. The QPP has also been used to create pseudo quantum random numbers and served as a foundation for quantum-safe lightweight block and streaming ciphers. This paper continues to explore numerous applications of QPP, namely, we present an implementation of QPP as a quantum encryption circuit on today's still noisy quantum computers. With the publicly available 5-qubit IBMQ devices, we demonstrate quantum secure encryption (256 bits of entropy) using 2-qubit QPP with 56 permutation gates, and 3-qubit QPP with 17 permutation gates respectively. Initial qubits of the encryption circuit correspond to the plaintext and after applying quantum encryption operations, cipher qubits are measured with probabilistic distributions, and the results with the highest probability are recorded as cipher bits. The cipher bits are then decrypted with an inverse QPP circuit. The output state plaintext qubits are measured and the most frequent count measurement results are recorded as plaintext bits. This quantum encryption and decryption process clearly demonstrates that QPP quantum implementations works exactly as symmetric encryption and decryption schemes should. The plaintext and ciphertext bits can also be encrypted and decrypted respectively by any classical computing device with the corresponding QPP algorithm as in quantum computers. This work reveals that it is possible to build quantum-secure communications between quantum-to-quantum and quantum-to-classical computers over today's internet and the future quantum internet.

TI Emulating Thouless pumping in the interacting Rice-Mele model using
   superconducting qutrits
SO FRONTIERS OF PHYSICS
AB The Rice-Mele model has been a seminal prototypical model for the study of topological phenomena such as Thouless pumping. Here we implement the interacting Rice-Mele model using a superconducting quantum processor comprising a one-dimensional array of 36 qutrits. By adiabatically cycling the qutrit frequencies and hopping strengths in the parametric space, we emulate the Thouless pumping of single and two bounded microwave photons along the qutrit chain. Furthermore, with strong Hubbard interaction inherent in the qutrits we also emulate the intriguing phenomena of resonant tunneling and asymmetric edge-state transport of two interacting photons. Utilizing the interactions and higher energy levels in such fully controlled synthetic quantum simulators, these results demonstrate new opportunities for exploring exotic topological phases and quantum transport phenomena using superconducting quantum circuits.

TI A New Quantum Circuits of Quantum Convolutional Neural Network for X-Ray
   Images Classification
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB A common model for classifying images is the convolutional neural network (CNN), which has the benefit of effectively using data correlation information. Despite their remarkable success, classical CNNs may face challenges in achieving further improvements in accuracy, computational efficiency, explainability, and generalization. However, if the specified data dimension or model grows too large, CNN becomes difficult to train effectively with a slowdown processing. In order to address a problem using CNN utilizing quantum computing, Quantum Convolutional Neural Network (QCNN) proposes a novel quantum solution or enhances the functionality of an existing learning model in terms of processing time during training. This paper presents a comparative analysis between classical Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and a novel quantum circuit architecture tailored for image-based tasks, emphasizing the adaptability and versatility of quantum circuits in enhancing feature extraction capabilities and then final accuracy and processing time. A MNIST and covidx-cxr3 datasets was used to train quantum-CNN models, and the results of these comparisons were made with traditional CNN performance. The results demonstrate that the suggested QCNN beat the traditional CNN in terms of recognition accuracy and processing speed (process time) when combined with cutting-edge feature extraction techniques. This superiority is particularly evident when trained on the covidx-cxr3 dataset, highlighting the potential for quantum computing to revolutionize image classification tasks.

TI Quantum decoherence effects on precision measurements at DUNE and T2HK
SO PHYSICS LETTERS B
AB We investigate the potential impact of neutrino quantum decoherence on the precision measurements of standard neutrino oscillation parameters in the DUNE and T2HK experiments. We show that the measurement of delta(CP), sin(2) theta(13) and sin(2) theta(23) is stronger effected in DUNE than in T2HK. On the other hand, DUNE would have a better sensitivity than T2HK to observe decoherence effects. By performing a combined analysis of DUNE and T2HK we show that a robust measurement of standard parameters would be possible, which is not guaranteed with DUNE data alone.

AB We demonstrate the possibility of (sub)exponential quantum speed-up via a quantum algorithm that follows an adiabatic path of a gapped Hamiltonian with no sign problem. The Hamiltonian that exhibits this speed-up comes from the adjacency matrix of an undirected graph whose vertices are labeled by n-bit strings, and we can view the adiabatic evolution as an efficient O(poly(n))-time quantum algorithm for finding a specific "EXIT" vertex in the graph given the "ENTRANCE" vertex. On the other hand we show that if the graph is given via an adjacency-list oracle, there is no classical algorithm that finds the "EXIT" with probability greater than exp(-n(delta)) using at most exp(n(delta)) queries for delta = 1/5 - o (1). Our construction of the graph is somewhat similar to the "welded-trees" construction of Childs et al., but uses additional ideas of Hastings for achieving a spectral gap and a short adiabatic path.

TI Factorization by quantum annealing using superconducting flux qubits
   implementing a multiplier Hamiltonian
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Prime factorization (P = M x N) is a promising application for quantum computing. Shor's algorithm is a key concept for breaking the limit for analyzing P, which cannot be effectively solved by classical computation; however, the algorithm requires error-correctable logical qubits. Here, we describe a quantum annealing method for solving prime factorization. A superconducting quantum circuit with native implementation of the multiplier Hamiltonian provides combinations of M and N as a solution for number P after annealing. This circuit is robust and can be expanded easily to scale up the analysis. We present an experimental and theoretical exploration of the multiplier unit. We demonstrate the 2-bit factorization in a circuit simulation and experimentally at 10 mK. We also explain how the current conditions can be used to obtain high success probability and all candidate factorized elements.

TI Quantum Annealing Based Power Grid Partitioning for Parallel Simulation
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON POWER SYSTEMS
AB Graph partitioning has many applications in power systems, from decentralized state estimation to parallel simulation. Focusing on parallel simulation, optimal grid partitioning minimizes the idle time caused by different simulation times for the sub-networks and their components and reduces the overhead required to simulate the cuts. Partitioning a graph into two parts such that, for example, the cut is minimal and the sub-graphs have equal size is an NP-hard problem. In this paper, we show how optimal partitioning of a graph can be obtained using quantum annealing (QA). We show how to map the requirements for optimal splitting to a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) formulation and test the proposed formulation using a current D-Wave QPU. We show that the necessity to find an embedding of the QUBO on current D-Wave QPUs limits the problem size to under 200 buses and notably affects the time-to-solution. We finally discuss the implications of quantum hardware non-ideality on near term implementation in the simulation loop.

TI Quantum Algorithm for the Domatic Number Problem
SO BALTIC JOURNAL OF MODERN COMPUTING
AB In this paper we design a quantum algorithm for the NP-complete problem of finding the domatic number. The D OMATIC N UMBER problem asks to determine the largest integer k , such that a given undirected graph with n vertices can be partitioned into k pairwise disjoint dominating sets. This problem finds significant applications, such as in wireless sensor networks, where the selection of multiple dominating sets balances energy consumption and extends network lifetime. Each node communicates exclusively with designated nodes, and dominant sets ensure network resilience by enabling seamless replacement in case of node cluster failure. The importance of this problem lies in its implications for network optimization, highlighting the advantages of quantum computing in addressing complex combinatorial challenges. We present a quantum algorithm that solves this problem in time O(2.4143(n)) , which we further improve to O (2.3845(n)) .

TI Quantum sensing of strongly coupled light-matter systems using free
   electrons
SO SCIENCE ADVANCES
AB Strong coupling in light-matter systems is a central concept in cavity quantum electrodynamics and is essential for many quantum technologies. Especially in the optical range, full control of highly connected multi-qubit systems necessitates quantum coherent probes with nanometric spatial resolution, which are currently inacces-sible. Here, we propose the use of free electrons as high-resolution quantum sensors for strongly coupled light -matter systems. Shaping the free-electron wave packet enables the measurement of the quantum state of the entire hybrid systems. We specifically show how quantum interference of the free-electron wave packet gives rise to a quantum-enhanced sensing protocol for the position and dipole orientation of a subnanometer emitter inside a cavity. Our results showcase the great versatility and applicability of quantum interactions between free electrons and strongly coupled cavities, relying on the unique properties of free electrons as strongly interacting flying qubits with miniscule dimensions.

TI DDKA-QKDN: Dynamic On-Demand Key Allocation Scheme for Quantum Internet
   of Things Secured by QKD Network
SO ENTROPY
AB In the era of the interconnection of all things, the security of the Internet of Things (IoT) has become a new challenge. The theoretical basis of unconditional security can be guaranteed by using quantum keys, which can form a QKD network-based security protection system of quantum Internet of Things (Q-IoT). However, due to the low generation rate of the quantum keys, the lack of a reasonable key allocation scheme can reduce the overall service quality. Therefore, this paper proposes a dynamic on-demand key allocation scheme, named DDKA-QKDN, to better meet the requirements of lightweight in the application scenario of Q-IoT and make efficient use of quantum key resources. Taking the two processes of the quantum key pool (QKP) key allocation and the QKP key supplement into account, the scheme dynamically allocates quantum keys and supplements the QKP on demand, which quantitatively weighs the quantum key quantity and security requirements of key requests in proportion. The simulation results show that the system efficiency and the ability of QKP to provide key request services are significantly improved by this scheme.

TI Coherence-protected nonadiabatic geometric quantum computation
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB Because of using geometric phases, nonadiabatic geometric gates have robustness against control errors. On the other hand, decoherence still affects nonadiabatic geometric gates, which is a key factor in reducing their fidelities. In this paper, we show that based on the system Hamiltonian that realizes a nonadiabatic geometric gate, one may construct a system Hamiltonian by the use of which not only the geometric feature of the nonadiabatic geometric gate is preserved, but also the system's coherence is protected. As a result, a coherence-protected nonadiabatic geometric gate is realized with this system Hamiltonian, and this gate has robustness against both control errors and decoherence. We further implement our scheme with nitrogen-vacancy centers and show that a universal set of coherence-protected nonadiabatic geometric gates can be realized. Our scheme does not need auxiliary systems or the encoding of logical qubits with physical qubits, which saves resources for the implementation. Due to the robustness against both control errors and decoherence, our scheme provides a promising way to realize high-fidelity quantum gates.

CY JUL 14-18, 2025
CL Varna, BULGARIA
AB The ZX-calculus is a graphical language for reasoning about quantum computing and quantum information theory. As a complete graphical language, it incorporates a set of axioms rich enough to derive any equation of the underlying formalism. While completeness of the ZX-calculus has been established for qubits and the Clifford fragment of prime-dimensional qudits, universal completeness beyond two-level systems has remained unproven until now. In this paper, we present a proof establishing the completeness of finite-dimensional ZX-calculus, incorporating only the mixed-dimensional Z-spider and the qudit X-spider as generators. Our approach builds on the completeness of another graphical language, the finite-dimensional ZW-calculus, with direct translations between these two calculi. By proving its completeness, we lay a solid foundation for the ZX-calculus as a versatile tool not only for quantum computation but also for various fields within finite-dimensional quantum theory.

AB Nuclei surrounding single electron spins are valuable resources for quantum technology. For application in this area, one is often interested in weakly coupled nuclei with coupling strength on the order of a few 10-100 kHz. In this paper, we compare methods to address single nuclear spins with this type of hyperfine coupling to a single electron spin. To achieve the required spectral resolution, we specifically focus on two methods, namely dynamical decoupling and correlation spectroscopy. We demonstrate spectroscopy of two single nuclear spins and present a method to derive components of their hyperfine coupling tensor from those measurements.

TI Complexity of Fermionic Dissipative Interactions and Applications to
   Quantum Computing
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Interactions between particles are usually a resource for quantum computing, making quantum many-body systems intractable by any known classical algorithm. In contrast, noise is typically considered as being inimical to quantum many-body correlations, ultimately leading the system to a classically tractable state. This work shows that noise represented by two-body processes, such as pair loss, plays the same role as many-body interactions and makes otherwise classically simulable systems universal for quantum computing. We analyze such processes in detail and establish a complexity transition between simulable and nonsimulable systems as a function of a tuning parameter. We determine important classes of simulable and nonsimulable two-body dissipation. Finally, we show how using resonant dissipation in cold atoms can enhance the performance of two-qubit gates.

SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB In this paper, we consider a heat engines composed of two interactional qubits with spin-orbit interaction (Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM)) subject to an external magnetic field, so that each qubit is coupled with cold or hot source. One intention of this work is to investigate the following question: is it possible the effects of DM lead to improve basic thermodynamic quantities in this heat engine are coupled to local environments that are not necessarily at equilibrium? Moreover, we study whether or not quantum correlations can be helpful in the performance of quantum work engines. For this end, we investigate the effects of the temperature and the interaction rate of each qubit with its surrounding environment on quantum correlations such as quantum coherence and quantum discord and quantum entanglements, as well as the generated work. Finally we compare three quantum correlations (entanglement, discord, and coherence) with thermodynamic parameters and show that the output work is positive for what values of the magnetic field so that this cycle can be considered as a thermal machine.

TI Scalable Evaluation of Quantum-Circuit Error Loss Using Clifford
   Sampling
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB A major challenge in developing quantum computing technologies is to accomplish high precision tasks by utilizing multiplex optimization approaches, on both the physical system and algorithm levels. Loss functions assessing the overall performance of quantum circuits can provide the foundation for many optimization techniques. In this Letter, we use the quadratic error loss and the final-state fidelity loss to characterize quantum circuits. We find that the distribution of computation error is approximately Gaussian, which in turn justifies the quadratic error loss. It is shown that these loss functions can be efficiently evaluated in a scalable way by sampling from Clifford-dominated circuits. We demonstrate the results by numerically simulating 10-qubit noisy quantum circuits with various error models as well as executing 4-qubit circuits with up to ten layers of 2-qubit gates on a superconducting quantum processor. Our results pave the way toward the optimization-based quantum device and algorithm design in the intermediate-scale quantum regime.

TI Algebraic compression of quantum circuits for Hamiltonian evolution
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Unitary evolution under a time-dependent Hamiltonian is a key component of simulation on quantum hardware. Synthesizing the corresponding quantum circuit is typically done by breaking the evolution into small time steps, also known as Trotterization, which leads to circuits the depth of which scales with the number of steps. When the circuit elements are limited to a subset of SU (4 )-or equivalently, when the Hamiltonian may be mapped onto free fermionic models-several identities exist that combine and simplify the circuit. Based on this, we present an algorithm that compresses the Trotter steps into a single block of quantum gates using algebraic relations between adjacent circuit elements. This results in a fixed depth time evolution for certain classes of Hamiltonians.

TI isQ: An Integrated Software Stack for Quantum Programming
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON QUANTUM ENGINEERING
AB We introduce isQ, a new software stack for quantum programming in an imperative programming language, also named isQ. The aim of isQ is to make programmers write quantum programs as conveniently as possible. In particular, 1) the isQ language and its compiler contain many useful features, including but not limited to classical control flow, such as recursion, decomposition of self-defined unitary gates, and oracle programming and its circuit realization. 2) To make it flexible, an isQ program can be compiled into several different kinds of intermediate representation and assemblies, including QIR, eQASM, OpenQASM 3.0, and QCIS (specially tailored for the superconducting quantum hardware at the University of Science and Technology of China). 3) Besides interfacing isQ with real superconducting hardware, a QIR simulator is also developed for the demonstration and testing of isQ programs. The isQ software stack encompasses abundant compiler optimizations of high-level quantum programs. To realize it, a distinct multilevel intermediate representation (MLIR) dialect name isQ-IR is proposed.

TI Symmetry Breaking in Geometric Quantum Machine Learning in the Presence
   of Noise
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Geometric quantum machine learning based on equivariant quantum neural networks (EQNNs) recently appeared as a promising direction in quantum machine learning. Despite encouraging progress, studies are still limited to theory, and the role of hardware noise in EQNN training has never been explored. This work studies the behavior of EQNN models in the presence of noise. We show that certain EQNN models can preserve equivariance under Pauli channels, while this is not possible under the amplitude damping channel. We claim that the symmetry breaks linearly in the number of layers and noise strength. We support our claims with numerical data from simulations as well as hardware up to 64 qubits. Furthermore, we provide strategies to enhance the symmetry protection of EQNN models in the presence of noise.

TI Integrating quantum computing resources into scientific HPC ecosystems☆
SO FUTURE GENERATION COMPUTER SYSTEMS-THE INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ESCIENCE
AB Quantum Computing (QC) offers significant potential to enhance scientific discovery in fields such as quantum chemistry, optimization, and artificial intelligence. Yet QC faces challenges due to the noisy intermediate-scale quantum era's inherent external noise issues. This paper discusses the integration of QC as a computational accelerator within classical scientific high-performance computing (HPC) systems. By leveraging a broad spectrum of simulators and hardware technologies, we propose a hardware-agnostic framework for augmenting classical HPC with QC capabilities. Drawing on the HPC expertise of the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) and the HPC lifecycle management of the Department of Energy (DOE), our approach focuses on the strategic incorporation of QC capabilities and acceleration into existing scientific HPC workflows. This includes detailed analyses, benchmarks, and code optimization driven by the needs of the DOE and ORNL missions. Our comprehensive framework integrates hardware, software, workflows, and user interfaces to foster a synergistic environment for quantum and classical computing research. This paper outlines plans to unlock new computational possibilities, driving forward scientific inquiry and innovation in a wide array of research domains.

TI Ultracompact 3D integrated photonic chip for high-fidelity
   high-dimensional quantum gates
SO SCIENCE ADVANCES
AB Spatial modes of photons offer a rich encoding resource for high-dimensional quantum information processing. Multiplane light conversion (MPLC) enables spatial mode transformation and is applicable in both classical and quantum optics. Here, we demonstrate a polymer-based MPLC device, fabricated via femtosecond laser three-dimensional printing, that realizes high-dimensional quantum logic gates in an ultracompact format. Specifically, we design a three-dimensional Hadamard gate by training a diffractive neural network to generate the required phase distribution. The device is evaluated through quantum process tomography at the single-photon level within spatial modes, achieving a fidelity of 90%. Compared to traditional spatial light modulator-based implementations, our approach integrates spatial mode manipulation into a miniaturized photonic platform. These results highlight the feasibility of polymer-based MPLC for compact quantum logic and open possibilities for scalable, high-dimensional quantum information processing on integrated photonic chips.

TI Monogamy and Polygamy Relations of Quantum Correlations for Multipartite
   Systems
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF THEORETICAL PHYSICS
AB We study the monogamy and polygamy inequalities of quantum correlations in arbitrary dimensional multipartite quantum systems. We first derive the monogamy inequality of the alpha th (0 <= alpha <= r/2, r >= 2) power of concurrence for any 2 circle times 2 circle times 2(n-2) tripartite states and generalize it to the n-qubit quantum states. In addition to concurrence, we show that the monogamy relations are satisfied by other quantum correlation measures such as entanglement of formation. Moreover, the polygamy inequality of the beta th (beta <= 0) power of concurrence and the beta th (beta >= s, 0 <= s <= 1) power of the negativity are presented for 2 circle times 2 circle times 2(n-2). We then obtain the polygamy inequalities of quantum correlations for multipartite states. Finally, our results are shown to be tighter than previous studies using detailed examples.

TI Additively Manufactured Ceramics for Compact Quantum Technologies
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB Quantum technologies are advancing from fundamental research in specialized laboratories to practical applications in the field, driving the demand for robust, scalable, and reproducible system integration techniques. Ceramic components can be pivotal thanks to high stiffness, low thermal expansion, and excellent dimensional stability under thermal stress. Lithography-based additive manufacturing of technical ceramics is explored, especially for miniaturized physics packages and electro-optical systems. This approach enables functional systems with precisely manufactured, intricate structures, and high mechanical stability while minimizing size and weight. It facilitates rapid prototyping, simplifies fabrication and leads to highly integrated, reliable devices. As an electrical insulator with low outgassing and high temperature stability, printed technical ceramics such as Al2O3${\rm Al}_2{\rm O}_3$ and AlN bridge a technology gap in quantum technology and offer advantages over other printable materials. This potential is demonstrated with CerAMRef, a micro-integrated rubidium D2 line optical frequency reference on a printed Al2O3${\rm Al}_2{\rm O}{_3}$ micro-optical bench and housing. The frequency instability of the reference is comparable to laboratory setups while the volume of the integrated spectroscopy setup is only 6mL$6 \,\mathrm{m}\mathrm{L}$. Potential for future applications is identified in compact atomic magnetometers, miniaturized optical atom traps, and vacuum system integration.
   Additively manufactured ceramics are for the first time employed in quantum technology, which require advanced production and integration technologies for practical applications. A miniaturized optical frequency reference based on rubidium spectroscopy is integrated on a printed alumina micro-optical bench. Superior SWaP is demonstrated compared to traditional systems, showing the potential of additively manufactured ceramics for future applications in quantum technology. image

TI Near-Optimal Quantum Algorithms for String Problems
SO ALGORITHMICA
AB We study quantum algorithms for several fundamental string problems, including Longest Common Substring, Lexicographically Minimal String Rotation, and Longest Square Substring. These problems have been widely studied in the stringology literature since the 1970s, and are known to be solvable by near-linear time classical algorithms. In this work, we give quantum algorithms for these problems with near optimal query complexities and time complexities. Specifically, we show that: Longest Common Substring can be solved by a quantum algorithm in (sic)(n(2/3)) time, improving upon the recent (sic)(n(5/6))-time algorithm by Le Gall and Seddighin (in: Proceedings of the 13th innovations in theoretical computer science conference (ITCS 2022), pp 97:1-97:23, 2022. https://doi.org/10.4230/LIPIcs.ITCS.2022.97). Our algorithm uses the MNRS quantum walk framework, together with a careful combination of string synchronizing sets (Kempa and Kociumaka, in: Proceedings of the 51st annual ACM SIGACT symposium on theory of computing (STOC 2019), ACM, pp 756-767, 2019. https://doi.org/10.1145/3313276.3316368) and generalized difference covers. Lexicographically Minimal String Rotation can be solved by a quantum algorithm in n(1/2+o(1)) time, improving upon the recent (sic)(n(3/4))-time algorithm by Wang and Ying (in: Quantum algorithm for lexicographically minimal string rotation. CoRR, 2020. arXiv:2012.09376). We design our algorithm by first giving a new classical divide and-conquer algorithm in near-linear time based on exclusion rules, and then speeding it up quadratically using nested Grover search and quantum minimum finding. Longest Square Substring can be solved by a quantum algorithm in (sic)(root n) time. Our algorithm is an adaptation of the algorithm by Le Gall and Seddighin (2022) for the Longest Palindromic Substring problem, but uses additional techniques to overcome the difficulty that binary search no longer applies. Our techniques naturally extend to other related string problems, such as Longest Repeated Substring, Longest Lyndon Substring, and Minimal Suffix.

   communication complexity superiority for the Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt
   game
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Demonstrating quantum communication complexity superiority non-trivially with currently available experimental systems is of utmost importance in quantum information science. Here, we propose a generalized entanglement-assisted communication complexity reduction protocol and analyze the robustness of its quantum superiority against the measurement imperfections, such as measurement basis deviation and choice probability bias, a common problem rarely studied before. We find that the quantum superiority can be obtained in a specific entangled state in a suitable range of measurement basis and basis choice parameters. And the quantum superiority strengthens with the increase of the entanglement degree of quantum states. By using the maximum entangled state and its corresponding optimal measurement, the result we obtained violated the optimal classical bound by 239 standard deviations. Besides, the robustness of effective measurement basis in dephasing and depolarizing quantum channels is also investigated. These results not only make a step forward in investigating sufficient experimental conditions to unambiguously demonstrate the superiority of quantum communication complexity but also help to develop relevant practical applications.

TI Entropic singularities give rise to quantum transmission
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Non-additivity of the quantum channel coherent information is known to occur in some very noisy channels, but its fundamental origin is unclear. Here, the author explains its link with log singularity of quantum entropy, and shows that it can also come up for low-noise channels.
   When can noiseless quantum information be sent across noisy quantum devices? And at what maximum rate? These questions lie at the heart of quantum technology, but remain unanswered because of non-additivity- a fundamental synergy which allows quantum devices (aka quantum channels) to send more information than expected. Previously, non-additivity was known to occur in very noisy channels with coherent information much smaller than that of a perfect channel; but, our work shows non-additivity in a simple low-noise channel. Our results extend even further. We prove a general theorem concerning positivity of a channel's coherent information. A corollary of this theorem gives a simple dimensional test for a channel's capacity. Applying this corollary solves an open problem by characterizing all qubit channels whose complement has non-zero capacity. Another application shows a wide class of zero quantum capacity qubit channels can assist an incomplete erasure channel in sending quantum information. These results arise from introducing and linking logarithmic singularities in the von-Neumann entropy with quantum transmission: changes in entropy caused by this singularity are a mechanism responsible for both positivity and non-additivity of the coherent information. Analysis of such singularities may be useful in other physics problems.

TI Simulating Methylamine Using a Symmetry-Adapted, Qubit Excitation-Based
   Variational Quantum Eigensolver
SO QUANTUM REPORTS
AB Understanding the capabilities of quantum computer devices and computing the required resources to solve realistic tasks remain critical challenges associated with achieving useful quantum computational advantage. We present a study aimed at reducing the quantum resource overhead in quantum chemistry simulations using the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE). Our approach achieves up to a two-orders-of magnitude reduction in the required number of two-qubit operations for variational problem-inspired ansatzes. We propose and analyze optimization strategies that combine various methods, including molecular point-group symmetries, compact excitation circuits, different types of excitation sets, and qubit tapering. To validate the compatibility and accuracy of these strategies, we first test them on small molecules such as LiH and BeH2, then apply the most efficient ones to restricted active-space simulations of methylamine. We complete our analysis by computing the resources required for full-valence, active-space simulations of methylamine (26 qubits) and formic acid (28 qubits) molecules. Our best-performing optimization strategy reduces the two-qubit gate count for methylamine from approximately 600,000 to about 12,000 and yields a similar order-of-magnitude improvement for formic acid. This resource analysis represents a valuable step towards the practical use of quantum computers and the development of better methods for optimizing computing resources.

TI Quantum channel-position finding using single photons
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Channel-position finding is the task of determining the location of a single target channel among an ensemble of background channels. It has many potential applications, including quantum sensing, quantum reading, and quantum spectroscopy. In particular, it could allow for simple detection protocols to be extended to ones of measurement, for example, target ranging with quantum illumination. The use of quantum states and entanglement in such protocols has shown to yield quantum advantages over their optimal classical counterparts. Here we consider quantum channel-position finding using sources specified by at most one single photon on average per mode, using the discrete-variable formalism. By considering various quantum sources, it is shown through the derivation of performance bounds that a quantum enhancement may be realized.

TI Quantum Error Mitigation as a Universal Error Reduction Technique:
   Applications from the NISQ to the Fault-Tolerant Quantum Computing Eras
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB In the early years of fault-tolerant quantum computing (FTQC), it is expected that the available code distance and the number of magic states will be restricted due to the limited scalability of quantum devices and the insufficient computational power of classical decoding units. Here, we integrate quantum error correction and quantum error mitigation into an efficient FTQC architecture that effectively increases the code distance and T-gate count at the cost of constant sampling overheads in a wide range of quantum computing regimes. For example, while we need 10(4) to 10(10) logical operations for demonstrating quantum advantages from optimistic and pessimistic points of view, we show that we can reduce the required number of physical qubits by 80% and 45% in each regime. From another perspective, when the achievable code distance is up to about 11, our scheme allows executing 10(3) times more logical operations. This scheme will dramatically alleviate the required computational overheads and hasten the arrival of the FTQC era.

TI Experimental Demonstration of Secure Relay in Quantum Secure Direct
   Communication Network
SO ENTROPY
AB Quantum secure direct communication (QSDC) offers a practical way to realize a quantum network which can transmit information securely and reliably. Practical quantum networks are hindered by the unavailability of quantum relays. To overcome this limitation, a proposal has been made to transmit the messages encrypted with classical cryptography, such as post-quantum algorithms, between intermediate nodes of the network, where encrypted messages in quantum states are read out in classical bits, and sent to the next node using QSDC. In this paper, we report a real-time demonstration of a computationally secure relay for a quantum secure direct communication network. We have chosen CRYSTALS-KYBER which has been standardized by the National Institute of Standards and Technology to encrypt the messages for transmission of the QSDC system. The quantum bit error rate of the relay system is typically below the security threshold. Our relay can support a QSDC communication rate of 2.5 kb/s within a 4 ms time delay. The experimental demonstration shows the feasibility of constructing a large-scale quantum network in the near future.

TI Digital quantum simulation of reaction-diffusion systems on lattice
SO EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL B
AB The quantum computer offers significant advantages in simulating physical systems, particularly those with exponentially large state spaces, such as quantum systems. Stochastic reaction-diffusion systems, characterized by their stochastic nature, also exhibit exponential growth in the dimension of the state space, posing challenges for simulation at a probability distribution level. We explore the quantum simulation of stochastic reaction-diffusion systems on a digital quantum computer, directly simulating the system at the master equation level. Leveraging a spin representation of the system, we employ Trotterization and probabilistic imaginary time evolution (PITE) to simulate the probability distribution directly. We illustrate this approach through four diverse examples, ranging from simple single-lattice site generation-annihilation processes to a system featuring active-absorbing phase transition.

TI Certifying optimality for convex quantum channel optimization problems
SO QUANTUM
AB We identify necessary and sufficient conditions for a quantum channel to be optimal for any convex optimization problem in which the optimization is taken over the set of all quantum channels of a fixed size. Optimality conditions for convex optimization problems over the set of all quantum measurements of a given system having a fixed number of measurement outcomes are obtained as a special case. In the case of linear objective functions for measurement optimization problems, our conditions reduce to the well-known Holevo-Yuen-Kennedy-Lax measurement optimality conditions. We illustrate how our conditions can be applied to various state transformation problems having non-linear objective functions based on the fidelity, trace distance, and quantum relative entropy.

TI Does acceleration always degrade quantum entanglement for tetrapartite
   Unruh-DeWitt detectors?
SO JOURNAL OF HIGH ENERGY PHYSICS
AB Previous studies have shown that the Unruh effect completely destroys quantum entanglement and coherence of bipartite states, as modeled by entangled Unruh-DeWitt detectors. But does the Unruh effect have a different impact on quantum entanglement of multipartite states within this framework? In this paper, we investigate the influence of the Unruh effect on 1 - 3 entanglement in the context of entangled tetrapartite Unruh-DeWitt detectors. We find that quantum entanglement of tetrapartite W state first decreases to a minimum value and then increases to a fixed value with the growth of the acceleration. This indicates that the Unruh effect can, under certain conditions, enhance quantum entanglement. In other words, the Unruh effect plays a dual role in the behavior of quantum entanglement-both diminishing and enhancing it. This discovery challenges and overturns the traditional view that the Unruh effect is solely detrimental to quantum entanglement and coherence in entangled Unruh-DeWitt detectors, offering a fresh and profound perspective on its impact.

AB This paper aims to outline the effectiveness of modern universal gate quantum computers when utilizing different configurations to solve the B-SAT (Boolean satisfiability) problem. The quantum computing experiments were performed using Grover's search algorithm to find a valid solution. The experiments were performed under different variations to demonstrate their effects on the results. Changing the number of shots, qubit mapping, and using a different quantum processor were all among the experimental variables. The study also branched into a dedicated experiment highlighting a peculiar behavior that IBM quantum processors exhibit when running circuits with a certain number of shots.

TI Quantum decoherence of gravitational waves
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
AB The quantum nature of gravity remains an open question in fundamental physics, lacking experimental verification. Gravitational waves (GWs) provide a potential avenue for detecting gravitons, the hypothetical quantum carriers of gravity. However, by analogy with quantum optics, distinguishing gravitons from classical GWs requires the preservation of quantum coherence, which may be lost due to interactions with the cosmic environment causing decoherence. We investigate whether GWs retain their quantum state by deriving the reduced density matrix and evaluating decoherence, using an environmental model where a scalar field is conformally coupled to gravity. Our results show that quantum decoherence of GWs is stronger at lower frequencies and higher reheating temperatures. We identify a model-independent amplitude threshold below which decoherence is negligible, providing a fundamental limit for directly probing the quantum nature of gravity. In the standard cosmological scenario, the low-energy density of the universe at the end of inflation leads to complete decoherence at the classical amplitude level of inflationary GWs. However, for higher-energy densities, decoherence is negligible within a frequency window in the range 100 Hz-108 Hz, which depends on the reheating temperature. In a kinetic-dominated scenario, the dependence on reheating temperature weakens, allowing GWs to maintain quantum coherence above 107 Hz.

TI Overview of the Phase Space Formulation of Quantum Mechanics with
   Application to Quantum Technologies
SO ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES
AB The phase-space formulation of quantum mechanics has recently seen increased use in testing quantum technologies, including methods of tomography for state verification and device validation. Here, an overview of quantum mechanics in phase space is presented. The formulation to generate a generalized phase-space function for any arbitrary quantum system is shown, such as the Wigner and Weyl functions along with the associated Q and P functions. Examples of how these different formulations are used in quantum technologies are provided, with a focus on discrete quantum systems, qubits in particular. Also provided are some results that, to the authors' knowledge, have not been published elsewhere. These results provide insight into the relation between different representations of phase space and how the phase-space representation is a powerful tool in understanding quantum information and quantum technologies.

TI Initialization of neutral and charged exciton spin states in a
   telecom-emitting quantum dot
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB Photonic cluster states are highly entangled states that allow for photonic quantum computing and memoryless quantum repeaters. Their generation has been recently demonstrated using semiconductor quantum dots emitting at the 900 nm wavelength range. However, a similar demonstration at the communication-optimal telecom range has remained elusive. A key ingredient that is still missing is an appropriate optical excitation method. A central requirement of such a method is to allow an arbitrary spin initialization of quantum-dot excitonic complexes. In this work, we report on developing such a method based on a quasiresonant p-shell excitation for an InAs/InGaAs quantum dot emitting at 1535 nm. We show qubit writing of a neutral exciton and spin-preserving excitation of a negative trion. Using the Larmor precession of the negative trion under an externally applied magnetic field, we determine the in-plane g factors of both the electron and the hole in the investigated quantum dot. In addition, we measure a lower bound on the hole coherence time, T-2* > 6.4 ns, boosting its candidacy as a sound photon entangler for more advanced quantum photonic schemes.

TI XOR-AND-XOR Logic Forms for Autosymmetric Functions and Applications to
   Quantum Computing
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON COMPUTER-AIDED DESIGN OF INTEGRATED CIRCUITS AND
   SYSTEMS
AB propose a new three-level X OR-AND-XOR form for autosymmetric functions, called XORAX expression. In general, a Boolean function f over n variables is k-autosymmetric if it can be projected onto a smaller function f(k), which depends on n - k variables only. We show that XORAX expressions can ease the reversible synthesis of autosymmetric functions, producing compact reversible networks, without inserting additional new input lines. Autosymmetry occurs especially for functions that exhibit a regular structure, as for instance arithmetic functions. For this reason, compact reversible networks for autosymmetric functions might be interesting for quantum computing. Experimental results validate the proposed approach.

TI Frequency-dependent squeezing for gravitational-wave detection through
   quantum teleportation
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB Ground-based interferometric gravitational-wave detectors are highly precise sensors for weak forces, limited in sensitivity across their detection band by quantum fluctuations of light. Current and future instruments address this limitation by injecting frequency-dependent squeezed vacuum into the detection port, utilizing narrow-band, low-loss optical filter cavities for optimal rotation of the squeezing ellipse at each signal frequency. This study introduces a scheme of such vacuum injection employing the principles of quantum teleportation which works the same as an arbitrary number of filter cavities without additional kilometer-scale infrastructure. We applied this scheme to a detuned signal-recycled Fabry-P & eacute;rot-Michelson interferometer, which is the baseline design of the low-frequency detector within the Einstein Telescope xylophone detector. It is shown that our scheme achieves broadband suppression of quantum noise without requiring additional filter cavities or modifications to the core optics of the main interferometer.

TI Probing quantum decoherence at Belle II and LHCb
SO JOURNAL OF HIGH ENERGY PHYSICS
AB With the advent of Belle II and the LHCb upgrade, the precision measurements of various B-Physics observables are on cards. This holds significant potential for delving into physics beyond the standard model of electroweak interactions. These measurements can also serve as means to establish limits on phenomena occurring at much finer length scales, such as quantum decoherence, which may arise due to potential discreteness in space-time or non-trivial topological effects. In this work, we set up the formalism to investigate the impact of quantum decoherence on several potential observables in B meson systems. The approach employs the trace-preserving Kraus operator formalism, extending unitary evolution to non-unitary dynamics while maintaining complete positivity. In this formalism, the decoherence effects are parametrized in terms of a single parameter. Through the analysis of purely leptonic, semileptonic, and non-leptonic decays of B mesons, we identify observables that could, in principle, be influenced by decoherence. The theoretical expressions are provided without neglecting the impact of decay width difference (triangle Gamma) and CP violation in mixing. Considering that many of these observables can be measured with high precision using the abundant data collected by LHCb and Belle II, our formalism can be applied to establish constraints on the decoherence parameter through multiple decay channels. This offers an alternative set-up for such studies, which, at present, are predominantly conducted in the neutrino sector.

TI Thermal Quantum Correlations in Two Gravitational Cat States
SO UNIVERSE
AB We consider the effect of a thermal bath on quantum correlations induced by the gravitational interaction in the weak field limit between two massive cat states, called gravitational cat (gravcat) states. The main goal of this paper is to provide a good understanding of the effects of temperature and several parameters in the entanglement (measured by the concurrence) and quantum coherence (measured by the l(1)-norm that is defined from the minimal distance between the quantum state and the set of incoherent states) which are derived from the thermal quantum density operator. Our results show that the thermal concurrence and l(1)-norm can be significantly optimized by increasing the masses or decreasing the distance between them. We investigate and discuss the behavior of these quantities under temperature variations in different regimes, including some that are expected to be experimentally feasible in the future. In particular, we observe that thermal fluctuations raise non-entangled quantum correlations when entanglement suddenly drops.

TI Microwave Spin Control of a Tin-Vacancy Qubit in Diamond
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW X
AB The negatively charged tin-vacancy (SnV-) center in diamond is a promising solid-state qubit for applications in quantum networking due to its high quantum efficiency, strong zero phonon emission, and reduced sensitivity to electrical noise. The SnV- has a large spin-orbit coupling, which allows for long spin lifetimes at elevated temperatures, but unfortunately suppresses the magnetic dipole transitions desired for quantum control. Here, by use of a naturally strained center, we overcome this limitation and achieve highfidelity microwave spin control. We demonstrate a pi-pulse fidelity of up to 99.51 +/- 0.03% and a Hahn2 = 170.0 +/- 2.8 mu s, both the highest yet reported for SnV- platform. This performance comes without compromise to optical stability, and is demonstrated at 1.7 K where ample cooling power is available to mitigate drive-induced heating. These results pave the way for SnV- spins to be used as a building block for future quantum technologies.

TI Edge Caching in Fog-Based Sensor Networks through Deep
   Learning-Associated Quantum Computing Framework
SO COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE AND NEUROSCIENCE
AB Fog computing (FC) based sensor networks have emerged as a propitious archetype for next-generation wireless communication technology with caching, communication, and storage capacity services in the edge. Mobile edge computing (MEC) is a new era of digital communication and has a rising demand for intelligent devices and applications. It faces performance deterioration and quality of service (QoS) degradation problems, especially in the Internet of Things (IoT) based scenarios. Therefore, existing caching strategies need to be enhanced to augment the cache hit ratio and manage the limited storage to accelerate content deliveries. Alternatively, quantum computing (QC) appears to be a prospect of more or less every typical computing problem. The framework is basically a merger of a deep learning (DL) agent deployed at the network edge with a quantum memory module (QMM). Firstly, the DL agent prioritizes caching contents via self organizing maps (SOMs) algorithm, and secondly, the prioritized contents are stored in QMM using a Two-Level Spin Quantum Phenomenon (TLSQP). After selecting the most appropriate lattice map (32x32) in 750,000 iterations using SOMs, the data points below the dark blue region are mapped onto the data frame to get the videos. These videos are considered a high priority for trending according to the input parameters provided in the dataset. Similarly, the light-blue color region is also mapped to get medium-prioritized content. After the SOMs algorithm's training, the topographic error (TE) value together with quantization error (QE) value (i.e., 0.0000235) plotted the most appropriate map after 750,000 iterations. In addition, the power of QC is due to the inherent quantum parallelism (QP) associated with the superposition and entanglement principles. A quantum computer taking "n" qubits that can be stored and execute 2(n) presumable combinations of qubits simultaneously reduces the utilization of resources compared to conventional computing. It can be analyzed that the cache hit ratio will be improved by ranking the content, removing redundant and least important content, storing the content having high and medium prioritization using QP efficiently, and delivering precise results. The experiments for content prioritization are conducted using Google Colab, and IBM's Quantum Experience is considered to simulate the quantum phenomena.

TI Efficient Quantum Algorithms for Stabilizer Entropies
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
AB Stabilizer entropies (SEs) are measures of nonstabilizerness or "magic " that quantify the degree to which a state is described by stabilizers. SEs are especially interesting due to their connections to scrambling, localization and property testing. However, applications have been limited so far as previously known measurement protocols for SEs scale exponentially with the number of qubits. Here, we efficiently measure SEs for integer Renyi index n > 1 via Bell measurements. The SE of N-qubit quantum states can be measured with O (n) copies and O (nN) classical computational time, where for even n we additionally require the complex conjugate of the state. We provide efficient bounds of various nonstabilizerness monotones that are intractable to compute beyond a few qubits. Using the IonQ quantum computer, we measure SEs of random Clifford circuits doped with non-Clifford gates and give bounds for the stabilizer fidelity, stabilizer extent, and robustness of magic. We provide efficient algorithms to measure Clifford-averaged 4 n-point out-of-time-order correlators and multifractal flatness. With these measures we study the scrambling time of doped Clifford circuits and random Hamiltonian evolution depending on nonstabilizerness. Counterintuitively, random Hamiltonian evolution becomes less scrambled at long times, which we reveal with the multifractal flatness.

TI Quantifying multipartite quantum entanglement in a
   semi-device-independent manner
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
AB We propose two semi-device-independent approaches that are able to quantify unknown multipartite quantum entanglement experimentally, where the only information that has to be known beforehand is quantum dimension, and the concept that plays a key role is nondegenerate Bell inequalities. Specifically, using the nondegeneracy of multipartite Bell inequalities, we obtain useful information on the purity of target quantum state. Combined with an estimate of the maximal overlap between the target state and pure product states, and a continuous property of the geometric measure of entanglement, we shall prove the information on purity allows us to give a lower bound for this entanglement measure. In addition, we show that a different combination of the above results also converts to a lower bound for the relative entropy of entanglement. As a demonstration, we apply our approach on 5-partite qubit systems with the Mermin-Ardehali-Belinskii-Klyshko (MABK) inequality, and show that useful lower bounds for the geometric measure of entanglement can be obtained if the Bell expression value is larger than 3.60, and those for the relative entropy of entanglement can be given if the Bell expression value is larger than 3.80, where the Tsirelson bound is 4.

TI Qudit stabilizer codes, CFTs, and topological surfaces
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
AB We study general maps from the space of rational conformal field theories (CFTs) with a fixed chiral algebra and associated Chern-Simons (CS) theories to the space of qudit stabilizer codes with a fixed generalized Pauli group. We consider certain natural constraints on such a map and show that the map can be described as a graph homomorphism from an orbifold graph, which captures the orbifold structure of CFTs, to a code graph, which captures the structure of self-dual stabilizer codes. By studying explicit examples, we show that this graph homomorphism cannot always be a graph embedding. However, we construct a physically motivated map from universal orbifold subgraphs of CFTs to operators in a generalized Pauli group. We show that this map results in a self-dual stabilizer code if and only if the surface operators in the bulk CS theories corresponding to the CFTs in question are self-dual. For CFTs admitting a stabilizer code description, we show that the full Abelianized generalized Pauli group can be obtained from twisted sectors of certain 0-form symmetries of the CFT. Finally, we connect our construction with SymTFTs, and we argue that many equivalences between codes that arise in our setup correspond to equivalence classes of bulk topological surfaces under fusion with invertible surfaces.

TI Optimal control of quantum permutation algorithm with a molecular
   ququart
SO OPTICS EXPRESS
AB Quantum algorithms can afford greater computational efficiency compared to their classical counterparts when addressing specific computing tasks. We describe here the implementation, using a polar molecule in an external electric field, of the single-qudit cyclic permutation identification algorithm proposed by Gedik et al. [Sci. Rep. 5, 14671 (2015).]. A molecular ququart is realized through the field-dressed states generated as the pendular modes of BaI. By employing multi-target optimal control theory, we design microwave pulses for ququart-based operations such as the Fourier transformation and its inverse, as well as the oracle Uf operation. Specifically, we design an optimized pulse sequence that realizes a quantum algorithm on a single BaI molecule identifying the parity of a member of a set of cyclic permutations with high fidelity. This demonstrates the applicability of optimal control theory to polar molecules for quantum computation.

TI Characterization and Verification of Trotterized Digital Quantum
   Simulation Via Hamiltonian and Liouvillian Learning
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB The goal of digital quantum simulation is to approximate the dynamics of a given target Hamiltonian via a sequence of quantum gates, a procedure known as Trotterization. The quality of this approximation can be controlled by the so-called Trotter step that governs the number of required quantum gates per unit simulation time. The stroboscopic dynamics generated by Trotterization is effectively described by a time-independent Hamiltonian, referred to as the Floquet Hamiltonian. In this work, we propose Floquet Hamiltonian learning to reconstruct the experimentally realized Floquet Hamiltonian order by order in the Trotter step. This procedure is efficient, i.e., it requires a number of measurements that scales polynomially in the system size, and can be readily implemented in state-of-the-art experiments. With numerical examples, we propose several applications of our method in the context of verification of quantum devices: from the characterization of the distinct sources of errors in digital quantum simulators to determining the optimal operating regime of the device. We show that our protocol provides the basis for feedback-loop design and calibration of new types of quantum gates. Furthermore, it can be extended to the case of nonunitary dynamics and used to learn Floquet Liouvillians, thereby offering a way of characterizing the dissipative processes present in noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices.

AB In this paper, the application of quantum computing (QC) in solving gate insulator Poisson equation is studied, through QC simulator and hardware in IBM. Various gate insulator stacks with and without fixed charges are studied. It is found that by increasing the number of clock bits and by choosing appropriate evolution time, accurate solutions can be obtained in QC simulation. However, when the real quantum hardware is used, the accuracy is substantially reduced. Therefore, a more robust quantum circuit or error correction should be employed and developed.

TI Quantum Computing with Circular Rydberg Atoms
SO PRX QUANTUM
AB Rydberg-atom arrays are a leading platform for quantum computing and simulation, combining strong interactions with highly coherent operations and flexible geometries. However, the achievable fidelities are limited by the finite lifetime of the Rydberg states, as well as by technical imperfections such as atomic motion. In this work, we propose a novel approach to Rydberg-atom arrays using long-lived circular Rydberg states in optical traps. Based on the extremely long lifetime of these states, exceeding seconds in cryogenic microwave cavities that suppress radiative transitions, and gate protocols that are robust to finite atomic temperature, we project that arrays of hundreds of circular Rydberg atoms with two-qubit gate errors around 10(-5) can be realized using current technology. This approach combines several key elements, including a quantum-nondemolition detection technique for circular Rydberg states, local manipulation using the ponderomotive potential of focused optical beams, a gate protocol using multiple circular levels to encode qubits, and robust dynamical-decoupling sequences to suppress unwanted interactions and errors from atomic motion. This represents a significant improvement on the current state of the art in quantum computing and simulation with neutral atoms.

TI Generation of Decoy Signals Using Optical Amplifiers for a Plug-and-Play
   Quantum Key Distribution System
SO APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
AB In most quantum key distribution (QKD) systems, a decoy-state protocol is implemented for preventing potential quantum attacks and higher mean photon rates. An optical intensity modulator attenuating the signal intensity is used to implement it in a QKD system adopting a one-way architecture. However, in the case of the plug-and-play (or two-way) architecture, there are technical issues, including random polarization of the input signal pulse and long-term stability. In this study, we propose a method for generating decoy pulses through amplification using an optical amplifier. The proposed scheme operates regardless of the input signal polarization. In addition, a circulator was added to adjust the signal intensity when the signal enters the input and exits the QKD transmitter by monitoring the intensity of the output signal pulse. It also helps to defend against Trojan horse attacks. A test setup for the proof-of-principle experiment was implemented and tested, and it was shown that the system operated stably with a quantum bit error rate (QBER) value of less than 5% over 26 h using a quantum channel (QC) of 25 km.

AB After the next planned upgrades to the LHC, the luminosity it delivers will more than double, substantially increasing the already large demand on computing resources. Therefore an efficient way to reconstruct physical objects is required. Recent studies show that one of the quantum computing techniques, quantum annealing (QA), can be used to perform particle tracking with efficiency higher than 90% in the high pileup region in the high luminosity environment. The algorithm starts by determining the connection between the hits, and classifies the topological objects with their pattern. The current study aims to improve the pre-processing efficiency in the QA-based tracking algorithm by implementing a graph neural network (GNN), which is expected to efficiently generate the topological object needed for the annealing process. Tracking performance with a different setup of the original algorithm is also studied with data collected by the ATLAS experiment.

TI Measuring multipartite quantum correlations by thermodynamic work
   extraction
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
AB While bipartite quantum correlations have been extensively studied across various fields, the role of multipartite quantum correlations in many-body systems remains elusive due to their complex structure. A primary challenge lies in the fact that the calculation of multipartite quantum correlation measure often requires an exponential cost with respect to the system size. In this work, we address this problem by adopting a thermodynamic approach: We introduce a measure of multipartite quantum correlations based on the difference in extractable thermodynamic work between global operations and LOCC (local operations and classical communication). This can be regarded as a multipartite generalization of the bipartite work deficit, which has attracted attention as a thermodynamic measure of bipartite quantum correlation. Importantly, we develop an efficient method for computing the multipartite work deficit in a special class of quantum many-body systems described by matrix product states (MPS). The numerical cost of this method scales linearly with system size, significantly reducing the exponential overhead required for direct calculations. We apply this method to an MPS family and show that a quantum phase transition is well captured by the multipartite work deficit, which exhibits singular behavior at the transition point. Our work shows that the multipartite work deficit not only highlights the fundamental connection between multipartite quantum correlations and quantum thermodynamics, but also serves as an efficiently computable probe of the structures of quantum many-body systems.
